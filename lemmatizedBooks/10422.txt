produce by jake jaqua caesar die by talbot mundy i in the reign of the emperor commodus golden antioch lay like a jewel at a mountain 's throat wide intersect street each nearly four mile long granite-paved and marble-colonnaded swarm with fashionable loiterer the gay antiochene whom nothing except frequent earthquake interrupt from pursuit of pleasure be take the air in chariot in litter and on foot they linen clothes be as riotously picturesque as be the fruit display in open shop-front under the colonnade or as the blossom on the tree in public garden which make of the city as see from the height of the citadel a mosaic of green and white the crowd on the main thoroughfare be aristocratic opulence be accent by group of slave in close attendance on they owner but the aristocracy be sharply differentiate the roman frequently less wealthy -lrb- because those who have make money go to rome to spend it -rrb- -- frequently less educate and in general not less dissolute -- despise the antiochene although the roman love antioch the cosmopolitan antiochene return the compliment regard roman as mere duffer in depravity philistine in art but capable in war and government and consequently to be fear if not respect so there be not much mingling of the group whose slave take example from they master affect in public a scorn that they do not feel but be careful to assert the roman be intensely dignified and wear the toga pallium and tunic the antiochene affect to think dignity be stupid and its trappings -lrb- forbid to they -rrb- hideous so they carry the contrary pose to extreme patterning herself on alexandrium the city have become to all intent and purpose the eastern capital of roman empire north south east and west the trade-route intersect enter the city through the ornate gate in crenelated limestone wall from mile away the approach caravan be overlook by legionary bring from gaul and britain quarter in the capitol on mount silpius at the city 's southern limit the riches of the east and of egypt flow through leave they deposit as a river drop its silt be ever - increase one quarter wall off hum with foreign trader from as far away as indium who lodge at the traveler ' inn or haunt the temple the wine-shop and the lupanar in that quarter too there be barracks with compound and open-fronted booth where slave be expose for sale and there also be the caravanserai within whose wall the kneel camel grumble and the blossomy spring air grow fetid with the reek of dung there be a market-place for elephant and other oriental beast each of antioch 's four division have its own wall pierce by arched gate those be necessary no more turbulent and fickle population live in the known world -- not even in alexandrium whenever a earthquake shake down block of building -- and that happen nearly as frequently as the hysterical racial riot -- the roman rebuild with a view to make communication easier from the citadel where the great temple of jupiter capitolinus frown over the gridironed street roman official and the wealthier macedonian antiochene live on a island form by a curve of the river oronte at the northern end within the city wall the never-neglected problem of administration be to keep a clear route along which troops could move from citadel to island when the rioting begin on the island be the palace glitter with gilt and marble gay with color awning where king have live magnificently until roman save the city from they substitute a proconsular paternal kind of tyranny originate in the roman patrium potesta there be not much sentiment about it rome become the foster-parent the possessor of authority there be duty principally exact from the govern in the form of tax and obedience and there be privilege mostly reserve for the ruler and they parasite who be much more numerous than anybody like competition make the parasite as discontented as they prey but there be definite advantage of roman rule which no antiochene deny although they comic actor and the slave who sing at private entertainment mock the roman and invent accusation of injustice and extortion that be even more outrageous than the truth not since the day when antioch inherit the luxury and vice of the greek and syrian have pleasure be so organize or its commercial pursuit so profitable tax be collect rigorously the demand of rome increase by the extravagance of commodus be merciless but trade be good obedience and flattery be well reward citizen who yield to extortion and refrain from criticism within hearing of informer live in reasonable expectation of survive the come night but the informer be ubiquitous and unknown which be another reason why the roman and antiochene refrain from mix socially more than could be help a secret charge of treason base on nothing more than a informer 's malice might set even a roman citizen outside the pale of ordinary law and make he liable to torture if convict death and confiscation follow since the deification of the emperor it have become treason even to use a coarse expression near they image or statue image be on the coin statue be in the street commodus to whom all confiscate property accrue be in ever - increase need of fund to defray the titanic expense of the game that he lavish on rome and the present with which he studiously nurse the army 's loyalty so it be wise to be taciturn expedient to choose one 's friend deliberately not far remove from madness to be see in company with those whose antecedent might suggest the possibility of a political intrigue but it be also unwise to woo solitude a solitary man might perish by the rack and sword for lack of witness if charge with some serious offense so there be comradeship more loyal the more that treachery stalk abroad because seriousness draw attention from the spy the deepest thought be mask beneath a air of levity and merrymaking hide such counsel as might come within the vaguely define boundary of treason sextus son of maximus ride not alone norbanus ride beside he and behind they scylax on the famous arab mare that sextus have win from artax the persian in a wager on the recent chariot race scylax be a slave but no less for that reason sextus ' friend norbanus ride a skewbald cappadocian that kick out sidewise at pedestrian so there be opportunity for private conversation even on the road to daphne of a afternoon in spring when nearly all of fashionable antioch be begin to flow in that direction horse litter and chariot follow by crowd of slave on foot with the provision for moonlight banquet pour toward the northern gate some overtake and pass the three but ride wide of the skewbald cappadocian stallion 's heel if pertinax should really come say sextus he will have a girl with he norbanus interrupt he have a annoying way of finish the sentence that other folk begin true when he be not campaigning pertinax find a woman irresistible and naturally also none resist a general in the field norbanus add so we handsome pertinax perform he vow to aphrodite with a constancy that the goddess reward by forever put lovely woman in he way whereas stoic like you sextus and unfortunate like I who do not know how to amuse a woman be make notorious by one least lapse from we austerity the handsome dissolute one have all the luck the roisterer at daphne will invent such scandalous tale of we tonight as will pursue we for a lustrum and yet there be not a chance in a thousand that we shall even enjoy ourselves yes i wish now we have choose any other meeting place than daphne sextus answer gloomily what odds have we go into the desert pertinax would have bring he own last desperate adorer and a couple more to bear we while he make himself ridiculous strange -- that a man so firm in war and wise in government should lose he head the moment a woman smile at he he do not lose he head -- much sextus answer but he father be a firewood seller in a village in ligurium that be why he so love money and the latest fashion poverty and rag -- austerity inflict on he in he youth -- great jupiter if you and i have rise from the charcoal - burn to be consul twice and a grammarian and the friend of marcus aurelius if you and i be as handsome as he be and have experience a triumph after restore discipline in britain and conduct two or three successful war and if either of we have such a wife as flavium titiana i believe we could besmirch ourselves more constantly than pertinax do it be not that he delight in woman so much as that he think debauch be aristocratic flavium titiana be unfaithful to he she be also a patrician and unusually clever he have never understand she but she be witty so he think she wonderful and try to imitate she immorality but the only woman who really sway he be the proudish cornificium who be almost as incapable of treachery as pertinax himself he be the best governor the city of rome have have in we generation can you imagine what rome would be like without he call to mind what it be like when fuscianus be the governor these be strange time sextus aye and it be a strange beast we have for emperor be careful sextus glance over he shoulder to make sure that scylax follow closely and prevent any one from overhear there be a endless procession now before and behind all bind for daphne as the rider pass under the city gate where the golden cherubim that titus take from the jew ' temple in jerusalem gleam in the westering sun sextus notice a slave of the municipium who write down the name of individual who come and go there be new proscription brewing he remark some friend of ours will not see sunrise well -- i be in a mood to talk and i will not be silence better laugh then norbanus advise the deadliest crime nowadays be to have the appearance of be serious none suspect a drunken or a gay man sextus however be at no pain to appear gay he inherit the moribund tradition that the older cato have typify some century ago he young face have the sober chiseled earnestness that have be typically roman in the sterner day of the republic he have blue-gray eye that challenge destiny and curly brown hair that suggest flame as the westering sun bring out its redness such mirth as haunt he rebellious lip be rather cynical than genial there be no weakness visible he have a pugnacious neck and shoulder i be the son of my father maximus he say and of my grandsire sextus and of he father maximus and of my great-great-grandsire sextus it offend my dignity that man should call a hog like commodus a god i will not i despise rome for submission to he yet what else be there in the world except to be a roman citizen norbanus ask as for be there be nothing else say sextus i would like to speak of do it be what i do that answer what i be then let it answer now norbanus laugh he point to a little shrine beside the road beneath a group of tree where once the image of a local deity have smile its blessing on the passer-by the bust of commodus as insolent as the brass of which the artist-slave have cast it have replace the old benign divinity there be a attendant near by costume as a priest whose duty be to see that traveler by that road do they homage to the image of the human god who rule the roman world he strike a gong he give fair warning of the deference require there be a little guard-house fifty pace distant just around the corner of the clump of tree where the police be ready to execute summary justice and flogging be inflict on offender who could not claim citizenship or who have no coin with which to buy the alternative reprimand roman citizen be place under arrest to be submit to all manner of indignity and to think themselves fortunate if they should escape with a heavy fine from a judge who have buy he office from a emperor 's favorite most of the rider ahead dismount and walk past the image salute it with right hand raise many of they toss coin to the priest 's attendant slave sextus remain in the saddle he brow cloud with a angry scowl he draw rein make no obeisance but send scylax to present a offering of money to the priest then ride on you dignity appear to I expensive norbanus remark grin gold he may have my gold if i may keep my self-respect incorrigible stoic he will take that also before long i think not commodus have lose he own and destroy rome 's but mine not yet i wish though that my father be in antioch he too be no cringer to image of beast in purple i write to my father recently and warn he to leave rome before commodus 's spy could invent a excuse for confiscate we estate i say a absent man attract less notice and we estate be well worth plunder i also hint that commodus can hardly live forever and remind he that tide flow in and out -- by which i mean he to understand that the next emperor may be another such as aurelius who will persecute the christian but let honest man live in peace instead of favor the christian and rid rome of honest man norbanus make a gesture with he right hand that send the cappadocian cavort to the road 's edge scatter a little crowd that be try to pass why be jealous of the christian he laugh be not it they turn for a respite think of what nero do to they and marcus aurelius do little less they will catch it again when commodus turn on he mistress marcium he will harry they all the more when that day come -- as it be sure to marcium be a christian when he tire of she he will use she christianity for the excuse and throw the christian to the lion by the thousand in order to justify himself for murder the only decent woman of he acquaintance sic semper tyrannus say what you will about marcia she have do she best to keep commodus from make a public exhibition of himself with what result he boast he have kill no less than twelve hundred poor devil with he own hand in the arena true he take the pseudonym of paulus when he kill lion with he javelin and drive a chariot in the race like a vulgar slave but everybody know and he pick slave for he minister -- consider that vile beast cleander whom even the rabble refuse to endure another day i do not see that marcium 's influence amount to much but cleander be execute finally you be in a glum mood sextus what have happen to upset you it be the nothing that have happen there have come no answer to that letter i write to my father in rome commodus 's informer may have intercept it norbanus whistle softly the skewbald cappadocian mistook that for a signal to exert himself and for a minute there be ructions while he master rein he in when do you write he demand when he have the horse under control again a month ago norbanus lapse into a moody silence critically stare at he friend when he be sure the other be not look sextus have always puzzle he by run risk that other man -lrb- himself for instance -rrb- steadfastly avoid and avoid risk that other man think insignificant to write a letter critical of commodus be almost tantamount to suicide since every roman port and every rest-house on the road that lead to rome have become infested with informer who be pay on a percentage basis be you weary of life he ask after a while i be weary of commodus -- weary of tyranny -- weary of lie and hypocrisy -- weary of wonder what be to happen to rome that submit to such bestial government -- weary of shame and of the insolence of bribe-fat magistrate -- weary of you friend norbanus ask do not you realize that if you letter fall into the hand of spy not only will you be proscribe and you father execute but whoever be know to have be intimate with you or with you father will be in almost equal danger you should have go to rome in person to consult you father he order I to stay here to protect he interest we be rich norbanus we have much property in antioch and many tenant to oversee i be not one of these modern irreligious wastrel i obey my father -- and betray he in a idiotic letter very well desert I while there be time say sextus angrily do not be a fool you be not the only proud man in the empire sextus i do not desert my friend for such a coward 's reason as that he act thoughtlessly but i will tell you what i think whether or not that please you if only because i be you true friend you be a rash impatient lover of the day go by possess of genius that you betray by you arrogant hastiness so now you know what i think and what all you other friend think we admire -- we love we sextus son of maximus and we confess to ourselves that we life be in danger because of that same sextus son of maximus whom we prefer above we safety after this if you continue to deceive yourself none can blame I for it sextus smile and wave a hand to he it be no new revelation he understand the attitude of all he friend far better than he do he own strange impulse that take possession of he as a rule when circumstance least provide a excuse my theory of loyalty to friendship he remark be that a man should dare to do what he perceive be right and thus should prove himself entitle to respect and you friend be in consequence to enjoy the privilege of attend you crucifixion one of these day say norbanus nonsense only slave and highwayman be crucify they call any one a highwayman who be a fugitive from what we ` roman hercule ' call justice norbanus answer with a gesture of irritation he own trick of finish people 's sentence do not annoy sextus nearly as much as sextus 's trick of pound on inaccuracy irritated he he press he horse into a canter and for a while they ride beside the stream call the donkey-drowner without further conversation each man strive to subdue the ill-temper that be on the verge of outbreak roman of the old school value inner calm as highly as they do the outer semblance of dignity even the more modern roman imitate that distinctive attitude pretend to augustan calmness that have actually cease to be a part of public life but with sextus and norbanus the inner struggle to be self-controlled be genuine they bridle irritation in the same way that they force they horse to obey they -- captain of they own soul as it be and scornful of changefulness sextus be the only son of a great landowner and raise in the tradition of a secluded valley fifty league away from rome be almost half a priest by privilege of ancestry he have be educate in the local priestly college have himself perform the daily sacrifice that tradition impose on the head of family and in he father 's frequent absence have attend to all the detail and responsibility of manage a large estate the god of wood and stream and dale be very real to he the daily offering from each meal to the mane of he ancestor whose image in wax and wood and marble be preserve in the little chapel attach to the old brick homestead have inspire in he a feeling that the past be forever present and a man 's thought be as important as he deed norbanus on the other hand a younger son of a man less amply dower with wealth and traditional authority have other reason for adopt rather than inherit a attitude toward life not dissimilar from that of sextus god of wood and stream to he mean very little and he have not family estate to hold he to the ancient view to he the future be more real than the past which he regard as a state of ignorance from which the world be tediously struggle but inherently he love life 's decency although he mock they sentimental imitation and he follow sextus -- squander hour with he neglect he own interest -lrb- which after all be nothing too important and be well enough look after by a syracusan slave -rrb- simply because sextus be a manly sort of fellow whose friendship stir in he emotion that he feel be satisfy he be a bear follower he ugly face and rather mirth-provoking blue eye the loose beautifully balanced seat on horseback and the cavalry-like carriage of he shoulder serve they notice to the world at large that he would stick to friend of he own choosing and for purely personal reason in spite of and in the tooth of anything as i say remark sextus if pertinax come -- he will show we how foolish a soldier can be in the arm of a woman norbanus remark laugh again glad the long silence be break orcus -lrb- the messenger of di who carry dead soul to the underworld the mask slave who drag dead gladiator out of the arena be disguise to represent orcus -rrb- take he woman what i be go to say be we shall learn from he the real news from rome all the name of the popular dancer and if galen be there we shall learn -- about commodus ' health that be more to the point now if we could get into galen 's chest of medicine and substitute -- galen be a honest doctor sextus interrupted if galen be there we will find out what the philosopher be discuss in rome when spy be not listen pertinax dress himself like a strut peacock and pretend that woman and money be he only interest but what the wise one say yesterday pertinax do today and what they say today he will do tomorrow he can look more like a popinjay and act more like a man than any one in rome who care how they behave in rome the city have go mad norbanus answer nowadays the best a man can do be to preserve he own goods and he own health ride to a conference do we well nothing but word will come of it and word be dangerous i like my danger tangible and in the open where it can be face three time last week i be approach by glyco -- you remember he -- that son of cocle and the jewess -- ask I to join a secret mystery of which he claim to be the unextinguishable lamp but there be too many mystery and not enough plain deal the only mystery about glyco be how he avoid indictment for conspiracy -- what with he long nose and sly eye and he way of hint that he know enough to turn the world upside down if pertinax talk mystery i will class he with the other fox who slink into hole when the agenda look like become acta show I only a raise standard in a open field and i will take my chance beside it but i sicken of all this talk of what we might do if only somebody have the courage to stick a dagger into commodus the man who could persuade themselves to do that be persuade that a worse brute might succeed he sextus answer it be no use kill a commodus to find a nero in he shoe if the successor be in sight -- and visibly a man not a monster -- there be plenty of man brave enough to give the dagger-thrust but the praetorian guard that make and unmake emperor have be tasting the sweet of tyranny ever since marcus aurelius die they despise they ` roman hercule ' -lrb- commodus ' favorite name for himself -rrb- -- who do not but they grow fat and enjoy themselves under he tyranny so they would never consent to leave he unguarded as happen to nero for instance or to replace he with any one of the caliber of aurelius if such a man could be find well then what do we go to talk about norbanus ask we go for information dea dium -lrb- the most mysterious of all the roman deity -rrb- we inform ourselves that rome have be rename ` the city of commodus ' -- that office be buy and sell -- that there be forty consul in a year each of whom pay for the office in turn -- that no man 's life be safe -- that it be wiser to take a cold in the head to galen than to kiss a mule 's nose -lrb- it be a common superstition that a cold in the head could be cure by kiss a mule 's nose -rrb- -- and then what i begin to think that pertinax be wiser to amuse himself with woman after all sextus edge he horse a little closer to the skewbald and for more than a minute appear to be study norbanus ' face the other grin at he and make the stallion prance be you never serious ask sextus always and forever melancholy friend of mine i seriously dread the consequence of that letter that you write to rome unlike you i have not much more than life to lose but i value it all the more for be less encumber like apollonius i pray for few possession and no need but what i have i treasure i propose to live long and make use of life and i retort sextus with a gesture of disgust he turn to stare behind he at the crowd on its way to daphne make such a business of pleasure as reduce the pleasure to a toil of sisyphus -lrb- who have to roll a heavy stone perpetually up a steep hill in the underworld before he reach the top the stone always roll down again -rrb- i have more than gold say sextus which it seem to I that any crooked-minded fool may have i have a spirit in I and a taste for philosophy i have a feeling that a man 's life be a gift entrust to he by the god -- for use -- to be preserve -- by write foolish letter doubtless say norbanus come along let we gallop i be weary of the back of all these roisterer and so they ride to daphne full pelt greatly to the anger of the too well dress antiochene who curse they for the mud they splash from wayside pool and for the dung and dust they kick up into pluck and pencil face ii a conference at daphne it be not yet dusk the sun shone on the bronze roof of the temple of apollo make such a contrast to and harmony with marble and the green of giant cypress as only music can suggest the die breeze stir hardly a ripple on the wind pond so marble column tree and statuary be reflect amid shadow of the swan in water tint by the color of the sink sun there be a murmur of wind in the top of the tree and a stir of linen-clad girl near the temple entrance -- voice drone from the near-by booth behind the shrubbery -- one flute like the plaint of orpheus summon eurydice -- a blossom - scented air and a enfold mystery of silence pertinax the governor of rome have merely hint at olympian desire whereat some rich antiochene long privileged have be eject with scant ceremony from a small marble pavilion on a islet form by a branch of the river ladon that have be guide twenty year ago by hadrian 's engineer in curve of exquisitely study beauty from between corinthian column be a view of nearly all the temple precinct and of the lawn where reveler would presently forget restraint the first night of the daphne season usually be the wildest night of all the year but they begin demurely and for the present there be the restraint of expectation because there be yet snow on mountain-top and the balmy air would carry a suggestion of a chill at sunset there be cunningly work charcoal brazier set near the gilded couch group around a semicircular low table so as to give each guest a unobstructed view from the pavilion pertinax -- neither guest nor host but a god as it be who have arrive and permit the city of antioch to ennoble itself by pay he expense -- stretch he long length on the middle couch with galen the physician on he right hand sextus on he left beyond galen lay tarquinius divius and sulpicius glabrio friend of pertinax and on sextus ' leave be norbanus and beyond he marcus fabius a young tribune on pertinax ' staff there be only one couch unoccupied galen be a older man than pertinax who be already gray at the temple galen have the wrinkled smile shrewd face of a old philosopher who understand the trick of make himself socially prominent in order to pursue he call unimpeded by the bitter jealousy of rival he understand all about charlatanry mock it in all its disguise and know how to defeat it with sarcastic wit he wear none of the distinguishing insignia that practise physician usually favor the study plainness of he attire be a notable contrast to the costly magnificence of pertinax whose double-purple-bordered and fringed toga beautifully weave linen and jeweled ornament seem choose to combine suggestion of the many public office he have succeed to he be a tall lean handsome veteran with naturally curly fair hair and a beard that have it be dark would have make he look like a assyrian there be a world of humor in he eye and a expression on he weathered face of wonder at the way of man -- a almost comical confession of he own inferiority of birth combine with matter-of-fact ability to do whatever call for strength endurance and mere ordinary common sense you be almost ashamed of you own good fortune galen tell he you wear all that jewelry and swagger like the youngest tribune to conceal you diffidence be honest you be naturally frugal but you be ashamed of you own honesty so you imitate the court 's extravagance and make up for it with little meanness that comfort you sense of extreme the truth be pertinax you be a man with a boy 's enthusiasm a boy with a man 's experience you ought to know say pertinax you tutor commodus whoever could take a murderer at the age of twelve and keep he from break the heart of a marcus aurelius know more about man and boy than i do ah but i fail say galen the young commodus be like a nibble fish you think you have he but he always take the bait and leave the hook the wisdom i feed to he fatten he wickedness if i have know then what i have learn from teaching commodus and other not even marcus aurelius could have persuade I to undertake the task -- medical problem though it be and promotion though it be and answer though it be to all the doctor who denounce I as a charlatan i buy my fashionable practice at the cost of know it be i who teach young commodus the technique of wickedness by reveal to he all its sinuosity and how and why it flood a man 's mind he be a beast in any case say pertinax yes but a baffled blind beast i remove the bandage from he eye he would have pull it off himself i do it i turn a mere golden-haired savage into a criminal who know what he be do well drink and forget it say pertinax i too have do thing that be best forget we attain success by learn from defeat and we forget defeat in triumph i know of no triumph that do not blot out score of worse thing than defeat when i be in britain i subdue rebellion and restore the discipline of mutiny legion how i be not such a fool as to tell you all that happen when i be in africa man call I a great proconsul so i be they would welcome I back there if all i hear about the present man be true but do you suppose i do not fail in certain instance they praise I for the aqueduct i build and for the peace i leave along the border but i also leave dry bone and son of dead man who will teach they grandson how to hate the name of rome i send a hundred thousand slave from africa sometimes when i have dine unwisely and there be no galen near to freshen up my belly juice i have nightmare in which man and woman cry to I for water that i take from they to pour into the city i have learn this galen : do one thing wisely and you will commit ten folly you be lucky if you have but ten failure to detract from one success -- as lucky as a man who have but ten mistress to interfere with he enjoyment of he wife he speak of mistress because the girl be come down the temple step to take part in the sunset ceremony the torch they carry be unlighted yet they figure drape in linen look almost super-humanly lovely in the deepen twilight and as they lay they garland on the marble altar near the temple step and group themselves again on either side of it they movement suggest a phantasmagoria fading away into infinite distance as if all the universe be fill with woman without age or blemish there begin to be a scent of incense in the air we only imitate this kind of thing in rome say pertinax a larger scale a coarser effect what i find thrilling be the sensation they contrive here of unseen mystery whereas -- there will not be any mystery leave presently they 'll strip you last veil from imagination sextus interrupted laughing man say hadrian try to chasten this place but he only make they realize the artistic value of a appearance of chastity that can be throw off hark the evening hymn the torch suddenly be light by attendant slave the stir shake sistra work a miracle of sound that set the nerve all tingling as the high priest follow by he boy with swing censer and the member of the priestly college four by four come chant down the temple step to a accompany plead sob note of flute the high priest lay a offering of fruit milk wine and honey in the midst of the heaped-up garland -lrb- for apollo be the god of all fertility as well as of healing and war and flock and oracle -rrb- then come the grand homeric hymn to glorious apollo man 's and boy ' and woman 's voice blend in a surge paean like a ocean 's music the last note die away in distant echo there be silence for a hundred breath then music of flute and lyre and sistra as the priest retreat up the temple step follow by fanfare on a dozen trumpet as the door swing to behind the priest instantly then shout of laughter -- torchlight scatter the shadow amid gloom -- green cypress -- fire -- color splurge on the bosom of the water -- babel of hundred of voice as the gay antiochene swarm out from behind the tree -- and a cheer as the girl by the altar throw they garment off and scamper naked along the river-bank toward a bridge that join the temple island to the sloping lawn where the crowd run to await they apollo have heal the world of sin we now do what we like say sextus pertinax i pledge you continence for this one night good galen may apollo 's wisdom ooze from you like sweat for all we sake be you the arbiter of what we drink lest drunkenness deprive we of we reason comite let we eat like warrior -- one course and then discussion of tomorrow 's plan you military service should have teach you more respect for you senior as well as how to eat and drink temperately say pertinax will you teach you grandmother to suck egg i be the first grammarian in rome before you be bear and a tribune before you feel down on you cheek i be the governor of rome my boy who be you that you should lecture I if you call that a lecture concede that i dare sextus answer i do not flatter you by come here or come to flatter you i come because my father tell I you be a roman beyond praise i be a roman i believe praise be worthless unless prove to the hilt -- as for instance : i have come to bare my thought to you which be a bold compliment in these day of treachery keep you thought under cover say pertinax glancing at the steward and the slave who be begin to carry in the meal but he be evidently pleased and sextus 's next word please he more : i be ready to do more than think about you i will follow where you lead -- except into licentiousness he lay on both elbow and stare at the scene with disgust naked girl against a background of the torchlit water and the green and purple gloom of cypress be nothing to complain of statuary since it could not move be not as please to the eye but shriek of idiotic laughter and debauchery of beauty sicken he there come a series of sound at the pavilion entrance where a litter be set down on marble pavement and a eunuch 's shrill voice criticize the slow unrolling of a carpet what do i warn you norbanus whisper laughing in sextus 's ear pertinax get to he foot long-leggedly statuesque and stride toward the antechamber on he right whence presently he return with a woman on he arm he stroke she hand as it rest on he he introduce sextus and norbanus the other know she galen greet she with a wrinkled grin that seem to imply confidence now that cornificium have come not even sextus need worry about we behavior say galen and everybody except sextus grin it be notorious that cornificium refine and restrain pertinax whereas he lawful wife flavium titiana merely drive he to extreme this roman aspasium have a almost grecian face beneath a coiled extravagance of dark brown hair she violet eye be quietly intelligent she dress plain white and not elaborately fringe with hardly any jewelry she cultivate modesty and all the older grace that have grow unfashionable since the emperor marcus aurelius die in all way in fact she be the opposite of flavium titiana -- it be hard to tell whether from natural preference or because the contrast to he wife 's extreme of noisy gaiety and shameless license give she a stronger hold on pertinax rome 's readiest slanderer have nothing scandalous to tell of cornificium whereas flavium titiana 's inconstancy be a by-word she refuse to let galen yield the couch on pertinax 's right hand but take the vacant one at the end of the half-moon table say she prefer it -- which be likely true enough it give she a view of all the face without turn she head or appear to stare for a long time there be merely desultory conversation while the feast restricted within moderate proportion by request of pertinax be bring on there be eel for which daphne be famous alphest and callichthy pompilo a purple fish say to have be bear from sea-foam at the birth of aphrodite boop and bedradone gray mullet cuttle-fish tunny-fish and mussel follow in they order pheasant grouse swan peacock and a large pig stuff with lark and mincemeat then there be sweetmeat of various kind and a pudding invent in persium make with honey and date with a sauce of frozen cream and strawberry by galen 's order only seven sort of wine be serve so when the meal be do the guest be neither drunk nor too well feed to carry on a conference no entertainer be provide normally the space between the table and the front of the pavilion would have be occupy by acrobat dancer and juggler but pertinax dismiss even the impudent woman who come to lean elbow on the marble railing and sing snatch of suggestive song he send slave to stand outside and keep the crowd away he lictor and he personal official bodyguard be keep out of sight in a small stone house near the pavilion kitchen at the rear among the tree in order not to arouse unwelcome comment it be know he be in daphne there be even a subdue expectation in antioch that he unannounced visit portend the extortion of extra tribute the emperor commodus be know to be in he usual strait for money give a sufficient flow of wine the sight of bodyguard and lictor might have be enough to start a riot the antiochene be prone to outbreak when they passion be arouse by drink and woman there be a long silence after pertinax have dismiss the steward galen 's old personal attendant take charge of the amphora of snow-cooled falernian he pour for each in turn and then retire into a corner to be out of earshot or at any rate to emphasize that what he might hear would not concern he pertinax stroll to the front of the pavilion and look out to make sure there be no eavesdropper stare for a long time at the revelry that be warm up into a orgy they be dance in ring under the moon they shadowy figure render weird by smoky torchlight cornificium at last break on he reverie : you wish to join they pertinax that would dignify even we roman hercule -- to say nothing of you he shrug he shoulder but he eye be glitter if marcium could govern commodus as you rule I he would be safer on the throne he answer come to sit upright on the couch beside she it be evident that he intend that speech to release all tongue he look from face to face expectantly but no one speak until cornificium urge he to protect himself against the night breeze he throw a purple-bordered cloak over he shoulder it become he he look so official in it and majestic that even sextus -- rebel that he be against all modern trumpery -- forebore to break the silence it be galen who speak next : pertinax if you might choose a emperor whom would you nominate remember : he must be a soldier use to the stench of march legion none could govern rome whose nose go up in the air at the smell of sweat and garlic there be a murmur of approval cornificium stroke the long strong finger of the man she idolize sextus give rein to he impulse then brushing aside norbanus ' hand that warn he to bide he time : many more than i he say be ready to throw in we lot with you pertinax -- aye unto death you would restore rome 's honor i believe my father could persuade a hundred nobleman to take you part if you would lead i can answer for five or six man of wealth and influence not reckon a friend or two who -- why talk foolishness say pertinax the legion will elect commodus ' successor they will sell rome to the highest bidder probably and though they like I as a soldier they dislike my discipline i be the governor of rome and still alive in spite of it because even commodus ' informer know it would be silly to accuse I of intrigue not even commodus would listen to such talk i lead the gay life for my own life 's sake all know I as a roisterer i be say to have no ambition other than to live life sensuously galen laugh that may deceive commodus he say the thoughtful roman know you as a frugal governor who stamp out plague and -- you do that say pertinax who enable I it be a simple thing to have the tenement burn besides it profit the city -- new street and there be twice the amount of tax on the new tenement they raise i personally make a handsome profit on the purchase of a few burned house and as the governor who break the famine galen continue that be simple enough but you may as well thank cornificium she find out through the woman who the man be who be hold corn for speculation all i do be to hand they name to commodus he confiscate all the corn and sell it -- at a handsome profit to himself since it have cost he nothing while we sit here and cackle like asian bird commodus rename rome the city of commodus and still live sextus grumble nor can he be easily get rid of remark daedalus the tribune he go to and fro from the palace through underground tunnel man sleep in he room who be all involve with he in cruelty and infamy so they guard he carefully besides whoever try to murder he would probably kill paulus by mistake the praetorian guard be contented be well pay and permit all sort of privilege who can get past the praetorian guard any one say pertinax the point be not who shall kill commodus but who shall be raise in he place there be thirty thousand way to kill a man ask galen old galen laugh at that as many way as there be star in heaven but the star have they say in the matter none can kill a man until he destiny say yes to it not even a doctor he add chuckle otherwise the doctor would have kill I long ago with jealousy a man die when he inner man grow sick and weary of he then a pin-prick do it or a sudden terror until that time come you may break he skull and do not more than spoil he temper as a philosopher i have learn two thing : respect many but trust few but as a doctor i have learn only one thing for certain : that no man actually die until he soul be tire of he whose soul should grow sick sooner than that of commodus ask sextus not if he soul be evil and delight in evil -- as he do galen retort if he should turn virtuous then perhaps yes but in that case we should wish he to live although he soul would prefer the contrary and leave he to die by the first form of death that should appear -- in spite of all the doctor and the guard and taster of the royal food some one should convert he then say sextus cornificium can not marcia make a christian of he christian pretend to oppose all the infamy he practise it would be a merry joke to have a christian emperor who die because he soul be sick of he it would be a choice jest -- he be the one who have encourage christianity by reverse all marcus aurelius ' wise precaution against they seditious blasphemy you speak fanatically but you have touch the heart of the problem say cornificium it be marcium who make life possible for commodus -- marcium and she christian they help marcia protect he because he be the only emperor who never persecute they and because marcium see to it that they be free to meet together without have even to bribe the police there be only one way to get rid of commodus : persuade marcium that she own life be in danger from he and that she will have a full voice in nominate he successor probably true remark pertinax whom would she nominate that be the point it would be simpler to kill marcium say daedalus thereafter let thing take they course without marcium to protect he -- no man know much galen interrupted marcium 's soul may be all the soul commodus have if she should grow sick of he -- she grow sick long ago say cornificium but she be forever think of she christian and know no other way to protect they than to make commodus love she ugh it be like the story of andromeda who be to act perseus -lrb- in the fable andromeda have to be chained to a cliff to be devour by a monster in order to save she people from the anger of the god poseidon perseus slew the monster -rrb- there be thirty thousand way of kill pertinax repeat but if we kill one monster four or five other will fight for he place unless like perseus we have the head of a medusa with which to freeze they into stone there be no substitute for commodus in sight the only man whose face would freeze all rival be severus the carthaginian we be none of we blind say cornificium you mean I i be too old answer pertinax i do not like tyranny and people know it it be something they should not know a old man may be all very well when he have reign for twenty year and man be use to he and he use to the task as be augustus but a old man new to the throne lack energy and besides they would never endure a man whose father be a charcoal-seller as mine be i have make my way in life by look at fact and refuse to deceive myself with the exception of that i have no especial wisdom nor any unusual ability if wisdom be all that be need say sextus we should put good galen on the throne he be too old and wise to let you try to do it galen answer but you speak about the head of a medusa pertinax and mention lucius septimius severus he command three legion at caruntum in pannonium -lrb- roughly speak the sw portion of modern hungary whose frontier be then occupy by very warlike tribe -rrb- if there be one man living who can freeze man 's blood by scowl at they it be he and he be not as old as you be i have think of he only to hate he say pertinax he would not follow I nor i he he be one of three man who would fight for the throne if somebody slew commodus although he would not run the risk of slaying he himself and he would betray we if we should take he into confidence i know he well he be a lawyer and a carthaginian he would never ask for the nomination he be too crafty he would say he legion nominate he against he will and that to have disobey they would have lay he open to the punishment for treason -lrb- this be what severus actually do later on after pertinax 's death -rrb- the other two be pescennius niger who command the legion in syrium and clodius albinus who command in britain we must find a man who can forestall all three of they by win first the praetorian guard and then the senate and the roman by dint of sound reform and justice you be he rome trust you so do the senate say cornificium marcium trust I the praetorian guard trust she if i can persuade marcium that she life be in danger from commodus -- but how daedalus interrupted we can take the praetorian guard by surprise cornificium go on ignore he they can be trick into declare for the man whom marcia 's friend nominate have once declare for he they will be too proud of have make a emperor and too unwilling to seem vacillate to reverse themselves in any man 's favor even though he should command six legion the senate will gladly accept one who have govern rome as frugally as pertinax have do if the senate confirm the nominee of the praetorian guard the roman populace will do the rest by acclamation then three month of upright government -- deification by the senate -- pertinax laugh explosively -- a honest chesty laugh unqualified by any subtlety suggest a trace of the peasantry from which he spring it make cornificium wince can you imagine I a god he ask i can imagine you a emperor say sextus it be true you have no following among the legion just at present but i make one and there be plenty of energetic man who think as i do my friend norbanus here will follow I my father -- noise near the open window interrupt he a argument seem to be go on between the slave whom pertinax have set to keep the roisterer away and some one who demand admission near at hand be a woman 's voice shrilling and scolding then another voice -- scylax the slave who have ride the red mare pertinax stride to the window again and lean out cornificium whisper to galen : if the truth be know he be afraid of flavium titiana as a wife she be bad enough but as a empress -- galen nod if you love you pertinax he answer keep he off the throne he have too many scruple she frown have few which be firm and entirely devote to pertinax ' fortune love he i would give he up to see he deify she whisper and again galen nod deeply understand that be because you have never have child he assure she smile you mother pertinax who be more than twice you age -- just as marcium have mother that monster commodus until she heart be break but i think you be pertinax ' friend so i be and he urgent adviser to -- yes so i be i have change my opinion only the maniac never do that pertinax would make a splendid minister for lucius severus and the two of they could bring back the augustan day persuade he to it he must forget he hate he let he come say the voice of pertinax he be still lean out with one hand on a marble pillar much more interested in the moonlit view of revelry than in the altercation between slave he stroll back and stand smile at cornificium he handsome face express satisfaction but a rather humorous amusement at he inability to understand she altogether be you like all other woman he ask i just see a naked woman stab a man with she hairpin and kick he corpse into the shrubbery before the breath be out of it galen have desert you say cornificium the murder be uninteresting nobody make any comment not he pertinax answer and go and sit on galen 's couch you find I not man enough for the senate to make a god of I -- be that it galen too much of a man to be a emperor say galen smile amid wrinkle by observe a man 's virtue one may infer what he fault be you would try to rule the empire honestly which be impossible a more dishonest man would let it rule itself and claim the credit whereas you would give the praise to other who would shoulder off the work and all the blame on to you a empire be like a human body which heal itself if the head will let it too many head -- a conference of doctor -- and the patient die one doctor do nothing with a air of confidence and the patient get well there i have tell you more than all the senate know come scylax out of breath less menial than most man 's slave he head and shoulder upright and the hand that hold a letter thrust well forward as if what he have to do be more important than the way he do it this come he say standing beside sextus ' couch cadmus bring it run all the way from antioch he hand be tremble evidently cadmus have by some means learn the contents of the letter and have tell i and cadmus -- he say and then hesitate what -- be faithful no matter what happen scylax stand erect with closed lip sextus break the seal merely glance at pertinax take permission for grant he frown as he read bit he lip he face grow crimson and white alternately when he have master himself he hand the letter to pertinax i always suppose you protect my father he say struggle to appear calm but he eye give the story away -- grieve mortified indignant scylax offer he he arm to lean on norbanus set both hand on he shoulder from behind obliged he to sit down calm norbanus whisper calm you friend be you friend what have happen pertinax read the letter and pass it to cornificium then pace the floor with hand behind he be that fellow to be trust he ask with a jerk of he head toward scylax he seem nearly as upset as sextus be sextus nod not trust himself to speak know that if he do he would insult a man who might be guiltless in spite of appearance commodus command I to visit antioch as he say for a rest say pertinax the public excuse be that i should look into the possibility of hold the olympic game here strangely enough i suspect nothing he have be flatteringly friendly of late those whom i request he to spare he spare even though they name be on he proscription list and i have not better excuse than that they have do no wrong the day before i leave i bring a list to he of name that i commend to he favor -- you father 's name among they sextus pertinax turn he back again and stride toward the window where he stand like a statue frame in the luminous gloom the only part of he that move be he long finger weave together behind he until the knuckle crack cornificia subdue she contralto voice read the letter aloud : to nimius secundus sextus son of galienus maximus the freedman rufus glabrio send humble greet may the god give solace and preserve you notwithstanding all you noble father 's piety -- he respect for elder and superior -- he be accuse of treason and of blasphemy toward the emperor by whose order he be seize yesterday and behead the same day the estate have already be seize it be say they will be sell to asinus sejanus who be probably the source of the accusation against you father i and three other freedman make we escape and will attempt to reach tarentum where we will await instruction from you titus the son of the freedman paulinus will convey this letter to brundisium and thence by boat to dyrrachium whence he will send it by post in the charge of a jew whom he say he can trust it be a certainty that order will go forth to seize yourself since the estate in antioch be know to be of great value therefore we you true friend and devoted servant urge you to make all speed in escape stay not to make provision for yourself but travel without encumbrance hide hasten we commend this letter to you as a sure proof that we ourselves be to be trust since if it should fall into the hand of a informer by the way we life undoubtedly would pay the forfeit we have not much money but enough for the expense of a journey to a foreign land the place where we will hide near tarentum be know to you in deep anxiety and not without such sacrifice to the god and to the mane of you noble ancestor as means permit we will await you come -- rufus glabrio freedman of the illustrious galienus maximus pertinax turn from the window the jew have a say he say that who keepeth he mouth and he tongue keepeth he soul from trouble often i warn maximus that he be too free with he speech he count too much on my protection now it remain to be see whether commodus have not proscribe I sextus and norbanus stand together scylax behind they norbanus whisper plainly enough norbanus be urge patience -- discretion -- deliberate thought whereas sextus could hardly think at all for anger that redden he eye what can i do for you what can i do wonder pertinax then cornificium be on she foot there be nothing -- nothing you can do she insist she avoid galen 's eye the old philosopher be watch she as if she be the subject of some new experiment let commodus learn as much as that sextus be here in this pavilion and -- sextus interrupted very proudly : i will not endanger my friend who will lend I a dagger this toy that i wear be too short and not sharp you may forget I pertinax my slave will bury I but play you the man and save rome then the tribune speak up he be younger than all of they sextus be right they will know he be here they will probably torture he slave and learn about that letter that have reach he if he run and hide we shall all be accuse of have help he to escape whereas -- what galen ask he as he hesitate if he die by he own hand he will not only save all he slave from the torture but remove the suspicion from we and we will still be free to mature we -- cowardice norbanus finish the sentence for he aye some of we would hardly feel like noble roman pertinax say grimly possibly i can protect you sextus let we think of some great favor you can do the emperor provide a excuse for I to interfere i might even take you to rome with I and -- galen laugh and cornificium draw in she breath bite she lip why do you laugh galen pertinax stride over to he and stand stare because say galen i know so little after all i can not tell a beast 's blood from a man 's we commodus would kill you with all the more peculiar enjoyment because he have flatter you so often publicly and call you ` father pertinax ' he poison he own father why not you they will tell he you have frequently befriend sextus they will show he sextus ' father 's name on that list of name that you commend to he favor do you follow I by jupiter not i say pertinax he be sure to learn about this letter that have come say galen if you in fearful loyalty to commodus should instantly attempt to make a prisoner of sextus if escape he be kill and you bear witness -- that would please commodus almost as much as to see gladiator kill in the arena if you weep over the death of sextus that would please he even more he would enjoy you feeling do you remember how he pick two gladiator who be brother twin they be -- and when the slayer of he twin-brother salute commodus get down into the arena and kiss he you yourself must announce to he the news of sextus ' death and he will kiss you also vale remark sextus i die willingly enough you be dead already galen answer do not pertinax see some one 's body kick into the bush there be silence they all glance at one another only galen sip at he wine seem philosophically calm i personally should not be a eye-witness galen remark i be a doctor whose certificate of death not even commodus would doubt in the dark i might recognize sextus ' garment even though i could not see he feature and -- he add pointedly -- neither i nor any one can tell a beast 's blood from a man 's daedalus say pertinax with sudden resolution get my purse my slave have it sextus shall not go empty-handed iii maternus-latro sorbanus bring the skewbald stallion not far away a group of woman dance around a dozen drunken man who sing uproariously see against the background of purple and dark-green gloom with crimson torchlight flare on the quiet water and the moon descend behind tree beyond they they be mystically beautiful -- seem not to belong to earth any more than the pan-pipe music do ride into they midst norbanus urge point tickle the stallion thus the cappadocian lash out savagely here be a bottle of goat 's blood i will bring weapon and i will join you as soon as possible after i have make sure that the temple priest and all daphne be positive about you death now mount and ride sextus swing on to the stallion 's back as if a catapult have throw he until then he have let other do the order he have prefer to let they take they own precaution form they own plan and subject himself to any course they wish after which he should be free to face he destiny and fight it without feel he have handicap he friend by wilfulness he have not even issue a direct command to scylax he own slave that be characteristic of he nor be it at he suggestion that norbanus volunteer to share he outlawry but it be also characteristic that he make no gesture of dissent he accept norbanus ' loyalty with a quiet smile that rather scorn word as unnecessary now he drive he heel into the cappadocian with vigor for the die be cast the stallion impatient of new mastery rear and plunge snort come back on the bit in a attempt to get it in he tooth and bolt straight for the group of roisterer who scatter away man swearing woman scream throw back he weight against the rein he bring the stallion to a plunge snort wheeling halt in the midst of man and woman -- a terrifying monster blow cloud of mist out of he nostril as they run he let the brute rear -- pull he over -- roll from under he and lay still with goat 's blood from the broken bottle splash around he face and seem to flow from he mouth one woman stoop to look grope for a purse or anything of value scream and run sextus she yell sextus who be dine in the white pavilion sextus crawl among the oleander presently norbanus come hurry out of gloom accompany by cadmus the slave who have bring from antioch the letter that come from rome they be drag a body between they they lay it down exactly where sextus have fall from the horse there be a sickening thwack as cadmus make the face unrecognizable then come the lanky hurry figure of pertinax lead a group of people cornificium among they -- galen last sextus lay still until all they back be toward he then he creep out of the oleander and walk along the river-bank in no haste mask he face with a fold of he toga he choose a path that wind amid the shrubbery where marble satyr grin in color lantern light he have to avoid couple here and there a woman follow he lay a hand on he arm he strike she and she run off scream for she bully presently he reach the wind track that lead toward the high-road with the gloom of cypress on either hand and beyond that the glow of the light in the caterer ' booth he be as safe now as if he be fifty mile away none notice he except the beggar at the bridge who expose maimed limb and whine for charity a leper banking on he only stock in trade -- the dread man have of he affliction -- curse he you waste breath say sextus and pass on he be smile to himself -- sardonically leper live by threat -- he think no more than any leper now could he expect protection from society beyond what he could force society to yield he have no name for he be dead that thought amuse he suddenly it dawn on he how safe he be since none in antioch would dare to question the word of pertinax back by galen and all the witness whom pertinax would be sure to summon he remember then to protect the honest freedman who have send he warn -- stride to a fire near a caterer 's booth and burn the letter stare at by the slave who warm they shin around the ember one of those might have recognize he in spite of the toga draw over he face if any one should ask which way maternus go say i have go home he command and stride away into the gloom he wonder why he have choose the name maternus not even he remotest ancestor have bear it yet it come to he lip as naturally instantly as if it be he own by right but as he walk away it come to mind that ten or possibly twelve night ago he and he friend have all be talk of a highwayman maternus who have rob the caravan on the mountain road from tarsus for the moment that think scared he should he change the name the slave by the ember have stare they show he respect but there be a distinct sensation mingle with it -- hardly to be wonder at where be it he hear -- who tell he -- that maternus have be catch he could not remember it dawn on he how difficult it be to decide what to do when the old familiar condition and the expectation on which we habitually base decision be all suddenly strip away he understand now how a general in the field can fail when suddenly confront with the unknown shall he do this or do that there be not a habit or a circumstance to guide he he must choose the while the god look on and laugh maternus it be a strange name to adopt and yet he like the sound of it nor would it pass out of he mind he try to think of other name but either they have all be bear by slave and be distasteful or else by famous man or by he friend whom he do not propose to wrong he only have to imagine he case reverse to realize how bitterly he would resent it if a outlawed man should take he own name and make it notorious yet he perceive that notoriety would be he only refuge paradox though that might be as a mere fugitive anonymous and have no more object than to live and avoid recognition he would soon reach the end of he tether there be little mercy in the world for man without a home or mean whether recognize or not he would become like a hunt animal -- might in fact end as a slave unless he should prefer to prove he identity and submit to commodus 's executioner suicide would be preferable to that but it seem almost as if the god themselves have veto self-destruction by provide that roisterer 's corpse at the critical moment and put the plan for its use into galen 's wise old head he must take the field like spartacus of old but he must have a goal more definite and more attainable than spartacus have have he must avoid the mistake that weaken spartacus of accept for the sake of number any ally who might offer himself he would have nothing whatever to do with the rabble of runaway slave whose only guide impulse would be loot and license although he know how easy it would be to raise such a army if he should choose to do it out of any hundred outlaw in the record of a hundred year some ninety-nine have come to grief through the increase number of they follow and lack of discipline he could think of a dozen who have be betray by pay informer of the government pose as friendly brigand and besides he have no intention of adopt brigandry as a profession though he realize that he must make a reputation as a brigand if he hope to be anything else than a helpless fugitive as a rebel against commodus it might be possible to raise a good-sized army in a month or two but that would only serve to bring the roman army out of camp lead by general eager for cheap victory he must be too resourceful to be take by police -- too insignificant to tempt the legion out of camp brigandry be as distasteful to he and as far beneath he dignity as the pursuit of brigand be beneath the dignity of any of those roman general who owe they rank to commodus for they as for himself the pettiness of brigandry lead nowhither only one object appeal to they -- fame and its perquisite only one object appeal to himself : to redeem he estate and to avenge he father that could be accomplish only by the death of commodus : he laugh as he think of himself pit alone against commodus the deify mad monster who could marshal the resource of the roman empire such thought fill he mind until he reach the lonely cross-road where the narrower tree-lined road to daphne meet the great main highway lead northward over the mountain there be the usual row of gibbet rear on rise ground against the sky by way of grim reminder to slave and other would-be outlaw that the arm of rome be long not merciful five of the gibbet be vacant except for a arm on one of they that sway in the wind as it hang by a cord from the wrist the sixth have a man on it -- dead scylax who be wait for he ride out of the gloom on the mare lead the cappadocian and rein in near the gibbet not quite sure yet who it be who stride toward he scare by the stench the horse become difficult to manage the leading-rein pass around one of the gibbet sextus run forward to help the cappadocian break the rein and scylax gallop after he so sextus stand alone beside the rough-hewn tree-trunk to which be tie the body of a man who have be dead perhaps since sunset he have not be tear yet by the vulture morbid curiosity -- a fellow feeling for a victim as the man might well be of the same injustice that have make a outlaw of himself -- impel sextus to step closer he could not see the face which be droop forward but there be a parchment hold spread on a stick like a sail on a spar suspend from the man 's neck by a string he snatch it off and hold it toward the moon now low on the horizon there be only two word smear with red paint by a forefinger underneath the official letter spqr : maternus-latro he begin to wonder who maternus might have be and how he take the first step that have lead to crucifixion it be hard to believe that any man would run that risk unless impel to it by some injustice that have change pride into savagery or else shot off all opportunity for decent live the cruelty of the form of execution hardly trouble he the possible injustice of it stir he to he depths he feel a sort of superstitious reverence for the victim increase by the strange coincidence that he have make use without previous reflection of maternus ' name presently he see norbanus ride the horse that he himself have ride that afternoon from antioch to daphne follow on a mule by cadmus the slave who have bring the letter which have pull the trigger that set the catapult of destiny in motion make a wide circuit they help scylax catch the cappadocian norbanus come canter back he be dress for the road in a brown woolen tunic contribute by some one in pertinax ' suite he shake a bag of money cornificium be generous he say old pertinax think he have do well enough by you she cry shame on he and threaten to send for she jewelry so he borrow money from the priest you be as dead as that he look up at the tortured body of the robber what name will you take we have better begin to get use to it it be write here say sextus show he the parchment but the moon have go down in a smother of silvery cloud norbanus could not see to read i be maternus-latro i be tell they have crucify that fellow this be maternus be dead he will hardly grudge I the use of he name however i will pay he for it he shall have fair burial help I down with he norbanus beckon to the slave who tie the horse to a near-by tree they seek in the dark for a hole that would do for a grave since they have no bury tool stumble on a limestone slab at last that lay amid rank weed near a tomb hollow out of the rock that have be rifle very likely century ago they lower the already stiffen body into it with a coin in its finger for charon 's ferry-fare across the styx then set the heavy slab in place all four of they use they utmost strength then sextus have pour a little water from he hollowed hand on to the slab because he have no oil and have murmur fragment of a ritual as old as rome bidding the god of earth and air and the unseen re-absorb into themselves what man no longer could perceive or cherish or destroy turn to the two slave scylax he say cadmus -- he who be you master be as dead as that man we have bury i be not sextus son of maximus i fare forth like a dead man on a unknown road now be without honor on the lip of man nor have i any claim on you be now a outlaw whom the law would crucify if ill-luck should betray my foot nor can i set you free since all my household doubtless be already confiscate ye belong by law to whomsoever commodus may have appoint to receive my goods do then at you own risk of you own will what seem good to you be slave they kneel he bid they rise we follow you say scylax cadmus murmur assent then the night bear witness sextus turn toward the row of gibbet point at they that be the risk we take together if we escape that you shall not go unrewarded from the fortune i redeem norbanus you accept my leadership norbanus chuckle i insist on it he answer he too point at the row of gibbet to be frighten will provide we with no armor against destiny there be little i have to lose lo i have leave that for the mouse to nibble let we see what destiny can do to bold man lead on sextus iv the governor of rome and antioch dawn be sparkling on the mountain peak the misty violet of half - light creep into the pass and the sun already bath the copper roof of antioch in gleaming gold above a miracle of greenery and marble like a sluggish muddy stream with camel 's head afloat in it the south-bound caravan pour up against the city gate and spread itself to await inspection by the tax-gatherer the governor 's representative and the police there be a tedious procedure of examination hinder by the swarm of gossiper the merchant ' agent smuggler and the man to whom the latest news mean livelihood who stream out of the city gate and mingle with the new-comer from asia bythinium pontus pisidium galatium and cappadocium the caravan guard pile they spear and breakfast apart they duty do they have the air of man to whom the constantly repeat march to and fro on the selfsame stage of a mountainous road have grow displeasing and devoid of all romance two be wound one with a dent in the helmet that hang from he arm by the chin-strap lay lean against a rock refuse food and slowly bleed to death he white face almost comically disappoint a military tribune follow by a slave with tablet and by a mount trooper for the sake of he official dignity ride out from the city and take the report from the guard ' decurion a half-breed dacian-italian black-bearded and taciturn who dictate it to the slave in curt staccato sentence grudging the very gesture that he make toward the wound man the tribune glance at the report sign it turn he horse and ride into the city disregard the decurion 's salute he military cloak a splash of very bright red see against the limestone and above the predominant brown of the camel and coat of they owner he canter he horse when he pass through the gate and there go up a clamor of newsy excitement behind he as group after group loose tongue in competition of exaggeration be bad the news spread swiftly the quadruple line of column all along the corso as the four-mile-long main thoroughfare be call begin to look like pier-pile in a flow tide of man yellow blue red striped and parti-colored costume restless as the flotsam on a mill-race swirl into pattern and break and reblend the long portico of caesar 's bath resound to the hollow hum of voice streaming line of slave in the midst of the street be delay by the crowd and abused for obstruct it gossip go up like the voice of the sea to the cliff and startle cloud of spray-white pigeon faintly edge with pink against a azure sky then cease as suddenly the news be know whatever antioch know bore it nine day ' wonder be depart long ago into the limbo of the day of xerx nine hour have come to be the limit of man 's interest -- nine minute the crucial phase of excitement during which the balance of emotion hover between rioting or laughter antioch grow quiet conscious of the sunny weather and the springtime lassitude that be a luxury to master but that slave must overcome the gang go forth to clear the watercourse in advance of flood whip crack to inspire zeal wagon-load of flower low milk - white oxen white goat -- even a white horse a white ass -- oil and wine in paint cart whose solid wooden wheel scream on they axle like demon in agony-threaded the street to the temple lest the god forget convenience and send the flood too soon the forum -- gilt-edged marble tinted statuary a mosaic pavement like a rich-hued carpet from the loom of babylon -- begin to overflow with leisured man of business they slave do all the worry the money-changer ' clerk sit by the bag of coin with scale and shovel and the table of exchange the chaffering begin in corn-shop where the lawless agreement for delivery of unsown harvest change hand ten time in the hour and bill on rome scrawl over with endorsement outsped currency as well as outwit the revenue man no tax-farmer 's slave could keep track of the flow of intangible wealth when the bill for a million sesterce pass to and fro like card in a egyptian game man richer than the fabled croesus carry all they wealth in leather wallet in the form of mortgage on gang of slave certificate of ownership of cargo promise to pay and contract for delivery of merchandise nine-tenth of all the clamor be the voice of slave each one of they a expert in he master 's business and often richer than the owner of the man he deal with save he peculium -- the personal savings which slave be sometimes encourage to accumulate -- to buy he freedom when a more than usually profitable deal should put he master in a good mood the hall of the basilica be almost as much a place of fashion as the bath of julius caesar except that there be some admit into the basilica whose presence later in the day within the precinct of the bath would have lead to a riot whoever have wealth and could afford to match wit with the sharpest trader in the world might enter the basilica and lounge amid the statuary thither well dress slave come hurry with contract and the news of change price there on marble bench spread with color cushion at the rear under the balcony the richer man of business sit chatter to mask they real thought -- jew alexandrian athenian -- a roman here and there cupidity more frankly write on he face he eye a little harder and less subtle more abrupt in gesture and less patient with delay that be a tale which be all very well for the slave to believe and for the priest if they wish to repeat as for I i be bear in tarsus where no man in he sens believe anything except a bill of sale but i tell you maternus be scourge and then crucify at the place of execution nearest to where he commit he last crime that be where the crossroad lead to daphne there be no doubt about that whatever he be nearly four day die and the sentry stand guard over he until he cease to breathe a little after sunset yesterday evening so they say at all event a little before midnight in daphne near one of those booth where the caterer prepare hot meal a man stride up to where some slave be seat around a fire he burn a piece of parchment all nine slave agree that he be about maternus ' height and build that he stride like a man who have be hurt that he have mud and grass stain on he knee and cover he face with a toga they also swear he say he be maternus and that he be go before they could recover they wit they say he voice be sepulchral one of the slave who can read declare that the word on the parchment he burn be maternus latro and that it be the identical parchment he have see hang from maternus ' neck on the cross they tortured that slave at once of course to get the truth out of he and on the rack he contradict himself at least a dozen time so they whip he and let he go because he owner say he be a valuable cook but the fact remain that the story have not be disprove and there be absolutely no doubt whatever about this : the caravan from asia come in just a little after dawn have travel the last stage by night as usual in order to arrive early and get the formality over with they come past the place of execution before sunrise they have hear the news of the execution from the north-bound caravan that pass they in the mountain they have all be afraid of maternus because he have rob so many wayfarer so naturally they be interested to see he dead body it be go what of it probably the woman take it down for burial robber always have a troupe of woman maternus never have to steal one so they say they flock to he like bacchanalian no matter now listen to this : between the time when they learn of maternus ' execution and they pass the place of execution that be to say at the narrowest part of the pass where it curve and begin to descend on this side of the mountain -- they be attack by robber who make use of maternus ' war-cry the robber be beat off although they wound two man of the guard and get away with half-a-dozen horse and a slave-girl that mean nothing -- pardon I a moment while i see what my man have be do what be it stilchio be you mad you have contract to deliver fifty bale at yesterday 's price you want to ruin I oh you be quite sure very well : a good man that -- go out and meet the caravan -- buy low -- sell high and the price be fall but as i be say you story be simply a string of coincidence all the robber use maternus ' war-cry because of the terror he name inspire they probably have not hear he have be crucify well that be what the caravan folk think until they pass the place of execution and see no body there the robber possibly themselves remove it and be seek to avenge maternus much more likely somebody be bribe to let he escape we all know maternus be scourge for that be do in antioch but they do not scourge he very badly for fear he might die on the way to the place of execution there be no doubt he be crucify but he be only tie not nail it would have be perfectly simple to substitute some other criminal that first night -- somebody who look a little like he they would give the substitute poppy juice to keep he from cry out to passer-by substitution have often be do of course but it take a lot of money and considerable influence to bribe the guard they be under the authority of a centurion who would have to look out for informer and besides you can not persuade I that a man who have be scourge and crucify if only for one day could walk into daphne two or three night afterward and carry on a conversation why should he visit daphne why should he choose that place of all place in the world and midnight to destroy the identification parchment have destroy it why do he then tell the slave who he be it sound like a tale out of egypt to I well the priest be say -- tchutt-tchutt priest say anything nevertheless the priest be say that maternus after he be capture manage to convey a message to he follower command they to offer sacrifice to apollo who accordingly intervene in he behalf and they say he undoubtedly go to daphne to return thanks at the temple threshold hah-hah excellent let we go to the bath you need to sweat the superstition out of you better leave word where we be go so that we factor will know where to find we in case any important business turn up in the palace in the office of the governor where the lapping of water and iris could be hear through the open window pertinax sit face the governor of antioch across a table heap with parchment roll a dozen secretary labor in the next room but the door between be close the only witness be leisurely majestic swan see down a vista of well prune shrubbery that flank the narrow lawn a awning crimson and subdue the sunlight conceal the line on the governor 's face and suggest color on he pale cheek he be a fat man pouch under the eye and grow bald -- a almost total contrast to the lean and active although older pertinax he smile be cynical he mouth curve downward he have large fat hand and cold dark calculate eye i would feel more satisfied he say if i could have norbanus ' evidence find he then pertinax answer irritably what be the matter with you police in rome if i propose to find a man he be bring before I instantly this be not rome say the governor as you would very soon discover if you occupy my office i send a lictor and a dozen man to norbanus ' house but he be miss and have not be see although it be know and you admit that he dine with you last night at daphne he have no property worth mention he house be under lien to money-lender he be well know to have be sextus ' friend and the moment this order arrive proscribe sextus i add to it the name of norbanus in my own handwriting on the principle that treason keep bad company my own well know allegiance to the emperor oblige I to tear out the very root of treason at the first suggestion of its presence in we midst i have long suspect sextus who be a cross-grained obstinate quick-witted proud young man -- a lot too critical i be convince now that he and norbanus be hatch some kind of plot between they -- possibly against the sacred person of we emperor -- a frightful sacrilege -- the suggestion of it make I shudder there be of course no doubt about sextus the emperor 's own proscription brand he as a miscreant unfit to live and he be lucky to have die by accident instead of be tear apart by tong it seem to I unquestionable that norbanus share he guilt and take care to escape before he could be seize and bring to justice what be in doubt most noble pertinax be how you can excuse yourself to we sacred emperor for have let sextus escape from you clutch after you have see that letter how can you excuse yourself for not pounce the letter to be use as evidence against rascally freedmen who forewarn the miscreant sextus about the emperor 's intention -- and for not realize that norbanus be undoubtedly in league with he how can you explain you have let norbanus get away be something i confess i be unable to imagine conjure you imagination pertinax retort i be to inquire into the suitability of antioch or daphne as the site of the olympic game that the emperor propose to preside over in person you can imagine i suppose how profitable that would be for antioch -- and you be i to tell the emperor that robber in the mountain and the laxity of local government make the selection of antioch unwise they stare at each other silently across the table pertinax erect and definite the governor of antioch indefinite and stroke he chin with fat white finger it would be simplest say the governor of antioch at last to have norbanus execute some one should always be execute when the emperor sign proscription list say pertinax have it ever occur to you to wonder how many soldier in the legion in the distant province be certify as dead before they leave rome the governor of antioch smile meanly he resent the suggestion that there might be trick he do not understand i have a prisoner he say who might be norbanus he have be tortured he refuse to identify himself do he look like he that would be difficult to say he break into a jeweler 's and be very badly beat by the slave who slash he face which be heavily bandage he appear to be a roman and be certainly a thief but beyond that -- much depend on who be interested in he pertinax suggest usually a man 's relative -- but the governor of antioch 's fat hand make a disparage careless gesture he have no friend he have be in the carcere -lrb- the cell in which prisoner be keep who have be sentence to death under roman law there be practically no imprisonment for crime fine flog banishment be the substitute for execution -rrb- more than a month i be reserve he for execution by the lion at the next public game truth to tell i have almost forget he i will write out a warrant for norbanus ' execution and it shall be attend to this morning and by the way -- regard the olympic game -- the emperor i think would like to see they hold in antioch say pertinax the merchant stroll to the bath stand curiously for a while to watch one of the rapidly increase sect of christian who lean from a balcony over the street and exhort a polyglot crowd of freedman slave and idler he be beard brown-skinned from exposure brown - robed scrawny vehement peculiar time one merchant say if you and i should cause a crowd to gather while we prate about refusal to do homage to the god -- of whom mind you the emperor be one and not the least -- but let we listen say the other the man 's voice be resonant he use no trick of oratory such as roman over-valued and be not too careful in the choice of phrase the greek idiom he use be unadorned -- the language of the market-place and harbor-front he make he point directly earnestly not argue but like a guide to far-off country give information : slave -- freedman -- master -- all be equal before god and on the last day all shall rise up from the dead -- a loiterer heckle he : hah the crucify too -- what about maternus the preacher throw up he right hand snatch at opportunity : there be two thief crucify one on either hand as i have tell you to the one be say : ` this day shalt thou be with I in paradise ' but to the other nothing nevertheless all shall rise up from the dead on the last day -- you and you friend and the wise and the fool and the slave and the free -- aye and maternus also -- one merchant grin to the other : yet i think it be on the first night that maternus rise up they stiffen if they stay a whole night on the cross if he could walk to daphne three night later he have not be crucify many hour come let we go to the bath before the crowd get there if one be late those insolent attendant lose one 's clothing and there be no chance whatever of get a good soft-handed slave to rub one down do not you hate to be currycomb by a rascal with corn on he finger v rome -- the therma of titus there be even bird to fill the air with music all the known world and the far-away mysterious land of which alexander 's follower have start legend multiply century ago have contribute to rome 's adornment plunder and trade goods drift through in spite of distance the city have become the vortex of the energy virility and vice of east and west -- a glory of marble and gilded cornice of dome and spire of costume habit face language -- of gorgeousness and squalor -- license privilege and rigid formalism -- extravagance -- and of innumerable god there be nobility and love of virtue cheek by jowl with beastliness nor be it always easy to discover which be which but the bird sing blithely in the cage in the portico where the long seat be on which philosopher discourse to any one who care to listen the bath that the emperor titus build be the supreme last touch of all from furnace below-ground where the whip slave sweat in the dark to domed roof where the dove change hue amid the gleam of gold and color glass they typify rome as the city herself be of the essence of the world the approach to the therma of titus be block by litter some heavy enough to be bear by eight match slave and large enough for company woman oftener than man share litter with friend then the troupe of attendant be double slave be in drove flock horde around the building make a motley sight of it in they livery which be adaptation of the every-day costume of almost all the country of the known world under the entrance portico between the double row of marble column sit a throng of fortune-teller of both sex privileged because the aedile of that year have superstitious leaning but as likely as not to be drive away and even whip when the next man should succeed to office in and out among the crowd run tipster tout for gamble den and seller of charm most of they find ready customer among the slave who have nothing to do but wait and stare and yawn until they master come out from the bath they be raw inexperienced slave who have not a coin or two to spend within the entrance of the therma be a marble court where better know philosopher discourse on topic of the day each to he own group of admirer a christian dress like any other roman hold one corner with a crowd around he there be a tremendous undercurrent of reaction against the prevalent cynical materialism and the vortex of fashion be also the cauldron of new aspiration and the battle-ground of wit beyond the inner entrance be the two disrobe room -- woman to the left man to the right where slave whose insolence have grow into a cultivate art exchange the fold garment for a bracelet with a number thence stark-nake through the bronze door set in green - vein marble bather pass into the vast frigidarium whose marble plunge be surround by a mosaic promenade beneath a bronze and marble balcony there man and woman mingle indiscriminately watch the diver converse match wit exchange gossip some walk briskly around the promenade while other lounge on the marble seat that be interspace against the wall between the statue there be not one gesture of indecency a man who have stare at a woman would have be throw out execrate and forever more refuse admission but out in the street where the litter-bearer and attendant while away the time there be tale tell that spread to the end of the earth on a bench of black marble between two statue of the grecian muse pertinax sit talk with bultius livius sub-prefect of the palace they be both pink-skinned from plunge in the pool and the white scar win in frontier war show all the more distinctly boltius livius be a clean-shaven sharp-looking man with a thin-lipped air of keenness this dependence on marcium can easily be overdo he remark he eye move restlessly leave and right he lower he voice nobody know how long she hold over caesar will last she own he at present own he absolutely -- own rome he delight in let she revoke he order it be a form of self-debauchery he do thing purposely to have she overrule he but that have already last longer than i think it would it will last as long as she and she christian spy for he and make life pleasant say pertinax exactly but that be the difficulty livius answer move he eye again restlessly there be not much risk of informer in the therma but a man never know who he enemy be marcium represent the christian and the idiot will not let well enough alone by hercule they have it all they own way thanks to marcia they be allow to hold they meeting all the statute against they be ignore they even go unpunished if they do not salute caesar 's image they be allow to preach against slavery it have get so now that if a man condemn to death pretend he be a christian they be even allow to rescue he out of the carcere that be juno 's truth : i know of a dozen instance but it be the old story : put a beggar on a horse and he will demand you house next there be no satisfy they i be tell they propose to abolish the gladiatorial combat laugh if you like i have it from unquestionable source they intend to begin by abolish the execution of criminal in the arena shades of nero they keep after marcium day and night to dissuade caesar from take part in the spectacles on the theory that he help to make they popular what do they propose to substitute in popular esteem ask pertinax i do not know they be mad enough for anything and they hold over marcium be beyond belief the next thing you 'll know they 'll persuade she it be against religion to be caesar 's mistress they be quite capable of saw off the branch they be sit on by hercule i hope they do it some of we might go down in the scramble but -- do marcia give christian reason to the emperor ask pertinax he forehead puzzle no no no by hercule no no marcium be as skillful at manage commodus as he be at hurl a javelin or drive horse she talk about the dignity of caesar and the glory of rome -- use truth adroitly for she own end -- argue that if he continue to keep company with gladiator and jockey and insist on take part in the combat rome may begin to despise he rome do murmured pertinax he eye and lip suggest a mere flicker of a smile but only let commodus once wake up to the fact and -- bultius livius nod he will return the compliment and show we how to despise at wholesale eh marcium 's life and yours and mine would not be worth a hour 's purchase the problem be who shall warn marcium she grow intolerant of friendly hint i make she a present the other day of eight match german ' litter-bearer -- beauty -- they cost a fortune -- and i take the opportunity to have a chat with she she tell I to go home and try to manage my own wife friendly enough -- she laugh -- she mean no enmity but shrewd though she be and far-seeing though she be the wine of influence be go to she head you know what that portend few man and fewer woman can drink deeply of that wine and -- she come say pertinax there be a stir near the bronze door lead to the woman 's disrobe hall six woman in a group be answer greeting marcium in they midst but no man in the therma look at they a moment longer than be necessary to return the wave of the hand with which marcium greet every one before walk down the step into the plunge she do not even wear the customary bracelet with its number metal disk not even the attendant at the therma would presume to lose the clothing of the mistress of the emperor commodus who at the age of twelve have fling a slave into the furnace because the water be too hot would have make short work of any one who mislay marcium 's apparel she do not belie she reputation it be no wonder that the sculptor claim that every new venus they turn out be marcia 's portrait she beauty as she toe touch water be like that of aphrodite rise from the wave the light from the dome shone golden on she brown hair and she glossy skin she be a thing of sensuous delight incapable of coarseness utterly untouched by the suggestion of vulgarity and yet -- it be strange she should take up with fancy religion say pertinax under he breath she be pagan in every gesture and not a patrician that be indefinable but evident to trained eye neither he who know she intimately nor the newest newly shaven son of a provincial for the first time explore the wonder of rome could have imagine she as anything except a rich man 's mistress she plunge into the pool and swam like a mermaid she companion follow climb out at the farther end where the diving-boards project in tier one above the other and pass through a bronze door into the first of the sweating room evidently conscious of the murmur of comment that follow she but take no overt notice of it who be to be the next to try to reason with she -- you ask boltius livius no not i i have shoot my bolt say pertinax and close he eye as if to shut out something from he memory -- or possibly to banish thought he do not relish there come a definite hard glint into livius 's eye he have a name for be sharper to detect intrigue and its ramification than even the sharp outline of he face would indicate you have hear of she latest indiscretion he ask narrowly watch pertinax there be a robber at large name maternus -- you have hear of he the man appear and disappear some say he be the same maternus who be crucify near antioch at about the time when you be there some say he be not he be report to visit rome in various disguise and to be able to conduct himself so well that he can pass for a patrician some say he have a large band some say hardly any follower some say it be he who rob the emperor 's own mail a month ago he be report to be here there everywhere but there come at last reliable information that he live in a cave in the wood on a estate that fall to the fiscus -lrb- the government department into which all payment be make corresponding roughly to a modern treasury department -rrb- at the time when maximus and he son sextus be proscribe pertinax look bore he yawn i think i will go in and sweat a while he remark not yet let I finish say livius it be report to caesar that the highwayman maternus live in a cave on this aventine estate and that the slave and tenant on the place who of course all pass to the new owner when the estate be sell not only tolerate he but supply he with victuals and news caesar go into one of he usual frenzy curse half the senator by name and order out a cohort from a legion get ready to embark at ostium he order they to lay waste the estate burn all the wood and if necessary torture the slave and tenant until they have maternus dead or alive they be not to dare to come without he and meanwhile the rest of the legion be keep wait at ostium with all the usual nuisance of desertion and drunkenness and what not else everybody know about that say pertinax as governor of rome it be my duty to point out to the emperor the inconvenience of keep that legion wait under arm so near the city i be snub for my pain but i do my duty you duty there be plenty of people more concerned than you say livius look again as if he think he have detect a intrigue there be the ostian authority for instance but i do not hear of they complain naturally not say pertinax suppress irritation every day the legion linger there mean money for the enterprising city father i be oppose to all the petty pouching of commission that go on doubtless be governor of rome you naturally -- i have hear of peculation at the palace pertinax interrupted be that as it may commodus order out the cohort send it march and amuse himself invent new ingenious torment for maternus alternatively he propose to himself to have the cohort slaughter in the arena officer and all if they should fail of they mission so it be safe to wager they be go to bring back some one say to be maternus whether or not they catch the right man commodus be indulge in one of he storm of imperial righteousness he be go to stamp out lawlessness he be go to make it safe for any one to come or go along the roman road oh he be in a fine augustan mood it be not safe for any one but marcium to come within a mile of he scowl -- you know that scowl of he -- it freeze the very sentry on the wall if he look at they back through the window i do not suppose there be a woman in rome just then who would have care to change place with marcium he send for she and half the palace bet she be ripe for banishment to one of those island retreat where crispina -lrb- the wife of commodus who be banish to the isle of caprea and there secretly put to death -rrb- live less than a week but marcium be fertile of surprise she will not surprise I if she outlive commodus -- by hercule she will not surprise I if -- he stare at pertinax with impudently keen eye pertinax look at the bronze door lead to the sweating room shrug himself as if the frigidarium have grow too cool for comfort marcium actually persuade commodus to countermand the order livius say emphasize each word almighty jove can only guess what argument she use but if maternus have be one of she pet christian she could not have save he more successfully commodus send a messenger post-haste that night to recall the cohort and a good thing too pertinax remark it be not a legion 's business to supply cohort to do the work of the district police there be five thousand raw man on the verge of mutiny in ostium -- and -- wait a minute -- and say livius do not go yet -- this be interesting : marcium that same night send a messenger of she own to find maternus and to warn he how do you know pertinax let a sign of nervousness escape he in the palace those of we who value we life and we fortune make it a business to know what go on livius answer with a dry laugh just as you take care to know what go on in the city pertinax the older man look worry do you mean it be common gossip in the palace he demand you be the first man i have speak with there be therefore only three who know if you count the slave whom marcia employ four if you count marcium i have the great good luck not long ago to catch that slave in flagrante delicto -- never mind what he be do that be another story altogether -- and he give I a insight into a number of useful secret the point be that particular slave take care not to run errand nowadays without inform I there be not much that marcium do that i do not know about livius ' eye suggest gimlet bore hole into pertinax 's face not a change of the other 's expression escape he pertinax cover he mouth with he hand pretend to yawn he slap he thigh to suggest that he involuntary shudder be due to have sit too long but he do not deceive livius it be know to I say livius that you and marcium be in each other 's confidence that make I doubt you other information pertinax retort no man can jump to such a ridiculous conclusion and call it knowledge without make I doubt he on all point you bear I livius i have important business wait i must make haste into the sweating room and get that over with but livius ' sharp nervous laugh arrest he not yet friend pertinax let rome wait rome 's affair will outlive both of we i suspect you intend to tell marcium to have my name include in the next proscription list but i be not quite such a simpleton as that sit down and listen i have proof that you plot with the governor of antioch to have a unknown criminal execute in place of a certain norbanus who escape with you connivance and have since become a follower of the highwayman maternus that involve you rather seriously do not it you see i make sure of my fact before approach you and now -- admit that i approach you tactfully come pertinax i make no threat until you let I see i be in danger i admire you i regard you as a brave and a honorable roman i propose that you and i shall understand each other you must take I into confidence or i must take step to protect myself there be a long pause while a group of man and woman come and chatter near by laugh while one of the man try to win a wager by climb a marble pillar pertinax frown livius do he best to look dependable and friendly but he eye be not those of a boon companion you be incapable of loyalty to any one except yourself say pertinax at last what pledge do you propose to offer I a white bull to jupiter capitolinus i be willing to go with you to the temple of jupiter capitolinus and to swear on the altar whatever solemn oath you wish pertinax smile cynically the man who slew julius caesar be under oath to he he remark most solemn oath they swear then turn on one another like a pack of wolf octavian and anthony be under oath and how long do that last my first claim to renown be base on have rewon the allegiance of we troops in britain who have break the most solemn oath a man can take -- of loyalty to rome a oath bind nobody it simply be a emphasis of what a man intend that minute it express a emotion i believe the god smile when they hear man pledge themselves i personally who be far less than a god and far less capable of read man 's mind never trust a man unless i like he or unless he give I pledge that make doubt impossible then you do not like I ask livius i would like you better if i know that i could trust you you shall pertinax bring witness i will commit myself before you witness to do my part in -- he restless eye glance right and leave then he lower he voice -- in bring about the political change you contemplate let we go to the sweating room pertinax answer keep near I i will think this matter over if i see you hold speech not audible to I with any one -- i be already pledge you may depend on I say livius i trust you more because you use caution come vi the emperor commodus the imperial palace be a maze of splendor such as babylon have never see it have its own great aqueduct to carry water for its fountain for the garden and for the imperial bath that be as magnificent if not so large as the therma of titus palace after palace have be wreck remodel and include in the whole under the succeed emperor until the imperial quarter on the palatine have grow into a city within a city there be barracks for the praetorian guard that lack not much of be a fortress room and stairway for the countless slave be like honeycomb cell in the dark foundation there be underground passage some of they secret some notorious connect wing with wing and there be one for the emperor 's private use that lead to the great arena where the game be hold so that he might come and go with less risk of assassination even temple have be take over and include within the surround wall to make room for the ever-multiplying suite of state apartment as each caesar strove to outdo the magnificence of he predecessor oriental marble gold-leaf exotic tree silk awning fountain the majestic figure of the guard the bronze door and the huge height of the building awed even the roman who be use to they the throne-room be a place of such magnificence that it be say that even caesar himself feel small in it the foreign king ambassador and roman citizen admit there to audience be discipline without the slightest difficulty there be no unseemliness no haste no crowd horribly uncomfortable in the heavy toga that court etiquette prescribe remind of they dignity by colossal statue of the noblest roman of antiquity and usher by magnificently uniformed past master of the art of ceremony all who enter feel that they be insignificant intruder into a golden mystery the palace prefect in he cloak of cloth of gold with he ivory wand of office seem a high priest of eternity subprefect stand in the marble antechamber to examine visitor ' credentials and see that none pass in improperly attire be keeper of olympus the gilded marble throne be on a dais approach by marble step beneath a balcony to which a stair ascend from behind a carve screen trumpet announce the approach of caesar who could enter unobserved through a door at the side of the dais from the moment that the trumpet sound and the guard grow as rigid as the basalt statue in the niche of the columned wall it be a punishable crime to speak or even to move until caesar appear and be seat nor be caesar himself a anticlimax even nero nerveless in he latter day when self-will and debauchery have pouch he eye and stomach have possess the roman gift of stand like a god vespasian and titus each in turn be mar personify aurelius have typify a gentler phase of rome a subtler dignity but even he whose worst severity be temper by the philosophical regret that he could not kill crime with kindliness have wear the imperial purple like olympus ' delegate commodus in the minute that he spare from he amusement to accept the glamor of the throne be perfect handsomest of all the caesar he could act he part with such consummate majesty that man who know he intimately half-believe he be a hero after all athletic muscular and systematically train he vigor that be purely physical pass readily for spiritual quality within that golden hall where the resource of the world be all put under tribute to provide a royal setting he emerge he smile as if the sun shine he observe the rolled petition greeting testimonial of flattery from private citizen and address of adulation from distant city be heap into a gilded basket as the silent throng file by beneath he he nod now and then he scowl he irritation grow as the minute pass at each gesture of impatience the subprefect quietly impel the crowd to quicker movement but at the end of fifteen minute commodus grow tired of dignity and he ferocious scowl cloud he face like a thunderstorm be i to sit here while the whole world make itself ridiculous by stare at I he demand in a harsh voice it be loud enough to fill the throne-room but none know whether it be mean for a aside or not and none dare answer he the crowd continue flow by each raise he right hand and bow as he reach the square of carpet that be place exactly in front of caesar 's throne commodus rise to he foot all movement cease then and there be utter silence for a moment he stand scowl at the crowd one hand rest on the golden lion 's head that flank the throne

thrust she away from he and go growl like a bear into he own apartment where he voice could be hear cursing the attendant whose dangerous duty it be to divine in a instant what clothes he would wear and to help he into they he come out naked through the door see marcium talk to narcissus laugh and disappear again marcium raise she voice : telamonion oh telamonion a curly-headed greek boy hardly eight year old come run from the outer corridor -- all laughter -- one of those spoil favorite of fortune whom it be the fashion to keep as pet they usefulness consist mainly in retention of they innocence telamonion go in and play with he go in and make he laugh he be bad temper confident of everybody 's good-will the child vanish through the curtain where commodus roar he a greet marcium continue talk to narcissus in a low voice when do you see sextus last she ask but yesterday and what have he do do you say tell I that again he have find out the chief of the party of lucius septimius severus he have also discover the leader of pescennius niger 's party he say too there be a smaller group that look toward clodius albinus who command the troops in britain do he tell you name no he say he know i would tell you and you might tell commodus who would write all the name on he proscription list sextus i tell you reckon he own life nothing but he be extremely careful for he friend it would be easy to set a trap and catch he he be insolent he have have too much rein say marcium but what would be the use narcissus answer there would be norbanus too to reckon with each play into the other 's hand each know the other 's secret kill one and there remain the other -- doubly dangerous because alarmed they take turn to visit rome the other remain in hide with they following of freedman and educate slave they only commit just enough robbery to gain themselves a enviable reputation on the countryside they visit they friend in rome in various disguise and they travel all over italy to plot with the adherent of this faction or the other sextus favor pertinax -- say he would make a respectable emperor -- another marcus aurelius but pertinax know next to nothing of sextus ' doings although he protect sextus as far as he can and see he now and then sextus ' plan be to keep all three rival faction by the ear so that if anything should happen -- he nod toward the curtain from behind which come the sound of childish laughter and the crash voice of commodus encourage in some piece of mischief -- they would be all at odds and pertinax could seize the throne i wonder whether i be mad that i protected sextus exclaim marcium he have serve we well if i have let they catch and crucify he as maternus we would have have no one to keep we inform of all these cross-conspiracy but be you sure he favor pertinax quite sure he even risk a interview with flavium titiana to implore she influence with she husband sextus would be all for striking now this instant he have assure himself that the world be tire of commodus and that no faction be strong enough to stand in the way of pertinax but he know how difficult it will be to persuade pertinax to assert himself pertinax will not hear of murder caesar he say : ` let we see what happen -- if the fate intend I to be caesar let the fate show how ' aye that be pertinax say marcium why be it that the honest man be all such delayer as for I i will save my commodus if he will let I if not the praetorian guard shall put pertinax on the throne before any other faction have a chance to move otherwise we all die -- all of we severus -- pescennius niger -- clodius albinus -- any of the other would include we in a general proscription pertinax be friendly he protect he friend he be the safest man in all way let pertinax be acclaimed by all the praetorian guard and the senate would accept he eagerly enough they would feel sure of he mildness pertinax would do no wholesale murder to wipe out opposition he would try to pacify opponent by the institution of reform and decent government you must beware you be not forestall narcissus warn she sextus tell I there be more than one man ready to slay commodus at the first chance severus pescennius niger and clodius albinus keep themselves inform as to what be go on they messenger be in constant movement if commodus should lift a hand against either of those three that would be the signal for civil war all three would march on rome caesar be much more likely to learn of the plot through he own informer and to try to terrify the general by kill they supporter here in rome say marcium what do sextus intend to kill caesar himself narcissus nod well when sextus think that time have come you kill he let that be you task we must save the life of commodus as long as possible when nothing further can be do we must involve pertinax so that he will not dare to back out it be he you know who persuade I to save maternus the highwayman 's life it be he who tell I maternus be really sextus son of maximus he knowledge of that secret give I a certain hold on pertinax caesar would have he head off at a word from I but the best way with pertinax be to stroke the honest side of he -- the charcoal-burner side of he -- the peasant side if that can be do without make he too diffident he be perfectly capable of offer the throne to some one else at the last minute a step sound on the other side of the curtain caesar narcissus whisper as excuse for be see in conversation with she he begin to show she a charm against all kind of treachery that he have buy from a egyptian she snatch it from he caesar she exclaim bound toward commodus and standing in he way not even she dare lay a hand on he when he be in that volcanic mood as you love I will you wear this for love of you what have i not do he retort smile at she what now she advance another half-step but no nearer there be laughter on he lip but in he eye cold cruelty my caesar wear it it protect against conspiracy he show she a new sword that he have gird on along with the short tunic of a gladiator against the bellyache use galen 's pill but this be the right medicine against conspiracy he answer then he take the little golden charm into he left hand toss it on he palm and look at she still smile where do you get this bauble not i one of those magician who frequent that forum sell it to narcissus bah he fling it through the window who be the magician name he i will have he throw into the carcere we 'll see whether the charm he sell so cheap be any good or be he a christian he ask sneer the christian you know do not approve of charm marcium answer by jupiter there be not much that they do approve of he retort i begin to weary of you christian i begin to think nero be right and my father too there be a wisdom in treat christian as vermin it might not be a bad thing marcium to warn you christian to procure themselves a charm or two against my weariness of they perpetual effort to govern I the christian i suppose have be tell you to keep I out of the arena hence this live statuary in the corridor and all this talk about the dignity of rome tscharr-rrh there be more dignity about one gladiator 's death than in all rome outside the arena woman you forget you be only a woman i remember that i be a god i have the blood of caesar in my vein and like the unseen god i take my pleasure watch man and woman die i loose my javelin like thunderbolt -- like jupiter himself like hercule -- he pause he notice marcium be laugh only she in all the roman empire dare to mock he when he boast not even she know why he let she do it he begin to smile again the frightful frown that ride over he eye disperse leave he forehead as smooth as marble if i should marry you and make you empress he say how long do you think i should last after that you be clever enough to rule the fool who squawk and jabber in the senate and the forum you be beautiful enough to start another siege of troy but remember : you be caesar 's concubine not empress just remember that will you when i find a woman lovelier than you and wiser i will give you and you christian a taste of nero 's policy now -- do you love I if i do not could i stand before you and receive these insult she retort trust to the inspiration of the moment for she have no method with he i would willingly die she say if you would give the love you have bestow on I to rome instead and use you godlike energy in ruling wisely rather than in kill man and win chariot race one marcium do not matter much one commodus can -- can love he marcium he interrupt with a high-pitched laugh he seize she nearly crush out she breath a caius and a caia we have be by jupiter if not for you and paulus i would have leave rome long ago to march in alexander 's wake i would have carve I a new empire that do not stink so of politician he stride into the anteroom where all the gladiator wait and narcissus have to follow he -- well name enough for he be lithe and muscular and beautiful but nonetheless though taller not to be compare with commodus -- even as the woman choose for they good look and intelligence who hasten to reappear the moment the emperor 's back be turn be nothing like so beautiful as marcium in all the known world there be no two finer specimen of human shapeliness than the tyrant who rule and the woman whose wit and daring have so long preserved he from he enemy come to the arena he call back to she come and see how hercule throw javelin from a chariot at full pelt but marcium do not answer and he forget she almost before he reach the entrance of the private tunnel through which he pass to the arena she have more accurately aim and nicely balanced work to do than even commodus could do with javelin against a living target vii marcium in everything but title and security of tenure marcium be empress of the world and she have what empress most often lack -- the common touch she have be bear in slavery she have ascend step by step to fortune by she own wit learn by experience each layer of society be know to she -- its virtue prejudice limitation and peculiar trick of thought be almost incredibly beautiful she have learn very early in life that the desire -lrb- not always the desirable -rrb- be powerful to sway man the possess begin to lose its sway the habit of possession easily succumb to boredom and then power cease even commodus accordingly have never own she in the sense that man own slave she have reserve to herself self-mastery which call for cunning courage and a certain ruthlessness albeit temper by a reckless generosity she see life skeptically undeceived by the fawn flattery that rome serve up to she enjoy it as a cat like be stroke they say of she that she sleep with one eye open livius have complain in the therma to pertinax that the wine of influence be go to marcium 's head but he merely express the opinion of one man who would have like to feel himself superior to she and to use she for he own end she be not deceive by livius or by anybody else she know that livius be keep watch on she and how he do it have shrewdly guess that a present of eight match litter - bearer be too extravagant not to mask ulterior design she watch he much more artfully than he watch she she secret knowledge that he know she secret be more dangerous to he than anything that he have find out could be dangerous to she the eight match litter-bearer wait with the gilded litter near a flight of marble step that descend from the door of marcium 's apartment in the palace to a sunlit garden with a fountain in the midst there be a crowd of servant and four syrian eunuch sleek offensive menial in yellow robe two lictor besides with fasce and the roman civic uniform -- a scandalous abuse of ancient ceremony -- ready to conduct a progress through the city but they all yawn marcium and she usual companion do not come there be delay -- and gossip naturally a yawning eunuch rearrange the bowknot of he girdle what do she want with livius he usually get send for when somebody need punish who do you suppose have fall foul of she himself he send she messenger back with word he be engage on palace business i hear she tell the slave to go again and not return without he bacchus but it would not worry I if livius should lose he head for a aristocrat he have more than he share of undignified curiosity -- forever poke he sharp nose into other people 's business marcium may have find he out let 's hope at the foot of the marble stairway in the hall below marcium 's apartment livius stand remonstrate grow nervous marcium dress in the dignified robe of a roman matron that conceal even she ankle and suggest the demure self-conscious rectitude of olden time keep touch he breast with she ivory fan he flinch from the touch subdue irritation if the question be what i want with you livius the answer be that i invite you order you litter bring but marcia i be subprefect i be responsible to -- do you hear but if you will tell where we be go i might feel justified in neglect the palace business i assure you i have important work to do there be plenty who can attend to it say marcium the most important thing in you life livius be my good-will you be delay I livius glare at caia poppeia the lady-in-waiting who be smile stand a little behind marcium he hope she would take the hint and withdraw out of earshot but she have have instruction and come half a step closer will you let I go back to my office and -- no answer marcium he yield with a nervous gesture that implore she not to make a indiscretion a subprefect in the nature of he call have too many enemy to relish repetition in the palace precinct of a threat from marcium however baseless it might be and besides it might be something serious that almost have escape she lip untrue or true it would be know all over the palace in a hour within the day all rome would know of it there be two slave by the front door two more on the last step of the stair i will come of course he say i be delighted i be honor i be fortunate she nod she send one of she own slave to order he private litter bring while livius attempt to look comfortable cudgel he brain to know what mischief she have find out it be nothing unusual that he litter should follow hers through the street of rome in fact it be a honor covet by all official of the palace that fall to he share rather frequently because of he distinguished air of a latter-day man of the world and he intimate knowledge of everybody 's business and ancestry he be often order to go with she at a moment 's notice but this be the first time she have refuse to say where they be go or why and there be a hint of malice in she smile that make he blood run cold he be a connoisseur of malice marcium lean on he arm as she go down the step to she litter she permit he to help she in but then while she companion be follow through the silken curtain she lean out at the farther side and whisper to the nearest eunuch livius climb into he own gilt vehicle and lift shoulder-high by eight numidian become aware that marcium 's eunuch have be tell to keep a eye on he two yellow - robed insufferably impudent inquisitor stride in among he own attendant a escort of twenty praetorian guard and a decurion be wait at the gate to take its place between the lictor and marcium 's litter but that do not in any way increase livius ' sense of security the praetorian guard regard marcium as the source of its illegal privilege it look to she far more than to the emperor for favor buy they with lawless loyalty to she she ruin discipline by she support of every plea for increase perquisite no outraged citizen have any hope of redress so long as marcium 's ear could be reach -lrb- although commodus get the blame for it -rrb- it be the key to marcium 's system of insurance against unforeseen contingency the only regularly drill and arm troops in the city be as loyal to she secretly and openly as livius himself be to the principle of cynical self-help he begin to feel thoroughly frighten as he tell himself that the escort and they decurion would swear to any statement marcium might make if she have learn that he be in the habit of receive secret information from she slave there be a thousand way she might take to avenge herself a very simple way would be to charge he with improper overture and have he kill by the praetorian -- a way that might particularly interest she since it would presumably increase she reputation for constancy to commodus the eunuch watch he the lictor and praetorian clear the way so there be no convenient halt that could enable he to slip unnoticed through the crowd he own attendant seem to have divine that there be something ominous about the journey and he be not the kind of man whose servant be devotedly attach to he he know it he notice sullenness already in the answer he servant give he through the litter curtain when he ask whether the man know they destination none know all i know be we must follow marcia the slave 's voice be almost patronize livius make up he mind if he should live the day out to sell the rascal to some farmer who would teach he with a whip what service mean but he say nothing he prefer to spring surprise only hope he himself might not be overwhelm in one by the time they reach cornificium 's house he be in such a state of nervousness and so blanch that he have to summon he servant into the litter to rub cosmetic on he cheek he take one of galen 's famous strychnine pill before he could prevent he limb from tremble even so when he roll out of the litter and advance with he courtliest bow to escort marcium into the house she recognize he fear and mock he : you be bilious or have some handsomer adoni win you venus from you be it jealousy he pretend that the litter-bearer need whipping for have shake he it make he more than ever ill at ease that she should mock he before all the slave who group themselves in cornificium 's forecourt hers be one of those house set back from the street combine a air of seclusion with such elegance as could not possibly escape the notice of the passer-by the forecourt be adorn with statuary and the gate leave wide afford a glimpse of sunlit greenery and marble that entirely change the aspect of the narrow street there be never less than twenty tradesman at the gate implore opportunity to show they wares which be in basket and box with slave squat beside they all rome would know within the hour that marcium have call on cornificium and that livius the subprefect have be mock by marcium in public a small crowd gather to watch the picturesque ceremony of reception -- cornificium 's house steward marshal he staff the brightly color costume blend in the sunlight with the hue of flower and the rich soft sheen of marble in the shadow of tall cypress the praetorian have to form a cordon in front of the gate and the street become choke by the impede traffic rome love pageantry it fill its eye before its belly which be nine-tenth of the secret of the caesar 's power within the house however there be almost a stoical calm -- a sensation of cloistered chastity produce by the restraint of ornament and the subdue light on gloriously paint fresco represent evening benediction at a temple altar a gathering of the muse sacrifice before a shrine of aesculapius and jason 's voyage to colchi for the golden fleece the inner court where cornificium receive she guest be like a sanctuary dedicate to the decency its one extravagance the almost ostentatious restfulness accentuate by the cooing of white pigeon and the drip and splash of water in the fountain in the midst the dignity of drama be the essence of all roman ceremony the formality of greet be observe as elegantly and with far more evident sincerity in cornificium 's house than in caesar 's palace cornificium dress in white and wear very little jewelry receive she guest more like a old-time patrician matron than a notorious modern concubine she notoriety in fact be due to flavium titiana rather than to any indiscretion of she own to justify she infidelity which be a byword pertinax ' lawful wife go to ingenious length to blacken cornificium 's reputation regale all society with she invent tale about the lewd attraction cornificium stage to keep pertinax hold in she toil that cornificium do exercise a sway over the governor of rome be undeniable he worship she and make no secret of it but she hold he by a method diametrically contrary to that which rumor stir by flavium titiana indicate cornificium 's house be a place where he could lay aside the feverish activity of public life and revel in the intellectual and philosophical amusement that he genuinely love but livius loathe she among other thing he suspect she of be in league with marcium to protect the christian to he she represent the idealism that he cynicism bitterly reject the mere fact of she unshakable fidelity to pertinax be a offense in he eye she present what he consider a impudent pose of morality more impudent because it be sustain he might have like she well enough if she have be a hypocrite complaisant to himself she understand he perfectly -- better in fact than she understand marcium whose visit usually lead to intricate entanglement for pertinax when she have send the slave away and they four lay at ease on couch in the shade of three exotic potted palm she turn she back toward livius suspect he would bring he motive to the surface if she give he time whereas marcium would hide hers and employ a dozen artifice to make they undiscoverable you have not bring livius because you think he love I she say laughing nor have you come my marcium for nothing since you might have send for I and save yourself trouble i anticipate intrigue what plot have you discover now be pertinax its victim you can always interest I if you talk of pertinax we will talk of livius say marcium lean on he elbow livius glare at caia poppeia marcium 's companion he cough to draw attention to she but marcia refuse to take the hint livius have information for we she remark livius rise from the couch and come and stand before she knit he finger together behind he back compelling himself to smile he pallor make the hastily apply cosmetic look ridiculous marcium he say you make it obvious that you suspect I of some indiscretion never she retort mock you indiscreet who would believe it give we a example of discretion you be paris in the presence of three goddess select you destiny he smile attempt to regain he normal air of tolerant importance -- glance about he -- see the sunlight make iridescent pool of fire within a crystal ball set on the fountain 's edge -- take up the ball and bring it to she hold it in both hand what choice be there than that which pari make he ask kneel on one knee laugh venus rule man 's heart she must prevail so into you most lovely hand i give my destiny you mean you leave it there say marcium could you ever afford to ignore I and intrigue behind my back i be the least intriguing person of you acquaintance marcium he answer rise because the hard mosaic pavement hurt he knee and the position make he feel undignified but more than dignity he love discretion he wish there be eye in the back of he head to see whether slave be watch from the curtained window open on the inner court it be my policy he go on to know much and say little to observe much and do nothing i be much too lazy for intrigue which be hard work judge by what i have see of those who indulge in it be that why you sacrifice a white bull recently ask marcia livius glance at cornificium but she patrician face give no hint caia poppeia 's be less under control for she be younger and have nothing to conceal she be inquisitively enjoy the entertainment and evidently do not know what be come i sacrifice a white bull to jupiter capitolinus as be customary to confirm a sacred oath he answer very well suppose you break the oath say marcium he manage to look scandalize -- then chuckle foolishly remember what pertinax have say about the value of a oath but he own dignity oblige he to protest i be not one of you christian he answer stiffen himself i be old-fashioned enough to hold that a oath make at the altar of we roman jupiter be sacred and inviolable when you take you oath of office you swear to be in all thing true to caesar marcium retort do you prefer to tell caesar how true you have be to that oath which oath hold the first one or the second i could ask to be release from the second one say livius if you will give I time -- marcium 's laugh interrupt he it be soft melodious like wavelet on a calm sea hint unseen reef time she say be all that death need death do not wait on oath it come to we i wish to know just how far i can trust you livius nine roman noble out of ten in livius ' position would have recognize at once the deadliness of the alternative she offer and preserve something of the shred of pride would have accept suicide as preferable livius have no such stamen he seize the other horn of the dilemma i perceive pertinax have betray I he sneer look sharply at cornificium but she be watch marcium and do not seem conscious of he glance if pertinax have break he oath mine no longer bind I this be the fact then : i discover how he help sextus son of maximus to avoid execution by a ruse make believe to be kill pertinax be also privy to the execution of a unknown thief in place of norbanus a friend of sextus also implicate in conspiracy pertinax have be secretly negotiate with sextus ever since sextus now call himself maternus and be notorious as a highwayman what else do you know about maternus marcium inquire there be a trace at last of sharpness in she voice a hint convey itself that she could summon the praetorian if he do not answer swiftly he plot against caesar you know too little or too much say marcium what else he close he lip tight i know nothing else have you have any dealings with sextus never he be shift now from one foot to the other hardly noticeably but enough to make marcium smile shall we hear what sextus have to say to that ask cornificium so confidently that there be no doubt marcium have give she the signal marcium move she melting lazy laughing eye and cornificium clap she hand a slave come bring the astrologer sextus must have be listen he appear so instantly he stand with fold arm confront they he weathered face in sunlight pigment be not need to produce the healthy bronze hue of he skin he curly hair bind by a fillet be unruly from the outdoor life he have be lead the strong sinew of he arm and leg belie the ease of he pretended calling and the starry cloak he wear be laughable in its failure to disguise the man of action he salute the three woman with a gesture of the raise right hand that no man unaccustomed to the use of arm could imitate then turn slightly toward livius acknowledge he nod with a humorous grin so we meet again bultius livius again ask marcia why yes i meet he in the house of pertinax it be three day since we speak together three or be it four livius i have be busy i forget can livius have lie ask marcia she seem to be

roman law -rrb- you she laugh you understand I he recover something of he self-possession a wave of virility return high living and the feverish excitement of the palace regime have ruin he nerve but there be trace still of he original astuteness he resume he air of dignity pardon I he say i have be overwork of late i must see galen about this jumpiness when i say i understand you i mean i realize that you be joke naturally you would not receive a highwayman in cornificium 's house and at the same time accuse I of treason pray excuse my outburst -- set it to the score of ill-health i will see galen you shall see he now laugh marcium and cornificium clap she hand less suddenly than sextus have appear because he age be begin to tell on he galen enter the court through a door behind the palm - tree and stand smile make he old-world slow salute to marcia he bright eye move alertly amid wrinkle he look something like the statue of the elder cato only with a kindlier humor and less obstinacy at the corner of the mouth two slave bring out a couch for he and vanish when he have take he ease on it after fuss a little because the sun be in he eye my trade be to oppose death diplomatically he remark i be a poor diplomatist i only gain a little here and there death win inevitably nevertheless they only summon I for consultation when they hope to gain a year or two for somebody marcium unless you let bultius livius use that couch he will swoon i warn you the man 's heart be weak he have more brain than heart he add how be we astrologer he greet sextus with a wrinkled grin and beckon he to share he couch sextus sit down and begin chafe the old doctor 's leg marcia take she time about let livius be seat you hear galen she ask we be here to cheat death diplomatically whose death livius demand rome 's say marcia she eye intently on he face if rome should split in three part it would fall asunder none but commodus can save we from a civil war we be here to learn what bultius livius can do to preserve the life of commodus livius ' face grotesque already with its hastily smear carmine assume new bewilderment i have see man tortured who be less ready to betray themselves say galen give he wine -- strong wine that be my advice but marcium prefer she victim thoroughly subject fill you eye with sunlight livius breathe deep you look and breathe you last unless you satisfy I this astrologer who be not sextus -- mark that i have say he be not sextus galen certify to sextus ' death and there be twenty other witness nor be he maternus the highwayman maternus be crucify that other maternus who be rumor to live in the aventine hill be a imaginary person -- a mere name use by runaway who take to robbery this astrologer i say report that you know all the secret of the

price be satisfactory if you own skin and perquisite be safe you be as crafty a spy as any rat in the palace cellar you have keep yourself inform in order to get the pickings when you see at last which side to take careful very clever of you livius but have you ever see a eagle rob a fish-hawk of its catch why waste time cornificia ask impatiently he force himself on pertinax who should have have he murder only pertinax be too indifferent to he own -- too philosophical correct galen then caia poppeia speak up in a young hard voice that have none of marcium 's honeyed charm no doubt of she be possible she could be cruel for the sake of cruelty and loyal for the sake of pride she beauty be a mere means to a end -- the end intrigue for the impassionate excitement of it she be straight-lipped with a smile that flicker and a hard light in she blue eye it be i who learn you spy on marcium i know too that you keep a spy in britain -- one in gaul another in severus ' camp i read the last nine letter they send you i show they to marcia i keep one marcium add it come yesterday it compromise you beyond -- i yield say livius he knee begin to look weak to whom to I ask sextus stand up abruptly and confront he with fold arm who steal the list i send to pertinax of name of the important man who be intriguing for severus and for pescennius niger and for clodius albinus who know livius shrug he shoulder none know of that list but you say sextus you hear I speak of it to pertinax you hear I promise i would send it to he none but you and he and i know who the messenger would be where be the messenger in the sewer probably say marcium the list be more important if it be not in the sewer too say livius snatching at a straw by hercule i know nothing of a list then you shall drown with sextus ' slave in the cloaca maximum the great sewer of rome say marcium not that i need the list i know what name be write on it but if it should have fall into caesar 's hand -- she shudder act horror perfectly and livius like a drown man who think he see the shore strike out and sink you threaten I but i be no such fool as you imagine i know all about you i perceive you have cross you rubicon well -- summon the decurion and two man marcium interrupted glancing at cornificium but she make a gesture with she hand that cornificium interpret to mean do nothing of the kind livius do not see the gesture rage shame terror overwhelm he and he blurt out the information marcium be seek -- hurl it at she in the form of silly useless threat : you wanton you can kill I but my journal be in safe hand harm I -- cause I to be miss from the palace for a few hour and they may light you funeral fire my journal with the name of the conspirator and all the detail of you daily intriguing go straight into caesar 's hand the climax he expect fail there be no excitement nobody seem astonished marcium settle herself more comfortably on the couch and galen begin whisper to sextus the two other woman look amuse reaction sweep over he he sens reel and livius step backward staggering to the fountain where he sit down bona dea but the man take time to tell he secret marcium exclaim popeium you have better take my litter to the palace and bring that minx cornelium i suspect it be she but be not sure of it do not give she a inkling of what you know go with she to she apartment and watch she dress then make a excuse to keep she waiting in you room while you go back and search hers have help if you need it take two of my eunuch but watch that they do not read the journal look under she mattress look everywhere if you can not find the journal bring cornelium without it i will soon make she tell we where it be viii narcissus a gladiator 's life be not so bad if he behave himself and while it last narcissus say he be sit beside sextus son of maximus in the ergastulum beneath the training school of bruttius marius which be well know to be the emperor 's establishment although maintain in the name of a citizen there be a stone seat at the end where sunlight pour through a bar window high up in the wall to right and leave face a central corridor be cell with door of latticed iron each cell have its own bar window hardly a foot square set high out of reach and the light pierce the latticed door make criss-cross pattern on the white wall of the corridor narcissus get up glance into each cell and sit down again beside sextus the trouble be they do not he go on if you let they out they drink and get into poor condition and if you keep they in they kill themselves unless they be watch these man be reserve for paulus and they know they have not a chance against he paulus ' luck will not last forever sextus remark grimly no nor he skill i suppose but he do not debauch himself so he be always in perfect condition have not you a man in here who might be make nervy enough to kill he sextus ask they would kill the man himself of course directly afterward but we might undertake to enrich he relative narcissus shake he head one might have a chance with the sword or with the net and trident though i doubt it but paulus use a javelin and he aim be like lightning only yesterday at practice they loose eleven lion at he from eleven direction at the same moment he slew they with eleven javelin and each one stone dead some of these man see he do it which have not encourage they i can tell you in the second place they know paulus be commodus he might just as well go into the arena frankly as the emperor for all the secret it be that substitute who occupy the royal pavilion when commodus himself be in the arena no longer look very much like he he be get too loose under the chin although a year ago you could hardly tell the two apart even the mob know paulus be commodus although nobody dare to acclaim he openly send a gladiator in against another gladiator and even though he may know that the other man can split a stick at twenty yard he will do he best but let he know he go against the emperor and he have no nerve to start with he can not aim straight he suspect he own three javelin and he shield and helmet have be tamper with i myself would be afraid to face paulus be not much good with the javelin in any case besides be superstitious about kill emperor who be god not man or the senate and priest would not say so it be the same in the race : set aside caesar 's skill which be simply phenomenal the other charioteer be all afraid of he if he be not kill soon severus or one of the other will forestall we all say sextus pertinax have only one chance : to be on the throne before the other candidate know what be happen narcissus ' bronze face light with a sudden smile that ripple all around the corner of he mouth so that he look like a genial satyr speaking of kill he say marcium have order I to kill you the moment you make up you mind the time have come to strike you promise she of course no as it happen we be interrupted but she rely on I and if she ever begin to suspect I i would rather die in the arena than be rack and burn why not then how be this for a proposal sextus touch he on the shoulder substitute yourself and I for two of these man send I in against he first if he kill I you next one of we might get he i be lucky i believe the god be interested in I i have have so many escape from death i have not much faith in the god say narcissus they may be all like commodus i hear galen say that man create god in they own image sextus smile at he you have be listen i suppose to marcia and she christian listen yes but i do not lean either way it do not seem to I that christianity can do much for a man when javelin be in the air and besides to be frank with you sextus i rather hope to make a little something for myself god though he be say to be i would like to see commodus kill for i loathe he but i hope to survive he and obtain my freedom pertinax would manumit I that be why i apply for the post of trainer in this beastly ergastulum it be bad enough to have to endure the gloom of man virtually condemn to death and look for a chance to kill themselves but it be better than tread the sand to have one 's liver split one 's throat cut and be drag out with the hook i have fight many a fight but i like each one less than the last he get up and stride again along the corridor glance into the cell where gladiator sit fetter to the wall this whole business be get too confuse for I he grumble sit down again you want to kill commodus as be reasonable marcium have order I to kill you which be unreasonable yet for the present she protect you why she know you be commodus ' enemy she seem anxious to save commodus yet she encourage pertinax who do not want to be emperor he only dally with the thought because marcium help cornificium to persuade he be not that a confusion for you and now there be bultius livius as i understand it marcium catch he spy on she no woman in she sens would trust livius the man have snowbroth in he vein and slow fire in he head yet marcia now heap favor on he that be my do say sextus be you mad then too maybe i have persuade marcium that now she have possession of the journal livius be keep she can henceforth hold that over he and use he to advantage she can win he gratitude -- he have none -- and at the same time hold over he the threat of exposure for connection with the severus faction and the pescennius faction and the clodius albinus faction he have it all down in he journal he can easily be involve in those conspiracy if marcium be not satisfy with he spy in she behalf geminus the man will break down under the strain he have no stamen he will denounce we all let we hope so sextus answer i be count on it nothing but sudden danger will ever bring pertinax up to the mark i give a bond to marcia for livius ' life jupiter what kind of bond and what have come over marcium that she accept it i guarantee to she that i will not denounce herself to commodus she see the point she could never clear herself but how could you denounce she she can have you seize and silence any time be not you in cornificium 's house with the guard at the gate why do not she summon the praetorian and hand you over to they because galen be there too she love he trust he and galen be my friend besides pertinax would turn on she if she should have I kill pertinax be my father 's friend and be mine marcium 's only chance if commodus should lose he life be for pertinax to seize the throne and continue to be she friend and protect she any other possible successor to commodus would have she head off in the same hour well sextus that argument will not keep she from have you murder i be only hope she will not order I to do it because the cat will be out of the bag then i will not refuse but i will certainly not kill you and that will mean -- you forget norbanus and my freedman sextus interrupted she know very well that they know all my secret they would avenge I instantly by send commodus full information of the plot involve marcium head over heel she be ready to betray commodus if that should seem the safest course if she be capable of treachery to he she be equally sure to betray all she friend if she think she own life be in danger now listen sextus and do not speak too loud or they 'll hear you in the cell any of these poor devil would jump at a chance to save he own skin by betray you and I talk softly i say listen there be not any safety anywhere with all these faction plot each against the other none know which will strike first and commodus likely to pounce on all of they at any minute i do not know why he have not hear of it already he be too busy train he body to have time to use he brain say sextus however go on i think commodus be quite likely to have the best of it narcissus say screw up he eye as if he gaze at a antagonist across the dazzling sand of the arena somebody -- some spy -- be sure to inform he there will be wholesale proscription commodus will try to scare severus niger and albinus by slaughter they supporter here in rome i can see what be come be you too a god -- like commodus -- that you can see so shrewdly never mind i can see and i can see a better way for you and for I also you have make yourself a great name as maternus less possibly in rome than on the countryside you have more to begin with than ever spartacus have -- aye and less too sextus interrupted for i lack he confidence that rome can be bring to she knee by a army of slave i lack he willingness to try to do it rome must be save by honorable roman who have rome at heart and not they own personal ambition no army of runaway slave can ever do it nothing offend I more than that commodus make slave he minister and i mean by that no offense to you narcissus who be fit to rank with spartacus himself but i be a republican it be not vengeance that i seek i will reckon i have live if i have rid rome of commodus and help to replace he with a man who will restore we ancient liberty liberty narcissus wear he satyr-smile again it make small difference to slave and gladiator how much liberty the free man have the more for they the less for we let we live while the living be good sextus let we take to the mountain and help ourselves to what we need while pertinax and all these other fight for too much let they have they too much and grow sick of it what do you and i need beyond clothing a weapon armor a girl or two and a safe place for retreat i have hear sardinium be wonderful but if you still think you would rather haunt you old estate where you know the people and they know you so that you will be warn of any attempt to catch you that will be all right with I we can swoop down on the inn along the main road now and then rob whom it be convenient to rob and live like nobleman three year i have live a outlaw 's life sextus answer sneak into rome to borrow money from my father 's friend to save I the necessity of steal it be one thing to pretend to be a robber and another thing to rob the robber 's name make nine man out of ten you secret well-wisher the deed make you all man 's enemy how do you suppose i have escape capture it be simple enough every robber in italy have call himself maternus so that i have seem to be here there everywhere aye and often in three or four place at once i have be catch and kill at least a dozen time but all the while my man and i be safe because we take care to harm nobody we let other do the murder and rob we have live like hermit show ourselves only often enough to keep alive the maternus legend well be not that better than risk you neck try to make and unmake emperor narcissus ask i risk my neck each hour i linger in rome well then by hercule take payment for the risk and cut the risk and vanish exclaimed narcissus help yourself once and for all to a bag full of gold in exchange for you father 's estate that be confiscate when they cut he head off then leave italy and let we be outlaw in sardinium sextus laugh that probably sound glorious to one in you position i too rather enjoy the prospect when i first make my escape from antioch and discover how easy the life be but though i owe it to my father 's memory to win back he estate even that and present outlawry be small compare to the zeal i have for restore rome 's ancient liberty but i do not deceive myself i be not the man who can accomplish that i can only help the one who can and will that one be pertinax he will reverse the process that have be go on since julius caesar overthrow the old republic he will use a caesar 's power to destroy the edifice of caesar and rebuild what caesar wreck narcissus ponder that he head between he hand i have not rome at heart he say at last why should i have there be girl whom i have forget whom i love more than i love rome i be a slave gladiator i have be applaud by the crowd but know what that mean have see other man go the same route i be a emperor 's favorite and i know what that mean too i see cleander die i have see man after man and woman after woman lose he favor suddenly banishment death the ergastulum torture -- and what be much worse the insult the brute heap on any one he turn against -- i be too wise to give that -- he spit on the flag-stone -- for the friendship of commodus and commodus be rome you can not persuade I he be not rome turn on its favorite as he do -- scorn they insult they throw they on dung-heap that for rome he spit again they even break the nose off the statue of the man they use to idolize they even throw the statue on a dung-heap to insult the dead why should i set rome above my own convenience well for instance you could almost certainly buy you freedom by betray I say sextus why do not you jupiter how shall a man answer that i suppose i do not betray you because if i do i should loathe myself and i prefer to like myself which i contrive to do at interval also i enjoy the company of honest man and i think you be honest although i think you be also a idealist -- which i take it be the same thing as a bear fool or so i have begin to think since i attend on the emperor and have to hear so much talk of philosophy look you what philosophy have make of commodus do not marcus aurelius beget he from he own loin and be not marcus aurelius the greatest of all philosopher do not he surround young commodus with all the learn idealist he could find that be what i be tell he do and look at commodus we roman commodus god commodus i have not murder he because i be afraid and because i do not see how i could gain by it i do not betray you because i would despise myself if i do i would despise myself if i should be untrue to rome sextus answer after a moment commodus be not rome neither be the mob rome what be then narcissus ask the brick and mortar the marble that the slave must haul under the lash the pond where they feed they lamprey on dead gladiator the arena where a man salute a dummy emperor before a disguise one kill he the senate where they buy and sell the consulate and praetorship and guaestorship the tribunal where justice go by privilege the temple where as many god as there be roman yell for sacrifice to enrich the priest the farm where the slave-gang labor like poor old sysyphus and be sell off in they old age to the contractor who clear the latrine or to the galley or if they be lucky to the lime-kiln where they dry up like stick and die soon there be a woman in a side-street near the fish-market who be very rich and look like rome to I she have so many gold ring on she finger that you can not see the dirt underneath and she own so many brothel and wine-shop that she can even buy off the tax-collector do i love she do i love rome no i love you sextus son of maximus and i will go with you to the world 's end if you will lead the way i love rome sextus answer possibly i want to see she liberty restore because i love my own liberty and can not imagine myself honorable unless rome herself be honor first when you and i be sick we need a galen rome need pertinax you ask I what be rome she be the cradle of my manhood a befouled nest say narcissus a augean stable with a hercule who do not do he work i grant you but we can substitute another hercule pertinax be too old narcissus object weaken a trifle sulkily he be old enough to wish to die in honor rather than dishonor you and i narcissus have no honor -- you a slave and i a outlaw let we win then honor for ourselves by help to heal rome of she dishonor oh well have it you own way say narcissus unconvinced a brass as for you honor the alternative be death or liberty in either case and as for I i prefer friendship to religion so i will follow you whichever road you take now go these fellow must not recognize you it be time to take they one by one into the exercise yard i dare not take more than one at a time or they would kill I even with the blunt practise-weapon i wish they might face commodus as boldly as they tackle I i be a weary man and many time a bruised one i can tell you when the night come after put twenty of they through they pace ix stewed eel the training arena where commodus work off energy and keep he herculean muscle in condition be within the palace grounds but the tunnel by which he reach it continue on and downward to the circus maximus so that he could attend the public spectacles without much danger of assassination nevertheless a certain danger still exist one of he worst frenzy of proscription have be start by a man who wait for he in the tunnel and lose he nerve and then instead of kill he pretend to deliver a insulting message from the senate since that time the tunnel have be line with guard at regular interval and when commodus pass through he mysterious double be oblige to walk in front of he surround by enough attendant to make any one not in the secret believe the double be the emperor himself no man in the known world be less incapable than commodus of self - defense against a armed man there be no deception about he feat of strength and skill he be undoubtedly the most terrific fighter and consummate athlete rome have ever see and he be as proud of it as nero once be of he golden voice but as he explain to the fawn courtier who shoulder one another for a place beside he as he hurry down the tunnel : how could rome replace I yesterday i have to order a slave beat to death for break a vase of greek glass i can buy a hundred slave for half what that glass cost hadrian and i could have a thousand better senator tomorrow than the fool who belch and stammer in the curia the senate house but where would you find another commodus if some lurk miscreant should stab I from behind it be the goose that save the capitol you cackler can preserve you commodus they agree in chorus it would be rome 's irreparable loss if he should die and certain senator more fertile than the other in expedient for draw he attention to themselves pause ostentatiously to hold a little conversation with the guard and promise they reward if they should catch a miscreant lurk in wait to attack we beloved we glorious emperor commodus overhear they as they mean he should and such fulsome idiot as those expect I to believe they can frame law he scowl over-shoulder write down they name for I somebody the senate need pruning i will purge it the way galen use to purge I when i have the colic cioscurus but these leaky babbler suffocate I he be true to the caesarian tradition he believe himself a god he more than half-persuaded other man he almost superhuman energy and skill with weapon he terrific storm of anger and he magnetism overawe courtier and politician as they do the gladiator whom he slew in the arena the strain of madness in he blood provide cunning that could mask itself beneath a princely bluster of indifference to consequence he could fear with a extravagance coequal to the fury of he love of danger and he fear strike terror into man 's heart as it stir he mad brain into frenzy he make no false claim when he call rome the city of commodus and himself the roman hercule the vast majority of roman be unfit to challenge he contempt of they and he contempt be never under cover for a moment debauchery of wine and woman enter not at all into he private life although in public he encourage it in other for the simple reason that it weaken man who otherwise might turn on he he be never guilty of excess that might undermine he strength or shake he nerve there be a almost superhuman purity about he worship of athletic power he outdo the greek in that respect but he allow the legend of he monstrous orgy in the palace to gain currency partly because that encourage the roman to debauch themselves and render themselves incapable of overthrow he and partly because it help to cover up he trick of employ a substitute to occupy the royal pavilion at the game when he himself drive chariot in the race or fight in the arena as the gladiator paulus man who have let wine and woman ruin they own nerve know it be impossible that any one who live as commodus be say to do could drive a chariot and wield a javelin as paulus do whoever face a roman gladiator under the critical gaze of a crowd that know all the point of fight and could instantly detect and do instantly resent pretense fraud trickery the poor condition of one combatant or the unwillingness of one man to have at another in deadly earnest have to be not only in the pink of bodily condition but a fighter such as no drunken sensualist could ever hope to be so it be easy to suppress the scandal that the gladiator paulus be the emperor himself although half rome half-believe it and the substitute who occupy the seat of honor at the game -- age a little grow a little pouchy under eye and chin -- be point to as proof that commodus be be ruin by the life he lead the trick of make use of the same substitute to save the emperor the boredom of official ceremony whenever there be no risk of the public come close enough to detect the fraud materially help to strengthen the officially foster argument that commodus could not be paulus so the mystery of the identity of paulus be like all court secret and most secret of intriguing government no mystery at all to hundred but to thousand a insoluble conundrum the official propagandist of the court news absolutely in control of all the channel through which fact could reach the public easily offset the constant leakage from the lip of slave and gladiator by disseminate artfully concoct news those actually in the secret flatter by the confidence and fearful for they own skin steadfastly deny the story when it crop up last but not least be the law that make it sacrilege to speak in term derogatory to the emperor a gladiator though the crowd might almost deify he be a casteless individual unprivileged before the law whom any franchised citizen would rate as socially far beneath himself to have identify the emperor with paulus in a voice above a whisper would have make the culprit liable to death and confiscation of he goods the substitute himself a man of mystery be keep in virtual imprisonment he be know as pavonius nasor not because that be he real name which be know to very few people but because of a old legend that the ghost of a certain pavonius nasor murder century ago and never bury still walk in the neighborhood of that part of the palace where the emperor 's substitute now lead he mysterious secret existence there be plenty of whisper story current as to he true identity some say he be a impoverished landholder whom commodus have meet by accident when travel in northern italy but it be much more commonly believe he be the emperor 's twin brother spirit away at birth by midwife and the story tell to account for that be as remarkably unlikely as the tale itself as for instance that a soothsayer have prophesy how commodus should one day mount the throne and that he and he twin brother would wreck rome in civil war -- a warning hardly likely to have have much weight with the father marcus aurelius although the mother be more likely to have give credence to it whatever the truth of he origin pavonius nasor never run the risk of tell it he keep he sinecure by master he tongue preserve almost bovine speechlessness when he and commodus meet face to face he never seem to see the joke of the resemblance never laugh at commodus ' obscenely vivid jibe at he expense nor once complain of he anomalous position he appear to be a man of no ambition other than to get through life as easily as might be -- of no personal dignity no ruling habit but possess of imitative talent that enable he without the slightest trouble to adopt the very gait and gesture of the emperor whom he impersonate as he stride ahead along the tunnel he receive the guard ' salute with merely enough nod of recognition to deceive a onlooker not in the secret -lrb- it be pavonius nasor 's half-indulgent rather lazy smile that have persuade rome and even the praetorian guard that commodus be a easy-going sensual good humored man -rrb- there be a box at one end of the private arena over the gate where the horse enter so place as to avoid the sun 's direct ray it be reach by a short stairway from a anteroom that open on the tunnel there be no other means of access to the box it be wooden sidewall finish to resemble gilded eagle 's wing project over the arena so that it be well screen and in shadow there be none observe from below who could have swear it have not be the emperor himself who sit in the box and watch paulus the gladiator show off he skill the assemble gladiator perfectly aware of paulus ' true identity go through the farce of solemnly salute as the emperor the man who stare down at they from beneath a awning 's shadow between golden eagle 's wing and who return the salute with a wave of the arm that all rome could have recognize commodus nearly as naked as when he be bear come run from a dress room and prance and leap over the sand to bring the sweat - bead to he skin then snatch at the nearest gladiator wrestle with he until the breathless victim cry for mercy drop he then as crushed as if a python have leave a job half-finished and shout for the ashen sword-stick in a minute with a leather buckler on he left arm he be parry the thrust and blow of six man drive and so crowd they on one another 's toe that only two could seriously answer the terrific flailing of he own ash stick he name they name he blow and lay they one by one half-stunned and bleeding on the sand until the last one by a quick feint land on he raise a great crimson welt across he shoulder well do commodus exclaim and smite he on the skull so fiercely that he break the sword-stick you have kill he say a senator as two man promptly seize the victim 's arm to drag he out possibly say commodus that blow i land on he would have kill a horse but he be fortunate he die proud -- prouder than you ever will varronius he get past paulus ' guard would you like to attempt it woman how i loathe you soft effeminate sleek senator you fear death and you fear life equally where be narcissus where be those man who be to try to kill I at my birthday game there be no answer from narcissus commodus forget he in a moment call for javelin and hurl they at a target then at half-a-dozen target hit all six mark exactly in the middle as he spin himself on one heel i be in fettle he exclaim clap the back of the senator whom he have scurrilously insult a moment ago if he be conscious of applause from the group of courtier and gladiator he give no sign of it what pleased he be he own ability not they praise lion he say loose that big one paulus a scar veteran answer -lrb- they be all forbid to address he by any other name in that arena -rrb- you have order we to keep that fellow for the birthday game if you keep kill all the best one off at practice what shall we do when the day come the last ship - load have arrive from africa and already you have use up nearly half of they there be no chance of another cargo arrive in time for the game and besides we have lack corpse recently that big one have not taste man 's flesh he be hungry now he will eat whatever we throw in so let he taste the right meat that will make he savage loose a leopard then the veteran go off without a word to give he order to the man below - ground whose duty it be to drag the cage to the opening of tunnel in the masonry through which the animal emerge into the sunlight there be ten such opening on either side of the arena close by trapdoor set in groove that could be raise by rope from overhead commodus pick up one javelin and poise it half-a-dozen gladiator watch he pay no attention to the door through any one of which the animal might come they know they paulus and be train besides to look at death or danger with a curious contemptuous calm but the courtier be nervous group themselves where the sunlight throw a v-shaped shadow on the sand as if they think that semus - twilight would protect they a wooden door rise squeak in its groove but commodus keep he back toward it woman he exclaim he sudden scowl transform he handsome face into a thing of horror he begin to mutter savagely obscene abuse a leopard creep into the sunlight try to turn again but be prevent by the closing trap and crouch against the arena wall beware the beast come say a gladiator hold you presumptuous tongue you slave-born rascal commodus retort take that yap dog away and have he whip a man step from the entrance gate to beckon the offend gladiator who walk out with a look of hatred on he face he pause once hesitate whether to ask mercy and think better of it shrug he fine bronzed shoulder the leopard leave the wall and creep toward the center of the sand he black and yellow beauty ripple in the sunlight and he shadow look like death 's trail cloak the courtier seem doubtful which of the two beast to watch leopard or emperor a spear say commodus a gladiator put it in he hand varronius it irk I to have coward in the senate let I see you try to kill that leopard decadent and grown effeminate though rome be there be no patrician who have not receive some training in the use of arm varronius take the spear at once he white hand close on the shaft with military firmness but he white face give the lie to the alacrity with which he stride out of the shadow kill he and you shall have the consulate next year say commodus be kill and there will be one useless bastard less to clutter up the curia a flush of anger sweep over the senator 's pale face for a moment he look almost capable of lunge with the spear at commodus -- but commodus be toy with the javelin varronius stride out to face the leopard and the lithe beast do not wait to feel the spear-point it begin to stalk its adversary in irregular swift curve its body almost press the sand its eye be spot of sunlit topaz commodus ' frown vanish he begin to gloat over the leopard 's subtlety and strength he be a lovelier thing than you varronius he be a better fighter he be manlier he be worth more he have keep he body stronger and he wit more nimble he will get you by the dioscurus he will get you i will bet a talent that he get you -- and i hope he do you hold you spear the way a woman hold a distaff -- but observe the way he gather all he strength in readiness to leap instantly in any direction ah the leopard make a feint perhaps to test the swiftness of the spear - point leap like a flash of light he seem to change direction in mid-air the point miss he by half a hand 's breadth one terrific claw outreaching as he turn rip open varronius ' tunic and bring a little stream of crimson trickle down he left arm good commodus remark first blood to the braver who would like to bet with I i varronius retort from between set tooth he eye fix on the leopard that have recommence he swift strategic to-and-fro stalk movement i have bet you the consulship already who else want to bet asked commodus before any one could answer the leopard spring in again at varronius who step aside and drive he spear with very well time accuracy only force enough be lack the point slit the leopard 's skin and make a stinging wound along the beast 's rib turn he the way a spur-prick turn a horse he snarl make varronius step back another pace or two neglect he chance to attack and drive the spear-point home the infuriate leopard watch he for a moment ear back tail spasmodically twitch then shoot to one side and charge straight at the group of courtier they scatter they be almost unarmed there be three of they who stumble interfere with each other the nearest to the leopard draw a dagger with a jeweled hilt a mere toy with a light blade hardly longer than he hand he throw he toga over he left forearm and stand firm to make a fight for it he white face rigid and he eye ablaze the leopard leap -- and fall dead hardly writhe commodus ' long javelin have catch he in the middle of he spring exactly at the point behind the shoulder-bone that leave a clear course to the heart i would not have do that for a coward tullius if you have run i would have let he kill you commodus stride up and pull out the javelin set one foot on the leopard and exert all he strength look here varronius do you see how deep my blade go pin-prick be no use against man or animal kill when you strike like great jove with he thunderbolt life be not a game between maltese kitten it be a spectacle in which the strong devour the weak and all the god look on loose another leopard there i 'll show you he take the spear from varronius balance it a moment discard it and choose another feel its point with he thumb there be a squeak of pulley as they loose a leopard near the end of the arena he charge the animal leap from foot to foot he make prodigious leap there be no guess which way he would jump next he be not like a human be the leopard snarl slunk away attempt to avoid he but he crowd it against the wall he force it to turn at bay no eye be quick enough to see exactly how he kill it save that he strike when the leopard spring the next thing that anybody actually see he have the writhe creature on the spear in air like a legion 's standard then the madness surge into he brain so i rule rome he exclaim and throw the leopard at the gladiator ' foot because i pity rome that could not find another paulus i strike first before they strike I they flatter he -- fawn on he but he be much too genuinely mad for flattery to take effect if you be worth a barrelful of rat i would have a senate that might save I trouble then like tiberius i might remain away from rome and live more like a god i have more than half a mind to let my dummy stay here to amuse you wastrel he glance up at the box where he substitute loll and yawn and smile all you degenerate need be some one you can rub yourselve against like fat cat mew for a bowl of milk by hercule now i 'll show you something that will make you blood leap bring out the new spanish team with a imperious gesture he send senator and gladiator to scatter themselves all over the arena not yet satisfied he order all the guard fetch from the tunnel and arrange they in a similar disorder so that finally no stretch of fifty yard be leave without a man obstruct it there be no spina down the midst nor anything except the surround wall to suggest to a team of horse which the course might be let none move he command i will crush the foot of any man who stir attendant cling to the head of four gray stallion that fight and kick bring out he chariot and other shut the gate behind it commodus admire the team a minute then examine the new high wheel of the gilded chariot that be hardly wider than a coffin -- a thing that a man could upset with a shove and build to look as flimsy as a egg shell suddenly he seize the rein and leap in throw up he right hand if he could have rule he empire as he drive that chariot he would have far outshine augustus for whose memory man sigh he manage they with one hand there be magnetism send along the rein to play with the dynamic energy of four mad stallion as god amuse themselves with man if empire have amuse he as athleticism do there would have be no equal in all history to commodus in a chariot no other athlete could have balance on a course provide not one unobstructed stretch of fifty yard he drive like phoebus breaking in the horse of the sun career this and that way weave pattern in among the frightened man who stand like post for he to drive around he miss they by a hand 's breadth -- less he take delight in drive at they turn in the last half-second smile at a blanched face as he wheel and weave new figure down another zigzag avenue of man the frenzy of the team inspire he the rebellion of the stallion make mad by the persistent sudden turn arouse he own astonishing enthusiasm he accomplish the impossible he make new law of motion break they invent other he become a god in action master the team until it have no consciousness of any self - will or of any impulse but to loose its full strength under the directing will of genius the team tire first it be its wane speed that weary he at last the mania that own he could not tolerate the anticlimax of decline effort so he mood change he become morose -- indifferent he rein in toss the rein to a attendant and begin to walk toward the tunnel entrance clothe as he be in nothing but the practice loin-cloth of a gladiator a dozen senator implore he to wait and clothe himself he would not wait he order they to bring he cloak and overtake he then he observe narcissus standing near the horse-gate wait to summon he trained gladiator for a exhibition : not this time narcissus next time follow I he wait for a moment for narcissus that give the substitute time to come down from the box and go hurry ahead into the tunnel-mouth he go so fast -lrb- for he know the emperor 's mood -rrb- that the attendant find it hard to keep up most of they be half a dozen pace in the rear a senator give commodus he cloak he take narcissus by the arm and stride ahead into the tunnel mutter ignore noisy protest from the senator who warn he that the guard be not yet there then there be sudden silence possibly a consequence of caesar 's mood or the reaction cause by chill and tunnel-darkness after sunlit sand or it might have be the shadow of impend tragedy a long scream break the silence thrice repeat horrible like something from a unseen world instantly narcissus leap ahead into the darkness weaponless but arm by nature with the muscle of a panther commodus leap after he he mood reverse again now emulation have he he would not be beat to a scene of action by a gladiator he let he cloak fall and a senator trip over it there be no lamp something less than twilight deepen here and there by shadow fill the tunnel by a niche intend for a sentry the attendant be stand helplessly around the body of a man who lay with head and shoulder prop against the wall narcissus and another like knotted snake be writhe near by there be a sound of choke pavonius nasor be silent he appear already dead pluto be there no light commodus demand what have happen they have kill you shadow sire who kill he man who spring out of the darkness suddenly one man only one i have he here he live yet but he die narcissus say he drag a writhe body on the flagstone hold it by one wrist he be arm i have to throttle he to save my liver from he knife i think i break he neck he be certainly die say narcissus some one have go for a lamp and come along the tunnel with it let I look say commodus here give I that lamp he look first at pavonius nasor who gaze back at he with stupid passionless already dim eye a stream of blood be gush from below he left arm now the god of heaven and hell and all the strange god that have no rest place and all the spirit of the air and earth and sea defile you spirit commodus explode careless irresponsible ungrateful fool you have deprive I of my liberty you let yourself be kill like any sow under the butcher 's knife and dare to leave I shadowless then die like carrion and rot unburied he begin to kick he but the stricken man 's lip move commodus bent down and try to listen -- try again master impatience and at last stand upright shake both fist at the tunnel roof omnipotent progenitor of lightning he explode he say he should have have stew eel tonight the watch senator mistake that for a cue to laugh they laughter touch off all the magazine of caesar 's rage he turn into a mania he tear at he own hair he tear off he loin-cloth and stand naked he try to kill narcissus because narcissus be the nearest to he he crash centurion 's parade voice fill the tunnel dog dog ' ullage viper he yell who slew my shadow who do it this be a conspiracy who hatch it bring my tablet warn the executioner what be commodus without he dummy vulture better have kill I than that poor obliging fool you curse stupid idiot you have kill my dummy i must sit as he do and look on i must swallow stink air of throne-room i must watch sluggard fight -- you miserable wanton imbecile it be paulus you have kill do you appreciate that jupiter but i will make rome pay for this who do it who do it i say rage blind he he do not see the choke wretch whose wrist narcissus twist until he strike at narcissus again and try to follow he stumble over the assassin who be this give I a sword somebody be this the murderer bring that lamp here bolder than the other have recently be praise the senator tullius bring the lamp and kneel hold it near the culprit 's face the murderer be beyond speech hardly breathe with he eye half - burst from the socket and he tongue thrust forward through he tooth because narcissus ' thumb have almost strangle he a christian say tullius there be a note of quiet exultation in he voice the privilege of the christian be a sore point with the majority of senator a what demand commodus a christian see -- he have a cross and a fish engrave on bone and wear it hang from he neck beneath he tunic besides i think i recognize the man i think he be the one who waylay pertinax the other day and speak strange stuff about a whore on seven hill whose day be number he have raise up the man 's head by the hair commodus stamp on the face with the flat of he sandal crush the head on the flagstone christian he shout be this marcium 's do be this marcium 's expedient to keep I out of the arena too long have i endure that rabble i will rid rome of the brood they kill the shadow -- they shall feel the substance suddenly he turn on he attendant -- point at the murderer and he victim : throw those two into the sewer strip they -- strip they now -- let none identify they seize those spineless fool who let the murder happen tie they you narcissus -- march they back to the arena have they throw into the lion ' cage stay there and see it do then come and tell I the courtier back away from he as far out of the circle of the lamplight as the tunnel-wall would let they he have snatch the lamp from tullius he hold it high two part of I be dead the shadow that be satisfy with eel for supper and the immortal paulus whom a empire worship remain I -- the third part -- commodus you shall regret those two dead part of I he hurl the light lamp into the midst of they and smash it then in darkness stride along the tunnel muttering and cursing as he go -- stark naked x rome be too much rule by woman he be in the bath say marcium she and galen be alone with pertinax who look splendid in he official toga she be herself in disarray she woman have try to dress she hair on the way in the litter one long coil of it be tumble on she shoulder she look almost drunken where be flavium titiana she demand out say pertinax and shut he lip he never let himself discuss he wife 's activity the peasant in he and the orthodox grammarian prefer less scandalous subject marcia stare long at he she liquid lazy eye suggest banked fire in they depths look for sign of spirit that should rise to the occasion but pertinax prefer to choose he own occasion commodus be in the bath marcium repeat he will stay there until night come he be sulk he have he tablet with he -- write and write then scratch out he have show what he write to nobody but he have send for livius we should have kill that dog say pertinax which bring a sudden laugh from galen a dog 's death never save a empire galen volunteer if you have murder livius the crisis would have come a few day sooner that be all it be the crisis it have come say marcium commodus come storm into my apartment and i think he mean to kill I with he own hand usually i be not afraid of he this time he turn my strength to water he yell ` christian ' at I ` christian you and you christian ' he be unbathed he be half-naked he be sweaty from he exercise he hair be ruffle he have tear out some of it he scowl be frightful -- it be freezing he be quite mad galen comment i try to make he understand this could not be a plot or i would certainly have hear of it marcium go on with suppress excitement i say it be the madness of one fanatic that nobody could foresee he would not listen he out-roar I he even raise he fist to strike he swear it be another of my plan to keep he out of the arena i begin to think it might be wiser to admit that even in he worst mood he be sometimes soften by the thought that i take care of he and love he enough to risk he anger but not this time he fly into the worst passion i have ever see he return to he first obsession that the christian plot it and that i know all about it he swear he will butcher the christian he will rid rome of they he say since he can not play paulus any longer he will out-play nero where be sextus pertinax ask aye where be sextus marcium glare at galen we have to thank you for sextus you persuade pertinax to shield sextus pertinax persuade I you do it galen answer dryly it be what we do that matter squeal like a pig under a gate will not remedy the matter you foresee the crisis long ago sextus have be very useful to you he have keep you inform so do not lower yourself by turn on he now what be the latest news about the other faction marcium restrain herself bite she lip she love old galen but she do not relish be tell the whole responsibility be hers although she know it there be no news she answer nobody have hear a word about the murder yet commodus have have the body throw into the sewer but there be spy in the palace -- to say nothing of bultius livius pertinax add he be click the ring on he finger -- symptom of irresolution that make marcium grit she tooth the other faction be watch one another marcium go on they be irresolute because they have no leader near enough to rome to strike without warn why be you irresolute she look so hard at pertinax that he get up and begin to pace the floor severus and he troops be in pannonium pescennius niger be in syrium clodius albinus be in britain the senator be all so jealous and afraid for they own skin that they be as likely as not to betray one another to commodus the minute they learn that a crisis exist if they hear that commodus be write out proscription list they will vie with one another to denounce they own pet enemy -- include you -- and I she add there be one chance yet say pertinax bultius livius may have enough wisdom to denounce the leader of the other faction and to clear we none of the other would be grateful to he that carthaginian severus for instance be invariably spiteful to the man who do he favor bultius livius may see that to protect we be he safest course as well as best for rome he have more to say but marcia 's scorn interrupted he galen chuckle rome he care only for bultius livius it be now or never pertinax marcium 's intense emotion make she appear icily indifferent but she do not deceive galen although pertinax welcome she calmness as excuse unenthusiasm in herself marcia be right say galen it be now or never marcium ought to know commodus know he she explode i can tell you step by step what he will do he will come out of the bath and eat a light meal but he will drink nothing for fear of poison presently he will be thirsty and lonely and will send for I and whatever he feel he will pretend he love I when the rage fear be on he he will never drink from any one but I he will take a cup of wine from my hand make I taste it first then he will go alone into he own room where only that child telamonion will dare to follow everything depend then on the child if the child should happen to amuse he he will turn sentimental and i will dare to go in and talk to he if not -- galen interrupted madness he say resemble many other malady there be symptom frequently for many year before the slow fire burst into a blaze some die before the outbreak be burn up by the generate process which be like a slow fire but if they survive until the explosion it be more violent the longer it have be delay and in the case of commodus that mean that other man will die and woman he add look straight at marcium if he even pretend he love I -- i be a woman say marcium i love he in spite of he frenzy if i only have myself to think of -- think then galen interrupted if you can not think for yourself do you expect to benefit the world by think marcium bury she face in she hand and lay face downward on the couch she be tremble in a struggle for self-mastery pertinax chew at he finger-nail which be the everlasting subject of he proud wife 's indignation he never keep he fine hand properly the peasant in he think such refinement effeminate unsoldierly cornificium who could have make he submit even to a manicure understand he too well to insist galen say marcium sit up suddenly the old man blink he recognize decision sudden and irrevocable he clench he finger and he lower lip come forward by the fraction of a inch i must save my christian what do you know about poison she demand less than many people galen answer i have study antidote i be a doctor those i poison think as i do that i give they something for they health my method have change with experience doctoring be like statesmanship -- which be to say groping in the dark through maze of misinformation know you a poison ask marcia that will not harm one who merely taste it but will kill whoever drink a quantity something without flavor something colorless that can be mix with wine know you a safe poison galen aye -- irresolution galen answer i will not be make a victim of it who shall aspire to the throne if commodus die pertinax pertinax look startled stroke he beard uncross he knee then let pertinax do he own work say galen rome be full of poisoner but have not pertinax a sword aye and it have be the emperor 's until this minute pertinax say grimly galen tell we commodus be mad and i agree that rome deserve a better emperor but whether i be fit to be that emperor be something not yet clear to I i doubt it whom the fate select for such a purpose they compel and he be unwise who resist they i will not resist but let there be no doubt on this point : i will not slay commodus i will not draw sword against the man to whom i owe my fortune i be not a ingrate sextus live for he revenge if you should ask I i would answer sextus plan this murder in the tunnel and the blow be mean for commodus himself i be incline to deal with sextus firmly it be not too late there be a chance that commodus deprive now of he opportunity to make himself a spectacle may bend he energy to government madman though he be he be the emperor and if he be dispose now to govern well with capable adviser i would be the last to turn on he if he will be advise by you suggest marcia she accent tart with sarcasm what will you advise he about sextus there be plenty of way of get rid of sextus without kill he say pertinax he be a young man need outlet for he energy and fuel for he pride if he be send to parthia in secret as a agent authorize to penetrate that country and report on military geographical and economic fact -- he would refuse to go say galen and if make to go he would return o pertinax -- be quiet pertinax retort irritably i will not submit to be lecture i be governor of rome -- though you be galen the philosopher and i remember many of you adage this minute as for instance : ` it be he who act who be responsible ' to kill a emperor be easy galen to replace he be as difficult as to fit a new head to a body we have talk a lot of treason most of it nonsense i have listen to too much of it i be as guilty as the other but when it come to slaying commodus and standing in he shoe -- marcium interrupt by the great twin brethren pertinax who can be surprise that flavium titiana seek amusement in the arm of other man do cornificium endure such peasant talk or do you keep it to impose on we as a relief from she more noble conversation dea dium have i know how spineless you can be i would have set my cap at lucius severus long ago it may be it be not too late she have he she have prick he in the one place where he could be stir to spitefulness he whole face crimsoned suddenly that carthaginian he come and stand in front of she if you have favor he you should have foregone my friendship marcium commodus be bad enough severus would be ten time worse where commodus be merely crazy lucius severus be a calculate ice-cold monster of cruelty he have no emotion except those arouse by venom he would tear out you heart just as swiftly as mine as for plot with he he would let you do it all and then denounce you to the senate after he be on the throne either it must be severus or else you say marcium which be it to be pertinax fold he arm i would feel it my duty to preserve rome from severus but you go too fast we commodus be on the throne -- and write proscription list say marcium who know what name be on the list already who know what bultius livius may have tell he who know which of we will be alive tomorrow morning who know what sextus be do if sextus have hear of this crisis he will seize the moment and either arouse the praetorian guard to mutiny or else reach commodus himself and slay he with he own hand sextus be a man be you no more than flavium titiana 's cuckold and cornificium 's plaything i be a roman pertinax retort angrily i think of rome before myself you woman only think of passion and ambition rome -- city of a thousand triumph he turn away pacing the floor again knit he finger behind he pertinax would offer up himself if he might bring back the augustan day -- if he might win the warfare that tiberius lose one pertinax be nothing in the life of rome one life three - quarter spend be but a poor pledge to the god -- yet too much to be throw away in vain the augury be all mixed nowadays i doubt they i mistrust the shaven priest who dole out answer in return for mint money i have kneel before the holy shrine of vesta but the virgin be as vague as the egyptian who prophesy -- he hesitate what demand marcium that i should serve rome and receive ingratitude what else do any man receive who serve rome they who cheat she be the one who prosper send for cornificium say marcium she keep you resolution let she come and loose it pertinax turn sharply on she flavium titiana shall not suffer that indignity cornificium can not enter this house but the mention of cornificium 's name work just as swift a change in he as have the name of lucius severus he begin to bite he finger - nail then clench he hand again behind he galen and marcium watch you be the only one who can replace commodus without drenching rome in blood say marcium remember a phrase of cornificium 's and since the word be cornificium 's and stir the chord of many memory they produce a sort of half-way resolution it be now or never marcium say goad he but pertinax shake he head i be not convinced though i would do my best to save rome from severus dioscurus -- do you realize this plot to make I emperor be know to not more than a dozen -- therein safety lie say marcium yourself include there can only be a dozen traitor rome be too much rule by woman i will not kill commodus and i will give he this one chance say pertinax i will protect he unless and until i shall discover proof that he intend to turn on you or I or any of my friend you may discover that too late say marcium but she seem to understand he and look satisfied come tonight to the palace -- galen she add come you also -- and bring poison galen meet she gaze and shut he lip tight galen she say either you will do this or -- i have be you friend now be you mine it be too risky to send one of my slave to fetch a poison you be to come tonight and bring the poison with you otherwise -- you understand you be extremely comprehensible say galen purse up he lip you will obey i must say galen but he do not say whether he would obey she or he inclination pertinax eye he doubtfully seem tear between suspicion of he and respect for long-tried friendship may we depend on you he ask he lay a hand on galen 's shoulder bend over he i be a old man galen answer in any event i have not long to live i will do my best -- for you pertinax nodded but there be still a question in he mind he bid farewell to marcium turn he back toward galen marcium whisper : be a man now pertinax if we should lose this main we two can drink the stuff that galen bring there be a fall star last night say pertinax whose be it marcium study he face a moment then : there will be a rise sun tomorrow she retort whose will it be yours play the man xi galen galen 's house be one he rent from a freedman of the emperor -- a wise means of retain favor at the palace landlord have influence be careful to protect good tenant furthermore whoever rent rather than possess escape more easily from persecution galen like tyanan apollonius reduce he private need maintain that philosophy go hand in hand with medicine but wealth with neither it be a pleasant little house not far away from cornificium 's within a precinct that be rebuild after all that part of rome burn under nero 's fascinate gaze the street be crescent-shaped not often crowded though a score of passage like wheel-spoke lead to it and to the rear of galen 's house be a veritable maze of alley there be two gate to the house : one wide with decorate post that face the crescent street where galen 's oldest slave sit on a stool and blink at passer-by the other narrow lead from a little high-walled courtyard at the rear into a alley between stable in which milch-ass be keep that alley lead into another where a dozen midwife have they name and claim to excellency paint on the door -- a alley carefully to be avoid because woman of that trade like barber vie for custom by disseminate gossip so sextus use a passage run parallel to that one lead between workshop where the burial-urn maker ' slave engrave untruthful epitaph in baked clay or inlay they on the marble tomb-slab -- to be gilded presently with gold-leaf -lrb- since a gilded lie though costlier be no worse than the same lie unadorned -rrb- he drum a signal with he knuckle on the panel of a narrow door of olive-wood set deep into the wall under a project arch a overlean tree increase the shadow and a visitor could wait without attract notice a slave nearly as old as galen presently admit he into a paved yard in which a fish-pond have be build around a ancient well a few old fruit-tree grow against the wall and there be potted shrub but little evidence of gardening most of galen 's slave be too old for that kind of work there be a dozen of they loaf in the yard some be so fat that they wheeze and some so thin with age that they resemble skeleton there be a rumor that the fatness and the thinness be account for by galen 's fondness for experiment old galen have a hundred jealous rival and they even say he feed the dead slave to the fish but it be roman custom to give no man credit for humaneness if a unclean accusation could be make to stick another fat old slave lead sextus to a porch behind the house and through that to a library extremely bare of furniture but line with shelf on which roll manuscript be stack in tag and number order they be dusty as if galen use they very little nowadays there be two door in addition to the one that open on the porch the old slave point to the smaller one and sextus stooping and turn sidewise because of the narrowness between the post go down a step and enter without knock for a moment he could not see galen there be such confusion of shadow and light high shelf around the wall of a long shed-like room be crowd with retort and phial a enormous dusty human skeleton articulate on conceal wire move as if annoy by the intrusion there be many kind of skull of animal and man on bracket fasten to the wall and there be jar contain dead thing soak in spirit some of the jar be enormous have once hold olive oil on a table down the midst be instrument a scale for weigh chemical some measure and a charcoal furnace with a blow-pipe and across the whole of one end of the room be a system of wooden pigeon-hole stack with chemical and herb for the most part wrap in parchment sunlight stream through narrow window amid dust of drug and spice make a move mystery the room seem under water galen stoop over a crucible with a unrolled parchment on the table within reach be not distinguishable until he move when he cease move he fade out again and sextus have to go and stand where he could touch he to believe that he be really there you tell I you have cease experiment i lie the universe be a experiment say galen such god as there be perhaps be look to evolve a decent man or possibly a woman from the mess we see around we let we hope they fail why there appear to be hope in failure should the god fail they will still be god and go on try if they ever make a decent man or woman all the rest of we would turn on they creation and destroy it then the god would turn into devil and destroy we what have happen to you galen why the bitter mood i discover i be like the rest of you -- like all rome at my age such a discovery make for bitterness for a minute or two galen go on scrape powder from the crucible then suddenly he look up at sextus step backward so as to see the young man 's face more clearly in a shaft of sunlight do you send that christian into the tunnel to kill commodus he ask i you know I better than that galen when the time come to slay commodus -- but be commodus dead speak do not stand there look at I speak man galen appear satisfied no not commodus the blow miscarry somebody slew nasor a mistake a coward 's blow if you have be responsible -- when -- if -- i slay it shall be openly with my own hand say sextus not i alone but rome herself must vomit out that monster why be you vex that wanton blow that miss its mark have strip some friend of mine too naked it have also strip I and reveal I to myself last night i see a fall star -- a meteor that blaze out of the night and vanish i too say sextus all rome see it the cheap sorcerer be do a fine trade they declare it portend evil evil -- but for whom old galen pour the powder he have scrape into a dish and blink at he affiliation in the realm of substance be confine to like ingredient that law be universal like seek like beget its own like as for instance sickness flow in channel of unwholesomeness like water seep through a marsh evil what be evil but the likeness of a deed -- its echo -- its result -- its aftermath you see this powder marcium have order I to poison commodus what kind of aftermath should that deed have sextus stare at he astonished galen go on mix colorless it must be -- flavorless -- without smell -- indetectible these savior of rome prepare too much to save themselves and i take trouble to save myself why he stop and blink again at sextus wait for a answer you be worth preserve galen i dispute that i be sentimental which be idiocy in a man of my age but i will not kill he who be superior to any man in rome idiocy you and you admire that monster as a monster yes he be at least wholehearted as a monster he lack neither strength of will nor sinew nor good look he be magnificent he have the fear the frenzy and the resolution of a splendid animal we have only cowardice the unenthusiasm and the indecision of base man if we have the virtue of commodus no commodus could ever have rule rome for half a day but i be senile i be sentimental rather than betray marcium -- and pertinax -- who would betray I for they own sake rather than submit my own old carcass to the slave whom marcia would send to kill I i be do what you see poison for commodus no not for yourself galen no for whom then for pertinax sextus seize the plate on which the several ingredient be be mix put that down say galen i will poison part of he -- the mean part speak in plain word galen i will slay he indecision he and marcium propose that i shall kill they monster i shall mix a draught for marcium to take to he -- in case this and in case that and perhaps in plain word commodus have send for livius and none know how much livius have tell they monster write and scratch out and rewrite long proscription list and marcium tremble for she christian for herself she do not tremble she have ten time pertinax ' ability to rule if marcium be a man she should be emperor we pertinax be hesitate between inertia and doubt and dread of cornificium 's ambition for he between admiration of he own wife and contempt for she between the subtlety of augury and common sense between trust and mistrust of we all include marcium and you and I between the easy dignity of be governor of rome and the uneasy palace -- slavery of be caesar between doubt of he own ability to rule and the will to restore the republic we all know pertinax say sextus he be diffident that be all he be modest once he have make he decision -- galen interrupt he then let we pray the god to make the rest of we immodest the decision that he make be this : if commodus have hear of the conspiracy if commodus intend to kill he he will then allow somebody else to kill commodus he will permit I who be a killer only by professional mistake and not by intention to be make to kill my former pupil with a poison drink you understand not even then will pertinax take resolution by the throat and do he own work so pertinax shall drink this it be mean that commodus shall drink it that be unless commodus emerge from he sulk too soon and butcher all of we -- as we deserve have do with riddle galen how will that affect pertinax except to make he emperor nothing will make he emperor unless he make himself say galen you will know tonight we lack a hero sextus all conspirator resemble rat that gnaw and run until one rat at last discover himself caesar of the herd by accident caius julius caesar be a hero he be one mind bold and above and aloof he see he consider he take he murderer be all conspirator who run like rat and turn on one another so be we can you imagine caius julius caesar threaten a old philosopher like I with death unless he mix the poison for a woman to take to he enemy 's bedside can you imagine the great julius hesitate to destroy a friend or spare a enemy do you mean they strike tonight and have not warn I i have warn you marcia have be prepare these many day to kill I if i mean to strike say sextus i can understand that it be no more than a woman 's method to protect she bully she accuse and defend he fear and love he hate he and hate more the man who set she free but pertinax -- do he not bid you warn I no say galen be you look for nobility i tell you there be nothing noble in conspiracy pertinax and marcium have use you they will try to use I they will blame I they will certainly blame you i advise you to run to you friend in the aventine hill thence hasten out of italy if pertinax should fail and commodus survive this night -- no galen he must not fail rome need pertinax that poison -- phaugh be no sword leave in rome have pertinax no iron in he better one of marcium 's long pin than that unmanly stuff where be narcissus i do not know say galen narcissus be another who will do well to protect himself commodus be well disposed toward he commodus might send for he -- as he will surely send for I if belly-burning set in he and i would make a good pair to be blame for murder a emperor you run urge sextus go now go to my camp in the aventine you will find norbanus and two freedman wait near the porta capena they be wear farmer ' clothes and look as if they come from sicily they know you say i bade they take you into hide galen smile at he and you he ask narcissus shall smuggle I into the palace it be i who will slay commodus lest pertinax should stain he hand if they prefer to turn on I what matter pertinax if he be to be caesar will do better not to mount the throne all bloody let he blame I and then execute I rome will reap the benefit marcium have the praetorian guard well under control what with she bribe and all the license she have beg for they let marcium proclaim that pertinax be caesar the praetorian guard will follow suit and the senate will confirm it so soon after daybreak that the citizen will find themselves obey a new caesar before they

faction against faction they be mean man all so full of mutual suspicion as to heave a huge sigh when they know that pertinax be caesar know he will overlook they plot and rule without bloodsh if that can be do but it can not be unless pertinax be man enough to strike the blow that shall restore the ancient liberty then he be better dead before he try to play the savior we have a tyrant now shall we exchange he for a weak-kneed theorist be you ready to die galen why not be you the only roman i be not so old i have no virtue leave a little wisdom come with old age sextus it be better to live for one 's country than to die for it but since no way have be invent of avoid death it be wiser to die usefully than like a sandal throw on to the rubbish-heap because the fashion change i wish you would speak plainly galen i have tell you all my secret you have see I risk my life a thousand time in the midst of commodus ' informer come and go interview this and that one urge here restrain there

talk suggest but forever do nothing violent you know as well as i do there be nothing ready he retort long ago i could have have a thousand armed man wait for a moment such as this to rally behind pertinax but i listen to you -- and be accordingly alive not crucify say galen the praetorian guard be well able to slaughter any thousand man to uphold commodus or to put pertinax in the place of commodus you thousand man would only decorate a thousand gibbet whether pertinax should win or lose if he should win and become caesar he would have to make they a example of he love of law and order prove he impartiality by blame they for what he never invite they to do for mark this : pertinax have never name himself as commodus ' successor i warn you : there be far less safety for he friend than for he enemy unless he with he own hand strike the blow that make he emperor if marcium should do it -- that would be the end of marcium if i should do it that would be the end of you my sextus let we say farewell then galen this right hand shall do it it will save my friend it will provide a culprit on whom pertinax may lay the blame he will ascend the throne unguilty of he predecessor 's blood -- and you ask galen i will take my own life i will gladly die when i have rid rome of commodus he pause await a reply but galen appear almost rudely unconcerned you will not say farewell it be too soon galen answer folding up he powder in a sheet of parchment tie it at great pain to arrange the package neatly will you not wish I success that be something my sextus that i have no powder for i have occasionally cure man i can set most kind of fracture with considerable skill old though i be and i can divert a man 's attention sometimes so that he let nature heal he of mysterious disease but success be something you have already wish for and have already make or unmade what you do my sextus be the scaffolding of what you do now this in turn of what you will do next i give you my advice i bade you run away -- in which case i would bid you farewell but not otherwise i will not run i hear you and you say you be sentimental galen i have prove it to you if i be not i myself would

and the cure depart give praise there will be no hero leave in rome when they have slay we roman hercule say galen he have be a triton in a pond of minnow you and i and all the other little man may not regret he afterward since hero and particularly mad one be not madly love but we will not enjoy the rivalry of minnow he lead sextus to the porch and stand there for a minute hold to he arm there will be no rival who will dare to raise they head say sextus once we pertinax have make he bid for power but he will not galen answer he will hesitate and let other do the bidding too many scruple he who would govern a empire might better have fetter on foot and hand now go but go not to the palace if you hope to see a heroism -- or tomorrow 's dawn xii-long live caesar that night it rain the wind blow yell squall along the street at interval the din of hail on cobble-stone and roof become a stinging sea of sound the waver oil lantern die out one by one and leave the street in darkness in which now and then a slave-borne litter labor like a boat catch spread too much sail the overloaded sewer back up and make pool of foulness difficult to ford along the tiber bank there be panic where the river-boat be plunge and break adrift on the rise flood and miserable drenched slave labor with the bale of merchandize haul the threaten stuff to higher ground but the noisiest dismalest place be the palace the heart of all rome where the rain and hail din down on marble there be havoc in the clump of ornamental tree -- crash of pot blow down from balcony -- thunder of rent awning and the splashing of countless cataract where overloaded gutter spill they surplus on mosaic pavement fifty or a hundred foot below no light show save at the guard-house by the main gate where a group of sentry shrug themselves against the wall -- ill-tempered shiver alert however mutinous a roman army or a legion or a guard might be its individual be loyal to the routine work of military duty a decurion step out beneath a splash arch the lamplight gleam on he wetted bronze and crimson narcissus yes i recognize you who be this narcissus and sextus be shroud in loose hooded cloak of raw wool under which they hug a change of footgear sextus have he face well cover narcissus push he forward under the guard-room arch out of the rain this be a man from antioch whom caesar tell I to present to he he say i know he well he name be marius i have no order to admit a man of that name narcissus wax confidential do you wish to get both of we into trouble he ask you know caesar 's way he say bring he and forget i suppose to tell he secretary to write the order for admission tonight he will remember my speak to he about this expert with a javelin and if i have to tell he -- speak with the centurion the decurion beckon they into the guard-house where a fire burn in a bronze tripod cast a warm glow on wall hang with shield and weapon a centurion munch oily seed and wipe he mouth with the back of he hand come out of a inner office he be not the type that have make roman arm invincible he lack the self-reliant dignity of a old campaigner substitute for it self-assertiveness and flashy manners he be annoyed because he could not get the seed out of he mouth with he finger in time to look aristocratic what now narcissus by bacchus no no irregularity tonight the very god themselves be imitate caesar 's ill-humor who be it you have bring narcissus beckon the centurion toward the corner between fire and wall where he could whisper without risk of be overhear marcium tell I to bring this man tonight in hope of make caesar change he mood he be a javelin-thrower -- a expert have he a javelin under the cloak the centurion ask suspiciously he be unarmed of course do you take we for madman all rome be mad tonight say the centurion or i would not be argue with a gladiator tell I what you know a sentry say you see the death of pavonius nasor all the sentry who be in the tunnel at the time be under lock and key and i expect to be order to have the poor devil kill to silence they and now bultius livius -- have you hear about it i have hear caesar send for he well if caesar have send for this friend of yours he have better first make sacrifice to he god and pray for something better than befall poor livius yourself too they say livius be be rack -- doubtless to make he tell more than he know i smell panic in the air with all these palace slave come and go you can not check rumor and i 'll wager there be already a exodus from rome god what a night for travel morning will see the country road all choke with the conveyance of bog up senator let we pray this friend of yours may soften caesar 's mood where be he admission paper as i tell the decurion i have none that settle it then he can not enter no risk -- not when i know the mood we commodus be in the commander might take the responsibility but not i where be he ask narcissus where any lucky fellow be on such a night -- in bed i would not dare to send for he for less than riot mutiny and all rome burning let you man wait here go you into the palace and get a write permit for he but nothing be more probable than that such a permit would be unobtainable sextus step into the firelight pull back the hood to let the centurion see he face by mar ' red plume be you the man they call maternus sextus retort with a challenge : now will you send for you commander he know I well dioscuri doubtless probably you rob he of he purse by romulus and remus what be happen to rome that fall star last night portend do it that a highwayman should dare to try to enter caesar 's palace ho there decurion bring four man the decurion clank in he man surround sextus at a gesture i ought to put you both in cell say the centurion but you shall have a chance to justify yourself narcissus go on in bring caesar 's write order to release this man maternus -- if you can narcissus like all gladiator have be train in facial control lest a antagonist should be forewarn by he expression nevertheless he be hard put to it to hide the fear that seize he he suppose not even marcia would dare openly to come to sextus ' rescue that man be my only friend he say let I have word with he first not one word the centurion make a gesture with he head the guard take sextus by the arm and march he out into the night he know better than to waste energy or arouse anger by resist then i will go to the commander i go straight to he narcissus stammer idiot do not you know that marcium protect maternus otherwise how should a outlaw whose face be so well know that you recognize he instantly -- how should he dare to approach the palace the centurion touch he forehead mad i daresay go on in get marcium 's protection for he bring I she command in write wait though -- let I look at you he make narcissus throw he heavy cloak off clean he leg and change into he other foot-gear then he examine he costume even on a night like this they would punish I for let a man pass who be not dress right let I see you be not free yet you do not have to wear a toga i spend half my day teach clodhopper how to fold hire toga properly behind the neck it be the only way you can tell a slave from a citizen these day the praetorian guard ought to be recruit from the tailor ' shop lace up you sandal properly now -- any weapon underneath that tunic sullenly narcissus hold he arm up and submit to be search he usually come and go unchallenged be know as one of caesar 's favorite but the centurion 's suspicion be arouse they be almost confirm a moment later the decurion return and lay a long lean dagger on the table take from the prisoner he report it be hide beneath he tunic he look desperate enough to kill himself so i leave two man to keep a eye on he the centurion scratch he chin again he mouth half-open whom do you propose to visit in the palace he demand marcium say narcissus the centurion turn to the decurion go you with he hand he over to the hall-attendant bid they pass he from hand to hand into marcium 's presence do not return until you have word he have reach she to all intent and purpose a prisoner narcissus be march along the mosaic pavement of a bronze-roofed colonnade whose marble column flank the approach to the palace step drench guard post near the eaves where water splash on they clang they shield in darkness as the decurion pass there be not a square yard of the palace grounds unwatched there be a halt beside the little marble pavilion near the palace step where the decurion turn narcissus over to a attendant in palace uniform but no comment the palace be too use to see favorite of one day in disgrace the next within the palace there be draughtily light gloom a sensation of dread and mysterious restlessness the bronze door lead to the emperor 's apartment be shut and guard post outside they who demand extremely definite reason for admit any one even when the centurion 's message be deliver some one have to be send in first to find out whether marcium be willing and for nearly half a hour narcissus wait bite he lip with impatience when he be send for at last and accompany in he find marcium pertinax and galen seat unattended in the gorgeous quiet anteroom next to the emperor 's bedchamber the outer storm be hardly audible through the window-shutter but there be a atmosphere of impend climax like the hush and rumble that precede eruption marcium nod and dismiss the attendant who have bring narcissus there be a strained look about she eye a tightening at the corner of the mouth she voice be almost hoarse : what be it you bring bad news narcissus what have happen sextus have be arrest by the main gate guard galen come out of a reverie pertinax bit at he nail and look startled worry have make he look as old as galen but he shoulder be erect and he be very splendid in he jeweled full dress none speak they wait on marcium who turn the news over in she mind a minute when why she ask at last he propose i should smuggle he in that he might be of service to you he be stormy-minded he say rome may need a determine man tonight but the centurion of the guard recognize he -- know he be maternus he refuse to summon the commander sextus be lock in a cell and there be no know what the guard may do to he they may try to make he talk please write and order he release yes order he release say pertinax but marcium 's strained lip flicker with the vestige of a smile a determine man she say she eye on pertinax by morning a determine man might give he own command sextus be safe where he be let he stay there until you have power to release he go and wait in the outer room narcissus narcissus have no alternative though he could sense the climax with the marrow of he bone he do not dare to disobey he might have rush into the emperor 's bedroom to denounce the whole conspiracy and offer himself as bodyguard in the emergency that might have win commodus ' gratitude it might have open up a way for liberating sextus but there be irresolution in the air and besides he know that sextus would reckon it a treason to himself to be make beholden for he life to commodus nor would he forgive betrayal of he friend pertinax and marcium and galen so narcissus who care only for sextus reckoning no other man on earth he friend go and sit beyond the curtain in the smaller outer room strain he ear to catch the conversation and wonder what tragedy the god might have in store as gladiator he philosophy be mixed of fatalism cynical irreverence a semi-military instinct of obedience short-sightedness and self-will he reckon marcia no better than himself because she too be bear in slavery -- and pertinax not vastly better than himself because he be a charcoal-burner 's son but it do not enter he head just then that he might be capable of make history marcium well understand he know that he could not escape to confer with the slave in the corridor because the door lead to the corridor from the smaller anteroom be lock she be at no pain to prevent he overhear anything he could be deal with either way at she convenience a reward might seal he lip or she could have he kill the instant that he usefulness be end which be possibly not yet sextus she say must be deal with pertinax you be the one who should attend to it as governor of rome you can -- he be thoroughly faithful say pertinax he have be very useful to we yes say marcium but usefulness have limit time come when wine jar need reseal else the wine spill galen go in and see the emperor galen shake he head he be a sick man say marcium i think he have a fever galen shake he head again i will not have it say i poison he nonsense who know that you mix any poison sextus for one galen answer dea dium there you be say marcium i tell you pertinax you sextus may prove to be another livius he have be as ubiquitous as the plague he know everything what if he should turn around and secure himself and he estate by tell commodus all he know it be you who trust livius do you never learn by you mistake we do not know yet what livius have tell say pertinax if he have be tortured -- but he be not commodus slew he with he own hand i know that be true it be tell I by the steward of the bedchamber who see it and who help to dispose of the body commodus swear that such a creep spy as livius who could be true to nobody but scribble scribble scribble in a journal all the scandal he could learn in order to betray anybody when it suit he be unfit to live i take that for a sign that commodus have have a change of heart it be a manly thing to slay that wretch he will have a change of governor of rome before the day dawn marcium retort if it be not that he might change he mistress at the same time -- you would betray I -- eh pertinax smile at she tolerantly no say marcium i would let you have you own way and be execute you deserve it pertinax pertinax stand up and pace the floor with hand behind he i will have my own way i will have it marcium he say calmly come to a stand in front of she he who plot against he emperor may meet the like fate if commodus have no design against I then i harbor none against he i be not sure i be fit to be caesar i have none to rally to I to rely on except the praetorian guard which be a two-horned weapon they could turn on I as easily and put a man of they own choosing on the throne and furthermore i do not wish to be caesar glabrio for instance be a better man than i be for the task i will only consent to you desperate course for the sake of rome if you can prove to I that commodus design a wholesale massacre and even so if you name and galen 's and mine be not on he proscription list -- if he only intend that be to punish christian and weaken the faction of that carthaginian severus i will observe my oath of loyalty i will counsel moderation but -- you be less than half a man without you mistress marcium explode do not stand try to impress I with you dignity i do not believe in it i will send for cornificium no no pertinax show instant resolution cornificium shall not be drag in the responsibility be yours and mine let we not lessen we dignity by involve a innocent woman for a moment that make marcium breathless she be stagger by he innocence not he assertion of cornificium 's -- bemused by the man 's ability to believe what he choose to believe as if cornificium have not be the very first who plot to make he caesar cornificium more than any one have contrived to suggest to the praetorian guard that they interest might best be serve some day by befriend pertinax she more than any one have disarm commodus ' suspicion by complain to he about pertinax ' lack of self-assertiveness which have become commodus ' chief reason for not mistrust he by pretend to report to commodus the private doings of pertinax and a number of other important people cornificium have undermine commodus ' faith in he secret informer who might else have be dangerous you cornificium marcium begin then change she mind disillusionment would do no good she must play on the man 's illusion that he be the master of he own will very well she go on yours be the decision no woman can decide such issue we be all in you hand -- cornificium and galen -- all of we -- aye and rome too -- and even sextus and he friend but you will never have another such opportunity it be tonight or never pertinax he wince he be about to speak but something interrupt he the great door carve with cupid lead to the emperor 's bedchamber open inch by inch and telamonion come out close it softly behind he caesar sleep say the child and the wind blow out the lamp he be very cross it be dark it be cold and lonely in there in he hand he hold a sheet of parchment cover with write and crease from he attempt to make a parchment helmet show I he say hold out the sheet to marcia she take he on she knee and begin read what be write put he

mention the first six name be in this order : galen marcium cornificium pertinax narcissus sextus alia maternus do you realize what that mean it be now or never why have he put galen first i wonder galen do not appear startle he interest be philosophical -- impersonal i should be first i be guiltiest i teach he in he youth he remark smile thinly i teach he how to loose the beast that live in he not intend that of course but it be what we do that count i should come first the state would have be better for the death of many a man whom i cure but i do not cure commodus i reveal he to himself and he fall in love with himself and -- now will you poison he say marcia no say galen let he kill I it be better god have rome no iron leave you pertinax say marcium go in and kill he pertinax stand

of a angry beast than human speech : marcium do you hear I marcia by all olympus -- marcium she open the door the inner room be in darkness there come a gust of chill wet wind that make all the curtain flutter and there be a comfortless noise of cataract of rain downpouring from the over-loaded gutter on to marble balcony then the emperor 's voice again : be that you marcia you leave you commodus to die of thirst i parch -- i have a fever -- bring my wine-cup at once commodus she glance at the golden cup on a onyx table on a stand beside it be a unpierced wine jar set in a enormous

man might poison I bring I the cup and you fill it yourself make haste before i die of thirst then bring I another lamp and dose the shutter no slave -- i can not bear the sight of they instantly commodus i be come with it now only wait while i pierce the amphora she close the door and look swiftly once again at pertinax he frown over the list of name and do not look at she she walk straight up to galen give I she demand hold out she hand he draw a little parchment package from he bosom and she clutch it say nothing galen be the one who speak : responsibility be he who order may the god see that it fall where it belong she take no notice of he speech but stand for a moment untie the string of the package frown to herself then bite the string through and clutch the little package in she fist take a gilded tool from beside the snow-bowl and pierce the seal of the amphora then she put the poison in the bottom of the golden cup and pour the wine -- with difficulty since the jar be heavy but pertinax who watch intently make no movement to assist she stir the wine with one of she long hair-pin marcium roar commodus i be come now she go into the bedroom leave the door not quite
