wander round the droop thatch like some poor exile thence to catch fond glimpse of each well-loved room and sigh beside the unraised latch -- o unseen wind art thou alone thus breathe round the sleep

ground the rank and ragged herbage rot on many a mound and desolate pool and marsh deadly lie around there be no life nor motion save the wind that fly with the close-muffled cloud in silence through the sky there be no sound to stir it save the bittern 's cry the bittern sit sadly on the fluted edge of pillar once the prop and pride of palace ledge now smear would with damp decay and sink in slimy sedge shatter would and sunken with the sculptured architrave peer above the surface of the sluggish wave like a gaunt limb thrust fleshless from a shallow grave the bittern sitteth sadly on the time-worn stone upon life 's moulder relic fearfully alone sear the silence ofttime with he solemn tone the bittern -- monarch of the sad and dreary place mock the pride and pageant of a ruin would race whose very name 's forget and whose deed have leave no trace the pleasant song of peace the lute the lover 's sigh the statesman 's eloquence the warrior 's battle-cry have pass would -- and like they echo from the heedless sky the lonely bittern 's note come sadly float by oh melancholy sound shall thus for ever end the glory and the greatness whither all hope tend and as the past come boom shall the present wend no ear to listen to the old and hard-earn would glory that wear the heart out make the lock grow scant and hoary no ear to listen and no tongue to tell the story the bittern sitteth ` midst the marsh of the past sitteth amidst the ruin whilst the hour fleet fast and at he own hoarse cry he looketh round aghast the hour fleet fast unnoted and the time be nigh when even he on noiseless wing shall soar on high till he deep note be lose amid the azure sky go the night be dark and evermore the thick drop patter on the pane the wind be weary of the rain and round the thatch moaneth sore dark be the night and cold the air and all the tree stand stark and bare with leaf spread dank and sere below slow rot on the plashy clay in the god 's - acre far away where she o god lie cold below -- cold cold below and many a bitter day and night have pour would they storm upon she breast and chill have she in she long long rest with foul corruption 's icy blight earth 's dew be freezing round the heart where love alone so late have part and evermore the frost and snow be burrow downward through the clay in the god 's - acre far away where she o god lie cold below -- cold cold below those eye so full of light be dim and the clear chalice of she youth all sparkling up with love and truth have death drain would keenly from the brim -- no more can mortal ear rejoice in the soft music of she voice no wistful eye through tear of woe can pierce down through the heavy clay in the god 's - acre far away where she o god lie cold below -- cold cold below a star shine sudden from the sky -- god 's angel cometh pure and bright make a radiance through the night unto the place where mute i lie gaze up in rapt devotion shake by a deep emotion and my thought no longer go wander o'er the plashy clay in the god 's - acre far away where she o god _ lay _ cold below -- cold cold below god 's angel ah i divinely bright but still the olden grace be there -- the soft brown eye -- the raven hair -- the gentle smile of calm delight that could such peace and joy impart -- the veil be rent from off my heart and gaze upward well i know the rain may beat upon the clay in the god 's - acre far away but she no longer lie below enshroud by the frost and snow -- cold cold below beatrice di tenda 1 it be too sweet -- such dream do ever fade when sorrow shake the sleeper from he rest -- life still to I have be a masquerade woe in mirth 's wildest gayest mantle drest with the heart hide -- but the face display would but now the vizard droppeth crush would and tear and there be nought left but some tinsell would rag to mock the wearer in the face of morn as through the gaping world she feebly drag she day-born measure of reproach and scorn but that _ he _ hand should pluck the dream away -- and thus -- and thus -- o heaven it strike too deep the knife that wound I if not mean to slay stumble upon my heart the while i weep : so be it no hand of mine its course shall stay false false to he release I -- let I go before heaven 's judgment-seat to make appeal unfold the record of this life and show all that the secret page can reveal that heaven and earth the inmost truth may know he can not think it in he heart of heart he can not wear this falsehood in he soul or deem I perjur would no delusive art can make he blot my name from honor 's scroll : the sun will shine forth when the cloud depart patience my heart error be quick but truth move slowly but move surely up the earth wipe from age the heresy of youth and kindling warmth on the once blast hearth : patience my heart and rage will turn to ruth there be no blush upon my brow though tear be in mine eye and sorrow in my heart this sob breast heave not with traitor fear : no sigh for sin be these that sadly start and bear they bitter burden to thine ear and though my woman 's strength bend like a reed before the flow of affliction 's river not not for shame nor for one strumpet deed doth this weak frame bow down or faintly quiver as i stand forth alone in deadly need no before thee filippo and the world case in its petty panoply of scorn with myriad slavish lip in mock curl

closer than each hot word by torment rack would fly at the bidding of false tyranny that make at will the pain-wrung falsehood fact there be full many sin confess would my lord in pain of body and in pain of soul some from the heart unearth would by fire and sword and steal forth amid the spirit 's dole with fiery pain-sweat seething every word but none my lord that riseth to the sky bear guilt of

day of yore yet be the spirit strong within I still and bear I up though manhood 's strength succumb unbent by any blighting blast of ill through fiery trial to all false witness dumb they can not stain I though perchance they kill i be a woman -- weak to combat wrong but innocent my lord i live or die and silent though my god doth tarry long he see I throughly with he holy eye and in my sore sore need doth make I strong this hapless youth i do forgive he all e ` en now remorse must rankle in he breast and no cool comfort cometh at he call to set the tumult of he soul at rest : god 's pity

weight of pain cast backward from the unforgotten past darkness no longer muffle time 's slow tread till my own pulse-beat mark the moment flee over the speeding shadow calm and clear rise the star of morn upon the earth eternal prophet of the sun-god 's birth shine serenely from its silver sphere mute mystic meaning on the strengthen would soul till all its night-bred vapor backward roll oh bright-eyed angel of the undimm would light stand upon heaven 's pinnacle thy glance pierce like two-edged sword through many a trance divide truth from dream in its might scourge doubt 's myriad from day 's temple-gate leave life 's worship pure its heart elate no herald thou of night like hesper fair pale with the dreaded future 's shapeless gloom lead the spirit to a unknown doom through cloud and darkness heavy fraught with care hesper the beautiful alone we guide beset by blind fear on every side grope through night 's dim chamber wearily longing to leave its cold sepulchral aisle comest thou with thy calm assure smile like nemesis to lead we tenderly through all the danger of the murky way unto the golden portal of the day yea night and death shall pass away and we by resurrection sweet arise new-born like thee in glory bright one son of morn without a shade on we felicity eye the fleeting vapor of the past as thou dost now night 's mist dissolve fast the delectable mountain how light and pleasant be the way across this quiet valley whose soft mead spring lightly as the air that angel tread beneath we footstep weariless all day this crystal river flow by we side one stream of sunshine still have seem would a guide from heaven in pure angelical array these purple mountain now be nigh that all the valley through have fill would we eye with day-dream of the distant paradise they sun-surrounded summit can descry -- we mount they now upon hope 's bound wing that make each short swift footstep long to spring suddenly upward to the shadeless sky the air methink be lighter here -- and the breast heave with full untrammell would ease drink the life-draught of the fragrant breeze that waft its soul-sigh to another sphere earth groweth little in we eye but fair fair as though sin have never enter would there -- earth groweth little as heaven draweth near this rock -- and then at last we stand upon the silent summit -- scarce i dare gaze outward through the clear and azure air towards the radiance of the promised land : i be so weak and fall friend i fear mine eye will dazzle and the light appear darkness so that i shall not see the promised land look thou afar and tell I true what thou discernest -- oh my eye grow dim and flood of golden glory seem to swim wave upon wave through all the cloudless blue blind I with they sunny splendor quite so that amid the pure excess of light but vaguest vision faintly glimmer through yet now methink i seem to see one spot of burn brightness beam clear through all the float glory like a sphere quenching light with its own intensity yes yes it be the holy city i behold with god 's sun from its tower of burnish would gold reflect broadly through immensity i must gaze out although i die : ah yes i see it through my longing tear -- a great clear glow of glory there appear like a light-fountain in the eastern sky that as i gaze pour forth its living light flooding creation till the dazzle sight see heaven in all thing that around it lie so shall it ever henceforth be -- who that discerneth once god 's dwelling-place can blot from vision the refulgent trace ay henceforth all thing shall be heaven to I -- and as i journey on shall brightly rise divinest semblance of paradise -- heaven mine in time and in eternity the dark river across the mountain and the hill across the valley and the swell sea by lake and river whose deep murmur fill earth 's dream with sweet prophetic melody together have we come unto this place and here we say farewell a little space : you backward turn through the land to tarry ` mid its beauty yet awhile -- i o'er the river to another strand with cheerful heart so part we with a smile shall space have any power o'er god-like soul love shall bridge o'er the stream that ` twixt we roll together wend we to the tide and as the first wave wet my foot we part -- e ` en now methink i see the other side and though the stream be swift a steady heart and stalwart arm shall quell its cold dark wave faith falter not e ` en when the tempest rave dark stream flow so blackly on thy turbid billow roll o'er golden sand beneath the surface all thy fear be go and precious gem fill full the diver 's hand yet how the heart list breathless for the roar of billow plash on the other shore _ the other shore _ -- oh thou dim land hide by faint mist from the spend swimmer 's eye until upon the sloping bank he stand mute in the light of eden-mystery thou golden ophir of youth 's spirit-dream shall i then reach thee through this turbid stream friend quail not this same gloomy tide roll its fearful breaker to the shore shall be transform would upon the other side into the crystal life-stream shaded o'er by paradisal grove whose mellow fruit shall heal the sorrow of the destitute these ghostly vapor brood low shall melt to sunny glory o'er my head and through they shall the golden city glow whither i hasten singing angel-led friend there be but a cloud-veil ` twixt we and the light one step beyond and heaven be in we sight now the stream lap my vesture hem back thou from my sad bosom to the world leave I here this current cold to stem soon from thy sight shall i be swiftly whirl would into the mystic darkness -- never fear god 's hand shall guide I unto vision clear already thou art grow dim and distant on the fast recede shore the tide be strong but still i trust in he and know that i shall safely struggle o'er for now the plash on yonder shore i hear amid sweet angel voice calm and clear wytham wood ` mid the wave wood of wytham now so far so far from I where the grand old beech be and the deer-herd feeding by they : ` mid the mossy wood of wytham oft i roam in memory down the grand wide-arching alley marge by plumy fern and flower whence all through the noontide hour many a fearless leveret sally for amid those grassy alley never hound nor huntsman scour still i see through leafy casement wytham hall so quaint and old remnant of the age of gold gable o'er from roof to basement in most fanciful enlacement look far o'er wood and wold with the mere outspread before it whitest swan upon its tide that in mystic beauty glide and the wild fowl flap o'er it to the reed that broadly shore it spear-like on the sunny side through the wave wood of wytham now so far so far from I where i roam in memory ` mid the leaf or flash by they like sunshine to glorify they on my sunless heart gleam she fall like the dream of summer make holy all the place vision of that sweet pale face sweeter than all dream of summer dearer than all dream of summer still in bower and glade i trace still she eye come deeply glowing through the leafy lattice and the rustle of the tree ` neath the west wind softly blow only emulate the flow of she love-toned melody oh those wave wood of wytham -- cease she thus to hover near radiant from she happy sphere like sunshine to glorify they never would i wander nigh they -- madly weep should i fly they till they memory e ` en grow sere but ah no in endless slimmer roam my heart through wytham wood meet in they solitude evermore that angel comer sweeter than the light of summer make golden wytham wood now so far so far from I in the world of memory the star in the east o'er the wide world i wander evermore through wind and weather heedless and alone alike through summer and through winter hoar on cloud-capt mountain by the sea-wash 'd shore seek the star that riseth in the east o'er the wide world -- the world that know not why and stare with stupid scorn to see I go whilst i with solemn secret face pass by to laugh in desert spot where none be nigh laugh loud and shrill unto the wind ho ho for that which none but i and _ it _ do know to think how when i find this lucky star and stand beneath it like the wise of old i shall mount upward on a golden car girt round with glory unto world afar while earth amaze the wonder shall behold that bear I unto happiness untold hush i 'll not whisper it lest some should hear and hurry on before I to the spot leave I bind for ever to this sphere part for ever from my child -- i here she in the realm that i could enter not hush i must hurry on -- for many night have i seek for the star about the sky and find it not amid the myriad light greater and lesser with they satellite flash confusedly upon mine eye i must unravel every golden hair upon the brow of night for what i seek lift every straggler from its moony lair lest too _ the _ star should haply linger there unnoted by mine eye so faint and weak for as the wise man do in old time trace the holy child by this same guide star so i know well that by the virgin 's grace i too by it shall come unto the place where my sweet babe and its nurse-angel be wearisome be the day they mock I so pour down light that seem to bid I see yet hide the starry pilot by its glow whose light i thirst for whilst light-fountain flow around I like the swell of the sea wearisome be they till the sun-god pale beneath the surge of the western wave and the last fold of he golden mantle trail o'er the horizon where earth 's vision fail and space become a darkness and a grave i ofttimes think to curse the day that try to keep my babe hide in its envious breast smit with its hair of gold and large blue eye close hide within its mantle careless of my sigh that night and day must wake it from its rest but patience when the sun be in the deep the star will beam upon I suddenly and ere the sun-god waketh from he sleep the dear one shall be mine for whom i weep mine mine alone for all eternity they call I craze -- ha ha -- they little know who be the craze of earth or they or i -- they by they greed of gold urge to and fro for petty pleasure bend god 's soul low -- i seek for my star about the sky when it be find -- when it be find how great will be the wonder of these blind and mad how great will be the wonder and the hate wake to see the glorious truth too late will _ he _ too see he error and be sad the wind sweep weirdly o'er the heaven to-night weirdly and black as though from guilty deed -- from some sad shipwreck it have take flight leave the drown in they direful plight -- leave the drown would low wave in the weed no star no star again oh woe again night drown I in its darkness and its gloom and i must crouch amidst the wind and rain without one hope-gleam lighten my pain all thing be league to darken down my doom perchance it be that i be grow weak and faint with wander afar afar and my dim eye see not the thing i seek and yet i must not ask i must not speak nor tell -- the secret of the savior star no dumb -- dumb -- i shall set I down to scan each twinkling orb that rolleth up through space hesper heaven 's loveliest lead up the van -- to-morrow -- yes to-morrow i shall watch and man shall see this wonder when i reach the place will the babe know I -- ope its sweet blue eye -- and stretch its little arm to clasp I round ah yes god will send knowledge from the sky in pity for my prayer and tear and sigh angel will sing for joy that i have find my treasure and _ he _ -- he will hear the sound cold -- cold it be -- the wind be bitter chill -- and the rain fall like curse on my head -- no no not curse for the drop say still that there be a end to sorrow and all ill flow from we like the water down a hill the star shall shine and all the cloud be speed \* \* \* \* \* the sought-for star uprose upon the dead under the sea deep in the bosom of the ocean where sunshine fade to twilight gloom the pure pearl lie and the coral bloom rest unsway would by the upper motion -- calm and still the hour pass by the lovely thing that sleep lie deep in the bosom of the ocean the thunder roll from cloud to cloud and the bitter blast sweep o'er the sea shake the water mightily but ne'er the tempest 's voice so loud sinketh down to the thing that lie -- the lovely thing that sleep lie deep in the bosom of the ocean the iceberg

sun 's warm gaze god-like all-seeing fall right down through space and the weak earth quite smitten by its ray lie scorch would and powerless with mute silent face like a tranced body where no change glow tell that the life-stream through its channel flow people it be by nation scant and few set far apart among the trackless sand unlearn would uncultured wild and swart of hue roam the desert in divide band where the green pasture call they and the deer troop yet within the range of bow and spear unhappy afric can thy boundless plain where the royal lion snuff the free pure air and every breeze laugh at the tyrant 's chain be but the nest of slavery and despair rearing a brood whose craven soul can be robb would of the very dream of liberty but as the shore of this vast sea of sand stretch afar a country rich and green with wave foliage shade all the land and flow water bright with sunny sheen and here browse countless herd of dappled deer blesbok and antelope remote from fear

hellish din and wake to fury lust and bloody hate so that with battle foray murder theft ring oft the echo of the mountain cleft there be one tribe that in unconscious ease slumber would and thought of danger but in dream hear not the tramp of man upon the breeze while the star watch with faint tremble beam see noiseless spectre round the village creep like apparition of unquiet sleep then silence-murder would what a yell arise and the scared sleeper rush forth in fear meet death without the portal from dim foe or e'er the warrior could grasp he spear or fit the arrow to he unstrung bow or ward the fatal stroke that lay he low so with the plunder and a capture band of hapless woman ere the morning light flit the victor swiftly through the land red with the trophy of they deadly fight leave the lion and he hungry crew to clear the morning of this bloody dew to meet they joyous forth they woman come and lead they back in triumph to the fold taunt they foe with many a bitter shame though now they lay in death 's aim stark and cold : whilst the poor captive rack would with fear and woe cower would close together from fate 's hapless blow soon there come trader from the coast and then the weep captive all be marshall would out and barter would singly with the heartless man each bosom tremble still with fear and doubt but when the truth burst on they a hoarse cry of wild despair ascend to the sky there be one there who from the tree of life pluck would yet the blossom with the fruit of year scarce yet a woman though a meek-soul would wife and with a babe to claim she prayer and tear a tender bud of early summer time ere breezy wood be in they verdant prime she ` mongst the rest they barter would and the child too young to sever from its mother 's breast leave they unnoticed whilst she poor one wild ` twixt hope and fear still hold it closely prest unto she heart whose throbbing loud and deep beat a alarum through the infant 's sleep but soon she master as he hasten would off with he new purchase the infant catch and bid the mother with a heartless scoff fling it away : say he ` tis good for nought none of this lumber can we have the road be long enough to tread without a load the mother clasp have she babe with bitter cry but a rude hand enforce it from she arm and the rough steward hold it up on high laughing aloud the while at she alarm say he unto he master this shall be a bait to draw she on with willingly he bind around the infant 's waist a line that fasten would to he crupper and then give the babe back to she laughing -- that end 's thine -- the other stay with I a witty slave the master chuckle and they move away she follow with anguish and dismay they journey would o'er the desert ` neath a sky scorch would by the fiery footstep of the sun without a shade to bless the wistful eye and soon she fellow slave droop would one by one callous to blow that harshly drive they on strength hope and love of life all seem go but she go onward with no word or plaint clasp the child unto she bosom still unflagg when all else begin to faint intent to save she little one from ill and they look would on she as she speed along wond ` ring what make so frail a creature strong at eve she bent above she sleeping treasure with eye that weep for pity and for love fill its cup of life in richer measure with the blest care that watch we above and in the morn they bind the babe again and so draw on the mother in they train she tender foot soon wound be and sore with the rough travel and the weary way and she slight limb o'ertask would and loaded bear less lightly up they burden day by day but nature fail love impart power to bear she step up to the rest hour alas the mother gaze with ache eye upon the life-spring in she little child as one lay by a fountain while it dry daily she watch would it ebb till she grow wild with anguish at the angel drawing near and bare she own breast for he fatal spear she lose all sense of weariness and pain and with hot tearless eye still hurry on bear the child girt by its cruel chain all think save of she cherish would burden go fearful alone lest other eye should guess the feeble thing she longing arm do press at last they see the babe be weaker grow that soon the little spark of life must fade so spite of all she prayer and wild tear flow beside a spring the sleep child they lay and bid she onward heedless of she woe but on the earth she fall and would not go they raise she up and bind she on a steed and so march would onward on they weary way -- for there be none to help she in she need and thus they travell would eastward all the day but when they rest and on each bow would head sleep heavy lay the mother rise and flee and speed swiftly with a lapwing 's flight backward she hurry to the little spring lead by a power that knoweth not the night but fly through darkness with unerring wing and so e'er morning shimmer would in the east she clasp would she dead babe to she panting breast at morn they miss would she and the woman say she seek she babe beside the distant well there wilt thou find she if she be not dead for o the love of mother who can tell and so the steward gallop would back in haste to seek the lose one in the desert waste at last the spring rise in the distant sand with its close verdure pleasant to the eye and there as near it the place he scann would he see the mother with she infant lie quiet and stilly on each other 's breast fold together in unbroken rest she arm around it throw that e ` en in sleep still press have the infant to she stricken heart no rest so perfect no repose so deep from she sweet babe the mother 's love to part before he loud and bitter curse speed -- who hear he -- for the mother too lay dead sonnet datur hora quieti the sun be slowly sink in the west the plough lie idle and the weary team cool would with the freshness of the shallow stream over the meadow hasten to they rest the breeze be hush would and no more turn the mill with its light sail upon yon rise crest its busy music now awhile be still and not a sound heave up from nature 's breast the bark upon the river smoothly ride with sail all furl would and flag that listless fall unrock would unshaken by the flow tide the cattle lazy lie within the stall and thus the time-stream on doth sweetly glide bear repose and slumber unto all sea

rough and torn whet he grimy beak upon the bark and croak hoarsely to the wood forlorn blood red the sky and misty in the east -- low vapor creep bleakly o'er the hill -- the rain will soon come plashing on the rill -- no sound in all the place of bird or beast save that hoarse croak that all the woodland fill a slimy pool all rank with rot weed close by the pine there at the highway side no ripple on its green and stagnant tide where only cold and still the horse-leech breed -- ugh might not here some bloody murder hide pshaw cold the air slow steal through the tree scarce rustling the

earth a man have pass would away -- a mighty man that over many a field roll would back the tide of battle on the foe -- thus far no further shall thy billow go who freedom 's falchion do right nobly wield like potter 's vessel smite tyrant down and from earth 's strongest snatch victory 's crown upon the anvil of each battle-plain still beat sword to ploughshare all be past -- the glory and the

flower to the sleep of death far far away over land and sea like a band of spirit the passage-bird flee round the old gray spire in the evening calm no more they circle in sportive glee hear the hum of the vesper psalm and the swell of the organ so far below but far far away over land and sea in the still mid-air the swift passage-bird go over the earth that be scarcely see through the curtain of vapor that wave between o'er city and hamlet o'er hill and plain o'er forest green and o'er mountain hoar they flit like shadow and pass the shore and wing they way o'er the pathless main there be no rest for the weary wing no quiver bough where the foot can cling to the north to the south to the east to the west the ocean lie with its heave breast within it without it there be no rest the tempest gather beneath they far the wind-god ride on he battle-car and the roar of the thunder the lightning-flash break on the wave with a sullen crash but silence reign where the passage-bird fly and o'er they stretch the clear blue sky the day wear out and the starry night hush the world to sleep to sleep the dew-shower fall in the still moonlight and none wake now save those who weep but rustling on through the starry night like a band of spirit the passage-bird flee cleave the darkness above the sea swift and straight as a arrow 's flight be the wind they guide through the trackless sky for here there be no landmark to travel by the first faint streak of the morning glow like the feeble blush on the bud rose and in long gray line the cloud divide and march away with retreat night whilst the bright gleam of victorious light follow they goldenly far and wide : and when the mist have all pass would away and leave the heaven serene and clear as a eye that have never shed a tear and the universe bask in the smile of day dreamy and still and the sleepy breeze lazily move o'er the glassy sea the passage-bird flit o'er the disc of noon like shadow across a mirror 's face for now they journey wane apace and the realm of summer they 'll enter soon the land loom far through the water blue the land of promise the land of rest through cloud and storm they have travell would true and joy thrill now in each throbbing breast down they sink with a wheeling flight whilst the song of bird come float high and they pass the lark in the sunny sky but down without pause down they fly they travel be over they summer shine bright memnon hot blow the wild simoom across the waste the desert waste amid the dreary sand with fiery breath swift burn up the land o'er the scared pilgrim speeding

the savior light sun-born and bid the wild and desert waste rejoice -- again with sigh the loom darkness mourn thou watchman wait weary for the dawn breathing low longing for its golden light through the dim silence of the drowsy night what wistful sigh with thine be softly draw till day-beam on the darken 'd spirit smite the dawn light of knowledge smite thee now and forth from the dim past come

gentle spring the young the fair and with she smile subdue he frosty heart so that for very joy to see she there he soul relent play have the lover 's part and nought could bring too lovely or too sweet to lavish on the bright evangel 's head no flower too radiant for she tender foot no joy too blissful o'er she life to shed and thus the land become a paradise a new-made eden redolent of joy where beauty blossom would under sunny sky and peaceful pleasure reign would without alloy the land 's end i stand on the land 's end alone and still man might have be unmade for no frail trace of mortal labor startle the wild place and only sea-mews with they wail shrill circle beneath I over the dark sea flash the wave with pinion snowy white that glimmer would faintly in the gloomy light betwixt the foam furrow constantly it be a mighty cape that proudly rise above the world of water high and steep with many a scar and fissure fathom deep upon whose ledge lodge the endless snow a noble brow to a firm-founded world that at the limit of its empire stand front the ocean in its roughest mood and all its fury calmly backward hurl would the midnight sun rise like a angry god girt round with cloud through which a lurid glow fev ` rously tremble to the wave below and smite the water with a fiery rod above the glory circle up the sky fainter and fainter to the sullen gray till the black under-drift of cloud away go with the gathering wind and let it die a moan sound sweep o'er the heave ocean toss would hoarsely on from angry crest to crest like groan from a great soul in its unrest stir the rank of man to fierce commotion my longing vision measure the wide waste this can not be the end of thing that man should see he path lead on so short a span and then the unstable ocean mock he haste better have stay would where i could still look on and see a sturdy world to bear my foot than thus outstrip the multitude to cheat earth of its knowledge and here find it go a shadow rise betwixt I and the sky out of the ocean as it seem would that set a perfect shape before mine eye and yet hide not the sky that do behind it lie but through its misty substance all thing grow faint pale and ghostly and the rise sun gleam would like a fiery globe half quench would and dun through the sere shadow which the spectre throw : it answer would I man this be not the end

the meadow glide away till i could steal with heart elate unto the little cottage-gate in the sweet sweet olden time o well i mind the olden time the sweet sweet olden time how all the night i long would for morn and bless would the thrush whose early note the silver chord of silence smote with greeting to the day new-born for then again with heart elate i hope to meet she at the gate in the

coast rough blast begin to blow and toss the sea about in giant sport lurk without to catch unwary sail and snap they belly seam against the mast so guy lay idly wait in the port gaze out eastward through the stormy mist gaze out eastward morn and closing eve seek some break amid the hurtle cloud but many day the same wind strongly blow keep he bark close moor would within the bay jerk the

amongst he kin and still the east wind bluster have to the shore now guy whose ear still tingle all the day with these strange murmur of the troubled land begin to feel he heart with pity move and for he soul still fret at delay like a leash would hound that scent the flying game he straight resolve to take this quarrel up and for he country 's weal to slay the beast so he arise girt on he trusty sword and with he bow and quiver sling behind and at he belt he mighty battle-axe ride calmly forth to slay the hurtful beast and no man know that he be guy for all believe he far away on foreign

in he wrath at last he come unto the fearful spot mark would with the blanch bone of man and beast a thicket plant by a lonely heath o'ergrown with bramble and unwholesome weed that clasp tree around with witch-like arm poison would they life out and still hold they dead and at one side there stretch have a stagnant pool unstirr would by any grateful breeze but thick with slimy leaf and rush all

that thou art there -- and stand all weep at sleep 's golden gate till the leaf open and the glory stream down through my trancèd soul in radiant dream too short -- too short -- soon come the chilly morn to shake from love 's bough all they sleep-born bloom and wake my heart back to its bitter doom send I through the land down-cast forlorn whilst thou my beautiful art far away bear the brightness from my joyless day i stand and gaze across earth 's fairest sea and still the plashing of the restless main sound like the clashing of a prisoner 's chain that bind I oh my beautiful from thee oh sea-bird flash past on snow-white wing bear my soul to she in thy wander my heart be weary gaze o'er the sea o'er the long dreary line that close the sky through solemn sun-set ever mournfully gaze in vain my beautiful for thee hear the sullen wave for evermore dash around I on the lonely shore but tide creep lazily about the sand wash frail landmark lethe-like away and though they record perish day by day still stand i ever with close claspèd hand gaze far westward o'er the heave sea gaze in vain my beautiful for thee a night scene the light have fade from the little casement as though she closing eye have bring on night and now she dream -- ah dream supremely bright while silence reign around from roof to basement and slow the moon be mount up the sky draw heaven 's myriad in she queenly train fling rich largesse as she pass by of beauty freely over hill and plain around the lattice creep the pure white rose and one light bough rest gently on the pane the diamond pane through which the angel train gaze on the sister saint who there repose the moonlight silver softly o'er it now and round the eave the south wind whisper lowly wave the leaf like curl on maiden 's brow the peace and stillness make the place seem holy the little garden where she daily stray sleep like the precinct of a place enchanted and many a flower by she own dear hand plant wave mystically ` neath the starry ray there be such strange still beauty in the spot that in the misty moonshine oft it seem a vision that the wake eye see not but some fair plesaunce bloom up in dream the dew distillèd perfume richly rise and float unseen about the silent air breathing a balmy sweetness everywhere like some blest secret fresh from paradise upon the soul dim thought of eden press within the stillness of this inner shrine where nature have unveil would she loveliness and to the angel bare she soul divine there be no sound upon the ear of night the distant watch-dog 's bay have sink to rest the thrush be brooding o'er he quiet nest and the light cloud sweep on with noiseless flight o heart why beat so wildly -- she will hear and start from slumber in serene surprise -- away away why longer

heaven with thee my soul could fly scanning earth 's beauty with a lover 's eye trace the wave water and the wood they sleepy shades and silent solitude where all the summer through i long to lie o cloud so golden stealing o'er the sky sail would i within thy bosom o'er heaven 's main methink that gaze downward on the glory the liquid loveliness of sea and plain of mountain isle and leafy promontory my soul would melt and fall again in rain float down the river my little bark glide steadily along still and unshaken as a summer dream and never fall the oar into the stream for ` tis but morning and the current strong so let the ripple bear I as they will sweet sweet be life and every sound be song sorrow lie sleep and joy send I still swift float down the river bright shine the sun athwart the linden-tree one little cloud alone steal o'er the sky as o'er the widen stream below steal i fann would by the same faint perfume-laden breeze bird-music answer sweetly through the air the unheard warbling of heart melody thus go i dream free from faintest care swift float down the river pure lie the broad-leaved lily on the tide with glowing petal in the midst that rest like the gold shower on dana 's lovely breast and the tall rush cluster on the side ho sweet-lipp would lily thou must be my prize -- thus shall i pluck thee in thy beauty 's pride fail would -- all too steadily my shallop hie swift float down the river the stream fast widen and upon the shore rise busy hamlet ` mid the fall wood fill they shear and broken solitude with labor 's clamor ever more and more : no more no more in dream of love all day rich set in music from the forest hoar now gaily speed my untoss would bark away swift float down the river let I take oar and turn mine eager prow back to the quiet waveless source again where no harsh sound break on the dream brain and wind steal softly round the careless brow -- swift as a dream my tiny bark have go and stoutly though i ply the oar yet now my weary shallop still go sadly on swift float down the river ah never more for I -- ah never more return those bless morning hour again the sun beat hotly on my throbbing brain and no cool shade wave friendly from the shore : my feeble oar dip powerless utterly and onward onward though i struggle sore still go my bark towards the surge sea swift float down the river welcome art thou o cool and fragrant eve welcome art thou though night pursue thee fast with thee the burning and the toil roll past and there be time to gaze back and to grieve hoarse ocean-murmurs fall upon mine ear and round I now prophetic billow heave as on i go out-looking through salt tear swift float down the river swift float to the sea orpheus about the land i wander all forlorn about the land with sorrow-quenchèd eye seek my love among the silent wood seek she by the fountain and the stream call she name unto lone mountain top send it fly on the cloud to heaven i drop my tear amid the dew at morn i trouble all the night with prayer and sigh that like a veil thick set with golden star hideth my woe but can not silence it yet never more at morning noon or night cometh there answer back eurydice thy voice speak never more eurydice o far death-stricken lose eurydice hear ` st thou my weary cry eurydice hearing but answer not from out the past wrapp would in thy robe of everlasting light round which the accent flutter faintingly like lark slow pant upward to the sun or roll the golden sand of day away and never more the voice of my despair trickle among they o'er thine unmoved ear though every grove doth multiply the sound and all the land sigh forth eurydice my heart be all untame for evermore the string hang loose and warp would for evermore the rock resound not with my olden song nor melt in echo on the trancèd breeze the stream flow on to music all they own the magic of my lyre have pass would away for love ne'er sweep sweet music from its chord for thou art pass would away eurydice thou tuner of my song eurydice and there be nought to guide the err tone that once breath would but of thee eurydice that make each breeze sweet with eurydice and teach each fountain and each run stream to sing of thee o lose eurydice the serpent see thee o eurydice the serpent slew thee o eurydice steal amongst the grass eurydice the long rank grass that stretch briarian arm to clasp thee to itself eurydice and soon they lay thee from the sight of man lay thee beneath the rankly wave grass opening earth 's portal wide to let thee wend forth to plutonian realm of gloom away and never more about the wait land stray would thy light step at morn or shady eve no fountain hide thine image in its heart no flower leap up to wreathe thy golden hair no more the fawn within the forest glade follow would a foot more lightsome than they own the moon steal through the night in dim surprise and all the star look would pale with wonder for thou cam ` st not o lose eurydice earth find thee not o lose eurydice love find thee not o lose eurydice i could not stay where thou wert not forlorn i could not live o lose eurydice -- not acheron itself could fright I back from where thy footstep wander would best beloved and so i seek thee e ` en at hade ' gate charm would wide its leaf with melody of woe and dare the grave to keep I from thine arm i flow would away upon a stream of song e ` en to dark pluto 's grimly guard throne melt the cruel cerberus himself the parca and snake-lock would eumenide to pity of my measureless despair i sing thy beauty o eurydice i sigh would my love forth o eurydice with tear and weary sigh eurydice and at thy name the pain of hell grow light ixion 's wheel stopp would in its weary round the rock of sisyphus forget to roll and draught of comfort flow would o'er tantalus : -- then from old di 's hand the key slipp would down and word of hope and pity speak he forth he promise thee again if i would go never back-looking from those realm of gloom those realm of gloom where thou wert best beloved how could i leave thee thus eurydice without one look one glance eurydice and i perchance no more to gaze on thee snare by some fatal falsehood from thy side yet strive i hard until at length i come where lethe flow would before I faint and dim ye god how could i cross it from my love that might wash out she memory for aye that i should live and dream of she no more that i should live and love she never more that i should sing no more eurydice that i should leave she in the grip of hell nor bear she forth e ` en on the wing of thought and so i turn would to gaze eurydice i turn would to clasp thee o eurydice -- and lo thy form straightway dissolve away thy beauty in the light dissolve away and hade and all thing dissolve away until i find I on thy cold cold grave amid the grass that i would grow o'er I clasp we close within one narrow home where i no more might wake and find thee go -- the earth ope not unto my frantic cry the portal close thee from I evermore -- else have i melted hell itself with prayer and bear thee back to earth triumphantly i cry heart-stricken on proserpina i rent the rock around with endless prayer i tell she all the story of we love i launch would my sorrow on she woman 's heart i seek she through the barren winter-time the woful winter-time for earth and I and oh i think she soul will soon relent and rush in crystal torrent from she eye till in the joy of sympathetic tear she woo my love from pluto 's stony heart i wait and i question would long the spring i question would every flower and bud spray if thou didst come among they back again i conjure each bright blossom each green leaf that leave earth she bear full-arm have to di but backward flingeth ere she glad return that every step of glorious liberty fall upon flower throughout the happy land but never come response eurydice -- the flower be dumb o lose eurydice they would not see thee spring from earth like they outshine all they fainter loveliness and so they leave I to my lorn despair she leave I lorn o false proserpina and never more may i behold thee here in spring or summer o eurydice by day or night o lose eurydice they shall not keep I from thee o beloved di shall not keep I from thee o beloved but i shall shake he gate in my despair until they open wide to let I pass i 'll take my life up like a mighty rock and so beat breach in the wall of time i 'll cast existence from I like a wrestler 's robe and with my supple naked soul throw fate i 'll snap the shackle whose promethean link bind down my soul unto this narrow earth -- dost hear my voice dim float to thee now along the wave that ripple at my foot thus do i come to thee eurydice through wave water-floods eurydice i come i come
