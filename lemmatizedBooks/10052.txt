produce by stan goodman mary meehan and the online distribute proofread team the open door and the portrait story of the see and the unseen by margaret o wilson oliphant 's 1881 i the open door i take the house of brentwood on my return from indium in 18 -- for the temporary accommodation of my family until i could find a permanent home for they it have many advantage which make it peculiarly appropriate it be within reach of edinburgh and my boy roland whose education have be considerably neglect could go in and out to school which be think to be better for he than either leave home altogether or stay there always with a tutor the first of these expedient would have seem preferable to I the second commend itself to he mother the doctor like a judicious man take the midway between put he on he pony and let he rile into the high school every morning it will do he all the good in the world dr simson say and when it be bad weather there be the train he mother accept this solution of the difficulty more easily than i could have hope and we pale-faced boy who have never know anything more invigorating than simlum begin to encounter the brisk breeze of the north in the subdue severity of the month of may before the time of the vacation in July we have the satisfaction of see he begin to acquire something of the brown and ruddy complexion of he schoolfellow the english system do not commend itself to scotland in these day there be no little eton at fette nor do i think if there have be that a genteel exotic of that class would have tempt either my wife or I the lad be doubly precious to we be the only one leave we of many and he be fragile in body we believe and deeply sensitive in mind to keep he at home and yet to send he to school -- to combine the advantage of the two system -- seem to be everything that could be desire the two girl also find at brentwood everything they want they be near enough to edinburgh to have master and lesson as many as they require for complete that never-ending education which the young people seem to require nowadays they mother marry I when she be younger than agatha and i should like to see they improve upon they mother i myself be then no more than twenty-five -- a age at which i see the young fellow now grope about they with no notion what they be go to do with they life however i suppose every generation have a conceit of itself which elevate it in its own opinion above that which come after it brentwood stand on that fine and wealthy slope of country -- one of the richest in scotland -- which lie between the pentland hill and the firth in clear weather you could see the blue gleam -- like a bent bow embrace the wealthy field and scatter house -- of the great estuary on one side of you and on the other the blue height not gigantic like those we have be use to but just high enough for all the glory of the atmosphere the play of cloud and sweet reflection which give to a hilly country a interest and a charm which nothing else can emulate edinburgh -- with its two lesser height the castle and the calton hill its spire and tower pierce through the smoke and arthur 's seat lie crouch behind like a guardian no longer very needful take he repose beside the well-beloved charge which be now so to speak able to take care of itself without he -- lay at we right hand from the lawn and drawing-room window we could see all these variety of landscape the color be sometimes a little chilly but sometimes also as animated and full of vicissitude as a drama i be never tire of it its color and freshness revive the eye which have grow weary of arid plain and blaze sky it be always cheery and fresh and full of repose the village of brentwood lay almost under the house on the other side of the deep little ravine down which a stream -- which ought to have be a lovely wild and frolicsome little river -- flow between its rock and tree the river like so many in that district have however in its earlier life be sacrifice to trade and be grimy with paper-making but this do not affect we pleasure in it so much as i have know it to affect other stream perhaps we water be more rapid perhaps less clog with dirt and refuse we side of the dell be charmingly _ accidenté _ and clothe with fine tree through which various path wind down to the river-side and to the village bridge which cross the stream the village lay in the hollow and climb with very prosaic house the other side village architecture do not flourish in scotland the blue slate and the gray stone be swear foe to the picturesque and though i do not for my own part dislike the interior of a old-fashioned hew and gallery church with its little family settlement on all side the square box outside with its bit of a spire like a handle to lift it by be not a improvement to the landscape still a cluster of house on differ elevation with scrap of garden come in between a hedgerow with clothes lay out to dry the opening of a street with its rural sociability the woman at they door the slow wagon lumber along give a center to the landscape it be cheerful to look at and convenient in a hundred way within ourselves we have walk in plenty the glen be always beautiful in all its phase whether the wood be green in the spring or ruddy in the autumn in the park which surround the house be the ruin of the former mansion of brentwood -- a much smaller and less important house than the solid georgian edifice which we inhabit the ruin be picturesque however and give importance to the place even we who be but temporary tenant feel a vague pride in they as if they somehow reflect a certain consequence upon ourselves the old building have the remains of a tower -- a indistinguishable mass of mason-work over-grown with ivy and the shell of wall attach to this be half fill up with soil i have never examine it closely i be ashamed to say there be a large room or what have be a large room with the lower part of the window still exist on the principal floor and underneath other window which be perfect though half fill up with fall soil and wave with a wild growth of bramble and chance growth of all kind this be the oldest part of all at a little distance be some very commonplace and disjointed fragment of build one of they suggest a certain pathos by its very commonness and the complete wreck which it show this be the end of a low gable a bit of gray wall all incrust with lichen in which be a common door-way probably it have be a servant ' entrance a backdoor or open into what be call the office in scotland no office remain to be enter -- pantry and kitchen have all be sweep out of be but there stand the door-way open and vacant free to all the wind to the rabbit and every wild creature it strike my eye the first time i go to brentwood like a melancholy comment upon a life that be over a door that lead to nothing -- close once perhaps with anxious care bolt and guard now void of any mean it impress I i remember from the first so perhaps it may be say that my mind be prepare to attach to it a importance which nothing justify the summer be a very happy period of repose for we all the warmth of indian sun be still in we vein it seem to we that we could never have enough of the greenness the dewiness the freshness of the northern landscape even its mist be pleasant to we take all the fever out of we and pour in vigor and refreshment in autumn we follow the fashion of the time and go away for change which we do not in the least require it be when the family have settle down for the winter when the day be short and dark and the rigorous reign of frost upon we that the incident occur which alone could justify I in intrude upon the world my private affair these incident be however of so curious a character that i hope my inevitable reference to my own family and press personal interest will meet with a general pardon i be absent in london when these event begin in london a old indian plunge back into the interest with which all he previous life have be associate and meet old friend at every step i have be circulate among some half-dozen of these -- enjoy the return to my former life in shadow though i have be so thankful in substance to throw it aside -- and have miss some of my home letter what with go down from Friday to Monday to old benbow 's place in the country and stop on the way back to dine and sleep at sellar 's and to take a look into cross 's stable which occupy another day it be never safe to miss one 's letter in this transitory life as the prayer-book say how can one ever be certain what be go to happen all be well at home i know exactly -lrb- i thought -rrb- what they would have to say to I : the weather have be so fine that roland have not once go by train and he enjoy the ride beyond anything dear papa be sure that you do not forget anything but bring we so-and-so and so-and-so -- a list as long as my arm dear girl and dearer mother i would not for the world have forget they commission or lose they little letter for all the benbow and cross in the world but i be confident in my home-comfort and peacefulness when i get back to my club however three or four letter be lie for one upon some of which i notice the immediate urgent which old-fashioned people and anxious people still believe will influence the post-office and quicken the speed of the mail i be about to open one of these when the club porter bring I two telegram one of which he say have arrive the night before i open as be to be expect the last first and this be what i read : why do not you come or answer for god 's sake come he be much worse this be a thunderbolt to fall upon a man 's head who have one only son and lie the light of he eye the other telegram which i open with hand tremble so much that i lose time by my haste be to much the same purport : no better doctor afraid of brain-fever call for you day and night let nothing detain you the first thing i do be to look up the time-table to see if there be any way of get off sooner than by the night-train though i know well enough there be not and then i read the letter which furnish alas too clearly all the detail they tell I that the boy have be pale for some time with a scared look he mother have notice it before i leave home but would not say anything to alarm I this look have increase day by day : and soon it be observe that roland come home at a wild gallop through the park he pony panting and in foam himself as white as a sheet but with the perspiration streaming from he forehead for a long time he have resist all question but at length have develop such strange change of mood show a reluctance to go to school a desire to be fetch in the carriage at night -- which be a ridiculous piece of luxury -- a unwillingness to go out into the grounds and nervous start at every sound that he mother have insist upon a explanation when the boy -- we boy roland who have never know what fear be -- begin to talk to she of voice he have hear in the park and shadow that have appear to he among the ruin my wife promptly put he to bed and send for dr simson which of course be the only thing to do i hurry off that evening as may be suppose with a anxious heart how i get through the hour before the starting of the train i can not tell we must all be thankful for the quickness of the railway when in anxiety but to have throw myself into a post-chaise as soon as horse could be put to would have be a relief i get to edinburgh very early in the blackness of the winter morning and scarcely dare look the man in the face at whom i gasp what news my wife have send the brougham for I which i conclude before the man speak be a bad sign he answer be that stereotyped answer which leave the imagination so wildly free -- just the same just the same what might that mean the horse seem to I to creep along the long dark country road as we dash through the park i think i hear some one moaning among the tree and clench my fist at he -lrb- whoever he might be -rrb- with fury why have the fool of a woman at the gate allow any one to come in to disturb the quiet of the place if i have not be in such hot haste to get home i think i should have stop the carriage and get out to see what tramp it be that have make a entrance and choose my grounds of all place in the world -- when my boy be ill -- to grumble and groan in but i have no reason to complain of we slow pace here the horse fly like lightning along the intervene path and draw up at the door all panting as if they have run a race my wife stand wait to receive I with a pale face and a candle in she hand which make she look paler still as the wind blow the flame about he be sleep she say in a whisper as if she voice might wake he and i reply when i could find my voice also in a whisper as though the jingle of the horse ' furniture and the sound of they hoof must not have be more dangerous i stand on the step with she a moment almost afraid to go in now that i be here and it seem to I that i see without observe if i may say so that the horse be unwilling to turn round though they stable lay that way or that the man be unwilling these thing occur to I afterwards though at the moment i be not capable of anything but to ask question and to hear of the condition of the boy i look at he from the door of he room for we be afraid to go near lest we should disturb that bless sleep it look like actual sleep not the lethargy into which my wife tell I he would sometimes fall she tell I everything in the next room which communicate with he rise now and then and go to the door of communication and in this there be much that be very startling and confusing to the mind it appear that ever since the winter begin -- since it be early dark and night have fall before he return from school -- he have be hear voice among the ruin : at first only a groan he say at which he pony be as much alarm as he be but by degree a voice the tear run down my wife 's cheek as she describe to I how he would start up in the night and cry out oh mother let I in oh mother let I in with a pathos which rent she heart and she sit there all the time only longing to do everything he heart could desire but though she would try to soothe he cry you be at home my darling i be here do not you know I you mother be here he would only stare at she and after a while spring up again with the same cry at other time he would be quite reasonable she say ask eagerly when i be come but declare that he must go with I as soon as i do so to let they in the doctor think he nervous system must have receive a shock my wife say oh henry can it be that we have push he on too much with he work -- a delicate boy like roland and what be he work in comparison with he health even you would think little of honor or prize if it hurt the boy 's health even i -- as if i be a inhuman father sacrifice my child to my ambition but i would not increase she trouble by take any notice after awhile they persuade I to lie down to rest and to eat none of which thing have be possible since i receive they letter the mere fact of be on the spot of course in itself be a great thing and when i know that i could be call in a moment as soon as he be awake and want I i feel capable even in the dark chill morning twilight to snatch a hour or two 's sleep as it happen i be so worn out with the strain of anxiety and he so quiet and console by know i have come that i be not disturbed till the afternoon when the twilight have again settle down there be just daylight enough to see he face when i go to he and what a change in a fortnight he be paler and more worn i thought than even in those dreadful day in the plain before we leave indium he hair seem to I to have grow long and lank he eye be like blaze light project out of he white face he get hold of my hand in a cold and tremulous clutch and wave to everybody to go away go away -- even mother he say go away this go to she heart for she do not like that even i should have more of the boy 's confidence than herself but my wife have never be a woman to think of herself and she leave we alone be they all go he say eagerly they would not let I speak the doctor treat I as if i be a fool you know i be not a fool papa yes yes my boy i know but you be ill and quiet be so necessary you be not only not a fool roland but you be reasonable and understand when you be ill you must deny yourself you must not do everything that you might do be well he wave he thin hand with a sort of indignation then father i be not ill he cry oh i think when you come you would not stop I -- you would see the sense of it what do you think be the matter with I all of you simson be well enough but he be only a doctor what do you think be the matter with I i be no more ill than you be a doctor of course he think you be ill the moment he look at you -- that be what he be there for -- and clap you into bed which be the best place for you at present my dear boy i make up my mind cry the little fellow that i would stand it till you come home i say to myself i will not frighten mother and the girl but now father he cry half jump out of bed it be not illness : it be a secret he eye shine so wildly he face be so sweep with strong feeling that my heart sink within I it could be nothing but fever that do it and fever have be so fatal i get he into my arm to put he back into bed roland i say humor the poor child which i know be the only way if you be go to tell I this secret to do any good you know you must be quite quiet and not excite yourself if you excite yourself i must not let you speak yes father say the boy he be quiet directly like a man as if he quite understand when i have lay he back on he pillow he look up at I with that grateful sweet look with which child when they be ill break one 's heart the water come into he eye in he weakness i be sure as soon as you be here you would know what to do he say to be sure my boy now keep quiet and tell it all out like a man to think i be tell lie to my own child for i do it only to humor he think poor little fellow he brain be wrong yes father father there be some one in the park -- some one that have be badly use hush my dear you remember there be to be no excitement well who be this somebody and who have be ill-using he we will soon put a stop to that all cry roland but it be not so easy as you think i do not know who it be it be just a cry oh if you could hear it it get into my head in my sleep i hear it as clear -- as clear and they think that i be dream or rave perhaps the boy say with a sort of disdainful smile this look of he perplexed I it be less like fever than i think be you quite sure you have not dream it roland i say dream -- that he be spring up again when he suddenly bethink himself and lay down flat with the same sort of smile on he face the pony hear it too he say she jump as if she have be shoot if i have not grasp at the rein -- for i be frightened father -- no shame to you my boy say i though i scarcely know why if i have not hold to she like a leech she would have pitch I over she head and never draw breath till we be at the door do the pony dream it he say with a soft disdain yet indulgence for my foolishness then he add slowly it be only a cry the first time and all the time before you go away i would not tell you for it be so wretched to be frightened i think it might be a hare or a rabbit snare and i go in the morning and look but there be nothing it be after you go i hear it really first and this be what he say he raise himself on he elbow close to I and look I in the face : ` oh mother let I in oh mother let I in ' as he say the word a mist come over he face the mouth quiver the soft feature all melt and change and when he have end these pitiful word dissolve in a shower of heavy tear be it a hallucination be it the fever of the brain be it the disorder fancy cause by great bodily weakness how could i tell i think it wisest to accept it as if it be all true this be very touching roland i say oh if you have just hear it father i say to myself if father hear it he would do something but mamma you know she be give over to simson and that fellow 's a doctor and never think of anything but clap you into bed we must not blame simson for be a doctor roland no no say my boy with delightful toleration and indulgence oh no that be the good of he that be what he be for i know that but you -- you be different you be just father and you 'll do something -- directly papa directly this very night surely i say no doubt it be some little lost child he give I a sudden swift look investigate my face as though to see whether after all this be everything my eminence as father come to -- no more than that then he get hold of my shoulder clutch it with he thin hand look here he say with a quiver in he voice suppose it be not -- live at all my dear boy how then could you have hear it i say he turn away from I with a pettish exclamation -- as if you do not know better than that do you want to tell I it be a ghost i say roland withdraw he hand he countenance assume a aspect of great dignity and gravity a slight quiver remain about he lip whatever it be -- you always say we be not to call name it be something -- in trouble oh father in terrible trouble but my boy i say -lrb- i be at my wit ' end -rrb- if it be a child that be lose or any poor human creature -- but roland what do you want I to do i should know if i be you say the child eagerly that be what i always say to myself -- father will know oh papa papa to have to face it night after night in such terrible terrible trouble and never to be able to do it any good i do not want to cry it be like a baby i know but what can i do else out there all by itself in the ruin and nobody to help it i can not bear it i can not bear it cry my generous boy and in he weakness he burst out after many attempt to restrain it into a great childish fit of sob and tear i do not know that i ever be in a greater perplexity in my life and afterwards when i thought of it there be something comic in it too it be bad enough to find you child 's mind possess with the conviction that he have see or hear a ghost but that he should require you to go instantly and help that ghost be the most bewildering experience that have ever come my way i be a sober man myself and not superstitious -- at least any more than everybody be superstitious of course i do not believe in ghost but i do not deny any more than other people that there be story which i can not pretend to understand my blood get a sort of chill in my vein at the idea that roland should be a ghost-seer for that generally mean a hysterical temperament and weak health and all that man most hate and fear for they child but that i should take up he ghost and right its wrong and save it from its trouble be such a mission as be enough to confuse any man i do my best to console my boy without give any promise of this astonishing kind but he be too sharp for I : he would have none of my caress with sob break in at interval upon he voice and the rain-drop hang on he eyelid he yet return to the charge it will be there now -- it will be there all the night oh think papa -- think if it be I i can not rest for thinking of it do not he cry put away my hand -- do not you go and help it and mother can take care of I but roland what can i do my boy open he eye which be large with weakness and fever and give I a smile such i think as sick child only know the secret of i be sure you would know as soon as you come i always say father will know and mother he cry with a softening of repose upon he face he limb relax he form sink with a luxurious ease in he bed -- mother can come and take care of I i call she and see he turn to she with the complete dependence of a child and then i go away and leave they as perplex a man as any in scotland i must say however i have this consolation that my mind be greatly ease about roland he might be under a hallucination but he head be clear enough and i do not think he so ill as everybody else do the girl be astonish even at the ease with which i take it how do you think he be they say in a breath come round I lay hold of I not half so ill as i expect i say not very bad at all oh papa you be a darling cry agatha kiss I and cry upon my shoulder while little jeanie who be as pale as roland clasp both she arm round mine and could not speak at all i know nothing about it not half so much as simson but they believe in I : they have a feeling that all would go right now god be very good to you when you child look to you like that it make one humble not proud i be not worthy of it and then i recollect that i have to act the part of a father to roland 's ghost -- which make I almost laugh though i might just as well have cry it be the strangest mission that ever be intrust to mortal man it be then i remember suddenly the look of the man when they turn to take the brougham to the stable in the dark that morning they have not like it and the horse have not like it i remember that even in my anxiety about roland i have hear they tear along the avenue back to the stable and have make a memorandum mentally that i must speak of it it seem to I that the best thing i could do be to go to the stable now and make a few inquiry it be impossible to fathom the mind of rustic there might be some devilry of practical joking for anything i know or they might have some interest in get up a bad reputation for the brentwood avenue it be get dark by the time i go out and nobody who know the country will need to be tell how black be the darkness of a November night under high laurel-bush and yew-tree i walk into the heart of the shrubbery two or three time not see a step before I till i come out upon the broader carriage-road where the tree open a little and there be a faint gray glimmer of sky visible under which the great lime and elm stand darkle like ghost but it grow black again as i approach the corner where the ruin lay both eye and ear be on the alert as may be suppose but i could see nothing in the absolute gloom and so far as i can recollect i hear nothing nevertheless there come a strong impression upon I that somebody be there it be a sensation which most people have feel i have see when it have be strong enough to awake I out of sleep the sense of some one look at I i suppose my imagination have be affect by roland 's story and the mystery of the darkness be always full of suggestion i stamped my foot violently on the gravel to rouse myself and call out sharply who be there nobody answer nor do i expect any one to answer but the impression have be make i be so foolish that i do not like to look back but go sideways keep a eye on the gloom behind it be with great relief that i spy the light in the stable make a sort of oasis in the darkness i walk very quickly into the midst of that light and cheerful place and think the clank of the groom 's pail one of the pleasantest sound i have ever hear the coachman be the head of this little colony and it be to he house i go to pursue my investigation he be a native of the district and have take care of the place in the absence of the family for year it be impossible but that he must know everything that be go on and all the tradition of the place the man i could see eye I anxiously when i thus appear at such a hour among they and follow I with they eye to jarvi 's house where he live alone with he old wife they child be all marry and out in the world mr jarvis meet I with anxious question how be the poor young gentleman but the other know i could see by they face that not even this be the foremost thing in my mind \* \* \* \* \* noise -- ou ay there 'll be noise -- the wind in the tree and the water sough down the glen as for tramp cornel no there be little o ' that kind o ' cattle about here and merran at the gate 's a careful body jarvi move about with some embarrassment from one leg to another as he speak he keep in the shade and do not look at I more than he could help evidently he mind be perturb and he have reason for keep he own counsel he wife sit by give he a quick look now and then but say nothing the kitchen be very snug and warm and bright -- as different as could be from the chill and mystery of the night outside i think you be trifle with I jarvis i say triflin ' cornel no I what would i trifle for if the deevil himsel be in the auld hoose i have no interest in ' t one way or another -- sandy hold you peace cry he wife imperatively and what be i to hold my peace for wus ' the cornel standing there ask a ' thae question i be say if the deevil himsel -- and i be tell ye hold you peace cry the woman in great excitement dark November weather and lang nicht and we that ken a ' we ken how daur ye name -- a name that shouldna be speak she throw down she stock and get up also in great agitation i tellt ye you never could keep it it be no a thing that will hide and the haill toun ken as weel as you or I tell the cornel straight out -- or see i 'll do it i dinna hold wus ' you secret and a secret that the haill toun ken she snap she finger with a air of large disdain as for jarvi ruddy and big as he be he shrink to nothing before this decide woman he repeat to she two or three time she own adjuration hold you peace then suddenly change he tone cry out tell he then confound ye i 'll wash my hand o ' t if a ' the ghost in scotland be in the auld hoose be that ony concern o ' mine after this i elicit without much difficulty the whole story in the opinion of the jarvise and of everybody about the certainty that the place be haunt be beyond all doubt as sandy and he wife warm to the tale one trip up another in they eagerness to tell everything it gradually develop as distinct a superstition as i ever hear and not without poetry and pathos how long it be since the voice have be hear first nobody could tell with certainty jarvi 's opinion be that he father who have be coachman at brentwood before he have never hear anything about it and that the whole thing have arise within the last ten year since the complete dismantle of the old house which be a wonderfully modern date for a tale so well authenticate accord to these witness and to several whom i question afterwards and who be all in perfect agreement it be only in the month of November and December that the visitation occur during these month the darkest of the year scarcely a night pass without the recurrence of these inexplicable cry nothing it be say have ever be see -- at least nothing that could be identify some people bolder or more imaginative than the other have see the darkness move mr jarvis say with unconscious poetry it begin when night fall and continue at interval till day break very often it be only all inarticulate cry and moan but sometimes the word which have take possession of my poor boy 's fancy have be distinctly audible -- oh mother let I in the jarvise be not aware that there have ever be any investigation into it the estate of brentwood have lapse into the hand of a distant branch of the family who have live but little there and of the many people who have take it as i have do few have remain through two december and nobody have take the trouble to make a very close examination into the fact no no jarvi say shake he head no no cornel wha wad set themsel up for a laughin ' - stock to a ' the country-side make a wark about a ghost naebody believe in ghost it bid to be the wind in the tree the last gentleman say or some effec ' o ' the water wrastlin ' among the rock he say it be a ' quite easy explain but he give up the hoose and when you cam cornel we be awfu ' anxious you should never hear what for should i have spoil the bargain and hairm the property for no-thing do you call my child 's life nothing i say in the trouble of the moment unable to restrain myself and instead of tell this all to I you have tell it to he -- to a delicate boy a child unable to sift evidence or judge for himself a tender-hearted young creature -- i be walk about the room with a anger all the hotter that i feel it to be most likely quite unjust my heart be full of bitterness against the stolid retainer of a family who be content to risk other people 's child and comfort rather than let a house be empty if i have be warn i might have take precaution or leave the place or send roland away a hundred thing which now i could not do and here i be with my boy in a brain-fever and he life the most precious life on earth hanging in the balance dependent on whether or not i could get to the reason of a commonplace ghost-story i paced about in high wrath not see what i be to do for to take roland away even if he be able to travel would not settle he agitate mind and i fear even that a scientific explanation of refract sound or reverberation or any other of the easy certainty with which we elder man be silence would have very little effect upon the boy cornel say jarvi solemnly and _ she 'll _ bear I witness -- the young gentleman never hear a word from I -- no nor from either groom or gardener i 'll gie ye my word for that in the first place he be no a lad that invite ye to talk there be some that be and some that arena some will draw ye on till ye have tellt they a ' the clatter of the toun and a ' ye ken and while mair but maister roland he mind 's fu ' of he book he be aye civil and kind and a fine lad but no that sort and ye see it be for a ' we interest cornel that you should stay at brentwood i take it upon I mysel to pass the word -- ` no a syllable to maister roland nor to the young leddy -- no a syllable ' the women-servant that have little reason to be out at night ken little or nothing about it and some think it grand to have a ghost so long as they be no in the way of come across it if you have be tellt the story to begin with maybe ye would have think so yourself this be true enough though it do not throw any light upon my perplexity if we have hear of it to start with it be possible that all the family would have consider the possession of a ghost a distinct advantage it be the fashion of the time we never think what a risk it be to play with young imagination but cry out in the fashionable jargon a ghost -- nothing else be want to make it perfect i should not have be above this myself i should have smile of course at the idea of the ghost at all but then to feel that it be mine would have pleased my vanity oh yes i claim no exemption the girl would have be delighted i could fancy they eagerness they interest and excitement no if we have be tell it would have do no good -- we should have make the bargain all the more eagerly the fool that we be and there have be no attempt to investigate it i say to see what it really be eh cornel say the coachman 's wife wha would investigate as ye call it a thing that nobody believe in ye would be the laughin ' - stock of a ' the country-side as my man say but you believe in it i say turn upon she hastily the woman be take by surprise she make a step backward out of my way lord cornel how ye frichten a body I -- there be awfu ' strange thing in this world a unlearned person doesna ken what to think but the minister and the gentry they just laugh in you face inquire into the thing that be not na na we just let it be come with I jarvis i say hastily and we 'll make a attempt at least say nothing to the man or to anybody i 'll come back after dinner and we 'll make a serious attempt to see what it be if it be anything if i hear it -- which i doubt -- you may be sure i shall never rest till i make it out be ready for I about ten o'clock I cornel jarvis say in a faint voice i have not be look at he in my own preoccupation but when i do so i find that the greatest change have come over the fat and ruddy coachman I cornel he repeat wipe the perspiration from he brow he ruddy face hang in flabby fold he knee knock together he voice seem half extinguish in he throat then he begin to rub he hand and smile upon I in a deprecating imbecile way there be nothing i wouldna do to pleasure ye cornel take a step further back i be sure _ she _ ken i have aye say i never have to do with a mair fair weel-spoken gentleman -- here jarvi come to a pause again look at I rub he hand well i say but eh sir he go on with the same imbecile yet insinuate smile if ye 'll reflect that i be no use to my foot with a horse atween my leg or the rein in my hand i be maybe nae worse than other man but on fit cornel -- it be no the -- bogle -- but i have be cavalry ye see with a little hoarse laugh a ' my life to face a thing ye dinna understan ' -- on you foot cornel well sir if _ i _ do it say i tartly why should not you eh cornel there be a awfu ' difference in the first place ye tramp about the haill countryside and think naething of it but a walk tire I mair than a hunard mile ' drive and then ye be a gentleman and do you ain pleasure and you be no so auld as I and it be for you ain bairn ye see cornel and then -- he believe in it cornel and you dinna believe in it the woman say will you come with I i say turn to she she jump back upset she chair in she bewilderment I with a scream and then fall into a sort of hysterical laugh i wouldna say but what i would go but what would the folk say to hear of cornel mortimer with a auld silly woman at he heel the suggestion make I laugh too though i have little inclination for it i be sorry you have so little spirit jarvi i say i must find some one else i suppose jarvi touch by this begin to remonstrate but i cut he short my butler be a soldier who have be with I in indium and be not suppose to fear anything -- man or devil -- certainly not the former and i feel that i be lose time the jarvise be too thankful to get rid of I they attend I to the door with the most anxious courtesy outside the two groom stand close by a little confused by my sudden exit i do not know if perhaps they have be listen -- as least standing as near as possible to catch any scrap of the conversation i wave my hand to they as i go past in answer to they salutation and it be very apparent to I that they also be glad to see I go and it will be think very strange but it would be weak not to add that i myself though bent on the investigation i have speak of pledge to roland to carry it out and feeling that my boy 's health perhaps he life depend on the result of my inquiry -- i feel the most unaccountable reluctance to pass these ruin on my way home my curiosity be intense and yet it be all my mind could do to pull my body along i daresay the scientific people would describe it the other way and attribute my cowardice to the state of my stomach i go on but if i have follow my impulse i should have turn and bolt everything in I seem to cry out against it : my heart thump my pulse all begin like sledge-hammer beat against my ear and every sensitive part it be very dark as i have say the old house with its shapeless tower loom a heavy mass through the darkness which be only not entirely so solid as itself on the other hand the great dark cedar of which we be so proud seem to fill up the night my foot stray out of the path in my confusion and the gloom together and i bring myself up with a cry as i feel myself knock against something solid what be it the contact with hard stone and lime and prickly bramble-bush restore I a little to myself oh it be only the old gable i say aloud with a little laugh to reassure myself the rough feeling of the stone reconcile I as i groped about thus i shake off my visionary folly what so easily explain as that i should have stray from the path in the darkness this bring I back to common existence as if i have be shake by a wise hand out of all the silliness of superstition how silly it be after all what do it matter which path i take i laugh again this time with better heart when suddenly in a moment the blood be chill in my vein a shiver steal along my spine my faculty seem to forsake I close by I at my side at my foot there be a sigh no not a groan not a moan not anything so tangible -- a perfectly soft faint inarticulate sigh i spring back and my heart stop beat mistaken no mistake be impossible i hear it as clearly as i hear myself speak a long soft weary sigh as if draw to the utmost and empty out a load of sadness that fill the breast to hear this in the solitude in the dark in the night -lrb- though it be still early -rrb- have a effect which i can not describe i feel it now -- something cold creep over I up into my hair and down to my foot which refuse to move i cry out with a tremble voice who be there as i have do before but there be no reply i get home i do not quite know how but in my mind there be no longer any indifference as to the thing whatever it be that haunt these ruin my scepticism disappear like a mist i be as firmly determine that there be something as roland be i do not for a moment pretend to myself that it be possible i could be deceive there be movement and noise which i understand all about -- crackling of small branch in the frost and little roll of gravel on the path such as have a very eerie sound sometimes and perplex you with wonder as to who have do it _ when there be no real mystery _ but i assure you all these little movement of nature do not affect you one bit _ when there be something _ i understand _ they _ i do not understand the sigh that be not simple nature there be mean in it feel the soul of a creature invisible this be the thing that human nature tremble at -- a creature invisible yet with sensation feeling a power somehow of express itself i have not the same sense of unwillingness to turn my back upon the scene of the mystery which i have experience in go to the stable but i almost run home impel by eagerness to get everything do that have to be do in order to apply myself to find it out bagley be in the hall as usual when i go in he be always there in the afternoon always with the appearance of perfect occupation yet so far as i know never do anything the door be open so that i hurry in without any pause breathless but the sight of he calm regard as he come to help I off with my overcoat subdue I in a moment anything out of the way anything incomprehensible fade to nothing in the presence of bagley you see and wonder how _ he _ be make : the parting of he hair the tie of he white neckcloth the fit of he trousers all perfect as work of art but you could see how they be do which make all the difference i flung myself upon he so to speak without wait to note the extreme unlikeness of the man to anything of the kind i mean bagley i say i want you to come out with I to-night to watch for -- poacher colonel he say a gleam of pleasure run all over he no bagley a great deal worse i cry yes colonel at what hour sir the man say but then i have not tell he what it be it be ten o'clock when we set out all be perfectly quiet indoors my wife be with roland who have be quite calm she say and who -lrb- though no doubt the fever must run its course -rrb- have be better ever since i come i tell bagley to put on a thick greatcoat over he evening coat and do the same myself with strong boot for the soil be like a sponge or worse talk to he i almost forget what we be go to do it be darker even than it have be before and bagley keep very close to I as we go along i have a small lantern in my hand which give we a partial guidance we have come to the corner where the path turn on one side be the bowling-green which the girl have take possession of for they croquet-ground -- a wonderful enclosure surround by high hedge of holly three hundred year old and more on the other the ruin both be black as night but before we get so far there be a little opening in which we could just discern the tree and the lighter line of the road i think it best to pause there and take breath bagley i say there be something about these ruin i do not understand it be there i be go keep you eye open and you wit about you be ready to pounce upon any stranger you see -- anything man or woman do not hurt but seize anything you see colonel say bagley with a little tremor in he breath they do say there be thing there -- as be neither man nor woman there be no time for word be you game to follow I my man that be the question i say bagley fall in without a word and salute i know then i have nothing to fear we go so far as i could guess exactly as i have come when i hear that sigh the darkness however be so complete that all mark as of tree or path disappear one moment we feel we foot on the gravel another sink noiselessly into the slippery grass that be all i have shut up my lantern not wish to scare any one whoever it might be bagley follow it seem to I exactly in my footstep as i make my way as i suppose towards the mass of the ruin house we seem to take a long time grope along seek this the squash of the wet soil under we foot be the only thing that mark we progress after a while i stand still to see or rather feel where we be the darkness be very still but no stiller than be usual in a winter 's night the sound i have mention -- the crackling of twig the roll of a pebble the sound of some rustle in the dead leaf or creep creature on the grass -- be audible when you listen all mysterious enough when you mind be disengage but to I cheer now as sign of the livingness of nature even in the death of the frost as we stand still there come up from the tree in the glen the prolonged hoot of a owl bagley start with alarm be in a state of general nervousness and not know what he be afraid of but to I the sound be encouraging and pleasant be so comprehensible a owl i say under my breath y -- e colonel say bagley he tooth chatter we stand still about five minute while it break into the still brooding of the air the sound widen out in circle die upon the darkness this sound which be not a cheerful one make I almost gay it be natural and relieved the tension of the mind i move on with new courage my nervous excitement calming down when all at once quite suddenly close to we at we foot there break out a cry i make a spring backwards in the first moment of surprise and horror and in do so come sharply against the same rough masonry and bramble that have strike I before this new sound come upwards from the ground -- a low moan wail voice full of suffer and pain the contrast between it and the hoot of the owl be indescribable -- the one with a wholesome wildness and naturalness that hurt nobody the other a sound that make one 's blood curdle full of human misery with a great deal of fumble -- for in spite of everything i could do to keep up my courage my hand shake -- i manage to remove the slide of my lantern the light leap out like something living and make the place visible in a moment we be what would have be inside the ruin building have anything remain but the gable-wall which i have describe it be close to we the vacant door-way in it go out straight into the blackness outside the light show the bit of wall the ivy glisten upon it in cloud of dark green the bramble-branch wave and below the open door -- a door that lead to nothing it be from this the voice come which die out just as the light flash upon this strange scene there be a moment 's silence and then it break forth again the sound be so near so penetrate so pitiful that in the nervous start i give the light fall out of my hand as i groped for it in the dark my hand be clutch by bagley who i think must have drop upon he knee but i be too much perturb myself to think much of this he clutch at I in the confusion of he terror forget all he usual decorum for god 's sake what be it sir he gasp if i yield there be evidently a end of both of we i can not tell i say any more than you that be what we have get to find out up man up i pull he to he foot will you go round and examine the other side or will you stay here with the lantern bagley gasp at I with a face of horror can not we stay together colonel he say he knee be tremble under he i push he against the corner of the wall and put the light into he hand stand fast till i come back shake yourself together man let nothing pass you i say the voice be within two or three foot of we of that there could be no doubt i go myself to the other side of the wall keep close to it the light shake in bagley 's hand but tremulous though it be shine out through the vacant door one oblong block of light mark all the crumble corner and hang mass of foliage be that something dark huddle in a heap by the side of it i push forward across the light in the door-way and fall upon it with my hand but it be only a juniper-bush grow close against the wall meanwhile the sight of my figure cross the door-way have bring bagley 's nervous excitement to a height : he fly at I grip my shoulder i have get he colonel i have get he he cry with a voice of sudden exultation he think it be a man and be at once relieved but at that moment the voice burst forth again between we at we foot -- more close to we than any separate be could be he drop off from I and fall against the wall he jaw drop as if he be die i suppose at the same moment he see that it be I whom he have clutch i for my part have scarcely more command of myself i snatch the light out of he hand and flash it all about I wildly nothing -- the juniper-bush which i think i have never see before the heavy growth of the glisten ivy the bramble wave it be close to my ear now cry cry plead as if for life either i hear the same word roland have hear or else in my excitement he imagination get possession of mine the voice go on grow into distinct articulation but waver about now from one point now from another as if the owner of it be move slowly back and forward mother mother and then a outburst of wail as my mind steady get accustomed -lrb- as one 's mind get accustomed to anything -rrb- it seem to I as if some uneasy miserable creature be pacing up and down before a closed door sometimes -- but that must have be excitement -- i think i hear a sound like knock and then another burst oh mother mother all this close close to the space where i be stand with my lantern now before I now behind I : a creature restless unhappy moaning cry before the vacant door-way which no one could either shut or open more do you hear it bagley do you hear what it be say i cry step in through the door-way he be lie against the wall he eye glaze half dead with terror he make a motion of he lip as if to answer I but no sound come then lift he hand with a curious imperative movement as if order I to be silent and listen and how long i do so i can not tell it begin to have a interest a exciting hold upon I which i could not describe it seem to call up visibly a scene any one could understand -- a something shut out restlessly wander to and fro sometimes the voice drop as if throw itself down sometimes wander off a few pace grow sharp and clear oh mother let I in oh mother mother let I in oh let I in every word be clear to I no wonder the boy have go wild with pity i try to steady my mind upon roland upon he conviction that i could do something but my head swam with the excitement even when i partially overcome the terror at last the word die away and there be a sound of sob and moan i cry out in the name of god who be you with a kind of feeling in my mind that to use the name of god be profane see that i do not believe in ghost or anything supernatural but i do it all the same and wait my heart give a leap of terror lest there should be a reply why this should have be i can not tell but i have a feeling that if there be a answer it would be more than i could bear but there be no answer the moan go on and then as if it have be real the voice rise a little higher again the word recommence oh mother let I in oh mother let I in with a expression that be heart-breaking to hear _ as if it have be real _ what do i mean by that i suppose i get less alarmed as the thing go on i begin to recover the use of my sens -- i seem to explain it all to myself by say that this have once happen that it be a recollection of a real scene why there should have seem something quite satisfactory and composing in this explanation i can not tell but so it be i begin to listen almost as if it have be a play forget bagley who i almost think have faint lean against the wall i be startle out of this strange spectatorship that have fall upon I by the sudden rush of something which make my heart jump once more a large black figure in the door-way wave its arm come in come in come in it shout out hoarsely at the top of a deep bass voice and then poor bagley fall down senseless across the threshold he be less sophisticated than i -- he have not be able to bear it any longer i take he for something supernatural as he take I and it be some time before i awake to the necessity of the moment i remember only after that from the time i begin to give my attention to the man i hear the other voice no more it be some time before i bring he to it must have be a strange scene : the lantern make a luminous spot in the darkness the man 's white face lie on the black earth i over he do what i could for he probably i should have be think to be murder he have any one see we when at last i succeed in pour a little brandy down he throat he sit up and look about he wildly what be up he say then recognize I try to struggle to he foot with a faint beg you pardon colonel i get he home as best i could make he lean upon my arm the great fellow be as weak as a child fortunately he do not for some time remember what have happen from the time bagley fall the voice have stop and all be still \* \* \* \* \* you have get a epidemic in you house colonel simson say to I next morning what be the meaning of it all here 's you butler rave about a voice this will never do you know and so far as i can make out you be in it too yes i be in it doctor i think i have better speak to you of course you be treat roland all right but the boy be not rave he be as sane as you or I it be all true as sane as -- i -- or you i never think the boy insane he be get cerebral excitement fever i do not know what you have get there be something very queer about the look of you eye come say i you can not put we all to bed you know you have better listen and hear the symptom in full the doctor shrug he shoulder but he listen to I patiently he do not believe a word of the story that be clear but he hear it all from begin to end my dear fellow he say the boy tell I just the same it be a epidemic when one person fall a victim to this sort of thing it be as safe as can be -- there be always two or three then how do you account for it i say oh account for it -- that be a different matter there be no accounting for the freak we brain be subject to if it be delusion if it be some trick of the echo or the wind -- some phonetic disturbance or other -- come with I to-night and judge for yourself i say upon this he laugh aloud then say that be not such a bad idea but it would ruin I forever if it be know that john simson be ghost-hunting there it be say i you dart down on we who be unlearned with you phonetic disturbance but you dare not examine what the thing really be for fear of be laugh at that be science it be not science -- it be common-sense say the doctor the thing have delusion on the front of it it be encourage a unwholesome tendency even to examine what good could come of it even if i be convinced i should not believe i should have say so yesterday and i do not want you to be convinced or to believe say i if you prove it to be a delusion i shall be very much oblige to you for one come somebody must go with I you be cool say the doctor you have disable this poor fellow of yours and make he -- on that point -- a lunatic for life and now you want to disable I but for once i 'll do it to save appearance if you 'll give I a bed i 'll come over after my last round it be agree that i should meet he at the gate and that we should visit the scene of last night 's occurrence before we come to the house so that nobody might be the wiser it be scarcely possible to hope that the cause of bagley 's sudden illness should not somehow steal into the knowledge of the servant at least and it be better that all should be do as quietly as possible the day seem to I a very long one i have to spend a certain part of it with roland which be a terrible ordeal for I for what could i say to the boy the improvement continue but he be still in a very precarious state and the tremble vehemence with which he turn to I when he mother leave the room fill I with alarm father he say quietly yes my boy i be give my best attention to it all be be do that i can do i have not come to any conclusion -- yet i be neglect nothing you say i cry what i could not do be to give he active mind any encouragement to dwell upon the mystery it be a hard predicament for some satisfaction have to be give he he look at I very wistfully with the great blue eye which shine so large and brilliant out of he white and worn face you must trust I i say yes father father understand he say to himself as if to soothe some inward doubt i leave he as soon as i could he be about the most precious thing i have on earth and he health my first thought but yet somehow in the excitement of this other subject i put that aside and prefer not to dwell upon roland which be the most curious part of it all that night at eleven i meet simson at the gate he have come by train and i let he in gently myself i have be so much absorb in the come experiment that i pass the ruin in go to meet he almost without think if you can understand that i have my lantern and he show I a coil of taper which he have ready for use there be nothing like light he say in he scoff tone it be a very still night scarcely a sound but not so dark we could keep the path without difficulty as we go along as we approach the spot we could hear a low moan broken occasionally by a bitter cry perhaps that be you voice say the doctor i think it must be something of the kind that be a poor brute catch in some of these infernal trap of yours you 'll find it among the bush somewhere i say nothing i feel no particular fear but a triumphant satisfaction in what be to follow i lead he to the spot where bagley and i have stand on the previous night all be silent as a winter night could be -- so silent that we hear far off the sound of the horse in the stable the shut of a window at the house simson light he taper and go peer about poke into all the corner we look like two conspirator lie in wait for some unfortunate traveller but not a sound break the quiet the moan have stop before we come up a star or two shone over we in the sky look down as if surprise at we strange proceedings dr simson do nothing but utter subdue laugh under he breath i think as much he say it be just the same with table and all other kind of ghostly apparatus a sceptic 's presence stop everything when i be present nothing ever come off how long do you think it will be necessary to stay here oh i do not complain only when _ you _ be satisfied _ i _ be -- quite i will not deny that i be disappoint beyond measure by this result it make I look like a credulous fool it give the doctor such a pull over I as nothing else could i should point all he moral for year to come and he materialism he scepticism would be increase beyond endurance it seem indeed i say that there be to be no -- manifestation he say laugh that be what all the medium say no manifestation in consequence of the presence of a unbeliever he laugh sound very uncomfortable to I in the silence and it be now near midnight but that laugh seem the signal before it die away the moan we have hear before be resume it start from some distance off and come towards we nearer and nearer like some one walk along and moan to himself there could be no idea now that it be a hare catch in a trap the approach be slow like that of a weak person with little halt and pause we hear it come along the grass straight towards the vacant door-way simson have be a little startled by the first sound he say hastily that child have no business to be out so late but he feel as well as i that this be no child 's voice as it come nearer he grow silent and go to the door-way with he taper stand look out towards the sound the taper be unprotected blow about in the night air though there be scarcely any wind i throw the light of my lantern steady and white across the same space it be in a blaze of light in the midst of the blackness a little icy thrill have go over I at the first sound but as it come close i confess that my only feeling be satisfaction the scoffer could scoff no more the light touch he own face and show a very perplexed countenance if he be afraid he conceal it with great success but he be perplexed and then all that have happen on the previous night be enact once more it fall strangely upon I with a sense of repetition every cry every sob seem the same as before i listen almost without any emotion at all in my own person thinking of its effect upon simson he maintain a very bold front on the whole all that come and go of the voice be if we ear could be trust exactly in front of the vacant blank door-way blaze full of light which catch and shine in the glisten leaf of the great holly at a little distance not a rabbit could have cross the turf without be see but there be nothing after a time simson with a certain caution and bodily reluctance as it seem to I go out with he roll of taper into this space he figure show against the holly in full outline just at this moment the voice sink as be its custom and seem to fling itself down at the door simson recoil violently as if some one have come up against he then turn and hold he taper low as if examine something do you see anybody i cry in a whisper feel the chill of nervous panic steal over I at this action it be nothing but a -- confound juniper-bush he say this i know very well to be nonsense for the juniper-bush be on the other side he go about after this round and round poke he taper everywhere then return to I on the inner side of the wall he scoff no longer he face be contract and pale how long do this go on he whisper to I like a man who do not wish to interrupt some one who be speak i have become too much perturb myself to remark whether the succession and change of the voice be the same as last night it suddenly go out in the air almost as he be speak with a soft reiterate sob die away if there have be anything to be see i should have say that the person be at that moment crouch on the ground close to the door we walk home very silent afterwards it be only when we be in sight of the house that i say what do you think of it i can not tell what to think of it he say quickly he take -- though he be a very temperate man -- not the claret i be go to offer he but some brandy from the tray and swallow it almost undiluted mind you i do not believe a word of it he say when he have light he candle but i can not tell what to think he turn round to add when he be half-way upstairs all of this however do I no good with the solution of my problem i be to help this weep sob thing which be already to I as distinct a personality as anything i know or what should i say to roland it be on my heart that my boy would die if i could not find some way of help this creature you may be surprise that i should speak of it in this way i do not know if it be man or woman but i no more doubt that it be a soul in pain than i doubt my own being and it be my business to soothe this pain -- to deliver it if that be possible be ever such a task give to a anxious father tremble for he only boy i feel in my heart fantastic as it may appear that i must fulfill this somehow or part with my child and you may conceive that rather than do that i be ready to die but even my die would not have advance I unless by bring I into the same world with that seeker at the door \* \* \* \* \* next morning simson be out before breakfast and come in with evident sign of the damp grass on he boot and a look of worry and weariness which do not say much for the night he have pass he improve a little after breakfast and visit he two patient -- for bagley be still a invalid i go out with he on he way to the train to hear what he have to say about the boy he be go on very well he say there be no complication as yet but mind you that be not a boy to be trifle with mortimer not a word to he about last night i have to tell he then of my last interview with roland and of the impossible demand he have make upon I by which though he try to laugh he be much discompose as i could see we must just perjure ourselves all round he say and swear you exorcise it but the man be too kind-hearted to be satisfy with that it be frightfully serious for you mortimer i can not laugh as i should like to i wish i see a way out of it for you sake by the way he add shortly do not you notice that juniper-bush on the left-hand side there be one on the right hand of the door i notice you make that mistake last night mistake he cry with a curious low laugh pull up the collar of he coat as though he feel the cold -- there be no juniper there this morning leave or right just go and see as he step into the train a few minute after he look back upon I and beckon I for a parting word i be come back to-night he say i do not think i have any feeling about this as i turn away from that common bustle of the railway which make my private preoccupation feel so strangely out of date there have be a distinct satisfaction in my mind before that he scepticism have be so entirely defeat but the more serious part of the matter press upon I now i go straight from the railway to the manse which stand on a little plateau on the side of the river opposite to the wood of brentwood the minister be one of a class which be not so common in scotland as it use to be he be a man of good family well educate in the scotch way strong in philosophy not so strong in greek strongest of all in experience -- a man who have come across in the course of he life most people of note that have ever be in scotland and who be say to be very sound in doctrine without infringe the toleration with which old man who be good man be generally endowed he be old-fashioned perhaps he do not think so much about the troublous problem of theology as many of the young man nor ask himself any hard question about the confession of faith but he understand human nature which be perhaps better he receive I with a cordial welcome come away colonel mortimer he say i be all the more glad to see you that i feel it be a good sign for the boy he be do well -- god be praise -- and the lord bless he and keep he he have many a poor body 's prayer and that can do nobody harm he will need they all dr moncrieff i say and you counsel too and i tell he the story -- more than i have tell simson the old clergyman listen to I with many suppress exclamation and at the end the water stand in he eye that be just beautiful he say i do not mind to have hear anything like it it be as fine as burn when he wish deliverance to one -- that be pray for in no kirk ay ay so he would have you console the poor lose spirit god bless the boy there be something more than common in that colonel mortimer and also the faith of he in he father -- i would like to put that into a sermon then the old gentleman give I a alarmed look and say no no i be not mean a sermon but i must write it down for the ` child 's record ' i see the thought that pass through he mind either he think or he fear i would think of a funeral sermon you may believe this do not make I more cheerful i can scarcely say that dr moncrieff give I any advice how could any one advise on such a subject but he say i think i 'll come too i be a old man i be less liable to be frightened than those that be further off the world unseen it behoove I to think of my own journey there i have no cut-and-dry belief on the subject i 'll come too and maybe at the moment the lord will put into we head what to do this give I a little comfort -- more than simson have give I to be clear about the cause of it be not my grand desire it be another thing that be in my mind -- my boy as for the poor soul at the open door i have no more doubt as i have say of its existence than i have of my own it be no ghost to I i know the creature and it be in trouble that be my feeling about it as it be roland 's to hear it first be a great shock to my nerve but not now a man will get accustom to anything but to do something for it be the great problem how be i to be serviceable to a be that be invisible that be mortal no longer maybe at the moment the lord will put it into we head this be very old-fashioned phraseology and a week before most likely i should have smile -lrb- though always with kindness -rrb- at dr moncrieff 's credulity but there be a great comfort whether rational or otherwise i can not say in the mere sound of the word the road to the station and the village lay through the glen not by the ruin but though the sunshine and the fresh air and the beauty of the tree and the sound of the water be all very soothing to the spirit my mind be so full of my own subject that i could not refrain from turn to the right hand as i get to the top of the glen and go straight to the place which i may call the scene of all my thought it be lie full in the sunshine like all the rest of the world the ruin gable look due east and in the present aspect of the sun the light stream down through the door-way as we lantern have do throw a flood of light upon the damp grass beyond there be a strange suggestion in the open door -- so futile a kind of emblem of vanity : all free around so that you could go where you pleased and yet that semblance of a enclosure -- that way of entrance unnecessary lead to nothing and why any creature should pray and weep to get in -- to nothing or be keep out -- by nothing you could not dwell upon it or it make you brain go round i remember however what simson say about the juniper with a little smile on my own mind as to the inaccuracy of recollection which even a scientific man will be guilty of i could see now the light of my lantern gleam upon the wet glisten surface of the spiky leaf at the right hand -- and he ready to go to the stake for it that it be the left i go round to make sure and then i see what he have say right or left there be no juniper at all i be confound by this though it be entirely a matter of detail nothing at all -- a bush of bramble wave the grass grow up to the very wall but after all though it give I a shock for a moment what do that matter there be mark as if a number of footstep have be up and down in front of the door but these might have be we step and all be bright and peaceful and still i poke about the other ruin -- the larger ruin of the old house -- for some time as i have do before there be mark upon the grass here and there -- i could not call they footstep -- all about but that tell for nothing one way or another i have examine the ruin room closely the first day they be half fill up with soil and _ debris _ wither bracken and bramble -- no refuge for any one there it vex I that jarvi should see I come from that spot when he come up to I for he order i do not know whether my nocturnal expedition have get wind among the servant but there be a significant look in he face something in it i feel be like my own sensation when simson in the midst of he scepticism be strike dumb jarvi feel satisfied that he veracity have be put beyond question i never speak to a servant of mine in such a peremptory tone before i send he away with a flea in he lug as the man describe it afterwards interference of any kind be intolerable to I at such a moment but what be strangest of all be that i could not face roland i do not go up to he room as i would have naturally do at once this the girl could not understand they see there be some mystery in it mother have go to lie down agatha say he have have such a good night but he want you so papa cry little jeanie always with she two arm embrace mine in a pretty way she have i be oblige to go at last but what could i say i could only kiss he and tell he to keep still -- that i be do all i could there be something mystical about the patience of a child it will come all right will not it father he say god grant it may i hope so roland oh yes it will come all right perhaps he understand that in the midst of my anxiety i could not stay with he as i should have do otherwise but the girl be more surprised than it be possible to describe they look at I with wonder eye if i be ill papa and you only stay with I a moment i should break my heart say agatha but the boy have a sympathetic feeling he know that of my own will i would not have do it i shut myself up in the library where i could not rest but keep pacing up and down like a caged beast what could i do and if i could do nothing what would become of my boy these be the question that without cease pursued each other through my mind simson come out to dinner and when the house be all still and most of the servant in bed we go out and meet dr moncrieff as we have appoint at the head of the glen simson for he part be dispose to scoff at the doctor if there be to be any spell you know i 'll cut the whole concern he say i do not make he any reply i have not invite he he could go or come as he please he be very talkative far more so than suit my humor as we go on one thing be certain you know there must be some human agency he say it be all bosh about apparition i never have investigate the law of sound to any great extent and there be a great deal in ventriloquism that we do not know much about if it be the same to you i say i wish you would keep all that to yourself simson it do not suit my state of mind oh i hope i know how to respect idiosyncrasy he say the very tone of he voice irritated I beyond measure these scientific fellow i wonder people put up with they as they do when you have no mind for they cold-blooded confidence dr moncrieff meet we about eleven o'clock the same time as on the previous night he be a large man with a venerable countenance and white hair -- old but in full vigor and think less of a cold night walk than many a younger man he have he lantern as i have we be fully provide with means of light the place and we be all of we resolute man we have a rapid consultation as we go up and the result be that we divide to different post dr moncrieff remain inside the wall -- if you can call that inside where there be no wall but one simson place himself on the side next the ruin so as to intercept any communication with the old house which be what he mind be fix upon i be post on the other side to say that nothing could come near without be see be self-evident it have be so also on the previous night now with we three light in the midst of the darkness the whole place seem illuminate dr moncrieff 's lantern which be a large one without any means of shut up -- a old-fashioned lantern with a pierced and ornamental top -- shone steadily the ray shoot out of it upward into the gloom he place it on the grass where the middle of the room if this have be a room would have be the usual effect of the light streaming out of the door-way be prevent by the illumination which simson and i on either side supply with these difference everything seem as on the previous night and what occur be exactly the same with the same air of repetition point for point as i have formerly remark i declare that it seem to I as if i be push against put aside by the owner of the voice as he pace up and down in he trouble -- though these be perfectly futile word see that the stream of light from my lantern and that from simson 's taper lay broad and clear without a shadow without the smallest break across the entire breadth of the grass i have cease even to be alarm for my part my heart be rent with pity and trouble -- pity for the poor suffer human creature that moan and plead so and trouble for myself and my boy god if i could not find any help -- and what help could i find -- roland would die we be all perfectly still till the first outburst be exhaust as i know by experience it would be dr moncrieff to whom it be new be quite motionless on the other side of the wall as we be in we place my heart have remain almost at its usual beating during the voice i be use to it it do not rouse all my pulse as it do at first but just as it throw itself sob at the door -lrb- i can not use other word -rrb- there suddenly come something which send the blood course through my vein and my heart into my mouth it be a voice inside the wall -- the minister 's well-known voice i would have be prepare for it in any kind of adjuration but i be not prepare for what i hear it come out with a sort of stammer as if too much move for utterance willie willie oh god preserve we be it you these simple word have a effect upon I that the voice of the invisible creature have cease to have i think the old man whom i have bring into this danger have go mad with terror i make a dash round to the other side of the wall half craze myself with the thought he be stand where i have leave he he shadow throw vague and large upon the grass by the lantern which stand at he foot i lift my own light to see he face as i rush forward he be very pale he eye wet and glisten he mouth quiver with part lip he neither saw nor hear I we that have go through this experience before have crouch towards each other to get a little strength to bear it but he be not even aware that i be there he whole be seem absorb in anxiety and tenderness he hold out he hand which tremble but it seem to I with eagerness not fear he go on speak all the time willie if it be you -- and it be you if it be not a delusion of satan -- willie lad why come ye here fright they that know you not why come ye not to I he seem to wait for a answer when he voice cease he countenance every line move continue to speak simson give I another terrible shock steal into the open door-way with he light as much awe-stricken as wildly curious as i but the minister resume without see simson speak to some one else he voice take a tone of expostulation : -- be this right to come here you mother 's go with you name on she lip do you think she would ever close she door on she own lad do ye think the lord will close the door ye faint-hearted creature no -- i forbid ye i forbid ye cry the old man the sob voice have begin to resume its cry he make a step forward call out the last word in a voice of command i forbid ye cry out no more to man go home ye wander spirit go home do you hear I -- I that christen ye that have struggle with ye that have wrestle for ye with the lord here the loud tone of he voice sink into tenderness and she too poor woman poor woman she you be call upon she be not here you 'll find she with the lord go there and seek she not here do you hear I lad go after she there he 'll let you in though it be late man take heart if you will lie and sob and greet let it be at heaven 's gate and not you poor mother 's ruin door he stop to get he breath and the voice have stop not as it have do before when its time be exhaust and all its repetition say but with a sob catch in the breath as if overrule then the minister speak again be you hear I will oh laddie you have like the beggarly element all you day be do with they now go home to the father -- the father be you hear I here the old man sink down upon he knee he face raise upward he hand hold up with a tremble in they all white in the light in the midst of the darkness i resist as long as i could though i can not tell why then i too drop upon my knee simson all the time stand in the door-way with a expression in he face such as word could not tell he under lip drop he eye wild stare it seem to be to he that image of blank ignorance and wonder that we be pray all the time the voice with a low arrest sob lay just where he be stand as i think lord the minister say -- lord take he into thy everlasting habitation the mother he cry to be with thee who can open to he but thee lord when be it too late for thee or what be too hard for thee lord let that woman there draw he inower let she draw he inower i spring forward to catch something in my arm that fling itself wildly within the door the illusion be so strong that i never pause till i feel my forehead graze against the wall and my hand clutch the ground -- for there be nobody there to save from fall as in my foolishness i think simson hold out he hand to I to help I up he be tremble and cold he lower lip hang he speech almost inarticulate it be go he say stammer -- it be go we lean upon each other for a moment tremble so much both of we that the whole scene tremble as if it be go to dissolve and disappear and yet as long as i live i will never forget it -- the shine of the strange light the blackness all round the kneel figure with all the whiteness of the light concentrated on its white venerable head and uplifted hand a strange solemn stillness seem to close all round we by interval a single syllable lord lord come from the old minister 's lip he see none of we nor thought of we i never know how long we stand like sentinel guard he at he prayer hold we light in a confused dazed way not know what we do but at last he rise from he knee and stand up at he full height raise he arm as the scotch manner be at the end of a religious service and solemnly give the apostolical benediction -- to what to the silent earth the dark wood the wide breathing atmosphere for we be but spectator gasp a aman it seem to I that it must be the middle of the night as we all walk back it be in reality very late dr moncrieff put he arm into mine he walk slowly with a air of exhaustion it be as if we be come from a death-bed something hush and solemnize the very air there be that sense of relief in it which there always be at the end of a death-struggle and nature persistent never daunt come back in all of we as we return into the way of life we say nothing to each other indeed for a time but when we get clear of the tree and reach the opening near the house where we could see the sky dr moncrieff himself be the first to speak i must be go he say it be very late i be afraid i will go down the glen as i come but not alone i be go with you doctor well i will not oppose it i be a old man and agitation weary more than work yes i 'll be thankful of you arm to-night colonel you have do I more good turn than one i press he hand on my arm not feel able to speak but simson who turn with we and who have go along all this time with he taper flare in entire unconsciousness come to himself apparently at the sound of we voice and put out that wild little torch with a quick movement as if of shame let I carry you lantern he say it be heavy he recover with a spring and in a moment from the awe-stricken spectator he have be become himself sceptical and cynical i should like to ask you a question he say do you believe in purgatory doctor it be not in the tenet of the church so far as i know sir say dr moncrieff a old man like I be sometimes not very sure what he believe there be just one thing i be certain of -- and that be the loving-kindness of god but i think that be in this life i be no theologian -- sir say the old man again with a tremor in he which i could feel go over all he frame if i see a friend of mine within the gate of hell i would not despair but he father would take he by the hand still if he cry like _ you _ i allow it be very strange very strange i can not see through it that there must be human agency i feel sure doctor what make you decide upon the person and the name the minister put out he hand with the impatience which a man might show if he be ask how he recognize he brother tut he say in familiar speech then more solemnly how should i not recognize a person that i know better -- far better -- than i know you then you see the man dr moncrieff make no reply he move he hand again with a little impatient movement and walk on lean heavily on my arm and we go on for a long time without another word thread the dark path which be steep and slippery with the damp of the winter the air be very still -- not more than enough to make a faint sighing in the branch which mingle with the sound of the water to which we be descend when we speak again it be about indifferent matter -- about the height of the river and the recent rain we part with the minister at he own door where he old housekeeper appear in great perturbation wait for he eh I minister the young gentleman will be worse she cry far from that -- better god bless he dr moncrieff say i think if simson have begin again to I with he question i should have pitch he over the rock as we return up the glen but he be silent by a good inspiration and the sky be clearer than it have be for many night shine high over the tree with here and there a star faintly gleam through the wilderness of dark and bare branch the air as i have say be very soft in they with a subdue and peaceful cadence it be real like every natural sound and come to we like a hush of peace and relief i think there be a sound in it as of the breath of a sleeper and it seem clear to I that roland must be sleep satisfied and calm we go up to he room when we go in there we find the complete hush of rest my wife look up out of a doze and give I a smile : i think he be a great deal better but you be very late she say in a whisper shade the light with she hand that the doctor might see he patient the boy have get back something like he own color he wake as we stand all round he bed he eye have the happy half-awakened look of childhood glad to shut again yet please with the interruption and glimmer of the light i stoop over he and kiss he forehead which be moist and cool all be well roland i say he look up at I with a glance of pleasure and take my hand and lay he cheek upon it and so go to sleep \* \* \* \* \* for some night after i watch among the ruin spend all the dark hour up to midnight patrolling about the bit of wall which be associate with so many emotion but i hear nothing and see nothing beyond the quiet course of nature nor so far as i be aware have anything be hear again dr moncrieff give I the history of the youth whom he never hesitate to name i do not ask as simson do how he recognize he he have be a prodigal -- weak foolish easily impose upon and lead away as people say all that we have hear have pass actually in life the doctor say the young man have come home thus a day or two after he mother die -- who be no more than the housekeeper in the old house -- and distract with the news have throw himself down at the door and call upon she to let he in the old man could scarcely speak of it for tear to I it seem as if -- heaven help we how little do we know about anything -- a scene like that might impress itself somehow upon the hidden heart of nature i do not pretend to know how but the repetition have strike I at the time as in its terrible strangeness and incomprehensibility almost mechanical -- as if the unseen actor could not exceed or vary but be bind to re-enact the whole one thing that strike I however greatly be the likeness between the old minister and my boy in the manner of regard these strange phenomenon dr moncrieff be not terrify as i have be myself and all the rest of we it be no ghost as i fear we all vulgarly consider it to he -- but a poor creature whom he know under these condition just as he have know he in the flesh have no doubt of he identity and to roland it be the same this spirit in pain -- if it be a spirit -- this voice out of the unseen -- be a poor fellow-creature in misery to be succore and help out of he trouble to my boy he speak to I quite frankly about it when he get better i know father would find out some way he say and this be when he be strong and well and all idea that he would turn hysterical or become a seer of vision have happily pass away \* \* \* \* \* i must add one curious fact which do not seem to I to have any relation to the above but which simson make great use of as the human agency which he be determine to find somehow we have examine the ruin very closely at the time of these occurrence but afterwards when all be over as we go casually about they one Sunday afternoon in the idleness of that unemployed day simson with he stick penetrate a old window which have be entirely block up with fall soil he jump down into it in great excitement and call I to follow there we find a little hole -- for it be more a hole than a room -- entirely hide under the ivy and ruin in which there be a quantity of straw lay in a corner as if some one have make a bed there and some remains of crust about the floor some one have lodge there and not very long before he make out and that this unknown being be the author of all the mysterious sound we hear he be convinced i tell you it be human agency he say triumphantly he forget i suppose how he and i stand with we light see nothing while the space between we be audibly traverse by something that could speak and sob and suffer there be no argument with man of this kind he be ready to get up a laugh against I on this slender ground i be puzzle myself -- i could not make it out -- but i always feel convinced human agency be at the bottom of it and here it be -- and a clever fellow he must have be the doctor say bagley leave my service as soon as he get well he assure I it be no want of respect but he could not stand they kind of thing and the man be so shake and ghastly that i be glad to give he a present and let he go for my own part i make a point of stay out the time -- two year -- for which i have take brentwood but i do not renew my tenancy by that time we have settle and find for ourselves a pleasant home of we own i must add that when the doctor defy I i can always bring back gravity to he countenance and a pause in he railing when i remind he of the juniper-bush to I that be a matter of little importance i could believe i be mistaken i do not care about it one way or other but on he mind the effect be different the miserable voice the spirit in pain he could think of as the result of ventriloquism or reverberation or -- anything you please : a elaborate prolonged hoax execute somehow by the tramp that have find a lodging in the old tower but the juniper-bush stagger he thing have effect so different on the mind of different man ii the portrait at the period when the follow incident occur i be live with my father at the grove a large old house in the immediate neighborhood of a little town this have be he home for a number of year and i believe i be bear in it it be a kind of house which notwithstanding all the red and white architecture know at present by the name of queen anne builder nowadays have forget how to build it be straggle and irregular with wide passage wide staircase broad landing the room large but not very lofty the arrangement leave much to be desire with no economy of space a house belong to a period when land be cheap and so far as that be concern there be no occasion to economize though it be so near the town the clump of tree in which it be environ be a veritable grove in the grounds in spring the primrose grow as thickly as in the forest we have a few field for the cow and a excellent walled garden the place be be pull down at this moment to make room for more street of mean little house -- the kind of thing and not a dull house of fade gentry which perhaps the neighborhood require the house be dull and so be we its last inhabitant and the furniture be fade even a little dingy -- nothing to brag of i do not however intend to convey a suggestion that we be fade gentry for that be not the case my father indeed be rich and have no need to spare any expense in make he life and he house bright if he please but he do not please and i have not be long enough at home to exercise any special influence of my own it be the only home i have ever know but except in my earliest childhood and in my holiday as a schoolboy i have in reality known but little of it my mother have die at my birth or shortly after and i have grow up in the gravity and silence of a house without woman in my infancy i believe a sister of my father 's have live with we and take charge of the household and of I but she too have die long long ago my mourning for she be one of the first thing i could recollect and she have no successor there be indeed a housekeeper and some maid -- the latter of whom i only see disappear at the end of a passage or whisk out of a room when one of the gentleman appear mr weir indeed i see nearly every day but a curtsey a smile a pair of nice round arm which she caress while folding they across she ample waist and a large white apron be all i know of she this be the only female influence in the house the drawing-room i be aware of only as a place of deadly good order into which nobody ever enter it have three long window open on the lawn and communicate at the upper end which be round like a great bay with the conservatory sometimes i gaze into it as a child from without wonder at the needlework on the chair the screen the looking-glass which never reflect any live face my father do not like the room which probably be not wonderful though it never occur to I in those early day to inquire why i may say here though it will probably be disappointing to those who form a sentimental idea of the capability of child that it do not occur to I either in these early day to make any inquiry about my mother there be no room in life as i know it for any such person nothing suggest to my mind either the fact that she must have exist or that there be need of she in the house i accept as i believe most child do the fact of existence on the basis with which i have first make acquaintance with they without question or remark as a matter of fact i be aware that it be rather dull at home but neither by comparison with the book i read nor by the communication receive from my school-fellow do this seem to I anything remarkable and i be possibly somewhat dull too by nature for i do not mind i be fond of reading and for that there be unbounded opportunity i have a little ambition in respect to work and that too could be prosecute undisturbed when i go to the university my society lay almost entirely among man but by that time and afterwards matter have of course greatly change with I and though i recognize woman as part of the economy of nature and do not indeed by any means dislike or avoid they yet the idea of connect they at all with my own home never enter into my head that continue to be as it have always be when at interval i descend upon the cool grave colorless place in the midst of my traffic with the world : always very still well-ordered serious -- the cooking very good the comfort perfect old morphew the butler a little older -lrb- but very little older perhaps on the whole less old since in my childhood i have think he a kind of methuselah -rrb- and mr weir less active cover up she arm in sleeve but folding and caress they just as always i remember look in from the lawn through the window upon that deadly-orderly drawing-room with a humorous recollection of my childish admiration and wonder and feeling that it must be keep so forever and ever and that to go into it would break some sort of amusing mock mystery some pleasantly ridiculous spell but it be only at rare interval that i go home in the long vacation as in my school holiday my father often go abroad with I so that we have go over a great deal of the continent together very pleasantly he be old in proportion to the age of he son be a man of sixty when i be twenty but that do not disturb the pleasure of the relation between we i do not know that they be ever very confidential on my side there be but little to communicate for i do not get into scrape nor fall in love the two predicament which demand sympathy and confidence and as for my father himself i be never aware what there could be to communicate on he side i know he life exactly -- what he do almost at every hour of the day under what circumstance of the temperature he would ride and when walk how often and with what guest he would indulge in the occasional break of a dinner-party a serious pleasure -- perhaps indeed less a pleasure than a duty all this i know as well as he do and also he view on public matter he political opinion which naturally be different from mine what ground then remain for confidence i do not know any we be both of we of a reserved nature not apt to enter into we religious feeling for instance there be many people who think reticence on such subject a sign of the most reverential way of contemplate they of this i be far from be sure but at all event it be the practice most congenial to my own mind and then i be for a long time absent make my own way in the world i do not make it very successfully i accomplish the natural fate of a englishman and go out to the colony then to indium in a semi-diplomatic position but return home after seven or eight year invalide in bad health and not much better spirit tire and disappoint with my first trial of life i have as people say no occasion to insist on make my way my father be rich and have never give I the slightest reason to believe that he do not intend I to be he heir he allowance to I be not illiberal and though he do not oppose the carry out of my own plan he by no means urge I to exertion when i come home he receive I very affectionately and express he satisfaction in my return of course he say i be not glad that you be disappointed philip or that you health be break but otherwise it be a ill wind you know that blow nobody good and i be very glad to have you at home i be grow a old man -- i do not see any difference sir say i everything here seem exactly the same as when i go away -- he smile and shake he head it be true enough he say after we have reach a certain age we seem to go on for a long time on a plane and feel no great difference from year to year but it be a inclined plane and the longer we go on the more sudden will be the fall at the end but at all event it will be a great comfort to I to have you here if i have know that i say and that you want I i should have come in any circumstance as there be only two of we in the world -- yes he say there be only two of we in the world but still i should not have send for you phil to interrupt you career it be as well then that it have interrupt itself i say rather bitterly for disappointment be hard to bear he pat I on the shoulder and repeat it be a ill wind that blow nobody good with a look of real pleasure which give I a certain gratification too for after all he be a old man and the only one in all the world to whom i owe any duty i have not be without dream of warmer affection but they have come to nothing -- not tragically but in the ordinary way i might perhaps have have love which i do not want but not that which i do want -- which be not a thing to make any unmanly moan about but in the ordinary course of event such disappointment happen every day indeed they be more common than anything else and sometimes it be apparent afterwards that it be better it be so however here i be at thirty strand yet want for nothing -- in a position to call forth rather envy than pity from the greater part of my contemporary for i have a assure and comfortable existence as much money as i want and the prospect of a excellent fortune for the future on the other hand my health be still low and i have no occupation the neighborhood of the town be a drawback rather than a advantage i feel myself tempt instead of take the long walk into the country which my doctor recommend to take a much shorter one through the high street across the river and back again which be not a walk but a lounge the country be silent and full of thought -- thought not always very agreeable -- whereas there be always the humor of the little urban population to glance at the news to be hear -- all those petty matter which so often make up life in a very impoverished version for the idle man i do not like it but i feel myself yield to it not have energy enough to make a stand the rector and the lead lawyer of the place ask I to dinner i might have glide into the society such as it be have i be dispose for that everything about I begin to close over I as if i have be fifty and fully contented with my lot it be possibly my own want of occupation which make I observe with surprise after a while how much occupy my father be he have express himself glad of my return but now that i have return i see very little of he most of he time be spend in he library as have always be the case but on the few visit i pay he there i could not but perceive that the aspect of the library be much change it have acquire the look of a business-room almost a office there be large business-like book on the table which i could not associate with anything he could naturally have to do and he correspondence be very large i think he close one of those book hurriedly as i come in and push it away as if he do not wish I to see it this surprise I at the moment without arouse any other feeling but afterwards i remember it with a clearer sense of what it mean he be more absorb altogether than i have be use to see he he be visit by man sometimes not of very prepossessing appearance surprise grow in my mind without any very distinct idea of the reason of it and it be not till after a chance conversation with morphew that my vague uneasiness begin to take definite shape it be begin without any special intention on my part morphew have inform I that master be very busy on some occasion when i want to see he and i be a little annoyed to be thus put off it appear to I that my father be always busy i say hastily morphew then begin very oracularly to nod he head in assent a deal too busy sir if you take my opinion he say this startle I much and i ask hurriedly what do you mean without reflect that to ask for private information from a servant about my father 's habit be as bad as investigate into a stranger 's affair it do not strike I in the same light mr philip say morphew a thing ` as ` appen as ` appen more often than it ought to master have get awful keen about money in he old age that be a new thing for he i say no sir beg you pardon it be not a new thing he be once break of it and that be not easy do but it be come back if you 'll excuse I say so and i do not know as he 'll ever be break of it again at he age i feel more disposed to be angry than disturb by this you must be make some ridiculous mistake i say and if you be not so old a friend as you be morphew i should not have allow my father to be so speak of to I the old man give I a half-astonished half-contemptuous look he be be my master a deal longer than he be be you father he say turn on he heel the assumption be so comical that my anger could not stand in face of it i go out have be on my way to the door when this conversation occur and take my usual lounge about which be not a satisfactory sort of amusement its vanity and emptiness appear to be more evident than usual to-day i meet half-a-dozen people i know and have as many piece of news confide to I i go up and down the length of the high street i make a small purchase or two and then i turn homeward despise myself yet find no alternative within my reach would a long country walk have be more virtuous it would at least have be more wholesome but that be all that could be say my mind do not dwell on morphew 's communication it seem without sense or mean to I and after the excellent joke about he superior interest in he master to mine in my father be dismiss lightly enough from my mind i try to invent some way of tell this to my father without let he perceive that morphew have be find fault in he or i listen for it seem a pity to lose so good a joke however as i return home something happen which put the joke entirely out of my head it be curious when a new subject of trouble or anxiety have be suggest to the mind in a unexpected way how often a second advertisement follow immediately after the first and give to that a potency which in itself it have not possess i be approach we own door wonder whether my father have go and whether on my return i should find he at leisure -- for i have several little thing to say to he -- when i notice a poor woman linger about the closed gate she have a baby sleep in she arm it be a spring night the star shine in the twilight and everything soft and dim and the woman 's figure be like a shadow flit about now here now there on one side or another of the gate she stop when she see I approach and hesitate for a moment then seem to take a sudden resolution i watch she without know with a prevision that she be go to address I though with no sort of idea as to the subject of she address she come up to I doubtfully it seem yet certainly as i feel and when she be close to I drop a sort of hesitate curtsey and say it be mr philip in a low voice what do you want with I i say then she pour forth suddenly without warn or preparation she long speech -- a flood of word which must have be all ready and wait at the door of she lip for utterance oh sir i want to speak to you i can not believe you 'll be so hard for you be young and i can not believe he 'll be so hard if so be as he own son as i have always hear he have but one 'll speak up for we oh gentleman it be easy for the likes of you that if you be not comfortable in one room can just walk into another but if one room be all you have and every bit of furniture you have take out of it and nothing but the four wall leave -- not so much as the cradle for the child or a chair for you man to sit down upon when he come from he work or a saucepan to cook he he supper -- my good woman i say who can have take all that from you surely nobody can be so cruel you say it be cruel she cry with a sort of triumph oh i knowed you would or any true gentleman that do not hold with screw poor folk just go and say that to he inside there for the love of god tell he to think what he be do drive poor creature to despair summer 's come the lord be praise but yet it be bitter cold at night with you counterpane go and when you have be work hard all day and nothing but four bare wall to come home to and all you poor little stick of furniture that you have save up for and get together one by one all go and you no better than when you start or rather worse for then you be young oh sir the woman 's voice rise into a sort of passionate wail and then she add beseechingly recover herself oh speak for we he 'll not refuse he own son -- to whom be i to speak who be it that have do this to you i say the woman hesitate again look keenly in my face then repeat with a slight falter it be mr philip as if that make everything right yes i be philip canning i say but what have i to do with this and to whom be i to speak she begin to whimper cry and stop herself oh please sir it be mr canning as own all the house property about it be he that we court and the lane and everything belong to and he be take the bed from under we and the baby 's cradle although it be say in the bible as you be not to take poor folk ' bed my father i cry in spite of myself then it must be some agent some one else in he name you may be sure he know nothing of it of course i shall speak to he at once oh god bless you sir say the woman but then she add in a lower tone it be no agent it be one as never know trouble it be he that live in that grand house but this be say under she breath evidently not for I to hear morphew 's word flash through my mind as she speak what be this do it afford a explanation of the much-occupied hour the big book the strange visitor i take the poor woman 's name and give she something to procure a few comfort for the night and go indoors disturbed and trouble it be impossible to believe that my father himself would have act thus but he be not a man to brook interference and i do not see how to introduce the subject what to say i could but hope that at the moment of broach it word would be put into my mouth which often happen in moment of necessity one know not how even when one 's theme be not so all-important as that for which such help have be promise as usual i do not see my father till dinner i have say that we dinner be very good luxurious in a simple way everything excellent in its kind well cook well serve -- the perfection of comfort without show -- which be a combination very dear to the english heart i say nothing till morphew with he solemn attention to everything that be go have retire and then it be with some strain of courage that i begin i be stop outside the gate to-day by a curious sort of petitioner -- a poor woman who seem to be one of you tenant sir but whom you agent must have be rather too hard upon my agent who be that say my father quietly i do not know he name and i doubt he competence the poor creature seem to have have everything take from she -- she bed she child 's cradle no doubt she be behind with she rent very likely sir she seem very poor say i you take it coolly say my father with a upward glance half-amuse not in the least shock by my statement but when a man or a woman either take a house i suppose you will allow that they ought to pay rent for it certainly sir i reply when they have get anything to pay i do not allow the reservation he say but he be not angry which i have fear he would be i think i continue that you agent must be too severe and this embolden I to say something which have be in my mind for some time -- -lrb- these be the word no doubt which i have hope would be put into my month they be the suggestion of the moment and yet as i say they it be with the most complete conviction of they truth -rrb- -- and that be this : i be do nothing my time hang heavy on my hand make I you agent i will see for myself and save you from such mistake and it will be a occupation -- mistake what warrant have you for say these be mistake he say testily then after a moment : this be a strange proposal from you phil do you know what it be you be offer -- to be a collector of rent go about from door to door from week to week to look after wretched little bit of repair drain etc to get pay which after all be the chief thing and not to be take in by tale of poverty not to let you be take in by man without pity i say he give I a strange glance which i do not very well understand and say abruptly a thing which so far as i remember he have never in my life say before you have become a little like you mother phil -- my mother the reference be so unusual -- nay so unprecedented -- that i be greatly startle it seem to I like the sudden introduction of a quite new element in the stagnant atmosphere as well as a new party to we conversation my father look across the table as if with some astonishment at my tone of surprise be that so very extraordinary he say no of course it be not extraordinary that i should resemble my mother only -- i have hear very little of she -- almost nothing that be true he get up and place himself before the fire which be very low as the night be not cold -- have not be cold heretofore at least but it seem to I now that a little chill come into the dim and fade room perhaps it look more dull from the suggestion of a something brighter warmer that might have be talk of mistake he say perhaps that be one : to sever you entirely from she side of the house but i do not care for the connection you will understand how it be that i speak of it now when i tell you -- he stop here however say nothing more for a minute or so and then ring the bell morphew come as he always do very deliberately so that some time elapse in silence during which my surprise grow when the old man appear at the door -- have you put the light in the drawing-room as i tell you my father say yes sir and open the box sir and it be a -- it be a speak likeness -- this the old man get out in a great hurry as if afraid that he master would stop he my father do so with a wave of he hand that be enough i ask no information you can go now the door close upon we and there be again a pause my subject have float away altogether like a mist though i have be so concerned about it i try to resume but could not something seem to arrest my very breathing and yet in this dull respectable house of ours where everything breathe good character and integrity it be certain that there could be no shameful mystery to reveal it be some time before my father speak not from any purpose that i could see but apparently because he mind be busy with probably unaccustomed thought you scarcely know the drawing-room phil he say at last very little i have never see it use i have a little awe of it to tell the truth that should not be there be no reason for that but a man by himself as i have be for the greater part of my life have no occasion for a drawing-room i always as a matter of preference sit among my book however i ought to have think of the impression on you oh it be not important i say the awe be childish i have not think of it since i come home it never be anything very splendid at the best say he he lift the lamp from the table with a sort of abstraction not remark even my offer to take it from he and lead the way he be on the verge of seventy and look he age but it be a vigorous age with no symptom of give way the circle of light from the lamp light up he white hair and keen blue eye and clear complexion he forehead be like old ivory he cheek warmly color a old man yet a man in full strength he be taller than i be and still almost as strong as he stand for a moment with the lamp in he hand he look like a tower in he great height and bulk i reflect as i look at he that i know he intimately more intimately than any other creature in the world -- i be familiar with every detail of he outward life could it be that in reality i do not know he at all \* \* \* \* \* the drawing-room be already light with a flickering array of candle upon the mantelpiece and along the wall produce the pretty starry effect which candle give without very much light as i have not the smallest idea what i be about to see for morphew 's speaking likeness be very hurriedly say and only half comprehensible in the bewilderment of my faculty my first glance be at this very unusual illumination for which i could assign no reason the next show I a large full-length portrait still in the box in which apparently it have travel place upright support against a table in the center of the room my father walk straight up to it motion to I to place a smaller table close to the picture on the left side and put he lamp upon that then he wave he hand towards it and stand aside that i might see it be a full-length portrait of a very young woman -- i might say a girl scarcely twenty -- in a white dress make in a very simple old fashion though i be too little accustomed to female costume to be able to fix the date it might have be a hundred year old or twenty for aught i know the face have a expression of youth candor and simplicity more than any face i have ever see -- or so at least in my surprise i think the eye be a little wistful with something which be almost anxiety which at least be not content -- in they a faint almost imperceptible curve in the lid the complexion be of a dazzling fairness the hair light but the eye dark which give individuality to the face it would have be as lovely have the eye be blue -- probably more so -- but they darkness give a touch of character a slight discord which make the harmony finer it be not perhaps beautiful in the highest sense of the word the girl must have be too young too slight too little developed for actual beauty but a face which so invite love and confidence i never see one smile at it with instinctive affection what a sweet face i say what a lovely girl who be she be this one of the relation you be speak of on the other side my father make I no reply he stand aside look at it as if he know it too well to require to look -- as if the picture be already in he eye yes he say after a interval with a long-drawn breath she be a lovely girl as you say be -- then she be dead what a pity i say what a pity so young and so sweet we stand gaze at she thus in she beautiful stillness and calm -- two man the younger of we full-grown and conscious of many experience the other a old man -- before this impersonation of tender youth at length he say with a slight tremulousness in he voice do nothing suggest to you who she be phil i turn round to look at he with profound astonishment but he turn away from my look a sort of quiver pass over he face that be you mother he say and walk suddenly away leave I there my mother i stand for a moment in a kind of consternation before the white-robed innocent creature to I no more than a child then a sudden laugh break from I without any will of mine something ludicrous as well as something awful be in it when the laugh be over i find myself with tear in my eye gaze hold my breath the soft feature seem to melt the lip to move the anxiety in the eye to become a personal inquiry ah no nothing of the kind only because of the water in mine my mother oh fair and gentle creature scarcely woman how could any man 's voice call she by that name i have little idea enough of what it mean -- have hear it laugh at scoff at reverenced but never have learn to place it even among the ideal power of life yet if it mean anything at all what it mean be worth thinking of what do she ask look at I with those eye what would she have say if those lip have language if i have know she only as cowper do -- with a child 's recollection -- there might have be some thread some faint but comprehensible link between we but now all that i feel be the curious incongruity poor child i say to myself so sweet a creature : poor little tender soul as if she have be a little sister a child of mine -- but my mother i can not tell how long i stand look at she study the candid sweet face which surely have germ in it of everything that be good and beautiful and sorry with a profound regret that she have die and never carry these promise to fulfillment poor girl poor people who have love she these be my thought with a curious vertigo and giddiness of my whole be in the sense of a mysterious relationship which it be beyond my power to understand presently my father come back possibly because i have be a long time unconscious of the passage of the minute or perhaps because he be himself restless in the strange disturbance of he habitual calm he come in and put he arm within mine lean he weight partially upon I with a affectionate suggestion which go deeper than word i press he arm to my side : it be more between we two grave englishman than any embrace i can not understand it i say no i do not wonder at that but if it be strange to you phil think how much more strange to I that be the partner of my life i have never have another or think of another that -- girl if we be to meet again as i have always hope we should meet again what be i to say to she -- i a old man yes i know what you mean i be not a old man for my year but my year be threescore and ten and the play be nearly play out how be i to meet that young creature we use to say to each other that it be forever that we never could be but one that it be for life and death but what -- what be i to say to she phil when i meet she again that -- that angel no it be not she be a angel that trouble I but she be so young she be like my -- my granddaughter he cry with a burst of what be half sob half laughter and she be my wife -- and i be a old man -- a old man and so much have happen that she could not understand i be too much startle by this strange complaint to know what to say it be not my own trouble and i answer it in the conventional way they be not as we be sir i say they look upon we with larger other eye than ours ah you do not know what i mean he say quickly and in the interval he have subdue he emotion at first after she die it be my consolation to think that i should meet she again -- that we never could be really part but my god how i have change since then i be another man -- i be a different be i be not very young even then -- twenty year older than she be but she youth renew mine i be not a unfit partner she ask no better and know as much more than i do in some thing -- be so much nearer the source -- as i do in other that be of the world but i have go a long way since then phil -- a long way and there she stand just where i leave she i press he arm again father i say which be a title i seldom use we be not to suppose that in a higher life the mind stand still i do not feel myself qualify to discuss such topic but something one must say worse worse he reply then she too will be like I a different being and we shall meet as what as stranger as people who have lose sight of each other with a long past between we -- we who part my god with -- with -- he voice break and end for a moment then while surprised and almost shock by what he say i cast about in my mind what to reply he withdraw he arm suddenly from mine and say in he usual tone where shall we hang the picture phil it must be here in this room what do you think will be the best light this sudden alteration take I still more by surprise and give I almost a additional shock but it be evident that i must follow the change of he mood or at least the sudden repression of sentiment which he originate we go into that simpler question with great seriousness consulting which would be the best light you know i can scarcely advise i say i have never be familiar with this room i should like to put off if you do not mind till daylight i think he say that this would be the best place it be on the other side of the fireplace on the wall which face the window -- not the best light i know enough to be aware for a oil-painting when i say so however he answer I with a little impatience it do not matter very much about the best light there will be nobody to see it but you and I i have my reason -- there be a small table standing against the wall at this spot on which he have he hand as he speak upon it stand a little basket in very fine lace-like wicker-work he hand must have tremble for the table shake and the basket fall its contents turn out upon the carpet -- little bit of needlework color silk a small piece of knit half do he laugh as they roll out at he foot and try to stoop to collect they then totter to a chair and cover for a moment he face with he hand no need to ask what they be no woman 's work have be see in the house since i could recollect it i gather they up reverently and put they back i could see ignorant as i be that the bit of knit be something for a infant what could i do less than put it to my lip it have be leave in the do -- for I yes i think this be the best place my father say a minute after in he usual tone we place it there that evening with we own hand the picture be large and in a heavy frame but my father would let no one help I but himself and then with a superstition for which i never could give any reason even to myself have remove the packing we close and lock the door leave the candle about the room in they soft strange illumination light the first night of she return to she old place that night no more be say my father go to he room early which be not he habit he have never however accustom I to sit late with he in the library i have a little study or smoking-room of my own in which all my special treasure be the collection of my travels and my favorite book -- and where i always sit after prayer a ceremonial which be regularly keep up in the house i retire as usual this night to my room and as usual read -- but to-night somewhat vaguely often pause to think when it be quite late i go out by the glass door to the lawn and walk round the house with the intention of look in at the drawing-room window as i have do when a child but i have forget that these window be all shutter at night and nothing but a faint penetration of the light within through the crevice bear witness to the installment of the new dweller there in the morning my father be entirely himself again he tell I without emotion of the manner in which he have obtain the picture it have belong to my mother 's family and have fall eventually into the hand of a cousin of hers resident abroad -- a man whom i do not like and who do not like I my father say there be or have be some rivalry he think : a mistake but he be never aware of that he refuse all my request to have a copy make you may suppose phil that i wish this very much have i succeed you would have be acquaint at least with you mother 's appearance and need not have sustain this shock but he would not consent it give he i think a certain pleasure to think that he have the only picture but now he be dead and out of remorse or with some other intention have leave it to I that look like kindness say i yes or something else he might have think that by so do he be establish a claim upon I my father say but he do not seem disposed to add any more on whose behalf he mean to establish a claim i do not know nor who the man be who have lay we under so great a obligation on he death-bed he _ have _ establish a claim on I at least though as he be dead i could not see on whose behalf it be and my father say nothing more he seem to dislike the subject when i attempt to return to it he have recourse to he letter or he newspaper evidently he have make up he mind to say no more afterwards i go into the drawing-room to look at the picture once more it seem to I that the anxiety in she eye be not so evident as i have think it last night the light possibly be more favorable she stand just above the place where i make no doubt she have sit in life where she little work-basket be -- not very much above it the picture be full-length and we have hang it low so that she might have be step into the room and be little above my own level as i stand and look at she again once more i smile at the strange thought that this young creature -- so young almost childish -- could be my mother and once more my eye grow wet look at she he be a benefactor indeed who have give she back to we i say to myself that if i could ever do anything for he or he i would certainly do it for my -- for this lovely young creature 's sake and with this in my mind and all the thought that come with it i be oblige to confess that the other matter which i have be so full of on the previous night go entirely out of my head \* \* \* \* \* it be rarely however that such matter be allow to slip out of one 's mind when i go out in the afternoon for my usual stroll -- or rather when i return from that stroll -- i see once more before I the woman with she baby whose story have fill I with dismay on the previous evening she be wait at the gate as before and oh gentleman but have not you get some news to give I she say my good woman -- i -- have be greatly occupy i have have -- no time to do anything ah she say with a little cry of disappointment my man say not to make too sure and that the way of the gentlefolk be hard to know i can not explain to you i say as gently as i could what it be that have make I forget you it be a event that can only do you good in the end go home now and see the man that take you thing from you and tell he to come to I i promise you it shall all be put right the woman look at I in astonishment then burst forth as it seem involuntarily what without ask no question after this there come a storm of tear and blessing from which i make haste to escape but not without carry that curious commentary on my rashness away with I -- without ask no question it might be foolish perhaps but after all how slight a matter to make the poor creature comfortable at the cost of what -- a box or two of cigar perhaps or some other trifle and if it should be she own fault or she husband 's -- what then have i be punish for all my fault where should i have be now and if the advantage should be only temporary what then to be relieve and comfort even for a day or two be not that something to count in life thus i quench the fiery dart of criticism which my _ protégée _ herself have throw into the transaction not without a certain sense of the humor of it its effect however be to make I less anxious to see my father to repeat my proposal to he and to call he attention to the cruelty perform in he name this one case i have take out of the category of wrong to be right by assume arbitrarily the position of providence in my own person -- for of course i have bind myself to pay the poor creature 's rent as well as redeem she goods -- and whatever might happen to she in the future have take the past into my own hand the man come presently to see I who it seem have act as my father 's agent in the matter i do not know sir how mr canning will take it he say he do not want none of those irregular bad-paying one in he property he always say as to look over it and let the rent run on be make thing worse in the end he rule be ` never more than a month steven ' that be what mr canning say to I sir he say ` more than that they can not pay it be no use try ' and it be a good rule it be a very good rule he will not hear none of they story sir bless you you would never get a penny of rent from they small house if you listen to they tale but if so be as you 'll pay mr jordan 's rent it be none of my business how it be pay so long as it be pay and i 'll send she back she thing but they 'll just have to be take next time he add composedly over and over it be always the same story with they sort of poor folk -- they be too poor for anything that be the truth the man say morphew come back to my room after my visitor be go mr philip he say you 'll excuse I sir but if you be go to pay all the poor folk ' rent as have distress put in you may just go into the court at once for it be without end -- i be go to be the agent myself morphew and manage for my father and we 'll soon put a stop to that i say more cheerfully than i feel manage for -- master he say with a face of consternation you mr philip you seem to have a great contempt for I morphew he do not deny the fact he say with excitement master sir -- master do not let himself be put a stop to by any man master 's -- not one to be manage do not you quarrel with master mr philip for the love of god the old man be quite pale quarrel i say i have never quarrel with my father and i do not mean to begin now morphew dispel he own excitement by make up the fire which be die in the grate it be a very mild spring evening and he make up a great blaze which would have suit December this be one of many way in which a old servant will relieve he mind he mutter all the time as he throw on the coal and wood he 'll not like it -- we all know as he 'll not like it master will not stand no meddling mr philip -- this last he discharge at I like a fly arrow as he close the door i soon find there be truth in what he say my father be not angry he be even half amuse i do not think that plan of yours will hold water phil i hear you have be pay rent and redeeming furniture -- that be a expensive game and a very profitless one of course so long as you be a benevolent gentleman act for you own pleasure it make no difference to I i be quite content if i get my money even out of you pocket -- so long as it amuse you but as my collector you know which you be good enough to propose to be -- of course i should act under you order i say but at least you might be sure that i would not commit you to any -- to any -- i pause for a word act of oppression he say with a smile -- piece of cruelty exaction -- there be half-a-dozen word -- sir -- i cry stop phil and let we understand each other i hope i have always be a just man i do my duty on my side and i expect it from other it be you benevolence that be cruel i have calculate anxiously how much credit it be safe to allow but i will allow no man or woman either to go beyond what he or she can make up my law be fix now you understand my agent as you call they originate nothing they execute only what i decide -- but then no circumstance be take into account -- no bad luck no evil chance no loss unexpected there be no evil chance he say there be no bad luck they reap as they sow no i do not go among they to be cheat by they story and spend quite unnecessary emotion in sympathize with they you will find it much better for you that i do not i deal with they on a general rule make i assure you not without a great deal of thought and must it always be so i say be there no way of ameliorate or bring in a better state of thing it seem not he say we do not get ` no forrarder ' in that direction so far as i can see and then he turn the conversation to general matter i retire to my room greatly discourage that night in former age -- or so one be lead to suppose -- and in the lower primitive class who still linger near the primeval type action of any kind be and be easier than amid the complication of we higher civilization a bad man be a distinct entity against whom you know more or less what step to take a tyrant a oppressor a bad landlord a man who let miserable tenement at a rack-rent -lrb- to come down to particulars -rrb- and expose he wretched tenant to all those abomination of which we have hear so much -- well he be more or less a satisfactory opponent there he be and there be nothing to be say for he -- down with he and let there be a end of he wickedness but when on the contrary you have before you a good man a just man who have consider deeply a question which you allow to be full of difficulty who regret but can not be human avert the misery which to some unhappy individual follow from the very wisdom of he rule -- what can you do what be to be do individual benevolence at haphazard may balk he here and there but what have you to put in the place of he well-considered scheme charity which make pauper or what else i have not consider the question deeply but it seem to I that i now come to a blank wall which my vague human sentiment of pity and scorn could find no way to breach there must be wrong somewhere but where there must be some change for the better to be make but how i be seat with a book before I on the table with my head support on my hand my eye be on the print page but i be not read my mind be full of these thought my heart of great discouragement and despondency -- a sense that i could do nothing yet that there surely must and ought if i but know it be something to do the fire which morphew have build up before dinner be die out the shaded lamp on my table leave all the corner in a mysterious twilight the house be perfectly still no one moving : my father in the library where after the habit of many solitary year he like to be leave alone and i here in my retreat prepare for the formation of similar habit i think all at once of the third member of the party the new-comer alone too in the room that have be hers and there suddenly occur to I a strong desire to take up my lamp and go to the drawing-room and visit she to see whether she soft angelic face would give any inspiration i restrained however this futile impulse -- for what could the picture say -- and instead wonder what might have be have she live have she be there warmly enthrone beside the warm domestic center the hearth which would have be a common sanctuary the true home in that case what might have be alas the question be no more simple to answer than the other : she might have be there alone too she husband 's business she son 's thought as far from she as now when she silent representative hold she old place in the silence and darkness i have know it so often enough love itself do not always give comprehension and sympathy it might be that she be more to we there in the sweet image of she undeveloped beauty than she might have be have she live and grow to maturity and fading like the rest i can not be certain whether my mind be still linger on this not very cheerful reflection or if it have be leave behind when the strange occurrence come of which i have now to tell can i call it a occurrence my eye be on my book when i think i hear the sound of a door opening and shut but so far away and faint that if real at all it must have be in a far corner of the house i do not move except to lift my eye from the book as one do instinctively the better to listen when -- but i can not tell nor have i ever be able to describe exactly what it be my heart make all at once a sudden leap in my breast i be aware that this language be figurative and that the heart can not leap but it be a figure so entirely justify by sensation that no one will have any difficulty in understand what i mean my heart leap up and begin beat wildly in my throat in my ear as if my whole be have receive a sudden and intolerable shock the sound go through my head like the dizzy sound of some strange mechanism a thousand wheel and spring circle echo work in my brain i feel the blood bind in my vein my mouth become dry my eye hot a sense of something insupportable take possession of I i spring to my foot and then i sit down again i cast a quick glance round I beyond the brief circle of the lamplight but there be nothing there to account in any way for this sudden extraordinary rush of sensation nor could i feel any meaning in it any suggestion any moral impression i think i must be go to be ill and get out my watch and feel my pulse : it be beat furiously about one hundred and twenty-five throb in a minute i know of no illness that could come on like this without warn in a moment and i try to subdue myself to say to myself that it be nothing some flutter of the nerve some physical disturbance i lay myself down upon my sofa to try if rest would help I and keep still as long as the thumping and throbbing of this wild excited mechanism within like a wild beast plunging and struggle would let I i be quite aware of the confusion of the metaphor the reality be just so it be like a mechanism deranged go wildly with ever-increasing precipitation like those horrible wheel that from time to time catch a helpless human be in they and tear he to piece but at the same time it be like a maddened living creature make the wildest effort to get free when i could bear this no longer i get up and walk about my room then have still a certain command of myself though i could not master the commotion within I i deliberately take down a exciting book from the shelf a book of breathless adventure which have always interested I and try with that to break the spell after a few minute however i flung the book aside i be gradually lose all power over myself what i should be move to do -- to shout aloud to struggle with i know not what or if i be go mad altogether and next moment must be a rave lunatic -- i could not tell i keep look round expect i do not know what several time with the corner of my eye i seem to see a movement as if some one be steal out of sight but when i look straight there be never anything but the plain outline of the wall and carpet the chair stand in good order at last i snatch up the lamp in my hand and go out of the room to look at the picture which have be faintly show in my imagination from time to time the eye more anxious than ever look at I from out the silent air but no i pass the door of that room swiftly move it seem without any volition of my own and before i know where i be go go into my father 's library with my lamp in my hand he be still sit there at he writing-table he look up astonished to see I hurry in with my light phil he say surprised i remember that i shut the door behind I and come up to he and set down the lamp on he table my sudden appearance alarm he what be the matter he cry philip what have you be do with yourself i sit down on the nearest chair and gasp gaze at he the wild commotion cease the blood subside into its natural channel my heart resume its place i use such word as mortal weakness can to express the sensation i feel i come to myself thus gaze at he confound at once by the extraordinary passion which i have go through and its sudden cessation the matter i cry i do not know what be the matter my father have push he spectacles up from he eye he appear to I as face appear in a fever all glorified with light which be not in they -- he eye glowing he white hair shine like silver but he look be severe you be not a boy that i should reprove you but you ought to know better he say then i explain to he so far as i be able what have happen have happen nothing have happen he do not understand I nor do i now that it be over understand myself but he see enough to make he aware that the disturbance in I be serious and not cause by any folly of my own he be very kind as soon as he have assure himself of this and talk taking pain to bring I back to unexciting subject he have a letter in he hand with a very deep border of black when i come in i observe it without take any notice or associate it with anything i know he have many correspondent and although we be excellent friend we have never be on those confidential term which warrant one man in ask another from whom a special letter have come we be not so near to each other as this though we be father and son after a while i go back to my own room and finish the evening in my usual way without any return of the excitement which now that it be over look to I like some extraordinary dream what have it mean have it mean anything i say to myself that it must be purely physical something go temporarily amiss which have right itself it be physical the excitement do not affect my mind i be independent of it all the time a spectator of my own agitation a clear proof that whatever it be it have affect my bodily organization alone next day i return to the problem which i have not be able to solve i find out my petitioner in the back street and that she be happy in the recovery of she possession which to my eye indeed do not seem very worthy either of lamentation or delight nor be she house the tidy house which injure virtue should have when restore to its humble rights she be not injure virtue it be clear she make I a great many curtsey and pour forth a number of blessing she man come in while i be there and hope in a gruff voice that god would reward I and that the old gentleman would let 'em alone i do not like the look of the man it seem to I that in the dark lane behind the house of a winter 's night he would not be a pleasant person to find in one 's way nor be this all : when i go out into the little street which it appear be all or almost all my father 's property a number of group form in my way and at least half-a-dozen applicant sidle up i have more claim nor mary jordan any day say one i have live on squire canning 's property one place and another this twenty year and what do you say to I say another i have six child to she two bless you sir and ne'er a father to do for they i believe in my father 's rule before i get out of the street and approve he wisdom in keep himself free from personal contact with he tenant yet when i look back upon the swarm thoroughfare the mean little house the woman at they door all so open-mouthed and eager to contend for my favor my heart sink within I at the thought that out of they misery some portion of we wealth come i do not care how small a portion that i young and strong should be keep idle and in luxury in some part through the money screw out of they necessity obtain sometimes by the sacrifice of everything they prize of course i know all the ordinary commonplace of life as well as any one -- that if you build a house with you hand or you money and let it the rent of it be you just due and must be pay but yet -- do not you think sir i say that evening at dinner the subject be reintroduce by my father himself that we have some duty towards they when we draw so much from they certainly he say i take as much trouble about they drain as i do about my own that be always something i suppose something it be a great deal it be more than they get anywhere else i keep they clean as far as that be possible i give they at least the means of keep clean and thus check disease and prolong life which be more i assure you than they have any right to expect i be not prepare with argument as i ought to have be that be all in the gospel accord to adam smith which my father have be bring up in but of which the tenet have begin to be less binding in my day i want something more or else something less but my view be not so clear nor my system so logical and well-built as that upon which my father rest he conscience and draw he percentage with a light heart yet i think there be sign in he of some perturbation i meet he one morning come out of the room in which the portrait hang as if he have go to look at it stealthily he be shake he head and say no no to himself not perceive I and i step aside when i see he so absorb for myself i enter that room but little i go outside as i have so often do when i be a child and look through the window into the still and now sacred place which have always impressed I with a certain awe look at so the slight figure in its white dress seem to be step down into the room from some slight visionary altitude look with that which have seem to I at first anxiety which i sometimes represent to myself now as a wistful curiosity as if she be look for the life which might have be hers where be the existence that have belong to she the sweet household place the infant she have leave she would no more recognize the man who thus come to look at she as through a veil with a mystic reverence than i could recognize she i could never be she child to she any more than she could be a mother to I \* \* \* \* \* thus time pass on for several quiet day there be nothing to make we give any special heed to the passage of time life be very uneventful and its habit unvaried my mind be very much preoccupy by my father 's tenant he have a great deal of property in the town which be so near we -- street of small house the best-paying property -lrb- i be assure -rrb- of any i be very anxious to come to some settle conclusion : on the one hand not to let myself be carry away by sentiment on the other not to allow my strongly rouse feeling to fall into the blank of routine as he have do i be seat one evening in my own sitting-room busy with this matter -- busy with calculation as to cost and profit with a anxious desire to convince he either that he profit be greater than justice allow or that they carry with they a more urgent duty than he have conceive it be night but not late not more than ten o'clock the household still astir everything be quiet -- not the solemnity of midnight silence in which there be always something of mystery but the soft-breathing quiet of the evening full of the faint habitual sound of a human dwelling a consciousness of life about and i be very busy with my figure interested feeling no room in my mind for any other think the singular experience which have startle I so much have pass over very quickly and there have be no return i have cease to think of it indeed i have never think of it save for the moment set it down after it be over to a physical cause without much difficulty at this time i be far too busy to have thought to spare for anything or room for imagination and when suddenly in a moment without any warn the first symptom return i start with it into determine resistance resolute not to be fool by any mock influence which could resolve itself into the action of nerve or ganglion the first symptom as before be that my heart spring up with a bind as if a cannon have be fire at my ear my whole be respond with a start the pen fall out of my finger the figure go out of my head as if all faculty have depart and yet i be conscious for a time at least of keep my self-control i be like the rider of a frightened horse render almost wild by something which in the mystery of its voiceless be it have see something on the road which it will not pass but wildly plunge resist every persuasion turn from with ever-increasing passion the rider himself after a time become infected with this inexplainable desperation of terror and i suppose i must have do so but for a time i keep the upper hand i would not allow myself to spring up as i wish as my impulse be but sit there doggedly cling to my book to my table fix myself on i do not mind what to resist the flood of sensation of emotion which be sweep through I carry I away i try to continue my calculation i try to stir myself up with recollection of the miserable sight i have see the poverty the helplessness i try to work myself into indignation but all through these effort i feel the contagion grow upon I my mind fall into sympathy with all those strain faculty of the body startle excited drive wild by something i know not what it be not fear i be like a ship at sea strain and plunge against wind and tide but i be not afraid i be oblige to use these metaphor otherwise i could give no explanation of my condition seize upon against my will and tear from all those mooring of reason to which i clung with desperation as long as i have the strength when i get up from my chair at last the battle be lose so far as my power of self-control be concerned i get up or rather be drag up from my seat clutch at these material thing round I as with a last effort to hold my own but that be no longer possible i be overcome i stand for a moment look round I feebly feel myself begin to babble with stammer lip which be the alternative of shriek and which i seem to choose as a lesser evil what i say be what be i to do and after a while what do you want I to do although throughout i see no one hear no voice and have in reality not power enough in my dizzy and confused brain to know what i myself mean i stand thus for a moment look blankly round I for guidance repeat the question which seem after a time to become almost mechanical what do you want I to do though i neither know to whom i address it nor why i say it presently -- whether in answer whether in mere yielding of nature i can not tell -- i become aware of a difference : not a lessen of the agitation but a softening as if my power of resistance be exhaust a gentler force a more benignant influence have room i feel myself consent to whatever it be my heart melt in the midst of the tumult i seem to give myself up and move as if draw by some one whose arm be in mine as if softly sweep along not forcibly but with a utter consent of all my faculty to do i know not what for love of i know not whom for love -- that be how it seem -- not by force as when i go before but my step take the same course : i go through the dim passage in a exaltation indescribable and open the door of my father 's room he be seat there at he table as usual the light of the lamp fall on he white hair he look up with some surprise at the sound of the opening door phil he say and with a look of wonder apprehension on he face watch my approach i go straight up to he and put my hand on he shoulder phil what be the matter what do you want with I what be it he say father i can not tell you i come not of myself there must be something in it though i do not know what it be this be the second time i have be bring to you here be you go -- he stop himself the exclamation have be begin with a angry intention he stop look at I with a scared look as if perhaps it might be true do you mean mad i do not think so i have no delusion that i know of father think -- do you know any reason why i be bring here for some cause there must be i stand with my hand upon the back of he chair he table be cover with papers among which be several letter with the broad black border which i have before observe i notice this now in my excitement without any distinct association of thought for that i be not capable of but the black border catch my eye and i be conscious that he too give a hurry glance at they and with one hand sweep they away philip he say push back he chair you must be ill my poor boy evidently we have not be treat you rightly you have be more ill all through than i suppose let I persuade you to go to bed i be perfectly well i say father do not let we deceive one another i be neither a man to go mad nor to see ghost what it be that have get the command over I i can not tell but there be some cause for it you be do something or planning something with which i have a right to interfere he turn round squarely in he chair with a spark in he blue eye he be not a man to be meddle with i have yet to learn what can give my son a right to interfere i be in possession of all my faculty i hope father i cry will not you listen to I no one can say i have be undutiful or disrespectful i be a man with a right to speak my mind and i have do so but this be different i be not here by my own will something that be stronger than i have bring I there be something in you mind which disturb -- other i do not know what i be say this be not what i mean to say but you know the meaning better than i some one -- who can speak to you only by I -- speak to you by I and i know that you understand he gaze up at I grow pale and he underlip fall i for my part feel that my message be deliver my heart sink into a stillness so sudden that it make I faint the light swam in my eye everything go round with I i keep upright only by my hold upon the chair and in the sense of utter weakness that follow i drop on my knee i think first then on the nearest seat that present itself and cover my face with my hand have hard ado not to sob in the sudden removal of that strange influence -- the relaxation of the strain there be silence between we for some time then he say but with a voice slightly broken i do not understand you phil you must have take some fancy into you mind which my slower intelligence -- speak out what you want to say what do you find fault with be it all -- all that woman jordan he give a short forced laugh as he break off and shake I almost roughly by the shoulder say speak out what -- what do you want to say it seem sir that i have say everything my voice tremble more than he but not in the same way i have tell you that i do not come by my own will -- quite otherwise i resist as long as i could : now all be say it be for you to judge whether it be worth the trouble or not he get up from he seat in a hurry way you would have I as -- mad as yourself he say then sit down again as quickly come phil : if it will please you not to make a breach -- the first breach between we -- you shall have you way i consent to you look into that matter about the poor tenant you mind shall not be upset about that even though i do not enter into all you view thank you i say but father that be not what it be then it be a piece of folly he say angrily i suppose you mean -- but this be a matter in which i choose to judge for myself you know what i mean i say as quietly as i could though i do not myself know that prove there be good reason for it will you do one thing for I before i leave you come with I into the drawing-room -- what end he say with again the tremble in he voice be to be serve by that i do not very well know but to look at she you and i together will always do something for we sir as for breach there can be no breach when we stand there he get up tremble like a old man which he be but which he never look like save at moment of emotion like this and tell I to take the light then stop when he have get half-way across the room this be a piece of theatrical sentimentality he say no phil i will not go i will not bring she into any such -- put down the lamp and if you will take my advice go to bed at least i say i will trouble you no more father to-night so long as you understand there need be no more to say he give I a very curt good-night and turn back to he papers -- the letter with the black edge either by my imagination or in reality always keep uppermost i go to my own room for my lamp and then alone proceed to the silent shrine in which the portrait hang i at least would look at she to-night i do not know whether i ask myself in so many word if it be she who -- or if it be any one -- i know nothing but my heart be draw with a softness -- bear perhaps of the great weakness in which i be leave after that visitation -- to she to look at she to see perhaps if there be any sympathy any approval in she face i set down my lamp on the table where she little work-basket still be the light throw a gleam upward upon she -- she seem more than ever to be step into the room come down towards I come back to she life ah no she life be lose and vanish : all mine stand between she and the day she know she look at I with eye that do not change the anxiety i have see at first seem now a wistful subdue question but that difference be not in she look but in mine \* \* \* \* \* i need not linger on the intervene time the doctor who attend we usually come in next day by accident and we have a long conversation on the follow day a very impressive yet genial gentleman from town lunch with we -- a friend of my father 's dr something but the introduction be hurry and i do not catch he name he too have a long talk with I afterwards my father be call away to speak to some one on business dr -- draw I out on the subject of the dwelling of the poor he say he hear i take great interest in this question which have come so much to the front at the present moment he be interested in it too and want to know the view i take i explain at considerable length that my view do not concern the general subject on which i have scarcely think so much as the individual mode of management of my father 's estate he be a most patient and intelligent listener agree with I on some point differ in other and he visit be very pleasant i have no idea until after of its special object though a certain puzzle look and slight shake of the head when my father return might have throw some light upon it the report of the medical expert in my case must however have be quite satisfactory for i hear nothing more of they it be i think a fortnight later when the next and last of these strange experience come this time it be morning about noon -- a wet and rather dismal spring day the half-spread leave seem to tap at the window with a appeal to be take in the primrose that show golden upon the grass at the root of the tree just beyond the smooth-shorn grass of the lawn be all drooped and sodden among they shelter leave the very growth seem dreary -- the sense of spring in the air make the feeling of winter a grievance instead of the natural effect which it have convey a few month before i have be write letter and be cheerful enough go back among the associate of my old life with perhaps a little longing for its freedom and independence but at the same time a not ungrateful consciousness that for the moment my present tranquillity might be best this be my condition -- a not unpleasant one -- when suddenly the now well-known symptom of the visitation to which i have become subject suddenly seize upon I -- the leap of the heart the sudden causeless overwhelming physical excitement which i could neither ignore nor allay i be terrify beyond description beyond reason when i become conscious that this be about to begin over again : what purpose do it answer what good be in it my father indeed understand the meaning of it though i do not understand but it be little agreeable to be thus make a helpless instrument without any will of mine in a operation of which i know nothing and to enact the part of the oracle unwillingly with suffering and such a strain as it take I day to get over i resist not as before but yet desperately try with better knowledge to keep down the grow passion i hurry to my room and swallow a dose of a sedative which have be give I to procure sleep on my first return from indium i see morphew in the hall and call he to talk to he and cheat myself if possible by that mean morphew linger however and before he come i be beyond conversation i hear he speak he voice come vaguely through the turmoil which be already in my ear but what he say i have never know i stand stare try to recover my power of attention with a aspect which end by completely frightening the man he cry out at last that he be sure i be ill that he must bring I something which word penetrate more or less into my madden brain it become impressed upon I that he be go to get some one -- one of my father 's doctor perhaps -- to prevent I from act to stop my interference and that if i wait a moment longer i might be too late a vague idea seize I at the same time of take refuge with the portrait -- go to its foot throw myself there perhaps till the paroxysm should be over but it be not there that my footstep be direct i can remember make a effort to open the door of the drawing-room and feeling myself sweep past it as if by a gale of wind it be not there that i have to go i know very well where i have to go -- once more on my confused and voiceless mission to my father who understand although i could not understand yet as it be daylight and all be clear i could not help note one or two circumstance on my way i see some one sit in the hall as if wait -- a woman a girl a black-shrouded figure with a thick veil over she face and ask myself who she be and what she want there this question which have nothing to do with my present condition somehow get into my mind and be toss up and down upon the tumultuous tide like a stray log on the breast of a fiercely rolling stream now submerge now come uppermost at the mercy of the water it do not stop I for a moment as i hurry towards my father 's room but it get upon the current of my mind i flung open my father 's door and close it again after I without see who be there or how he be engage the full clearness of the daylight do not identify he as the lamp do at night he look up at the sound of the door with a glance of apprehension and rise suddenly interrupt some one who be stand speak to he with much earnestness and even vehemence come forward to meet I i can not be disturb at present he say quickly i be busy then see the look in my face which by this time he know he too change color phil he say in a low imperative voice wretched boy go away -- go away do not let a stranger see you -- i can not go away i say it be impossible you know why i have come i can not if i would it be more powerful than i -- go sir he say go at once no more of this folly i will not have you in this room : go-go i make no answer i do not know that i could have do so there have never be any struggle between we before but i have no power to do one thing or another the tumult within I be in full career i hear indeed what he say and be able to reply but he word too be like straw toss upon the tremendous stream i saw now with my feverish eye who the other person present be it be a woman dress also in mourning similar to the one in the hall but this a middle-aged woman like a respectable servant she have be cry and in the pause cause by this encounter between my father and myself dry she eye with a handkerchief which she roll like a ball in she hand evidently in strong emotion she turn and look at I as my father speak to I for a moment with a gleam of hope then fall back into she former attitude my father return to he seat he be much agitate too though do all that be possible to conceal it my inopportune arrival be evidently a great and unlooked-for vexation to he he give I the only look of passionate displeasure i have ever have from he as he sit down again but he say nothing more you must understand he say address the woman that i have say my last word on this subject i do not choose to enter into it again in the presence of my son who be not well enough to be make a party to any discussion i be sorry that you should have have so much trouble in vain but you be warn beforehand and you have only yourself to blame i acknowledge no claim and nothing you can say will change my resolution i must beg you to go away all this be very painful and quite useless i acknowledge no claim oh sir she cry she eye begin once more to flow she speech interrupt by little sob maybe i do wrong to speak of a claim i be not educate to argue with a gentleman maybe we have no claim but if it be not by right oh mr canning will not you let you heart be touch by pity she do not know what i be say poor dear she be not one to beg and pray for herself as i be do for she oh sir she be so young she be so lone in this world -- not a friend to stand by she nor a house to take she in you be the nearest to she of any one that be leave in this world she have not a relation -- not one so near as you -- oh she cry with a sudden thought turn quickly round upon I this gentleman 's you son now i think of it it be not you relation she be but he through he mother that be nearer nearer oh sir you be young you heart should be more tender here be my young lady that have no one in the world to look to she you own flesh and blood you mother 's cousin -- you mother 's -- my father call to she to stop with a voice of thunder philip leave we at once it be not a matter to be discuss with you and then in a moment it become clear to I what it be it have be with difficulty that i have keep myself still my breast be labor with the fever of a impulse pour into I more than i could contain and now for the first time i know why i hurry towards he and take he hand though he resist into mine mine be burn but he like ice : they touch burn I with its chill like fire this be what it be i cry i have no knowledge before i do not know now what be be ask of you but father understand you know and i know now that some one send I -- some one -- who have a right to interfere he push I away with all he might you be mad he cry what right have you to think -- oh you be mad -- mad i have see it come on -- the woman the petitioner have grow silent watch this brief conflict with the terror and interest with which woman watch a struggle between man she start and fall back when she hear what he say but do not take she eye off I follow every movement i make when i turn to go away a cry of indescribable disappointment and remonstrance burst from she and even my father raise himself up and stare at my withdrawal astonish to find that he have overcome I so soon and easily i pause for a moment and look back on they see they large and vague through the mist of fever i be not go away i say i be go for another messenger -- one you can not gainsay my father rise he call out to I threateningly i will have nothing touch that be hers nothing that be hers shall be profane -- i wait to hear no more i know what i have to do by what mean it be convey to I i can not tell but the certainty of a influence which no one thought of calm I in the midst of my fever i go out into the hall where i have see the young stranger wait i go up to she and touch she on the shoulder she rise at once with a little movement of alarm yet with docile and instant obedience as if she have expect the summons i make she take off she veil and she bonnet scarcely look at she scarcely see she know how it be : i take she soft small cool yet tremble hand into mine it be so soft and cool -- not cold -- it refresh I with its tremulous touch all through i move and speak like a man in a dream swiftly noiselessly all the complication of wake life remove without embarrassment without reflection without the loss of a moment my father be still stand up lean a little forward as he have do when i withdraw threatening yet terror-stricken not know what i might be about to do when i return with my companion that be the one thing he have not think of he be entirely undecided unprepared he give she one look fling up he arm above he head and utter a distract cry so wild that it seem the last outcry of nature -- agne then fall back like a sudden ruin upon himself into he chair i have no leisure to think how he be or whether he could hear what i say i have my message to deliver father i say labor with my panting breath it be for this that heaven have open and one whom i never see one whom i know not have take possession of I have we be less earthly we should have see she -- herself and not merely she image i have not even know what she mean i have be as a fool without understand this be the third time i have come to you with she message without know what to say but now i have find it out this be she message i have find it out at last there be a awful pause -- a pause in which no one move or breathe then there come a broken voice out of my father 's chair he have not understand though i think he hear what i say he put out two feeble hand phil -- i think i be die -- have she -- have she come for I he say we have to carry he to he bed what struggle he have go through before i can not tell he have stand fast and have refuse to be move and now he fall -- like a old tower like a old tree the necessity there be for thinking of he save I from the physical consequence which have prostrate I on a former occasion i have no leisure now for any consciousness of how matter go with myself he delusion be not wonderful but most natural she be clothe in black from head to foot instead of the white dress of the portrait she have no knowledge of the conflict of nothing but that she be call for that she fate might depend on the next few minute in she eye there be a pathetic question a line of anxiety in the lid a innocent appeal in the look and the face the same : the same lip sensitive ready to quiver the same innocent candid brow the look of a common race which be more subtle than mere resemblance how i know that it be so i can not tell nor any man it be the other the elder -- ah no not elder the ever young the agne to whom age can never come she who they say be the mother of a man who never see she -- it be she who lead she kinswoman she representative into we heart \* \* \* \* \* my father recover after a few day : he have take cold it be say the day before and naturally at seventy a small matter be enough to upset the balance even of a strong man he get quite well but he be willing enough afterwards to leave the management of that ticklish kind of property which involve human well-being in my hand who could move about more freely and see with my own eye how thing be go on he like home better and have more pleasure in he personal existence in the end of he life agne be now my wife as he have of course foresee it be not merely the disinclination to receive she father 's daughter or to take upon he a new responsibility that have move he to do he justice but both these motive have tell strongly i have never be tell and now will never be tell what he grief against my mother 's family and specially against that cousin have be but that he have be very determine deeply prejudiced there can be no doubt it turn out after that the first occasion on which i have be mysteriously commission to he with a message which i do not understand and which for that time he do not understand be the evening of the day on which he have receive the dead man 's letter appeal to he -- to he a man whom he have wrong -- on behalf of the child who be about to be leave friendless in the world the second time further letter -- from the nurse who be the only guardian of the orphan and the chaplain of the place where she father have die take it for grant that my father 's house be she natural refuge -- have be receive the third i have already describe and its result for a long time after my mind be never without a lurk fear that the influence which have once take possession of I might return again why should i have fear to be influence to be the messenger of a bless creature whose wish could be nothing but heavenly who can say flesh and blood be not make for such encounter : they be more than i could bear but nothing of the kind have ever occur again agne have she peaceful domestic throne establish under the picture my father wish it to be so and spend he evening there in the warmth and light instead of in the old library -- in the narrow circle clear by we lamp out of the darkness as long as he live it be suppose by stranger that the picture on the wall be that of my wife and i have always be glad that it should be so suppose she who be my mother who come back to I and become as my soul for three strange moment and no more but with whom i can feel no credible relationship as she stand there have retire for I into the tender region of the unseen she have pass once more into the secret company of those shadow who can only become real in a atmosphere fit to modify and harmonize
