produce by jayam subramanian ted garvin and pg distribute proofreader roman history by titus livius translate by john henry freese alfr john church and william jackson brodribb with a critical and biographical introduction and note by duffield osborne illustrate 1904 livy 's history of the lose treasure of classical literature it be doubtful whether any be more to be regret than the miss book of livy that they exist in approximate entirety down to the fifth century and possibly even so late as the fifteenth add to this regret at the same time it leave in a few sanguine mind a linger hope that some unvisited convent or forget library may yet give to the world a work that must always be regard as one of the greatest of roman masterpiece the story that the destruction of livy be effect by order of pope gregory i on the score of the superstition contain in the historian 's page never have be fairly substantiate and therefore i prefer to acquit that pontiff of the less pardonable superstition involve in such a act of fanatical vandalism that the book preserve to we would be by far the most objectionable from gregory 's alleged point of view may be note for what it be worth in favor of the theory of destruction by chance rather than by design here be the inventory of what we have and of what we might have have the entire work of livy -- a work that occupy more than forty year of he life -- be contain in one hundred and forty-two book which narrate the history of rome from the suppose landing of æneas through the early year of the empire of augustus and down to the death of drusus bc 9 book i-x contain the story of early rome to the year 294 bc the date of the final subjugation of the samnite and the consequent establishment of the roman commonwealth as the control power in italy remain to we these by the accept chronology represent a period of four hundred and sixty year book xi-xx be the second decade accord to a division attribute to the fifth century of we era be miss they cover seventy-five year and bring the narrative down to the beginning of the second punic war book xxi-xlv have be save though those of the fifth decade be imperfect they close with the triumph of æmilius in 167 bc and the reduction of macedonium to a roman province of the other book only a few fragment remain the most interesting of which -lrb- from book cxx -rrb- recount the death of cicero and give what appear to be a very just estimate of he character we have epitome of all the lose book with the exception of ten but these be so scanty as to amount to little more than table of contents they probable date be not later than the time of trajan to summarize the result then thirty-five book have be save and one hundred and seven lose -- a most deplorable record especially when we consider that in the later book the historian treat of time and event whereof he means of knowledge be adequate to he task titus livius be bear at patavium the modern padua some time between 61 and 57 bc of he parentage and early life nothing be know it be easy to surmise that he be well bear from he political bias in favor of the aristocratic party and from the evident fact of he have receive a liberal education yet the former of these argument be not at all inconsistent with the opposite supposition and the latter should lead to no very definite conclusion when we remember that in he day few industry be more profitable than the higher education of slave for the pampered roman market niebuhr infer from a sentence quote by quintilian that livy begin life as a teacher of rhetoric however that may be it seem certain that he come to rome about 30 bc be introduce to augustus and win he patronage and favor and after the death of he great patron and friend retire to the city of he birth where he die 17 ad it be probable that he have fix the date of the emperor 's death as the limit of he history and that he own decease cut short he task no historian ever tell a story more delightfully the available translation leave much to be desire but to the student of latin livy 's style be pure and simple and possess that charm which purity and simplicity always give if there be anything to justify the charge of patavinity or provincialism make by asinius pollio we at least be not learn enough in latin to detect it and pollio too appear to have be no gentle critic if we may judge by he equally severe stricture upon cicero cæsar and sallust this much we know : the patavian 's hero live he event happen and we be carry along upon they tide we sympathy we indignation we enthusiasm be summon into be and history and fiction appear to walk hand in hand for we instruction and amusement in this latter word -- fiction -- lie the charge most often and most strongly make against he -- the charge that he have write a story and no more that with he past time exist but to furnish material to point a moral or adorn a tale let we consider to what extent this be true and if true in what measure the author have sin by it or we have lose no one would claim that the rule by which scientific historian of to-day be judge should be apply to those that write when history be young when the boundary between the possible and the impossible be less clearly define or when in fact such boundary hardly exist in man 's mind in this connection even while we vaunt we smile after all how much of we modern and so-called scientific history must strike the reasoning reader as mere theorize or as special plead base upon the slenderest evidence among the ancient the work of the historian whom we consider trustworthy -- such writer for instance as cæsar thucydide xenophon polybius and tacitus -- may be say to fall generally within rawlinson 's canon 1 and 2 of historical criticism -- that be -lrb- 1 -rrb- case where the historian have personal knowledge concern the fact whereof he write or -lrb- 2 -rrb- where the fact be such that he may reasonably be suppose to have obtain they from contemporary witness canon 2 might be elaborate and refine very considerably and perhaps to advantage it naturally include as source of knowledge -- first personal interview with contemporary witness and second access to the writings of historian whose opportunity bring they within canon 1 in this latter case the evidence would be less convincing owe to the lack of opportunity to cross-question though even here apparent lack of bias or the existence of bias testimony on both side from which a judicious man might have a fair chance to extract the truth would go far to cure the defect the point however to which i tend be that the portion of livy 's history from which we must judge of he trustworthiness treat for the most part of period concern which even he evidence be of the scantiest and poorest description he doubtless have family record funeral panegyric and inscription -- all of which be possibly almost as reliable as those of we own day song sing at festival and hand down by tradition may or may not be hold more truthful these he have as well but the government record the ancient fastus have be destroy at the time of the burning of the city by the gaul and there be no hint of any roman historian that live prior to the date of the second punic war thus we may safely infer that livy write of the first five hundred year without the aid of any contemporary evidence either approximately complete or ostensibly reliable with the beginning of the second punic war begin also the writing of history quintus fabius pictor have leave a work which polybius condemn on the score of its evident partiality lucius cincius alimentus whose claim to knowledge if not to impartiality rest largely on the fact that he be capture and hold prisoner by hannibal also leave memoirs but hannibal be not famous for treat prisoner mildly and the roman most cruel themselves in this respect be always deeply scandalize by a much less degree of harshness on the part of they enemy above all there be polybius himself who perhaps approach nearer to the critical historian than any writer of antiquity and it be polybius upon whom livy mainly rely through he third fourth and fifth decade the work of fabius and cincius be lose so also be those of the lacedaemonian sosilus and the sicilian silanus who campaign with hannibal and write the carthaginian side of the story nor be there any evidence that either polybius or livy have access to they writings polybius then may be say to be the only reliable source from which livy could draw for any of he extant book and before condemn unqualifiedly in the case where he desert he and hark back to roman authority we must remember that livy be a strong nationalist one of a people who despite they conquest be essentially narrow prejudiced egotistical and thus remember we must marvel that he so fully recognize the merit of he unprejudiced guide and wander as little as he do all tell it be quite certain that he have deal more fairly by hannibal than have alison and other english historian by napoleon he unreliability consist rather in he conclusion than in he fact and it be unquestioned that through all the page of the third decade he have so tell the story of the man most hate by rome -- the deadliest enemy she have ever encounter -- that the reader can not fail to feel the greatness of hannibal dominate every chapter refer again to the criticism make so lavishly upon livy 's story of the earlier century it be well to recall the contention of the hard-headed scotchman ferguson that with all we critical acumen we have find no sure ground to rest upon until we reach the second punic war niebuhr on the other hand whose german temperament be alike prone to delve or to theorize be dispose to think -- with considerable generosity to we ability it appear to I -- that we may yet evolve a fairly true history of rome from the foundation of the commonwealth as to the time of the king it be admit that we know nothing while from the founding of the commonwealth to the second punic war the field may be describe as at the best but a battle-ground for rival theory the ancient historian have as a rule little to do with such consideration or controversy in the lack of solid evidence he have only to write down the accept story of the origin of thing as draw from the lip of poetry legend or tradition and it be for livy to write thus or not at all even here the honesty of he intention be apparent for much of he early history he do not claim more than be claim for it by many of he modern critic while time and again he pause to express a doubt as to the credibility of some incident a notable instance of this be find in he criticism of those story most dear to the roman heart -- the story of the birth and apotheosis of romulus on the other hand if he have give free life to many beautiful legend that be undoubtedly current and believe for century be it heresy to avow that these as such seem to I of more true value to the antiquary than if they have be subject at they historical inception to the critical and theoretical method of to-day i can not hold livy quite unpardonable even when follow as he often do such authority as the furian family version of the redemption of the city by the arm of they progenitor camillus instead of by the payment of the agree ransom as modern writer consider prove while he put of set speech into the mouth of he character may be describe as a conventional usage of ancient historian which certainly add to the liveliness of the narrative and probably be neither intend to be take literally nor result in deceive any one revert for a moment to livy 's honesty and frankness so far as he intent might govern such quality i think no stronger evidence in he favor can be find than he avowed republican leaning at the court of augustus and he just estimate of cicero 's character in the face of the favor of a prince by whose consent the great orator have be assassinate above all it must have be a fearless and honest man who could swing the scourge with which he lash he degenerate countryman in those stinging word the present time when we can endure neither we vice nor they remedy nevertheless and despite the fact that livy mean to be honest and that he question much on grounds that would not shame the repute of many of he modern critic the charge be doubtless true that he writings be not free from prejudice in favor of he country that he definitely regard history rather as a moral agency and a lesson for the future than as a irrefutable narrative of the past i consider highly hypothetical but it be probable that he mind be not of the type that be most diligent in the close exhaustive and logical study so necessary to the historian of today superficial if we could eliminate the reproach in the word would perhaps go far toward describe he he be what we would call a popular rather than a scientific writer and since we think somewhat lightly of such when they write on what we consider scientific subject we be too apt to transfer they light repute to a author who write popularly at a time when this treatment be best adapt to he audience he aim and the material at he command that he have survive through all these century and have enjoy despite all criticism the position in the literature of the world which he very critic have unite in concede to he be perhaps a stronger commendation than any technical approval from the standpoint of the present work it be feel that selection aggregate seven book would accomplish all the purpose of a complete presentation the editor have choose the first three book of the first decade as tell what no one can better tell than livy : the story and legend connect with the foundation and early life of rome here as i have say there be nothing for he to do but cut loose from all trammel and hang breathless pen in hand upon the lip of tradition none can hold but that she faithful scribe have writ down she word with all they ancient color with reverence reign over he heart however doubt might lurk within he brain these book close with the restoration of the consular power after the downfall of the tyrannical rule of the decemvir the revolution follow upon the attempt of appius claudius to seize virginium the daughter of a citizen who rather than see he child fall into the clutch of the cruel patrician kill she with he own hand in the marketplace and rush into the camp with the bloody knife cause the soldier to revolt the second section comprise book xxi-xxiv a part of the narrative of the second punic war a military exploit the most remarkable the world have ever see the question who be the greatest general that ever live have be a fruitful source of discussion and alexander cæsar and napoleon have each find numerous and ardent supporter without decry the signal ability of these chief it must nevertheless be remember that each command a homogeneous army and have behind he a compact nation the most warlike and powerful of he time the adversary also of the greek and the roman be in the one instance a effete power already fall to piece by its own internal weakness and in the other for the most part scatter tribe of barbarian without unity of purpose or military discipline even in he civil war cæsar 's army be veteran and those of the commonwealth be comparatively speak recruit but when the reader of these page carefully consider the story of hannibal 's campaign in italy what do he find two nation -- one caucasian young warlike above all its contemporary with a record behind it of steady aggrandizement and almost unbroken victory a nation every citizen of which be a soldier on the other side a race of merchant semitic in blood a city whose citizen have long since cease to go to war prefer that they gold should fight for they by the hand of mercenary of every race and clime -- hireling whose ungoverned valor have prove almost as deadly to they employer and general as to they enemy above all the same battle have be join before when rome be weaker and carthage stronger and carthage have already show she weakness and rome she strength and now in this renew war we see a young man aid only by a little group of compatriot welding together army of the most heterogeneous element -- spaniard gaul numidian moor greek -- man of almost every race except he own we see he cut loose from he base of supplies leave enemy behind he to force he way through hostile race through unknown land bristle with almost impassable mountain and frigid with snow and ice we see he conquer here make friend and ally there and more wonderful than all hold he mongrel horde together through hardship and loss by the force of he character alone we see he at last descend into the plain of italy we see he not merely defeat but annihilate army after army more numerous than he own and compose of better raw material we see he unaided range from end to end of the peninsula none daring to meet he with oppose standard and the greatest general of rome win laurel because he know enough to recognize he own hopeless inferiority all story of reverse other than those of mere detachment may pretty safely be set down as the exaggeration of roman writer situate as be hannibal the loss of one marshal field would have mean immediate ruin and ruin never come when he fight in italy on the contrary without supplies save what he sword could take without friend save what he genius and he fortune could win he maintain he place and he superiority not for one or for two but through fourteen year during all which time we hear no murmur of mutiny no hint of aught but obedience and devotion among the incongruous and unruly element from which he have fashion he invincible army and at the end we see he leave italy of he own free will at the call of he country to waste himself in a vain effort to save she from the blunder of other leader and from the penalty of inherent weakness which only he sword have so long ward off when i consider the mean the opposition and the achievement -- a combination of element by which alone we can judge such question with even approximate fairness -- i can not but feel that of all military exploit this invasion of italy which we shall read of here be the most remarkable that of all commander hannibal have show himself to be the greatest some of livy 's charge against he as a man be doubtless true avarice be in he blood and cruelty also though it ill become a roman to chide a enemy on that score besides livy himself tell how hannibal have seek for the body of the general he have slay that he might give they the rite of honorable sepulture tell it and in the next breath relate how the roman commander mutilate the corpse of the fall hasdrubal and throw the head into he brother 's camp so too he naïve explanation that hannibal 's more than punic perfidy consist mainly of ambush and similar military strategy go to show as i have say that whatever be unjust in we author 's estimate be rather the result of the prejudiced deduction of national egotism than of fact wilfully or carelessly distort by partisan spite to the reader who bear well in mind the point i have venture to make i predict profit hardly less than pleasure in these page for livy be perhaps the only historian who may be say to have be honest enough to furnish much of the material for criticism of himself and to be to a very considerable extent self-adjusting duffield osborne the author 's preface -lrb- 1 -rrb- whether in trace the history of the roman people from the foundation of the city i shall employ myself to a useful purpose i be neither very certain nor if i be dare i say inasmuch as i observe that it be both a old and hackneyed practice later author always suppose that they will either adduce something more authentic in the fact or that they will excel the less polished ancient in they style of write be that as it may it will at all event be a satisfaction to I that i too have contribute my share to perpetuate the achievement of a people the lord of the world and if amid so great a number of historian my reputation should remain in obscurity i may console myself with the celebrity and lustre of those who shall stand in the way of my fame moreover the subject be of immense labor as be one which must be trace back for more than seven hundred year and which have set out from small beginning have increase to such a degree that it be now distressed by its own magnitude and to most reader i doubt not but that the first origin and the event immediately succeed will afford but little pleasure while they will be hasten to these later time in which the strength of this overgrown people have for a long period be work its own destruction i on the contrary shall seek this as a reward of my labor viz to withdraw myself from the view of the calamity which we age have witness for so many year so long as i be review with my whole attention these ancient time be free from every care that may distract a writer 's mind though it can not warp it from the truth the tradition that have come down to we of what happen before the building of the city or before its building be contemplate as be suitable rather to the fiction of poetry than to the genuine record of history i have no intention either to affirm or to refute this indulgence be concede to antiquity that by blend thing human with divine it may make the origin of city appear more venerable : and if any people might be allow to consecrate they origin and to ascribe it to the god as its author such be the renown of the roman people in war that when they represent mar in particular as they own parent and that of they founder the nation of the world may submit to this as patiently as they submit to they sovereignty but in whatever way these and similar matter shall be attend to or judge of i shall not deem it of great importance i would have every man apply he mind seriously to consider these point viz what they life and what they manners be through what man and by what measure both in peace and in war they empire be acquire and extend then as discipline gradually decline let he follow in he thought they moral at first as slightly give way anon how they sink more and more then begin to fall headlong until he reach the present time when we can endure neither we vice nor they remedy this it be which be particularly salutary and profitable in the study of history that you behold instance of every variety of conduct display on a conspicuous monument that thence you may select for yourself and for you country that which you may imitate thence note what be shameful in the undertaking and shameful in the result which you may avoid but either a fond partiality for the task i have undertake deceive I or there never be any state either greater or more moral or richer in good example nor one into which luxury and avarice make they entrance so late and where poverty and frugality be so much and so long honor so that the less wealth there be the less desire be there of late riches have introduce avarice and excessive pleasure a longing for they amid luxury and a passion for ruin ourselves and destroy everything else but let complaint which will not be agreeable even then when perhaps they will be also necessary be keep aloof at least from the first stage of begin so great a work we should rather if it be usual with we -lrb- historian -rrb- as it be with poet begin with good omen vow and prayer to the god and goddess to vouchsafe good success to we effort in so arduous a undertaking -lrb- footnote 1 : the tone of dignified despondency which pervade this remarkable preface tell we much that the republican historian be no timid or time-serving flatterer of prince or public be more than clear while he unerring

-lrb- 1 -rrb- the period of the king to begin with it be generally admit that after the taking of troy while all the other trojan be treat with severity in the case of two æneas and antenor the greek forbear to exercise the full rights of war both on account of a ancient tie of hospitality and because they have persistently recommend peace and the restoration of helen : and then antenor after various vicissitude reach the inmost bay of the adriatic sea accompany by a body of the enetus who have be drive from paphlagonium by civil disturbance and be in search both of a place of settlement and a leader they chief pylæmenes have perish at troy and that the enetus and trojan have drive out the euganeus who dwell between the sea and the alp occupy these district in fact the place where they first land be call troy and from this it be name the trojan canton the nation as a whole be call venetus it be also agree that æneas a exile from home owe to a like misfortune but conduct by the fate to the founding of a greater empire come first to macedonia that he be then drive ashore at sicily in he quest for a settlement and sailing thence direct he course to the territory of laurentum this spot also bear the name of troy when the trojan have disembark there be drive off booty from the country as be only natural see that they have nothing left but they arm and ship after they almost boundless wander latinus the king and the aborigine who then occupy these district assemble in arm from the city and country to repel the violence of the new-comer in regard to what follow there be a twofold tradition some say that latinus have be defeat in battle first make peace and then conclude a alliance with æneas other that when the army have take up they position in order of battle before the trumpet sound latinus advance to the front and invite the leader of the stranger to a conference he then inquire what manner of man they be whence they have come for what reason they have leave they home and in quest of what they have land on laurentine territory after he hear that the host be trojan they chief æneas the son of anchise and venus and that exile from home they country have be destroy by fire they be seek a settlement and a site for build a city strike with admiration both at the noble character of the nation and the hero and at they spirit ready alike for peace or war he ratify the pledge of future friendship by clasp hand thereupon a treaty be conclude between the chief and mutual greeting pass between the army : æneas be hospitably entertain at the house of latinus there latinus in the presence of he household god cement the public league by a family one by give æneas he daughter in marriage this event fully confirm the trojan in the hope of at length terminate they wanderings by a lasting and permanent settlement they build a town which æneas call lavinium after the name of he wife shortly afterward also a son be the issue of the recently conclude marriage to whom he parent give the name of ascanius aborigine and trojan be soon afterward the joint object of a hostile attack turnus king of the rutulian to whom lavinia have be affiance before the arrival of æneas indignant that a stranger have be prefer to himself have make war on æneas and latinus together neither army come out of the struggle with satisfaction the rutulian be vanquish : the victorious aborigine and trojan lose they leader latinus thereupon turnus and the rutulian mistrustful of they strength have recourse to the prosperous and powerful etruscan and they king mezentius whose seat of government be at cære at that time a flourishing town even from the outset he have view with dissatisfaction the founding of a new city and as at that time he consider that the trojan power be increase far more than be altogether consistent with the safety of the neighbouring people he readily join he force in alliance with the rutulian æneas to gain the good-will of the aborigine in face of a war so serious and alarming and in order that they might all be not only under the same law but might also bear the same name call both nation latin in fact subsequently the aborigine be not behind the trojan in zeal and loyalty toward they king æneas accordingly in full reliance on this state of mind of the two nation who be daily become more and more united and in spite of the fact that etrurium be so powerful that at this time it have fill with the fame of its renown not only the land but the sea also throughout the whole length of italy from the alp to the sicilian strait æneas lead out he force into the field although he might have repel they attack by means of he fortification thereupon a battle be fight in which victory rest with the latin but for æneas it be even the last of he act on earth he by whatever name law human and divine demand he should be call be bury on the bank of the river numicus : they call he jupiter indige ascanius the son of æneas be not yet old enough to rule the government however remain unassailed for he till he reach the age of maturity in the interim under the regency of a woman -- so great be lavinia 's capacity -- the latin state and the boy 's kingdom inherit from he father and grandfather be secure for he i will not discuss the question -- for who can state as certain a matter of such antiquity -- whether it be this ascanius or one older than he bear of creusa before the fall of troy and subsequently the companion of he father 's flight the same whom under the name of iulus the julian family represent to be the founder of its name be that as it may this ascanius wherever bear and of whatever mother -- it be at any rate agree that he father be æneas -- see that lavinium be over-populated leave that city now a flourish and wealthy one consider those time to he mother or stepmother and build himself a new one at the foot of the alban mount which from its situation be build all along the ridge of a hill be call alba longa there be a interval of about thirty year between the founding of lavinium and the transplant of the colony to alba longa yet its power have increase to such a degree especially owe to the defeat of the etruscan that not even on the death of æneas nor subsequently between the period of the regency of lavinium and the first beginning of the young prince 's reign do either mezentius the etruscan or any other neighbouring people venture to take up arm against it peace have be conclude on the follow term that the river albulum which be now call tiber should be the boundary of latin and etruscan territory after he silvius son of ascanius bear by some accident in the wood become king he be the father of æneas silvius who afterward beget latinus silvius by he several colony be transplant which be call prisci latinus from this time all the prince who rule at alba bear the surname of silvius from latinus spring alba from alba atys from atys capys from capys capetus from capetus tiberinus who have be drown while cross the river albulum give it the name by which it be generally know among those of later time he be succeed by agrippa son of tiberinus after agrippa romulus silvius have receive the government from he father become king he be kill by a thunderbolt and hand on the kingdom to aventinus who owe to he be bury on that hill which now form part of the city of rome give it its name after he reign proca who beget numitor and amulius to numitor who be the eldest son he bequeath the ancient kingdom of the silvian family force however prevail more than a father 's wish or the respect due to seniority amulius drive out he brother and seize the kingdom : he add crime to crime murder he brother 's male issue and under pretence of do honor to he brother 's daughter rea silvium have choose she a vestal virgin -lrb- 2 -rrb- deprive she of all hope of issue by the obligation of perpetual virginity my opinion however be that the origin of so great a city and a empire next in power to that of the god be due to the fate the vestal rea be ravish by force and have bring forth twin declare mar to be the father of she illegitimate offspring either because she really imagine it to be the case or because it be less discreditable to have commit such a offence with a god -lrb- 3 -rrb- but neither god nor man protect either she or she offspring from the king 's cruelty the priestess be bind and cast into prison the king order the child to be throw into the flow river by some chance which providence seem to direct the tiber have over fly its bank thereby form stagnant pool could not be approach at the regular course of its channel notwithstanding it give the bearer of the child hope that they could be drown in its water however calm accordingly as if they have execute the king 's order they expose the boy in the nearest land-pool where now stand the ficus ruminali which they say be call romulari -lrb- 4 -rrb- at that time the country in those part be a desolate wilderness the story go that when the shallow water subside have leave the float trough in which the child have be expose on dry ground a thirsty she-wolf from the mountain around direct she course toward the cry of the infant and hold down she teat to they with such gentleness that the keeper of the king 's herd find she lick the boy with she tongue they say that he name be faustulus and that they be carry by he to he homestead and give to he wife larentium to be bring up some be of the opinion that larentium be call lupa among the shepherd from she be a common prostitute and hence a opening be afford for the marvellous story the child thus bear and thus bring up as soon as they reach the age of youth do not lead a life of inactivity at home or amid the flock but in the chase scour the forest have thus gain strength both in body and spirit they now be not only able to withstand wild beast but attack robber laden with booty and divide the spoil with the shepherd in whose company as the number of they young associate increase daily they carry on business and pleasure even in these early time it be say that the festival of the lupercal as now celebrate be solemnize on the palatine hill which be first call pallantium from pallanteum a city of arcadium and afterward mount palatius there evander who belong to the above tribe of the arcadian have for many year before occupy these district be say to have appoint the observance of a solemn festival introduce from arcadium in which naked youth run about do honor in wanton sport to pan lycæus who be afterward call inuus by the roman when they be engage in this festival as its periodical solemnization be well know a band of robber enrage at the loss of some booty lay in wait for they and take remus prisoner romulus have vigorously defend himself : the captive remus they deliver up to king amulius and even go so far as to bring accusation against he they make it the principal charge that have make incursion into numitor 's land and have assemble a band of young man they have drive off they booty after the manner of enemy accordingly remus be deliver up to numitor for punishment now from the very first faustulus have entertain hope that the boy who be be bring up by he be of royal blood : for he both know that the child have be expose by the king 's order and that the time at which he have take they up coincide exactly with that period : but he have be unwilling to disclose the matter as yet not ripe for discovery till either a fitting opportunity or the necessity for it should arise necessity come first accordingly urge by fear he disclose the whole affair to romulus by accident also numitor while he have remus in custody have hear that the brother be twin by compare they age and they natural disposition entirely free from servility feel he mind strike by the recollection of he grandchild and by frequent inquiry come to the conclusion he have already form so that he be not far from openly acknowledge remus accordingly a plot be concerted against the king on all side romulus not accompany by a body of young man -- for he be not equal to open violence -- but have command the shepherd to come to the palace by different road at a fixed time make a attack upon the king while remus have get together another party from numitor 's house come to he assistance and so they slew the king numitor at the beginning of the fray give out that enemy have invade the city and attack the palace after he have draw off the alban youth to the citadel to secure it with a armed garrison when he see the young man after they have compass the king 's death advance toward he to offer congratulation immediately summon a meeting of the people and recount he brother 's unnatural behavior toward he the extraction of he grandchild the manner of they birth bring up and recognition and go on to inform they of the king 's death and that he be responsible for it the young prince advance through the midst of the assembly with they band in orderly array and after they have salute they grandfather as king a succeed shout of approbation issue from the whole multitude ratify for he the name and authority of sovereign the government of alba be thus intrust to numitor romulus and remus be seize with the desire of build a city on the spot where they have be expose and bring up indeed the number of alban and latin inhabitant be too great for the city the shepherd also be include among that population and all these readily inspire hope that alba and lavinium would be insignificant in comparison with that city which be intend to be build but desire of rule the bane of they grandfather interrupt these design and thence arise a shameful quarrel from a sufficiently amicable beginning for as they be twin and consequently the respect for seniority could not settle the point they agree to leave it to the god under whose protection the place be to choose by augury which of they should give a name to the new city and govern it when build romulus choose the palatine and remus the aventine as point of observation for take the augury it be say that a omen come to remus first six vulture and when after the omen have be declare twice that number present themselves to romulus each be hail king by he own party the former claim sovereign power on the ground of priority of time the latter on account of the number of bird thereupon have meet and exchange angry word from the strife of angry feeling they turn to bloodshed : there remus fell from a blow receive in the crowd a more common account be that remus in derision of he brother leap over the newly-erected wall and be thereupon slay by romulus in a fit of passion who mock he add word to this effect : so perish every one hereafter who shall leap over my wall thus romulus obtain possession of supreme power for himself alone the city when build be call after the name of its founder -lrb- 5 -rrb- he first proceed to fortify the palatine hill on which he himself have be bring up he offer sacrifice to hercule accord to the grecian rite as they have be institute by evander to the other god accord to the alban rite there be a tradition that hercule have slay geryon drive off he ox which be of surpass beauty -lrb- 6 -rrb- to that spot : and that he lay down in a grassy spot on the bank of the river tiber where he have swam across drive the cattle before he to refresh they with rest and luxuriant pasture be also himself fatigue with journey there when sleep have overpower he heavy as he be with food and wine a shepherd who dwell in the neighborhood by name cacus pride himself on he strength and charm with the beauty of the cattle desire to carry they off as booty but because if he have drive the herd in front of he to the cave they track must have conduct they owner thither in he search he drag the most beautiful of they by they tail backward into a cave hercule arouse from sleep at dawn have look over he herd and observe that some of they number be miss go straight to the nearest cave to see whether perchance they track lead thither when he see that they be all turn away from it and lead in no other direction trouble and not know what to make up he mind to do he commence to drive off he herd from so dangerous a spot thereupon some of the cow that be drive away low as they usually do when they miss those that be leave and the lowing of those that be shut in be hear in answer from the cave cause hercule to turn round and when cacus attempt to prevent he by force as he be advance toward the cave he be strike with a club and slay while vainly call upon the shepherd to assist he at that time evander who be a exile from the peloponnesus govern the country more by he personal ascendancy than by absolute sway he be a man hold in reverence on account of the wonderful art of write a entirely new discovery to man ignorant of accomplishment -lrb- 7 -rrb- and still more revere on account of the suppose divinity of he mother carmenta whom those people have marvel at as a prophetess before the arrival of the sybil in italy this evander rouse by the assemble of the shepherd as they hastily crowd round the stranger who be charge with open murder after he hear a account of the deed and the cause of it gaze upon the personal appearance and mien of the hero considerably more dignified and majestic than that of a man ask who he be as soon as he hear the name of the hero and that of he father and native country hail say he hercule son of jupiter my mother truthful interpreter of the will of the god have declare to I that thou art destine to increase the number of the heavenly being and that on this spot a altar shall be dedicate to thee which in after age a people most mighty on earth shall call greatest and honor in accordance with rite institute by thee hercule have give he he right hand declare that he accept the prophetic intimation and would fulfil the prediction of the fate by building and dedicate a altar thereon then for the first time sacrifice be offer to hercule with a choice heifer take from the herd the potitius and pinarius the most distinguished family who then inhabit those part be invite to serve at the feast it so happen that the potitius present themselves in due time and the entrails be set before they : but the pinarius do not arrive until the entrails have be eat up to share the remainder of the feast from that time it become a settle institution that as long as the pinarian family exist they should not eat of the entrails of the sacrificial victim the potitius fully instruct by evander discharge the duty of chief priest of this sacred function for many generation until they whole race become extinct in consequence of this office the solemn prerogative of they family be delegate to public slave these be the only religious rite that romulus at that time adopt from those of foreign country be even then a advocate of immortality win by merit to which the destiny mark out for he be conduct he the duty of religion have be thus duly complete the people be summon to a public meeting : and as they could not be unite and incorporate into one body by any other means save legal ordinance romulus give they a code of law : and judge that these would only be respect by a nation of rustic if he dignified himself with the insignia of royalty he clothe himself with greater majesty -- above all by take twelve lictor to attend he but also in regard to he other appointment some be of opinion that he be influence in he choice of that number by that of the bird which have foretell that sovereign power should be he when the augury be take i myself be not indispose to follow the opinion of those who be incline to believe that it be from the neighbouring etruscan -- from whom the curule chair and purple-bordered toga be borrow -- that the apparitor of this class as well as the number itself be introduce : and that the etruscan employ such a number because as they king be elect from twelve state in common each state assign he one lictor in the meantime the city be enlarged by take in various plot of ground for the erection of building while they build rather in the hope of a increase population in the future than in view of the actual number of the inhabitant of the city at that time next that the size of the city might not be without efficiency in order to increase the population follow the ancient policy of founder of city who by bring together to they side a mean and ignoble multitude be in the habit of falsely assert that a offspring be bear to they from the earth he open as a sanctuary the place which now inclose be know as the two grove and which people come upon when descend from the capitol thither a crowd of all class from the neighbouring people without distinction whether freeman or slave eager for change flock for refuge and therein lay the foundation of the city 's strength correspond to the commencement of its enlargement have now no reason to be dissatisfy with he strength he next institute a standing council to direct that strength he create one hundred senator either because that number be sufficient or because there be only one hundred who could be so elect anyhow they be call father -lrb- 8 -rrb- by way of respect and they descendant patrician by this time the roman state be so powerful that it be a match for any of the neighbouring state in war : but owe to the scarcity of woman its greatness be not likely to outlast the exist generation see that the roman have no hope of issue at home and they do not intermarry with they neighbor so then by the advice of the senator romulus send around ambassador to the neighbouring state to solicit a alliance and the right of intermarriage for he new subject say that city like everything else rise from the humblest beginning : next that those which the god and they own merit assist gain for themselves great power and high renown : that he know full well that the god have aid the first beginning of rome and that merit on they part would not be want : therefore as man let they not be reluctant to mix they blood and stock with man the embassy nowhere obtain a favourable hearing : but although the neighbouring people treat it with such contempt yet at the same time they dread the growth of such a mighty power in they midst to the danger of themselves and of they posterity in most case when they be dismiss they be ask the question whether they have open a sanctuary for woman also : for that in that way only could they obtain suitable match the roman youth be bitterly indignant at this and the matter begin unmistakably to point to open violence romulus in order to provide a fitting opportunity and place for this dissemble he resentment with this purpose in view institute game to be solemnize every year in honor of neptunus equester which he call consualium he then order the show to be proclaim among the neighbouring people and the roman prepare to solemnize it with all the pomp with which they be then acquaint or be able to exhibit in order to make the spectacle famous and a object of expectation great number assemble be also desirous of see the new city especially all the nearest people the caeninens crustuminus and antemnate : the entire sabine population attend with they wife and child they be hospitably invite to the different house : and when they see the position of the city its fortified wall and how crowd with house it be they be astonish that the power of rome have increase so rapidly when the time of the show arrive and they eye and mind alike be intent upon it then accord to preconcerted arrangement a disturbance be make and at a give signal the roman youth rush in different direction to carry off the unmarried woman a great number be carry off at hap-hazard by those into whose hand they severally fall : some of the common people to whom the task have be assign convey to they home certain woman of surpass beauty who be destine for the lead senator they say that one far distinguish beyond the rest in form and beauty be carry off by the party of a certain talassius and that when several people want to know to whom they be carry she a cry be raise from time to time to prevent she be molest that she be be carry to talassius : and that from this the word be use in connection with marriage the festival be disturb by the alarm thus cause the sorrowing parent of the maiden retire complain of the violate compact of hospitality and invoke the god to whose solemn festival and game they have come have be deceive by the pretence of religion and good faith nor do the maiden entertain better hope for themselves or feel less indignation romulus however go about in person and point out that what have happen be due to the pride of they father in that they have refuse the privilege of intermarriage to they neighbor but that notwithstanding they would be lawfully wed and enjoy a share of all they possession and civil rights and -- a thing dearer than all else to the human race -- the society of they common child : only let they calm they angry feeling and bestow they affection on those on whom fortune have bestow they body esteem -lrb- say he -rrb- often arise subsequent to wrong : and they would find they better husband for the reason that each of they would endeavor to the utmost of he power after have discharge as far as he part be concern the duty of a husband to quiet the longing for country and parent to this the blandishments of the husband be add who excuse what have be do on the plea of passion and love a form of entreaty that work most successfully upon the feeling of woman -lrb- 9 -rrb- by this time the mind of the maiden be considerably soothe but they parent especially by put on the garb of mourning and by they tear and complaint stir up the neighbouring state nor do they confine they feeling of indignation to they own home only but they flock from all quarter to titus tatius king of the sabine and embassy crowd thither because the name of tatius be hold in the greatest esteem in those quarter the caeninens crustuminus and antemnate be the people who be chiefly affect by the outrage as tatius and the sabine appear to they to be act in too dilatory a manner these three people by mutual agreement among themselves make preparation for war unaided however not even the crustuminus and antemnate bestir themselves with sufficient activity to satisfy the hot-headedness and anger of the caeninens : accordingly the people of caenina unaided themselves attack the roman territory but romulus with he army meet they while they be ravage the country in straggle party and in a trifling engagement convince they that anger unaccompanied by strength be fruitless he route they army and put it to flight follow in pursuit of it when route cut down they king in battle and strip he of he armor and have slay the enemy 's leader take the city at the first assault then have lead back he victorious army be a man both distinguish for he achievement and one equally skilful at put they in the most favourable light he ascend the capitol carry suspend on a portable frame cleverly contrived for that purpose the spoil of the enemy 's general whom he have slay : there have lay they down at the foot of a oak hold sacred by the shepherd at the same time that he present the offering he mark out the boundary for a temple of jupiter and bestow a surname on the god jupiter feretrius say he i king romulus victorious over my foe offer to thee these royal arm and dedicate to thee a temple within those quarter which i have just now mark out in my mind to be a resting-place for the spolia opima which posterity follow my example shall bring hither on slaying the king or general of the enemy this be the origin of that temple the first that be ever consecrate at rome it be afterward the will of the god that neither the utterance of the founder of the temple in which he solemnly declare that he posterity would bring such spoil thither should be speak in vain and that the honor of the offering should not be render common owe to the number of those who enjoy it in the course of so many year and so many war the spolium opima be only twice gain : so rare have be the successful attainment of this honor -lrb- 10 -rrb- while the roman be thus engage in those part the army of the antemnate make a hostile attack upon the roman territory seize the opportunity when they be leave unguarded against these in like manner a roman legion be lead out in haste and surprise they while straggle in the country thus the enemy be route at the first shout and charge : they town be take : romulus amid he rejoicing at this double victory be entreat by he wife hersilium in consequence of the importunity of the capture woman to pardon they father and admit they to the privilege of citizenship that the commonwealth could thus be knit together by reconciliation the request be readily grant after that he set out against the crustuminus who be begin hostility : in they case as they courage have be damp by the disaster of other the struggle be less keen colony be send to both place : more however be find to give in they name for crustuminum because of the fertility of the soil great number also migrate from thence to rome chiefly of the parent and relative of the woman who have be carry off the last war break out on the part of the sabine and this be by far the most formidable : for nothing be do under the influence of anger or covetousness nor do they give indication of hostility before they have actually begin they cunning also be combine with prudence spurius tarpeius be in command of the roman citadel : he maiden daughter who at the time have go by chance outside the wall to fetch water for sacrifice be bribe by tatius to admit some armed soldier into the citadel after they be admit they crush she to death by heap they arm upon she : either that the citadel might rather appear to have be take by storm or for the sake of set forth a warning that faith should never on any occasion be keep with a betrayer the follow addition be make to the story : that as the sabine usually wear golden bracelet of great weight on they left arm and ring of great beauty set with precious stone she bargain with they for what they have on they left hand and that therefore shield be heap upon she instead of present of gold some say that in accordance with the agreement that they should deliver up what be on they left hand she expressly demand they shield and that as she seem to be act treacherously she herself be slay by the reward she have choose for herself be that as it may the sabine hold the citadel and on the next day when the roman army draw up in order of battle have occupy all the valley between the palatine and capitoline hill they do not descend from thence into the plain until the roman stimulate by resentment and the desire of recover the citadel advance up hill to meet they the chief on both side encourage the fight on the side of the sabine mettius curtius on the side of the roman hostius hostilius the latter in the front of the battle on unfavourable ground support the fortune of the roman by he courage and boldness when hostius fall the roman line immediately give way and be route be drive as far as the old gate of the palatium romulus himself also carry away by the crowd of fugitive cry uplift he arm to heaven : o jupiter it be at the bidding of thy omen that here on the palatine i lay the first foundation for the city the citadel purchase by crime be now in possession of the sabine : thence they be advance hither in arm have pass the valley between but do thou o father of god and man keep back the enemy from hence at least dispel the terror of the roman and check they disgraceful flight on this spot i vow to build a temple to thee as jupiter stator to be a monument to posterity that the city have be preserve by thy ready aid have offer up these prayer as if he have feel that they have be hear he cry : from this position o roman jupiter greatest and best bid you halt and renew the fight the roman halt as if order by a voice from heaven romulus himself hasten to the front mettius curtius on the side of the sabine have rush down from the citadel at the head of he troops and drive the roman in disorder array over the whole space of ground where the forum now be he have almost reach the gate of the palatium cry out : we have conquer we perfidious friend we cowardly foe : now they know that fight with man be a very different thing from ravishing maiden upon he as he utter these boast romulus make a attack with a band of he bravest youth mettius then happen to be fight on horseback : on that account he repulse be easier when he be drive back the roman follow in pursuit : and the remainder of the roman army fire by the bravery of the king route the sabine mettius he horse take fright at the noise of he pursuer ride headlong into a morass : this circumstance draw off the attention of the sabine also at the danger of so high a personage he indeed he own party beckoning and call to he gain heart from the encouraging shout of many of he friend make good he escape the roman and sabine renew the battle in the valley between the two hill : but the advantage rest with the roman at this crisis the sabine woman from the outrage on whom the war have arise with dishevelled hair and tear garment the timidity natural to woman be overcome by the sense of they calamity be embolden to fling themselves into the midst of the fly weapon and rush across to part the incensed combatant and assuage they wrath : implore they father on the one hand and they husband on the other as father-in-law and son-in-law not to besprinkle themselves with impious blood nor to fix the stain of murder on they offspring the one side on they grandchild the other on they child if say they you be dissatisfy with the relationship between you and with we marriage turn you resentment against we it be we who be the cause of war of wound and bloodsh to we husband and parent : it will be better for we to perish than to live widow or orphan without one or other of you this incident affect both the people and the leader silence and sudden quiet follow the leader thereupon come forward to conclude a treaty and not only conclude a peace but form one state out of two they unite the kingly power but transfer the entire sovereignty to rome rome have thus be make a double state that some benefit at least might be confer on the sabine they be call quirite from cure to serve as a memorial of that battle they call the place -- where curtius after have emerge from the deep morass set he horse in shallow water -- the lacus curtius -lrb- 11 -rrb- this welcome peace follow suddenly on so melancholy a war endear the sabine woman still more to they husband and parent and above all to romulus himself accordingly when divide the people into thirty curia he call the curia after they name while the number of the woman be undoubtedly considerably greater than this it be not record whether they be choose for they age they own rank or that of they husband or by lot to give name to the curia at the same time also three century of knight be enrol : the ramnens be so call from romulus the titiens from titus tatius : in regard to the lucere the meaning of the name and its origin be uncertain -lrb- 12 -rrb- from that time forward the two king enjoy the regal power not only in common but also in perfect harmony several year afterward some relative of king tatius ill-treated the ambassador of the laurentine and on the laurentine begin proceedings accord to the rights of nation the influence and entreaty of he friend have more weight with tatius in this manner he draw upon himself the punishment that should have fall upon they : for have go to lavinium on the occasion of a regularly recur sacrifice he be slay in a disturbance which take place there they say that romulus resent this less than the event demand either because partnership in sovereign power be never cordially keep up or because he think that he have be deservedly slay accordingly while he abstain from go to war the treaty between the city of rome and lavinium be renew that at any rate the wrong of the ambassador and the murder of the king might be expiate with these people indeed there be peace contrary to expectation : but another war break out much nearer home and almost at the city 's gate the fidenate -lrb- 13 -rrb- be of opinion that a power in too close proximity to themselves be gain strength hasten to make war before the power of the roman should attain the greatness it be evidently destine to reach a armed band of youth be send into roman territory and all the territory between the city and the fidena be ravage then turn to the left because on the right the tiber be a barrier against they they continue to ravage the country to the great consternation of the peasantry : the sudden alarm reach the city from the country be the first announcement of the invasion romulus arouse by this -- for a war so near home could not brook delay -- lead out he army and pitch he camp a mile from fidenae have leave a small garrison there he march out with all he force and give order that a part of they should lie in ambush in a spot hide amid bush plant thickly around he himself advance with the greater part of the infantry and all the cavalry by ride up almost to the very gate draw out the enemy -- which be just what he want -- by a mode of battle of a disorderly and threatening nature the same tactic on the part of the cavalry cause the flight which it be necessary to pretend to appear less surprising : and when as the cavalry appear undecided whether to make up its mind to fight or flee the infantry also retreat -- the enemy pour forth suddenly through the crowded gate be draw toward the place of ambuscade in they eagerness to press on and pursue after they have break the roman line thereupon the roman suddenly arise attack the enemy 's line in flank the advance from the camp of the standard of those who have be leave behind on guard increase the panic : thus the fidenate smite with terror from many quarter take to flight almost before romulus and the cavalry who accompany he could wheel round : and those who a little before have be in pursuit of man who pretend flight make for the town again in much greater disorder see that they flight be real they do not however escape the foe : the roman press closely on they rear rush in as if it be in one body before the door of the gate could be shut against they the mind of the inhabitant of veius -lrb- 14 -rrb- be exasperate by the infectious influence of the fidenatian war both from the tie of kinship -- for the fidenate also be etruscan -- and because the very proximity of the scene of action in the event of the roman arm be direct against all they neighbor urge they on they sally forth into the roman territory rather with the object of plunder than after the manner of a regular war accordingly without pitch a camp or wait for the enemy 's army they return to veii take with they the booty they have carry off from the land the roman army on the other hand when they do not find the enemy in the country be ready and eager for a decisive action cross the tiber and when the veiente hear that they be pitch a camp and intend to advance to the city they come out to meet they that they might rather decide the matter in the open field than be shut up and have to fight from they house and wall in this engagement the roman king gain the victory he power be unassisted by any stratagem by the unaided strength of he veteran army : and have pursue the route enemy up to they wall he refrain from attack the city which be strongly fortify and well defend by its natural advantage : on he return he lay waste they land rather from a desire of revenge than of booty the veiente humble by that loss no less than by the unsuccessful issue of the battle send ambassador to rome to sue for peace a truce for one hundred year be grant they after they have be mulct in a part of they territory these be essentially the chief event of the reign of romulus in peace and in war none of which seem inconsistent with the belief of he divine origin or of he deification after death neither the spirit he show in recover he grandfather 's kingdom nor he wisdom in build a city and afterward strengthen it by the art of war and peace for assuredly it be by the power that romulus give it that it become so powerful that for forty year after it enjoy unbroken peace he be however dearer to the people than to the father : above all other he be most beloved by the soldier : of these he keep three hundred whom he call celere arm to serve as a body-guard not only in time of war but also of peace have accomplish these work deserving of immortality while he be hold a assembly of the people for review he army in the plain near the goat 's pool a storm suddenly come on accompany by loud thunder and lightning and envelop the king in so dense a mist that it entirely hide he from the sight of the assembly after this romulus be never see again upon earth the feeling of consternation have at length calm down and the weather have become clear and fine again after so stormy a day the roman youth see the royal seat empty -- though they readily believe the word of the father who have stand nearest he that he have be carry up to heaven by the storm -- yet strike as it be with the fear of be fatherless for a considerable time preserve a sorrowful silence then after a few have set the example the whole multitude salute romulus as a god the son of a god the king and parent of the roman city they implore he favor with prayer that with gracious kindness he would always preserve he offspring i believe that even then there be some who in secret be convince that the king have be tear in piece by the hand of the father -- for this rumor also spread but it be very doubtfully receive admiration for the man however and the awe feel at the moment give greater notoriety to the other report also by the clever idea of one individual additional confirmation be say to have be attach to the occurrence for proculus julius while the state be still trouble at the loss of the king and incense against the senator a weighty authority as we be tell in any matter however important come forward into the assembly quirite say he romulus the father of this city suddenly descend from heaven appear to I this day at daybreak while i stand fill with dread and religious awe beseech he to allow I to look upon he face to face ` go ' say he ` tell the roman that the god so will that my rome should become the capital of the world therefore let they cultivate the art of war and let they know and so hand it down to posterity that no human power can withstand the roman arm ' have say this he vanish up to heaven it be surprising what credit be give to that person when he make the announcement and how much the regret of the common people and army for the loss of romulus be assuage when the certainty of he immortality be confirm -lrb- 15 -rrb- meanwhile -lrb- 16 -rrb- contention for the throne and ambition engage the mind of the father the struggle be not as yet carry on by individual by violence or contend faction because among a new people no one person be pre-eminently distinguish the contest be carry on between the different order the descendant of the sabine wish a king to be elect from they own body lest because there have be no king from they own party since the death of tatius they might lose they claim to the crown although both be on a equal foot the old roman spurn the idea of a foreign prince amid this diversity of view however all be anxious to be under the government of a king as they have not yet experience the delight of liberty fear then seize the senator lest as the mind of many surrounding state be incense against they some foreign power should attack the state now without a government and the army now without a leader therefore although they be agree that there should be some head yet none could bring himself to give way to another accordingly the hundred senator divide the government among themselves ten decury be form and the individual member who be to have the chief direction of affair be choose into each decury -lrb- 17 -rrb- ten govern one only be attend by the lictor and with the insignia of authority : they power be limit to the space of five day and confer upon all in rotation and the interval between the government of a king last a year from this fact it be call a interregnum a term which be employ even now then the people begin to murmur that they slavery be multiply and that they have now a hundred sovereign instead of one and they seem determine to submit to no authority but that of a king and that one appoint by themselves when the father perceive that such scheme be on foot think it advisable to offer they without be ask what they be sure to lose they conciliate the good-will of the people by yield to they the supreme power yet in such a manner as to surrender no greater privilege than they reserve to themselves for they decree that when the people have choose a king the election should be valid if the senate give the sanction of they authority and even to this day the same form be observe in propose law and magistrate though they power have be take away for before the people begin to vote the senator ratify they choice even while the result of the election be still uncertain then the interrex have summon a assembly of the people address they as follow : do you quirite choose yourselve a king and may this choice prove fortunate happy and auspicious such be the will of the father then if you shall choose a prince worthy to be reckon next after romulus the father will ratify you choice this concession be so please to the people that not to appear outdo in generosity they only vote and ordain that the senate should determine who should be king at rome the justice and piety of numa pompilius be at that time celebrate he dwell at cure a city of the sabine and be as eminently learn in all law human and divine as any man could be in that age they falsely represent that pythagora of samo be he instructor in learn because there appear no other now it be certain that this philosopher in the reign of servius tullius more than a hundred year after this hold assembly of young man who eagerly embrace he doctrine on the most distant shore of italy in the neighborhood of metapontum heraclea and croton but from these place even have he flourish in the same age what fame of he could have reach the sabine or by what intercourse of language could it have arouse any one to a desire of learn or by what safeguard could a single man have pass through the midst of so many nation differ in language and custom i be therefore rather incline to believe that he mind owe to he natural bent be attemper by virtuous quality and that he be not so much verse in foreign system of philosophy as in the stern and gloomy training of the ancient sabine a race than which none be in former time more strict when they hear the name of numa although the roman father perceive that the balance of power would incline to the sabine if a king be choose from they yet none of they venture to prefer himself or any other member of he party or in fine any of the citizen or father to a man so well know but unanimously resolve that the kingdom should be offer to numa pompilius be send for just as romulus obtain the throne by the augury in accordance with which he found the city so numa in like manner command the god to be consult concern himself upon this be escort into the citadel by a augur to whose profession that office be later make a public and perpetual one by way of honor he sit down on a stone face the south : the augur take he seaton he left hand with he head cover hold in he right a crooked wand free from knot call lituus then after have take a view over the city and country and offer a prayer to the god he define the bound of the region of the sky from east to west : the part toward the south he call the right those toward the north the left and in front of he he mark out in he mind the sign as far as ever he eye could see then have shift the lituus into he left hand and place he right on the head of numa he pray after this manner : o father jupiter if it be thy will that this numa pompilius whose head i hold be king of rome mayest thou manifest infallible sign to we within those bound which i have mark then he state in set term the auspices which he wish to be send : on they be send numa be declare king and come down from the seat of augury have thus obtain the kingdom he set about establish anew on the principle of law and morality the newly found city that have be already establish by force of arm when he see that the inhabitant inasmuch as man 's mind be brutalize by military life could not become reconcile to such principle during the continuance of war consider that the savage nature of the people must be tone down by the disuse of arm he erect at the foot of argiletum -lrb- 18 -rrb- a temple of janus as a sign of peace and war that when open it might show that the state be engage in war and when shut that all the surround nation be at peace twice only since the reign of numa have this temple be shut : once when titus manlius be consul after the conclusion of the first punic war and a second time which the god grant we generation to behold by the emperor cæsar augustus after the battle of actium when peace be establish by land and sea this be shut after he have secure the friendship of all the neighbouring state around by alliance and treaty all anxiety regard danger from abroad be now remove in order to prevent they mind which the fear of enemy and military discipline have keep in check run riot from too much leisure he consider that first of all awe of the god should be instil into they a principle of the greatest efficacy in deal with the multitude ignorant and uncivilized as it be in those time but as this fear could not sink deeply into they mind without some fiction of a miracle he pretend that he hold nightly interview with the goddess egerium that by she direction he institute sacred rite such as would be most acceptable to the god and appoint they own priest for each of the deity and first of all he divide the year into twelve month accord to the course of the moon -lrb- 19 -rrb- and because the moon do not fill up the number of thirty day in each month and some day be want to the complete year which be bring round by the solstitial revolution he so regulate this year by insert intercalary month that every twentieth year the length of all the intermediate year be fill up the day correspond with the same starting-point of the sun whence they have set out he likewise divide day into sacred and profane because on certain occasion it be likely to be expedient that no business should be transact with the people next he turn he attention to the appointment of priest though he discharge many sacred function himself especially those which now belong to the flaman of jupiter but as he imagine that in a warlike nation there would be more king resemble romulus than numa and that they would go to war in person in order that the sacred function of the royal office might not be neglect he appoint a perpetual priest as flaman to jupiter and distinguish he by a fine robe and a royal curule chair to he he add two other flamen one for mar another for quirinus he also choose virgin for vesta a priesthood derive from alba and not foreign to the family of the founder that they might be constant attendant in the temple he appoint they pay out of the public treasury and by enjoin virginity and various religious observance he make they sacred and venerable he also choose twelve salius for mar gradivus and give they the distinction of a embroidered tunic and over the tunic a brazen cover for the breast he command they to carry the shield call ancilium -lrb- 20 -rrb- which fall fromheaven and to go through the city singing song with leap and solemn dancing then he choose from the father numa marcius son of marcius as pontiff and consign to he a complete system of religious rite write out and record show with what victim upon what day and at what temple the sacred rite be to be perform and from what fund the money be to be take to defray the expense he also place all other religious institution public and private under the control of the decree of the pontiff to the end that there might be some authority to whom the people should come to ask advice to prevent any confusion in the divine worship be cause by they neglect the ceremony of they own country and adopt foreign one he further ordain that the same pontiff should instruct the people not only in the ceremony connect with the heavenly deity but also in the due performance of funeral solemnity and how to appease the shades of the dead and what prodigy send by lightning or any other phenomenon be to be attend to and expiate to draw forth such knowledge from the mind of the god he dedicate a altar on the aventine to jupiter elicius and consult the god by means of augury as to what prodigy ought to be attend to the attention of the whole people have be thus divert from violence and arm to the deliberation and adjustment of these matter both they mind be engage in some occupation and the watchfulness of the god now constantly impressed upon they as the deity of heaven seem to interest itself in human concern have fill the breast of all with such piety that faith and religious obligation govern the state the dread of law and punishment be regard as secondary and while the people of they own accord be form themselves on the model of the king as the most excellent example the neighbouring state also who have formerly think that it be a camp not a city that have be establish in they midst to disturb the general peace be bring to feel such respect for they that they consider it impious to molest a state wholly occupy in the worship of the god there be a grove the middle of which be irrigate by a spring of run water flow from a dark grotto as numa often repair thither unattended under pretence of meet the goddess he dedicate the grove to the camenae because as he assert they meeting with he wife egerium be hold there he also institute a yearly festival to faith alone and command she priest to be drive to the chapel erect for the purpose in a arched chariot draw by two horse and to perform the divine service with they hand wrap up to the finger intimate that faith ought to be protect and that even she seat in man 's right hand be sacred he institute many other sacred rite and dedicate place for perform they which the priest call argeus but the greatest of all he work be the maintenance of peace during the whole period of he reign no less than of he royal power thus two king in succession by different method the one by war the other by peace aggrandize the state romulus reign thirty-seven year numa forty-three : the state be both strong and attempered by the art both of war and peace upon the death of numa the administration return again to a interregnum after that the people appoint as king tullus hostilius the grandson of that hostilius who have make the noble stand against the sabine at the foot of the citadel : the father confirm the choice he be not only unlike the precede king but even of a more warlike disposition than romulus both he youth and strength and further the renown of he grandfather stimulate he ambition think therefore that the state be deteriorate through ease he everywhere seek for a opportunity of stir up war it so happen that some roman and alban peasant mutually plunder each other 's land gaius cluilius at that time be in power at alba from both side ambassador be send almost at the same time to demand satisfaction tullus have order he representative to attend to they instruction before anything else he know well that the alban would refuse and so war might be proclaim with a clear conscience they commission be execute in a more dilatory manner by the alban : be courteously and kindly entertain by tullus they gladly take advantage of the king 's hospitality meanwhile the roman have both be first in demand satisfaction and upon the refusal of the alban have proclaim war upon the expiration of thirty day : of this they give tullus notice thereupon he grant the alban ambassador a opportunity of state with what demand they come they ignorant of everything at first waste some time in make excuse : that it be with reluctance they would say anything which might be displease to tullus but they be compel by order : that they have come to demand satisfaction : if this be not grant they be command to declare war to this tullus make answer go tell you king that the king of the roman take the god to witness that whichever of the two nation shall have first dismiss with contempt the ambassador demand satisfaction from it they -lrb- the god -rrb- may exact atonement for the disaster of this war this message the alban carry home preparation be make on both side with the utmost vigor for a war very like a civil one in a manner between parent and child both be of trojan stock : for from troy come lavinium from lavinium alba and the roman be descend from the stock of the alban king however the result of the war render the quarrel less distressing for the struggle never come to regular action and when the building only of one of the city have be demolish the two state be incorporate into one the alban first invade the roman territory with a large army they pitch they camp not more than five mile from the city and surround it with a trench which for several age be call the cluilian trench from the name of the general till by lapse of time the name as well as the event itself be forget in that camp cluilius the alban king die : the alban create mettius fufetius dictator in the meantime tullus exultant especially at the death of the king and give out that the supreme power of the god have begin at the head would take vengeance on the whole alban nation for this impious war have pass the enemy 's camp in the night-time march with a hostile army into the alban territory this circumstance draw out mettius from he camp : he lead he force as close as possible to the enemy thence he despatch a herald and command he to tell tullus that a conference be expedient before they come to a engagement and that if he would give he a meeting he be certain he would bring forward matter which concern the interest of rome no less than of alba tullus do not reject the offer : nevertheless in case the proposal make should prove fruitless he lead out he man in order of battle : the alban on they side march out also after both army stand draw up in battle array the chief with a few of the principal officer advance into the midst then the alban begin as follow : that injury and the non-restitution of property claim accord to treaty be the cause of this war methink i have both hear we king cluilius assert and i doubt not tullus but that you allege the same but if the truth must be tell rather than what be plausible it be thirst for rule that provoke two kindred and neighbouring state to arm whether rightly or wrongly i do not take upon myself to determine : let the consideration of that rest with he who have begin the war as for myself the alban have only make I they leader for carry on that war of this tullus i would have you advise : how powerful the etruscan state be around we and around you particularly you know better than we inasmuch as you be nearer to they they be very powerful by land far more so by sea recollect that directly you shall give the signal for battle these two army will be the object of they attention that they may fall on we when wearied and exhaust victor and vanquish together therefore for the love of heaven since not content with a sure independence we be run the doubtful hazard of sovereignty and slavery let we adopt some method whereby without great loss without much bloodshed of either nation it may be decide which be to rule the other the proposal be not displease to tullus though both from he natural bent as also from the hope of victory he be rather incline to violence after consideration on both side a plan be adopt for which fortune herself afford the means of execution it happen that there be in the two army at that time three brother bear at one birth neither in age nor strength ill-matched that they be call horatius and curiatius be certain enough and there be hardly any fact of antiquity more generally know yet in a manner so well ascertain a doubt remain concern they name as to which nation the horatius to which the curiatius belong author incline to both side yet i find a majority who call the horatius roman : my own inclination lead I to follow they the king arrange with the three brother that they should fight with sword each in defense of they respective country assure they that dominion would rest with those on whose side victory should declare itself no objection be raise the time and place be agree upon before the engagement begin a compact be enter into between the roman and alban on these condition that that state whose champion should come off victorious in the combat should rule the other state without further dispute different treaty be make on different condition but in general they be all conclude with the same formality we have hear that the treaty in question be then conclude as follow nor be there extant a more ancient record of any treaty the herald asked king tullus dost thou command I o king to conclude a treaty with the pater patratus of the alban people on the king so commanding he he say i demand vervain of thee o king the king reply take some that be pure the herald bring a pure blade of grass from the citadel then again he ask the king dost thou o king appoint I the royal delegate of the roman people the quirite and my appurtenance and attendant the king reply so far as it may be do without detriment to I and to the roman people the quirite i do so the herald be marcus valerius who appoint spurius fusius pater patratus -lrb- 21 -rrb- touch he head and hair with the vervain -lrb- 22 -rrb- the pater patratus be appoint ad iusiurandum patrandum that be to ratify the treaty and he go through it in a lengthy preamble which be express in a long set form it be not worth while to repeat after have set forth the condition he say : hear o jupiter hear o pater patratus of the alban people and ye o alban people give ear as those condition from first to last have be publicly recite from those tablet or wax without wicked or fraudulent intent and as they have be most correctly understand here this day the roman people will not be the first to fail to observe those condition if they shall be the first to do so by public consent by fraudulent intent on that day do thou o jupiter so strike the roman people as i shall here this day strike this swine and do thou strike they so much the more as thou art more mighty and more powerful when he say this he strike the swine with a flint stone the alban likewise go through they own set form and oath by the mouth of they own dictator and priest the treaty be conclude the twin-brother as have be agree take arm while they respective friend exhort each party remind they that they country 's god they country and parent all they fellow-citizen both at home and in the army have they eye then fix on they arm on they hand be both naturally brave and animated by the shout and exhortation of they friend they advance into the midst between the two line the two army on both side have take they seat in front of they respective camp free rather from danger for the moment than from anxiety : for sovereign power be at stake dependent on the valor and fortune of so few accordingly therefore on the tip-toe of expectation they attention be eagerly fix on a spectacle far from please the signal be give : and the three youth on each side as if in battle array rush to the charge with arm present bear in they breast the spirit of mighty army neither the one nor the other heed they personal danger but the public dominion or slavery be present to they mind and the thought that the fortune of they country would be such hereafter as they themselves should have make it directly they arm clash at the first encounter and they glittering sword flash a mighty horror thrill the spectator and as hope incline to neither side voice and breath alike be numbed then have engage hand to hand when now not only the movement of they body and the indecisive brandishing of they arm and weapon but wound also and blood be see two of the roman fall lifeless one upon the other the three alban be wound and when the alban army have raise a shout of joy at they fall hope have entirely by this time not however anxiety desert the roman legion breathless with apprehension at the dangerous position of this one man whom the three curiatius have surround he happen to be unhurt so that though alone he be by no mean a match for they all together yet he be full of confidence against each singly in order therefore to separate they attack he take to flight presume that they would each pursue he with such swiftness as the wounded state of he body would permit he have now flee a considerable distance from the place where the fight have take place when look back he perceive that they be pursue he at a great distance from each other and that one of they be not far from he on he he turn round with great fury and while the alban army shout out to the curiatius to succor they brother horatius by this time victorious have slay he antagonist be now proceed to a second attack then the roman encourage they champion with a shout such as be wont to be raise when man cheer in consequence of unexpected success and he hasten to finish the combat wherefore before the other who be not far off could come up to he he slew the second curiatius also and now the combat be bring to equal term one on each side remain but unequally match in hope and strength the one be inspire with courage for a third contest by the fact that he body be uninjured by a weapon and by he double victory : the other drag along he body exhaust from he wound exhaust from run and dispirit by the slaughter of he brother before he eye thus meet he victorious antagonist and indeed there be no fight the roman exult cry : two i have offer to the shades of my brother : the third i will offer to the cause of this war that the roman may rule over the alban he thrust he sword down from above into he throat while he with difficulty support the weight of he arm and strip he as he lay prostrate the roman welcome horatius with joy and congratulation with so much the greater exultation as the matter have closely border on alarm they then turn they attention to the burial of they friend with feeling by no mean the same : for the one side be elate by the acquisition of empire the other bring under the rule of other : they sepulchre may still be see in the spot where each fall the two roman in one place nearer alba the three alban in the direction of rome but situate at some distance from each other as in fact they have fight before they depart from thence when mettius in accordance with the treaty which have be conclude ask tullus what he order be he order he to keep he young man under arm for he intend to employ they if a war should break out with the veiente after this both army be lead away to they home horatius march in front carry before he the spoil of the three brother : he maiden sister who have be betroth to one of the curiatius meet he before the gate capena -lrb- 23 -rrb- and have recognize on she brother 's shoulder the military robe of she betrothed which she herself have work she tear she hair and with bitter wailing call by name on she deceased lover the sister 's lamentation in the midst of he own victory and of such great public rejoicing raise the ire of the hot-tempered youth so have draw he sword he run the maiden through the body at the same time reproach she with these word : go hence with thy ill-timed love to thy spouse forgetful of thy brother that be dead and of the one who survive -- forgetful of thy country so fare every roman woman who shall mourn a enemy this deed seem cruel to the father and to the people but he recent service outweigh its enormity nevertheless he be drag before the king for judgment the king however that he might not himself be responsible for a decision so melancholy and so disagreeable in the view of the people or for the punishment consequent on such decision have summon a assembly of the people declare i appoint accord to law duumvir to pass sentence on horatius for treason the law be of dreadful formulum let the duumvir pass sentence for treason if he appeal from the duumvir let he contend by appeal if they shall gain the cause let the lictor cover he head hang he by a rope on the accursed tree scourge he either within the pomerium -lrb- 24 -rrb- or without the pomerium the duumvir appoint in accordance with this decision who do not consider that accord to that law they could acquit the man even if innocent have condemn he then one of they say : publius horatius i judge thee guilty of treason lictor bind he hand the lictor have approach he and be commence to fix the rope round he neck then horatius on the advice of tullus a merciful interpreter of the law say i appeal accordingly the matter be contest before the people as to the appeal at that trial the spectator be much affect especially on publius horatius the father declare that he consider he daughter to have be deservedly slay be it not so that he would by virtue of he authority as a father have inflict punishment on he son he then entreat they that they would not render he childless one whom but a little while ago they have behold bless with a fine progeny during these word the old man have embrace the youth point to the spoil of the curiatius hang up in that place which be now call pila horatia -lrb- 25 -rrb- quirite say he can you bear to see bind beneath the gallows amid scourging and torture the man whom you just now behold march decorate with spoil and exult in victory -- a sight so shocking that even the eye of the alban could scarcely endure it go then lictor bind those hand which but a little while since arm win sovereignty for the roman people go cover the head of the liberator of this city : hang he on the accursed tree : scourge he either within the pomerium so it be only amid those javelin and spoil of the enemy or without the pomerium so it be only amid the grave of the curiatius for whither can you lead this youth where he own noble deed will not redeem he from such disgraceful punishment the people could not withstand either the tear of the father or the spirit of the son the same in every danger and acquit he more from admiration of he bravery than on account of the justice of he cause but that so clear a murder might be at least atone for by some expiation the father be command to expiate the son 's guilt at the public charge he have offer certain expiatory sacrifice which be ever after continue in the horatian family and lay a beam across the street make the youth pass under it as under the yoke with he head cover this beam remain even to this day be constantly repair at the public expense it be call sororium tigillum -lrb- sister 's beam -rrb- a tomb of square stone be erect to horatium in the spot where she be stab and fall however the peace with alba do not long continue the dissatisfaction of the populace at the fortune of the state have be intrust to three soldier pervert the waver mind of the dictator and since straightforward measure have not turn out well he begin to conciliate the affection of the populace by treacherous means accordingly as one who have formerly seek peace in time of war and be now seek war in time of peace because he perceive that he own state possess more courage than strength he stir up other nation to make war openly and by proclamation : for he own people he reserve the work of treachery under the show of allegiance the fidenate a roman colony -lrb- 26 -rrb- have take the veiente into partnership in the plot be instigate to declare war and take up arm under a compact of desertion on the part of the alban when fidena have openly revolt tullus after summon mettius and he army from alba march against the enemy when he cross the anio he pitch he camp at the conflux of the river -lrb- 27 -rrb- between that place and fidenae the army of the veiente have cross the tiber these in the line of battle also occupy the right wing near the river the fidenate be post on the left nearer the mountain tullus station he own man opposite the veientine foe the alban he post to face the legion of the fidenate the alban have no more courage than loyalty therefore neither daring to keep he ground nor to desert openly he file off slowly to the mountain after this when he suppose he have advance far enough he lead he entire army uphill and still waver in mind in order to waste time open he rank he design be to direct he force to that side on which fortune should give success at first the roman who stand nearest be astonish when they perceive they flank be expose by the departure of they ally then a horseman at full gallop announce to the king that the alban be move off tullus in this perilous juncture vow twelve salius and temple to paleness and panic rebuke the horseman in a loud voice so that the enemy might hear he plainly he order he to return to the rank that there be no occasion for alarm that it be by he order that the alban army be be lead round to fall on the unprotected rear of the fidenate he likewise command he to order the cavalry to raise they spear aloft the execution of this order shut out the view of the retreat alban army from a great part of the roman infantry those who see it believe that it be even so as they have hear from the king fight with all the greater valor the alarm be transfer to the enemy they have both hear what have be utter so loudly and a great part of the fidenate as man who have mix as colonist with the roman understand latin therefore that they might not be cut off from the town by a sudden descent of the alban from the hill they take to flight tullus press forward and have route the wing of the fidenate return with greater fury against the veiente who be dishearten by the panic of the other : they do not even sustain he charge but the river oppose to they in the rear prevent a disorder flight when they flight lead thither some shamefully throw down they arm rush blindly into the river other while linger on the bank undecided whether to fight or flee be overpower never before be a more desperate battle fight by the roman then the alban army which have be a mere spectator of the fight be march down into the plain mettius congratulate tullus on he victory over the enemy tullus on he part address mettius with courtesy he order the alban to unite they camp with that of the roman which he pray heaven might prove beneficial to both and prepare a purificatory sacrifice for the next day as soon as it be daylight all thing be in readiness accord to custom he command both army to be summon to a assembly the herald begin at the farthest part of the camp summon the alban first they strike also with the novelty of the thing in order to hear the roman king deliver a speech crowd next to he the roman force under arm accord to previous arrangement surround they the centurion have be charge to execute they order without delay then tullus begin as follow : roman if ever before at any other time in any war there be a reason that you should return thanks first to the immortal god next to you own valor it be yesterday 's battle for the struggle be not so much with enemy as with the treachery and perfidy of ally a struggle which be more serious and more dangerous for -- that you may not be under a mistaken opinion -- know that it be without my order that the alban retire to the mountain nor be that my command but a stratagem and the mere pretence of a command : that you be keep in ignorance that you be desert you attention might not be draw away from the fight and that the enemy might be inspire with terror and dismay conceive themselves to be surround on the rear nor be that guilt which i now complain of share by all the alban they merely follow they leader as you too would have do have i wish to turn my army away to any other point from thence it be mettius there who be the leader of this march : it be mettius also who the contriver of this war be : it be mettius who be the violator of the treaty between rome and alba let another hereafter venture to do the like if i do not presently make of he a signal example to mankind the centurion in arm stand around mettius : the king proceed with the rest of he speech as he have commence : it be my intention and may it prove fortunate happy and auspicious to the roman people to myself and to you o alban to transplant all the inhabitant of alba to rome to grant you common the rights of citizenship to admit you noble into the body of senator to make one city one state : as the alban state after be one people be formerly divide into two so let it now again become one on hearing this the alban youth unarmed surround by armed man although divide in they sentiment yet under pressure of the general apprehension maintain silence then tullus proceed : if mettius fufetius you be capable of learn fidelity and how to observe treaty i would have suffer you to live and have give you such a lesson but as it be since you disposition be incurable do you at any rate by you punishment teach mankind to consider those obligation sacred which have be violate by you as therefore a little while since you keep you mind divide between the interest of fidena and of rome so shall you now surrender you body to be tear asunder in different direction upon this two chariot draw by four horse be bring up he bind mettius stretch at full length to they carriage : then the horse be drive in different direction carry off he mangled body on each carriage where the limb have remain hang to the cord all turn away they eye from so shocking a spectacle that be the first and last instance among the roman of a punishment which establish a precedent that show but little regard for the law of humanity in other case we may boast that no other nation have approve of milder form of punishment -lrb- 28 -rrb- meanwhile the cavalry have already be send on to alba to transplant the people to rome the legion be next lead thither to demolish the city when they enter the gate there be not indeed such a tumult or panic as usually prevail in capture city when after the gate have be burst open or the wall level by the battering-ram or the citadel take by assault the shout of the enemy and rush of armed man through the city throw everything into confusion with fire and sword : but gloomy silence and speechless sorrow so stupefy the mind of all that through fear pay no heed as to what they should leave behind what they should take with they in they perplexity make frequent inquiry one of another they now stand on the threshold now wander about roam through they house which they be destine to see then for the last time when now the shout of the horseman command they to depart become urgent and the crash of the dwelling which be be demolish be hear in the remotest part of the city and the dust rise from distant place have fill every quarter as with a cloud spread over they then hastily carry out whatever each of they could while they go forth leave behind they they guardian deity and household god -lrb- 29 -rrb- and the home in which each have be bear and bring up a unbroken line of emigrant soon fill the street and the sight of other cause they tear to break out afresh in pity for one another : piteous cry too be hear of the woman more especially as they pass by they revered temple now beset with armed man and leave they god as it be in captivity after the alban have evacuate the town the roman soldiery level all the public and private building indiscriminately to the ground and a single hour consign to destruction and ruin the work of four hundred year during which alba have stand the temple of the god however -- for so it have be order by the king -- be spare in the meantime rome increase by the destruction of alba the number of citizen be double the coelian mount be add to the city and in order that it might be more thickly populated tullus select it as a site for he palace and subsequently take up he abode there the lead man of the alban he enrol among the patrician that that division of the state also might increase the tullius servilius quinctius geganius curiatius cloelius and as a consecrate place of meeting for the order thus augment by himself he build a senate-house which be call hostilium -lrb- 30 -rrb- even down to the time of we father further that all rank might acquire some additional strength from the new people he choose ten troops of horseman from among the alban : he likewise recruit the old legion and raise new one by addition from the same source trust to this increase of strength tullus declare war against the sabine a nation at that time the most powerful next to the etruscan in man and arm on both side wrong have be commit and satisfaction demand in vain tullus complain that some roman merchant have be seize in a crowded market near the temple of feronium : -lrb- 31 -rrb- the sabine that some of they people have previously take refuge in the asylum and have be detain at rome these be put forward as the cause of the war the sabine well aware both that a portion of they strength have be settle at rome by tatius and that the roman power have also be lately increase by the accession of the alban people begin in like manner to look around for foreign aid themselves etrurium be in they neighborhood of the etruscan the veiente be the nearest from thence they attract some volunteer whose mind be stir up to break the truce chiefly in consequence of the rankle animosity from former war pay also have its weight with some straggler belong to the indigent population they be assist by no aid from the government and the loyal observation of the truce conclude with romulus be strictly keep by the veiente : with respect to the other it be less surprising while both side be prepare for war with the utmost vigor and the matter seem to turn on this which side should first commence hostility tullus advance first into the sabine territory a desperate battle take place at the wood call malitiosa in which the roman army gain a decisive advantage both by reason of the superior strength of they infantry and also more especially by the aid of they cavalry which have be recently increase the sabine rank be throw into disorder by a sudden charge of the cavalry nor could they afterward stand firm in battle array or retreat in loose order without great slaughter after the defeat of the sabine when the government of tullus and the whole roman state enjoy great renown and be highly flourish it be announce to the king and senator that it have rain stone on the alban mount as this could scarcely be credit on person be send to investigate the prodigy a shower of stone fall from heaven before they eye just as when ball of hail be pelt down to the earth by the wind they also seem to hear a loud voice from the grove on the summit of the hill bidding the alban perform they religious service accord to the rite of they native country which they have consign to oblivion as if they god have be abandon at the same time as they country and have either adopt the religious rite of rome or as often happen enraged at they evil destiny have altogether renounce the worship of the god a festival of nine day be institute publicly by the roman also on account of the same prodigy either in obedience to the heavenly voice send from the alban mount -- for that too be report -- or by the advice of the soothsayer anyhow it continue a solemn observance that whenever a similar prodigy be announce a festival for nine day be observe not long after they be afflict with a epidemic and though in consequence of this there arise a unwillingness to serve yet no respite from arm be give they by the warlike king who consider besides that the body of the young man be more healthy when on service abroad than at home until he himself also be attack by a linger disease then that proud spirit and body become so broken that he who have formerly consider nothing less worthy of a king than to devote he mind to religious observance begin to pass he time a slave to every form of superstition important and trifling and fill the people 's mind also with religious scruple the majority of he subject now desire the restoration of that state of thing which have exist under king numa think that the only chance of relief for they diseased body lay in grace and compassion be obtain from the god it be say that the king himself turn over the commentary of numa after he have find therein that certain sacrifice of a secret and solemn nature have be perform to jupiter elicius shut himself up and set about the performance of those solemnity but that that rite be not duly undertake or carry out and that not only be no heavenly manifestation vouchsafe to he but he and he house be strike by lightning and burn to ash through theanger of jupiter who be exasperate at the ceremony have be improperly perform -lrb- 32 -rrb- tullus reign two-and-thirty year with great military renown on the death of tullus accord to the custom establish in the first instance the government devolve once more upon the senate who nominate a interrex and on he hold the comitium the people elect ancus marciusk the father ratify the election ancus marcius be the grandson of king numa pompilius by he daughter as soon as he begin to reign mindful of the renown of he grandfather and reflect that the last reign glorious as it have be in every other respect in one particular have not be adequately prosperous either because the rite of religion have be utterly neglect or improperly perform and deem it of the highest importance to perform the public ceremony of religion as they have be institute by numa he order the pontiff after he have record they all from the king 's commentary on white table to set they up in a public place hence as both he own subject and the neighbouring nation desire peace hope be entertain that the king would adopt the conduct and institution of he grandfather accordingly the latin with whom a treaty have be conclude in the reign of tullus gain fresh courage and after they have invade roman territory return a contemptuous answer to the roman when they demand satisfaction suppose that the roman king would spend he reign in indolence among chapel and altar the disposition of ancus be between two extreme preserve the quality of both numa and romulus and besides believe that peace be more necessary in he grandfather 's reign since the people be then both newly form and uncivilize he also feel that he could not easily preserve the tranquility unmolested which have fall to he lot : that he patience be be try and be try be despise : and that the time generally be more suit to a king tullus than to a numa in order however that since numa have institute religious rite in peace ceremony relate to war might be draw up by he and that war might not only be wage but proclaim also in accordance with some prescribed form he borrow from a ancient nation the æquicolae and draw up the form which the herald observe to this day accord to which restitution be demand the ambassador when he reach the frontier of the people from whom satisfaction be demand have he head cover with a fillet -- this cover be of wool -- say : hear o jupiter hear ye confines -lrb- name whatsoever nation they belong to -rrb- let divine justice hear i be the public messenger of the roman people i come depute by right and religion and let my word gain credit he then definitely state he demand afterward he call jupiter to witness : if i demand these person and these goods to be give up to I contrary to human or divine right then mayest thou never permit I to enjoy my native country these word he repeat when he pass over the frontier : the same to the first man he meet : the same on enter the gate : the same on enter the forum with a slight change of expression in the form of the declaration and draw up of the oath if the person whom he demand be not deliver up after the expiration of thirty-three day -- for this number be enjoin by rule -- he declare war in the follow term : hear jupiter and thou janus quirinus and all ye celestial terrestrial and infernal god give ear i call you to witness that this nation -lrb- mention its name -rrb- be unjust and do not carry out the principle of justice : however we will consult the elder in we own country concern those matter by what mean we may obtain we rights the messenger return with they to rome to consult the king use immediately to consult the father as nearly as possible in the follow word : concern such thing cause of dispute and quarrel as the pater patratus of the roman people the quirite have treat with the pater patratus of the ancient latin and with the ancient latin people which thing ought to be give up make good discharge which thing they have neither give up nor make good nor discharge declare say he to he whose opinion he ask first what think you then he reply : i think that they should be demand by a war free from guilt and regularly declare and accordingly i agree and vote for it then the other be ask in order and when the majority of those present express the same opinion war be agree upon it be customary for the fetiali to carry in he hand a spear point with steel or burn at the end and dip in blood to the confines of the enemy 's country and in presence of at least three grown-up person to say forasmuch as the state of the ancient latin and the ancient latin people have offend against the roman people of the quirite forasmuch as the roman people of the quirite have order that there should be war with the ancient latin and the senate of the roman people the quirite have give they opinion agree and vote that war should be wage with the ancient latin on this account i and the roman people declare and wage war on the state of the ancient latin and on the ancient latin people whenever he say that he use to hurl the spear within they confines after this manner at that time satisfaction be demand from the latin and war proclaim : and posterity have adopt that usage ancus have intrust the care of sacred matter to the flaman and other priest set out with a army freshly levy and take politorium a city of the latin by storm : and follow the example of former king who have increase the roman power by incorporate enemy into the state transplant all the people to rome and since the sabine have occupy the capitol and citadel and the alban the coelian mount on both side of the palatium the dwelling-place of the old roman the aventine be assign to the new people not long after on the capture of tellena and ficana new citizen be add to the same quarter after this politorium which the ancient latin have take possession of when vacate be take a second time by force of arm this be the cause of the roman demolish that city that it might never after serve as a place of refuge for the enemy at last the war with the latin be entirely concentrate at medullium the contest be carry on there for some time with change success accord as the fortune of war vary : for the town be both well protect by fortify work and strengthen by a powerful garrison and the latin have pitch they camp in the open have several time come to a close engagement with the roman at last ancus make a effort with all he force first defeat they in a pitched battle and enrich by considerable booty return thence to rome : many thousand of the latin be then also admit to citizenship to whom in order that the aventine might be unite to the palatium a settlement be assign near the temple of murcium -lrb- 33 -rrb- be likewise add not from want of room but lest at any time it should become a stronghold for the enemy it be resolve that it should not only be surround by a wall but also for convenience of passage be unite to the city by a wooden bridge which be then for the first time build across the tiber the fossa quiritium no inconsiderable defense in place where the ground be lower and consequently easier of access be also the work of king ancus the state be augment by such great accession see that amid such a multitude of inhabitant -lrb- all distinction of right and wrong be as yet confound -rrb- secret crime be commit a prison -lrb- 34 -rrb- be build in the heart of the city overlook the forum to intimidate the grow licentiousness and not only be the city increase under this king but also its territory and boundary after the mesian forest have be take from the veientine the roman dominion be extend as far as the sea and the city of ostium build at the mouth of the tiber salt-pit be dig around it and in consequence of the distinguished success in war the temple of jupiter feretrius be enlarged in the reign of ancus lucumo -lrb- 35 -rrb- a wealthy and enterprising man come to settle at rome prompt chiefly by the desire and hope of high preferment which he have no opportunity of obtain at tarquinius -lrb- for there also he be descend from a alien stock -rrb- he be the son of demaratus a corinthian who a exile from he country on account of civil disturbance have chance to settle at tarquinius and have marry a wife there have two son by she they name be lucumo and arruns lucumo survive he father and become heir to all he property arrun die before he father leave a wife pregnant the father do not long survive the son and as he not know that he daughter-in-law be pregnant have die without mention he grandchild in he will the boy who be bear after the death of he grandfather and have no share in he fortune be give the name of egerius on account of he poverty lucumo who be on the other hand the heir of all he father 's property be fill with high aspiration by reason of he wealth have these ambition greatly advance by he marriage with tanaquil who be descend from a very high family and be a woman who would not readily brook that the condition into which she have marry should be inferior to that in which she have be bear as the etruscan despise lucumo as be spring from a foreign exile she could not put up with the affront and regardless of the natural love of she native country provide only she could see she husband advance to honor she form the design of leave tarquinius rome seem particularly suit for that purpose in a state lately found where all nobility be rapidly gain and as the reward of merit there would be room -lrb- she think -rrb- for a man of courage and activity tatius a sabine have be king of rome : numa have be send for from cure to reign there : ancus be spring from a sabine mother and rest he title to nobility on the single statue of numa -lrb- 36 -rrb- without difficulty she persuade he be as he be ambitious of honor and one to whom tarquinius be he country only on he mother 's side accordingly remove they effect they set out for rome they happen to have reach the janiculum : there as he sit in the chariot with he wife a eagle gently swoop down on float wing take off he cap and hover above the chariot with loud scream as if it have be send from heaven for that very purpose carefully replace it on he head and then fly aloft out of sight tanaquil be say to have joyfully welcome this omen be a woman well skilled as the etruscan generally be in celestial prodigy and embrace she husband bid he hope for a high and lofty destiny : that such a bird have come from such a quarter of the heaven and the messenger of such a god : that it have declare the omen around the highest part of man : that it have lift the ornament place on the head of man to restore it to he again by direction of the god bear with they such hope and thought they enter the city and have secure a dwelling there they give out he name as lucius tarquinius priscus the fact that he be a stranger and he wealth render he a object of attention to the roman he himself also promote he own good fortune by he affable address by the courteousness of he invitation and by gain over to he side all whom he could by act of kindness until report concern he reach even to the palace : and that notoriety he in a short time by pay he court to the king without truckling and with skilful address improve so far as to be admit on a footing of intimate friendship so much so that he be present at all public and private deliberation alike both foreign and domestic and be now prove in every sphere he be at length by the king 's will also appoint guardian to he child ancus reign twenty-four year equal to any of the former king both in the art of war and peace and in renown he son be now nigh the age of puberty for which reason tarquin be more urgent that the assembly for the election of a king should be hold as soon as possible the assembly have be proclaim he send the boy out of the way to hunt just before the time of the meeting he be say to have be the first who canvass for the crown and to have make a speech expressly word with the object of gain the affection of the people : say that he do not aim at anything unprecedented for that he be not the first foreigner -lrb- a thing at which any one might feel indignation or surprise -rrb- but the third who aspire to the sovereignty of rome that tatius who have not only be a alien but even a enemy have be make king that numa who know nothing of the city and without solicitation on he part have be voluntarily invite by they to the throne that he from the time he be he own master have migrate to rome with he wife and whole fortune and have spend a longer period of that time of life during which man be employ in civil office at rome than he have in he native country that he have both in peace and war become thoroughly acquaint with the political and religious institution of the roman under a master by no means to be despise king ancus himself that he have vie with all in duty and loyalty to he king and with the king himself in he bounty to other while he be recount these undoubted fact the people with great unanimity elect he king the same spirit of ambition which have prompt tarquin in other respects a excellent man to aspire to the crown attend he also on the throne and be no less mindful of strengthen he own power than of increase the commonwealth he elect a hundred new member into the senate who from that time be call minorum gentium a party who stanchly support the king by whose favor they have be admit into the senate the first war he wage be with the latin in whose territory he take the town of apiola by storm and have bring back thence more booty than might have be expect from the report importance of the war he celebrate game with more magnificence and display than former king the place for the circus which be now call maximus be then first mark out and space be apportion to the senator and knight where they might each erect seat for themselves : these be call forus -lrb- bench -rrb- they view the game from scaffolding which support seat twelve foot in height from the ground the show consist of horse and boxer that be summon chiefly from etruria these solemn game afterward celebrate annually continue a institution be afterward variously call the roman and great game by the same king also space round the forum be assign to private individual for building on covered walk and shop be erect he be also prepare to surround the city with a stone wall when a war with the sabine interrupt he plan the whole thing be so sudden that the enemy pass the anio before the roman army could meet and prevent they : great alarm therefore be feel at rome at first they fight with doubtful success and with great slaughter on both side after this the enemy 's force be lead back into camp and the roman have thus gain time to make preparation for the war afresh tarquin think that the weak point of he army lay specially in the want of cavalry determine to add other century to the ramnens titiens and lucere which romulus have enrol and to leave they distinguish by he own name because romulus have do this after inquiry by augury attus navius a celebrated soothsayer of the day insist that no alteration or new appointment could be make unless the bird have approve of it the king enrage at this and as they say mock at he art say come thou diviner tell I whether what i have in my mind can be do or not when attus have try the matter by divination affirm that it certainly could well then say he i be think that you should cut asunder this whetstone with a razor take it then and perform what thy bird portend can be do thereupon they say that he immediately cut the whetstone in two a statue of attus with he head veil be erect in the comitium close to the step on the left of the senate-house on the spot where the event occur they say also that the whetstone be deposit in the same place that it might remain as a record of that miracle to posterity without doubt so much honor accrue to augury and the college of augur that nothing be subsequently undertake either in peace or war without take the auspices and assembly of the people the summon of army and the most important affair of state be put off whenever the bird do not prove propitious nor do tarquin then make any other alteration in the century of horse except that he double the number of man in each of these division so that the three century consist of one thousand eight hundred knight only those that be add be call the younger but by the same name as the earlier which because they have be double they now call the six century this part of he force be augment a second engagement take place with the sabine but besides that the strength of the roman army have be thus augment a stratagem also be secretly resort to person be send to throw into the river a great quantity of timber that lay on the bank of the anio after it have be first set on fire and the wood be further kindle by the help of the wind and the greater part of it that be place on raft be drive against and sticking in the pile fire the bridge this accident also strike terror into the sabine during the battle and after they be route also impede they flight many after they have escape the enemy perish in the river : they arm float down the tiber to the city and be recognize make the victory know almost before any announcement of it could be make in that action the chief credit rest with the cavalry : they say that be post on the two wing when the center of they own infantry be now be drive back they charge so briskly in flank that they not only check the sabine legion who press hard on those who be retreat but suddenly put they to flight the sabine make for the mountain in disorder flight but only a few reach they for as have be say before most of they be drive by the cavalry into the river tarquin think it advisable to press the enemy hard while in a state of panic have send the booty and the prisoner to rome and pile in a large heap and burn the enemy 's spoil vow as a offering to vulcan proceed to lead he army onward into the sabine territory and though the operation have be unsuccessfully carry out and they could not hope for better success yet because the state of affair do not allow time for deliberation the sabine come out to meet he with a hastily raise army be again route there as the situation have now become almost desperate they sue for peace collatium and all the land round about be take from the sabine and egerius son of the king 's brother be leave there in garrison i learn that the people of collatium be surrender and that the form of the surrender be as follow the king ask they be ye ambassador and deputy send by the people of collatium to surrender yourselve and the people of collatium we be be the people of collatium they own master they be do ye surrender yourselve and the people of collatium they city land water boundary temple utensil and everything sacred or profane belong to they into my power and that of the roman people we do then i receive they when the sabine war be finish tarquin return in triumph to rome after that he make war upon the ancient latin wherein they come on no occasion to a decisive engagement yet by shift he attack to the several town he subdue the whole latin nation corniculum old ficulea camerium crustumerium ameriolum medullium and nomentum town which either belong to the ancient latin or which have revolt to they be take from they upon this peace be conclude work of peace be then commence with even greater spirit than the effort with which he have conduct he war so that the people enjoy no more repose at home than it have already enjoy abroad for he set about surround the city with a stone wall on the side where he have not yet fortify it the beginning of which work have be interrupt by the sabine war and the lower part of the city round the forum and the other valley lie between the hill because they could not easily carry off the water from the flat grounds he drain by means of sewer conduct down a slope into the tiber he also level a open space for a temple of jupiter in the capitol which he have vow to he in the sabine war : as he mind even then forecast the future grandeur of the place he take possession of the site by lay its foundation at that time a prodigy be see in the palace which be marvellous in its result it be related that the head of a boy call servius tullius as he lay asleep blaze with fire in the presence of several spectator : that on a great noise be make at so miraculous a phenomenon the king and queen be awaken : and when one of the servant be bring water to put out the flame that he be keep back by the queen and after the disturbance be quiet that she forbid the boy to be disturbed till he should awaken of he own accord as soon as he awake the flame disappear then tanaquil take she husband apart say : do you see this boy whom bring up in so mean a style be assure that some time hereafter he will be a light to we in we adversity and a protector of we royal house when in distress henceforth let we with all the tenderness we can train up this youth who be destine to prove the source of great glory to we family and state from this time the boy begin to be treat as they own son and instruct in those accomplishment by which man 's mind be rouse to maintain high rank with dignity this be easily do as it be agreeable to the god the young man turn out to be of truly royal disposition : nor when a son-in-law be be seek for tarquin could any of the roman youth be compare to he in any accomplishment : therefore the king betroth he own daughter to he the fact of this high honor be confer upon he from whatever cause forbid we to believe that he be the son of a slave or that he have himself be a slave when young i be rather of the opinion of those who say that on the taking of corniculum the wife of servius tullius who have be the lead man in that city be pregnant when she husband be slay since she be know among the other female prisoner and in consequence of she distinguished rank exempt from servitude by the roman queen be deliver of a child at rome in the house of tarquinius priscus : upon this that both the intimacy between the woman be increase by so great a kindness and that the boy as he have be bring up in the family from he infancy be beloved and respect that he mother 's lot in have fall into the hand of the enemy after the capture of she native city cause he to be think to be the son of a slave about the thirty-eighth year of tarquin 's reign servius tullius enjoy the highest esteem not only of the king but also of the senate and people at this time the two son of ancus though they have before that always consider it the highest indignity that they have be deprive of they father 's crown by the treachery of they guardian that a stranger should be king of rome who not only do not belong to a neighbouring but not even to a italian family now feel they indignation rouse to a still higher pitch at the idea that the crown would not only not revert to they after tarquin but would descend even lower to slave so that in the same state about the hundredth year after romulus descend from a deity and a deity himself have occupy the throne as long as he live servius one bear of a slave would possess it : that it would be the common disgrace both of the roman name and more especially of they family if while there be male issue of king ancus still live the sovereignty of rome should be accessible not only to stranger but even to slave they determine therefore to prevent that disgrace by the sword but since resentment for the injury do to they incense they more against tarquin himself than against servius and the consideration that a king be likely to prove a more severe avenger of the murder if he should survive than a private person and moreover even if servius be put to death it seem likely that he would adopt as he successor on the throne whomsoever else he might have select as he son-in-law for these reason the plot be lay against the king himself two of the most brutal of the shepherd choose for the deed each carry with he the iron tool of husbandman to the use of which he have be accustom by create as great a disturbance as they could in the porch of the palace under pretence of a quarrel attract the attention of all the king 's attendant to themselves then when both appeal to the king and they clamor have reach even the interior of the palace they be summon and proceed before he at first both shout aloud and vie in clamour against each other until be restrain by the lictor and command to speak in turn they at length cease railing : as agree upon one begin to state he case while the king 's attention eagerly direct toward the speaker be divert from the second shepherd the latter raise up he axe bring it down upon the king 's head and leave the weapon in the wound both rush out of the palace when those around have raise up tarquin in a die state the lictor seize the shepherd who be endeavor to escape upon this a uproar ensue and a concourse of people assemble wonder what be the matter tanaquil amid the tumult order the palace to be shut and thrust out all spectator : at the same time she carefully prepare everything necessary for dress the wound as if a hope still remain : at the same time she provide other means of safety in case she hope should prove false have hastily summon servius after she have show he she husband almost at he last gasp hold he right hand she entreat he not to suffer the death of he father-in-law to pass unavenged nor to allow he mother-in-law to be a object of scorn to they enemy servius say she if you be a man the kingdom belong to you not to those who by the hand of other have perpetrate a most shameful deed rouse yourself and follow the guidance of the god who portend that this head of yours would be illustrious by formerly shed a divine blaze around it now let that celestial flame arouse you now awake in earnest we too though foreigner have reign consider who you be not whence you be spring if you own plan be render useless by reason of the suddenness of this event then follow mine when the uproar and violence of the multitude could scarcely be endure tanaquil address the populace from the upper part of the palace -lrb- 37 -rrb- through the window face the new street -lrb- for the royal residence be near the temple of jupiter stator -rrb- she bid they be of good courage that the king be merely stun by the suddenness of the blow that the weapon have not sink deep into he body that he have already come to he sens again that the blood have be wipe off and the wound examine that all the symptom be favourable that she be confident they would see he in person very soon that in the meantime he command the people to obey the order of servius tullius that the latter would administer justice and perform all the other function of the king servius come forth wear the trabea -lrb- 38 -rrb- and attend by lictor and seat himself on the king 's throne decide some case and with respect to other pretend that he would consult the king therefore though tarquin have now expire he death be conceal for several day and servius under pretence of discharge the function of another strengthen he own influence then at length the fact of he death be make public lamentation be raise in the palace servius support by a strong body-guard take possession of the kingdom by the consent of the senate be the first who do so without the order of the people the child of ancus the instrument of they villainy have be by this time catch as soon as it be announce that the king still live and that the power of servius be so great have already go into exile to suessa pometium and now servius begin to strengthen he power not more by public than by private measure and that the child of tarquin might not entertain the same feeling toward himself as the child of ancus have entertain toward tarquin he unite he two daughter in marriage to the young prince the tarquinius lucius and arrun he do not however break through the inevitable decree of fate by human counsel so as to prevent jealousy of the sovereign power create general animosity and treachery even among the member of he own family very opportunely for the immediate preservation of tranquility a war be undertake against the veiente -lrb- for the truce have now expire -rrb- and the other etruscan in that war both the valor and good fortune of tullius be conspicuous and he return to rome after route a large army of the enemy undisputed king whether he test the disposition of the father or the people he then set about a work of peace of the utmost importance : that as numa have be the author of religious institution so posterity might celebrate servius as the founder of all distinction in the state and of the several order by which any difference be perceptible between the degree of rank and fortune for he institute the census -lrb- 39 -rrb- a most salutary measure for a empire destine to become so great accord to which the service of war and peace be to be perform not by every man as formerly but in proportion to he amount of property then he divide the class and century accord to the census and introduce the follow arrangement eminently adapt either for peace or war of those who possess property to the value of a hundred thousand ass -lrb- 40 -rrb- and upward he form eighty century forty of senior -lrb- 41 -rrb- and forty of junior -lrb- 42 -rrb- all these be call the first class the senior to be in readiness to guard the city the junior to carry on war abroad the arm they be order to wear consist of a helmet a round shield greave and a coat of mail all of brass these be for the defense of the body : they weapon of offence be a spear and a sword to this class be add two century of mechanic who be to serve without arm : the duty impose upon they be that of make military engine in time of war the second class include all those whose property vary between seventy-five and a hundred thousand ass and of these senior and junior twenty century be enrol the arm they be order to wear consist of a buckler instead of a shield and except a coat of mail all the rest be the same he decide that the property of the third class should amount to fifty thousand ass : the number of its century be the same and form with the same distinction of age : nor be there any change in they arm only the greave be dispense with in the fourth class the property be twenty-five thousand ass : the same number of century be form they arm be change nothing be give they but a spear and a short javelin the fifth class be larger thirty century be form : these carry sling and stone for throw among they the supernumerary the horn-blower and the trumpeter be distribute into three century this class be rate at eleven thousand ass property lower than this embrace the rest of the citizen and of they one century be make up which be exempt from military service have thus arrange and distribute the infantry he enrol twelve century of knight from among the chief man of the state while romulus have only appoint three century servius form six other under the same name as they have receive at they first institution ten thousand ass be give they out of the public revenue to buy horse and a number of widow assign they who be to contribute two thousand ass yearly for the support of the horse all these burden be take off the poor and lay on the rich then a additional honor be confer upon they : for the suffrage be not now grant promiscuously to all -- a custom establish by romulus and observe by he successor -- to every man with the same privilege and the same right but gradation be establish so that no one might seem exclude from the right of voting and yet the whole power might reside in the chief man of the state for the knight be first call to vote and then the eighty century of the first class consist of the first class of the infantry : if there occur a difference of opinion among they which be seldom the case the practice be that those of the second class should be call and that they seldom descend so low as to come down to the lowest class nor need we be surprise that the present order of thing which now exist after the number of the tribe be increase to thirty-five they number be now double of what it be should not agree as to the number of century of junior and senior with the collective number institute by servius tullius for the city be divide into four district accord to the region and hill which be then inhabit he call these division tribe as i think from the tribute for the method of levy tax ratably accord to the value of property be also introduce by he : nor have these tribe any relation to the number and distribution of the century the census be now complete which he have bring to a speedy close by the terror of a law pass in reference to those who be not rate under threat of imprisonment and death he issue a proclamation that all the roman citizen horse and foot should attend at daybreak in the campus martius each in he century there he review the whole army draw up in century and purify it by the rite call suovetaurilium -lrb- 43 -rrb- and that be call the closing of the lustrum because it be the conclusion of the census eighty thousand citizen be say to have be rate in that survey fabius pictor the most ancient of we historian add that that be the number of those who be capable of bear arm to accommodate that vast population the city also seem to require enlargement he take in two hill the quirinal and viminal then next he enlarged the esquiline and take up he own residence there in order that dignity might be confer upon the place he surround the city with a rampart a moat and a wall : -lrb- 44 -rrb- thus he enlarged the pomerium those who regard only the etymology of the word will have the pomerium to be a space of ground behind the wall : whereas it be rather a space on each side of the wall which the etruscan in building city formerly consecrate by augury within certain limit both within and without in the direction they intend to raise the wall : so that the house might not be erect close to the wall on the inside as people commonly unite they now and also that there might be some space without left free from human occupation this space which be forbid to be till or inhabit the roman call pomerium not so much from its be behind the wall as from the wall be behind it : and in enlarge the boundary of the city these onsecrated limit be always extend as far as the wall be intend to be advance when the population have be increase in consequence of the enlargement of the city and everything have be organize at home to meet the exigency both of peace and war that the acquisition of power might not always depend on mere force of arm he endeavor to extend he empire by policy and at the same time to add some ornament to the city the temple of diana at ephesus be even then in high renown it be report that it have be build by all the state of asia in common when servius in the company of some latin noble with whom he have purposely form tie of hospitality and friendship both in public and private extol in high term such harmony and association of they god by frequently harp upon the same subject he at length prevail so far that the latin state agree to build a temple of diana at rome -lrb- 45 -rrb- in conjunction with the roman people this be a acknowledgment that the headship of affair concern which they have so often dispute in arm be centre in rome a accidental opportunity of recover power by a scheme of he own seem to present itself to one of the sabine though that object appear to have be leave out of consideration by all the latin in consequence of the matter have be so often attempt unsuccessfully by arm a cow of surprising size and beauty be say to have be calve to a certain sabine the head of a family : she horn which be hang up in the porch of the temple of diana remain for many age to bear record to this marvel the thing be regard in the light of a prodigy as indeed it be and the soothsayer declare that sovereignty should reside in that state a citizen of which have sacrifice this heifer to diana this prediction have also reach the ear of the high priest of the temple of diana the sabine as soon as a suitable day for the sacrifice seem to have arrive drive the cow to rome lead she to the temple of diana and set she before the altar there the roman priest strike with the size of the victim so celebrate by fame mindful of the response of the soothsayer thus accost the sabine : what dost thou intend to do stranger say he with impure hand to offer sacrifice to diana why dost not thou first wash thyself in run water the tiber run past at the bottom of the valley the stranger seize with religious awe since he be desirous of everything be do in due form that the event might correspond with the prediction forthwith go down to the tiber in the meantime the roman priest sacrifice the cow to diana give great satisfaction to the king and to the whole state servius though he have now acquire a indisputable right to the kingdom by long possession yet as he hear that expression be sometimes throw out by young tarquin to the effect that he occupy the throne without the consent of the people have first secure the good-will of the people by divide among they man by man the land take from they enemy he venture to propose the question to they whether they choose and order that he should be king and be declare king with greater unanimity than any other of he predecessor and yet even this circumstance do not lessen tarquin 's hope of obtain the throne nay because he have observe that the matter of the distribution of land to the people be against the will of the father he think that a opportunity be now present to he of arraign servius before the father with greater violence and of increase he own influence in the senate be himself a hot-tempered youth while he wife tullium rouse he restless temper at home for the royal house of the roman king also exhibit a example of tragic guilt so that through they disgust of king liberty come more speedily and the rule of this king which be attain through crime be the last this lucius tarquinius -lrb- whether he be the son or grandson of tarquinius priscus be not clear : follow the greater number of authority however i should feel inclined to pronounce he he son -rrb- have a brother arrun tarquinius a youth of a mild disposition to these two as have be already state the two tullia daughter of the king have be marry they also themselves be of widely different character it have come to pass through the good fortune i believe of the roman people that two violent disposition should not be unite in marriage in order that the reign of servius might last longer and the constitution of the state be firmly establish the haughty spirit of tullium be chagrin that there be no predisposition in she husband either to ambition or daring direct all she regard to the other tarquinius he she admire he she declare to be a man and spring from royal blood she express she contempt for she sister because have a man for she husband she lack that spirit of daring that a woman ought to possess similarity of disposition soon draw they together as wickedness be in general most congenial to wickedness but the beginning of the general confusion originate with the woman accustom to the secret conversation of the husband of another there be no abusive language that she do not use about she husband to he brother about she sister to she sister 's husband assert that it would have be better for herself to remain unmarried and he single than that she should be unite with one who be no fit mate for she so that she life have to be pass in utter inactivity by reason of the cowardice of another if the god have grant she the husband she deserve she would soon have see the crown in possession of she own house which she now see in possession of she father she soon fill the young man with she own daring lucius tarquinius and the younger tullium when the pair have by almost simultaneous murder make they house vacant for new nuptials be unite in marriage servius rather offer no opposition than actually approve then indeed the old age of tullius begin to be every day more endanger he throne more imperil for now the woman from one crime direct she thought to another and allow she husband no rest either by night or by day that they past crime might not prove unprofitable say that what she want be not one whose wife she might be only in name or one with whom she might live a inactive life of slavery : what she want be one who would consider himself worthy of the throne who would remember that he be the son of tarquinius priscus who would rather have a kingdom than hope for it if you to whom i consider myself marry be such a one i greet you both as husband and king but if not we condition have be change so far for the worse in that in you crime be associate with cowardice why do you not gird yourself to the task you need not like you father from corinth or tarquinius struggle for a kingdom in a foreign land you household and country 's god the statue of you father the royal palace and the kingly throne in that palace and the tarquinian name elect and call you king or if you have too little spirit for this why do you disappoint the state why suffer yourself to be look up to as a prince get hence to tarquinius or corinth sink back again to you original stock more like you brother than you father by chide he with these and other word she urge on the young man : nor could she rest herself at the thought that though tanaquil a woman of foreign birth have be able to conceive and carry out so vast a project as to bestow two throne in succession on she husband and then on she son-in-law she spring from royal blood have no decisive influence in bestow and take away a kingdom tarquinius drive on by the blind passion of the woman begin to go round and solicit the support of the patrician especially those of the younger family : -lrb- 46 -rrb- he remind they of he father 's kindness and claim a return for it entice the young man by present increase he influence everywhere both by make magnificent promise on he own part as well as by accusation against the king at length as soon as the time seem convenient for carry out he purpose he rush into the forum accompany by a band of armed man then while all be strike with dismay seat himself on the throne before the senate-house he order the father to be summon to the senate-house by the crier to attend king tarquinius they assemble immediately some have be already prepare for this other through fear lest it should prove dangerous to they not to have come astounded at such a strange and unheard-of event and consider that the reign of servius be now at a end then tarquinius begin he invective with he immediate ancestor : that a slave the son of a slave after the shameful death of he father without a interregnum be adopt as on former occasion without any election be hold without the suffrage of the people or the sanction of the father he have take possession of the kingdom by the gift of a woman that so bear so create king a strong supporter of the most degraded class to which he himself belong through a hatred of the high station of other he have deprive the lead man of the state of they land and divide it among the very lowest that he have lay all the burden which be formerly share by all alike on the chief member of the community that he have institute the census in order that the fortune of the wealthier citizen might be conspicuous in order to excite envy and ready to hand that out of it he might bestow largess on the most needy whenever he please servius arouse by the alarming announcement have come upon the scene during this harangue immediately shout with a loud voice from the porch of the senate-house : what mean this tarquin by what audacity hast thou dare to summon the father while i be still alive or to sit on my throne when the other haughtily reply that he a king 's son be occupy the throne of he father a much fitter successor to the throne than a slave that he have insult he master full long enough by shuffling insolence a shout arise from the partisan of both the people rush into the senate-house and it be evident that whoever come off victor would gain the throne then tarquin force by actual necessity to proceed to extremity have a decide advantage both in year and strength seize servius by the waist and have carry he out of the senate-house hurl he down the step to the bottom he then return to the senate house to assemble the senate the king 's officer and attendant take to flight the king himself almost lifeless -lrb- when he be return home with he royal retinue frighten to death and have reach the top of the cyprian street -rrb- be slay by those who have be send by tarquin and have overtake he in he flight as the act be not inconsistent with the rest of she atrocious conduct it be believe to have be do by tullium 's advice anyhow as be generally admit drive into the forum in she chariot unabashed by the crowd of man present she call she husband out of the senate-house and be the first to greet he king and when be bid by he to withdraw from such a tumult she be return home and have reach the top of the cyprian street where diana 's chapel lately stand as she be turn on the right to the urian hill in order to ride up to the esquiline the driver stop terrify and draw in he rein and point out to he mistress the body of the murder servius lie on the ground on this occasion a revolting and inhuman crime be say to have be commit and the place bear record of it they call it the wicked street where tullium frantic and urge on by the avenge fury of she sister and husband be say to have drive she chariot over she father 's body and to have carry a portion of the blood of she murder father on she blood-stained chariot herself also defile and sprinkle with it to she own and she husband 's household god through whose vengeance result correspond with the evil beginning of the reign be soon destine to follow servius tullius reign forty-four year in such a manner that it be no easy task even for a good and moderate successor to compete with he however this also have prove a additional source of renown to he that together with he perish all just and legitimate reign this same authority so mild and so moderate because it be vest in one man some say that he nevertheless have intend to resign have not the wickedness of he family interfere with he as he be form plan for the liberation of he country after this period lucius tarquinius begin to reign whose act procure he the surname of proud for he the son-in-law refuse he father-in-law burial allege that even romulus be not bury after death he put to death the principal senator whom he suspect of have favor the cause of servius then conscious that the precedent of obtain the crown by evil means might be borrow from he and employ against himself he surround he person with a body-guard of armed man for he have no claim to the kingdom except force as be one who reign without either the order of the people or the sanction of the senate to this be add the fact that as he repose no hope in the affection of he citizen he have to secure he kingdom by terror and in order to inspire a greater number with this he carry out the investigation of capital case solely by himself without assessor and under that pretext have it in he power to put to death banish or fine not only those who be suspect or hate but those also from whom he could expect to gain nothing else but plunder the number of the father more particularly be in this manner diminish he determine to elect none into the senate in they place that the order might become more contemptible owe to this very reduction in number and that it might feel the less resentment at no business be transact by it for he be the first of the king who violate the custom derive from he predecessor of consult the senate on all matter and administer the business of the state by take counsel with he friend alone war peace treaty alliance all these he contract and dissolve with whomsoever he please without the sanction of the people and senate entirely on he own responsibility the nation of the latin he be particularly anxious to attach to he so that by foreign influence also he might be more secure among he own subject and he contract tie not only of hospitality but also of marriage with they lead man on octavius mamilius of tusculum who be by far the most eminent of those who bear the latin name be descend if we believe tradition from ulyss and the goddess circe he bestow he daughter in marriage and by this match attach to himself many of he kinsman and friend the influence of tarquin among the chief man of the latin be now considerable he issue a order that they should assemble on a certain day at the grove of ferentina -lrb- 47 -rrb- say that there be matter of common interest about which he wish to confer with they they assemble in great number at daybreak tarquinius himself keep the day indeed but do not arrive until shortly before sunset many matter be there discuss in the meeting throughout the day in various conversation turnus herdonius of aricium inveigh violently against the absent tarquin say that it be no wonder the surname of proud be give he at rome for so they now call he secretly and in whisper but still generally could anything show more haughtiness than this insolent mockery of the entire latin nation after they chief have be summon so great a distance from home he who have proclaim the meeting do not attend assuredly they patience be be try in order that if they submit to the yoke he might crush they when at he mercy for who could fail to see that he be aim at sovereignty over the latin this sovereignty if he own countryman have do well in have intrust it to he or if it have be intrust and not seize on by murder the latin also ought to intrust to he -lrb- and yet not even so inasmuch as he be a foreigner -rrb- but if he own subject be dissatisfy with he -lrb- see that they be butcher one after another drive into exile and deprive of they property -rrb- what better prospects be hold out to the latin if they listen to he they would depart thence each to he own home and take no more notice of the day of meeting than he who have proclaim it when this man mutinous and full of daring and one who have obtain influence at home by such method be press these and other observation to the same effect tarquin appear on the scene this put a end to he harangue all turn away from he to salute tarquin who on silence be proclaim be advise by those next he to make some excuse for have come so late say that he have be choose arbitrator between a father and a son : that from he anxiety to reconcile they he have delay : and because that duty have take up that day that on the morrow he would carry out what he have determine they say that he do not make even that observation unrebuked by turnus who declare that no controversy could be more quickly decide than one between father and son and that it could be settle in a few word -- unless the son submit to the father he would be punish the arician withdraw from the meeting utter these reproach against the roman king tarquin feel the matter much more sorely than he seem to immediately set about plan the death of turnus in order to inspire the latin with the same terror as that with which he have crush the spirit of he own subject at home : and because he could not be put to death openly by virtue of he authority he accomplish the ruin of this innocent man by bring a false charge against he by means of some arician of the opposite party he bribe a servant of turnus with gold to allow a great number of sword to be secretly bring into he lodging when these preparation have be complete in the course of a single night tarquin have summon the chief of the latin to he a little before day as if alarm by some strange occurrence say that he delay of yesterday which have be cause as it be by some providential care of the god have be the means of preservation to himself and to they that he have be tell that destruction be be plot by turnus for he and the chief of the latin people that he alone might obtain the government of the latin that he would have attack they yesterday at the meeting that the attempt have be defer because the person who summon the meeting be absent who be the chief object of he attack that that be the reason of the abuse heap upon he during he absence because he have disappoint he hope by delay that he have no doubt that if the truth be tell he he would come attend by a band of conspirator at break of day when the assembly meet ready prepared and armed that it be report that a great number of sword have be convey to he house whether that be true or not could be know immediately he request they to accompany he thence to the house of turnus both the daring temper of turnus and he harangue of the previous day and the delay of tarquin render the matter suspicious because it seem possible that the murder might have be put off in consequence of the latter they start with mind incline indeed to believe yet determine to consider everything else false unless the sword be find when they arrive there turnus be arouse from sleep and surround by guard : the slave who from affection to they master be prepare to use force be secure and the sword which have be conceal draw out from all corner of the lodging then indeed there seem no doubt about the matter : turnus be load with chain and forthwith a meeting of the latin be summon amid great confusion there on the sword be exhibit in the midst such violent hatred arise against he that without be allow a defense he be put to death in a unusual manner he be throw into the basin of the spring of ferentina a hurdle be place over he and stone be heap up in it he be drowned tarquin then recall the latin to the meeting and have applaud they for have inflict well-merited punishment on turnus as one convict of murder by he attempt to bring about a change of government speak as follow : that he could indeed proceed by a long-established right because since all the latin be spring from alba they be comprehend in that treaty by which date from the time of tullus the entire alban nation with its colony have pass under the dominion of rome however for the sake of the interest of all party he think rather that that treaty should be renew and that the latin should rather share in the enjoyment of the prosperity of the roman people than be constantly either apprehend or suffer the demolition of they town and the devastation of they land which they have formerly suffer in the reign of ancus and afterward in the reign of he own father the latin be easily persuade though in that treaty the advantage lay on the side of rome : however they both see that the chief of the latin nation side with and support the king and turnus be a warning example still fresh in they recollection of the danger that threaten each individually if he should make any opposition thus the treaty be renew and notice be give to the young man of the latin that accord to the treaty they should attend in considerable number in arm on a certain day at the grove of ferentina and when they assemble from all the state accord to the edict of the roman king in order that they should have neither a general of they own nor a separate command nor standard of they own he form mixed company of latin and roman so as out of a pair of company to make single company and out of single company to make a pair : and when the company have thus be double he appoint centurion over they nor be tarquin though a tyrannical prince in time of peace a incompetent general in war nay he would have equal he predecessor in that art have not he degeneracy in other way likewise detract from he merit in this respect he first begin the war against the volscus which be to last two hundred year after he time and take suessa pometium from they by storm and when by the sale of the spoil he have realize forty talent of silver he conceive the idea of build a temple to jupiter on such a magnificent scale that it should be worthy of the king of god and man of the roman empire and of the dignity of the place itself : for the building of this temple he set apart the money realize by the sale of the spoil soon after a war claim he attention which prove more protracted than he have expect in which have in vain attempt to storm gabius -lrb- 48 -rrb- a city in the neighborhood when after suffer a repulse from the wall he be deprive also of all hope of take it by siege he assail it by fraud and stratagem a method by no means natural to the roman for when as if the war have be abandon he pretend to be busily engage in lay the foundation of the temple and with other work in the city sextus the youngest of he three son accord to a preconcerted arrangement flee to gabii complain of the unbearable cruelty of he father toward himself : that he tyranny have now shift from other against he own family and that he be also uneasy at the number of he own child and intend to bring about the same desolation in he own house as he have do in the senate in order that he might leave behind he no issue no heir to he kingdom that for he own part as he have escape from the midst of the sword and weapon of he father he be persuade he could find no safety anywhere save among the enemy of lucius tarquinius : for -- let they make no mistake -- the war which it be now pretend have be abandon still threaten they and he would attack they when off they guard on a favourable opportunity but if there be no refuge for suppliant among they he would traverse all latium and would apply next to the volscian aequan and hernican until he should come to people who know how to protect child from the impious and cruel persecution of parent that perhaps he would even find some eagerness to take up arm and wage war against this most tyrannical king and he equally savage subject as he seem likely to go further enraged as he be if they pay he no regard he be kindly receive by the gabian they bid he not be surprise if one at last behave in the same manner toward he child as he have do toward he subject and ally -- that he would ultimately vent he rage on himself if other object fail he -- that he own come be very acceptable to they and they believe that in a short time it would come to pass that by he aid the war would be transfer from the gate of gabius up to the very wall of rome upon this he be admit into they public council in which while with regard to other matter he declare himself willing to submit to the judgment of the elder of gabius who be better acquaint with they yet he every now and again advise they to renew the war claim for himself superior knowledge in this on the ground of be well acquaint with the strength of both nation and also because he know that the king 's pride which even he own child have be unable to endure have become decidedly hateful to he subject as he thus by degree stir up the noble of the gabian to renew the war and himself accompany the most active of they youth on plunder party and expedition and unreasonable credit be increasingly give to all he word and action frame as they be with the object of deceive he be at last chosen general-in-chief in the war in the course of this war when -- the people be still ignorant of what be go on -- trifling skirmish with the roman take place in which the gabian generally have the advantage then all the gabian from the highest to the lowest be eager to believe that sextus tarquinius have be send to they as they general by the favor of the god by expose himself equally with the soldier to fatigue and danger and by he generosity in bestow the plunder he become so love by the soldier that he father tarquin have not greater power at rome than he son at gabius accordingly when he see he have sufficient strength collect to support he in any undertaking he send one of he confidant to he father at rome to inquire what he wish he to do see the god have grant he to be all-powerful at gabius to this courier no answer by word of mouth be give because i suppose he appear of questionable fidelity the king go into a garden of the palace as if in deep thought follow by he son 's messenger walk there for some time without utter a word he be say to have strike off the head of the tallest poppy with he staff -lrb- 49 -rrb- the messenger weary with ask and wait for a answer return to gabius apparently without have accomplish he object and tell what he have himself say and see add that tarquin either through passion aversion to he or he innate pride have not utter a single word as soon as it be clear to sextus what he father wish and what conduct he enjoin by those intimation without word he put to death the most eminent man of the city some by accuse they before the people as well as other who from they own personal unpopularity be liable to attack many be execute publicly and some in whose case impeachment be likely to prove less plausible be secretly assassinate some who wish to go into voluntary exile be allow to do so other be banish and they estate as well as the estate of those who be put to death publicly divide in they absence out of these largess and plunder be distribute and by the sweet of private gain the sense of public calamity become extinguish till the state of gabius destitute of counsel and assistance surrender itself without a struggle into the power of the roman king tarquin have thus gain possession of gabius make peace with the nation of the aequus and renew the treaty with the etruscan he next turn he attention to the affair of the city the chief of these be that of leave behind he the temple of jupiter on the tarpeian mount as a monument of he name and reign to remind posterity that of two tarquinius both king the father have vow the son complete it -lrb- 50 -rrb- further that the open space to the exclusion of all other form of worship might be entirely appropriate to jupiter and he temple which be to be erect upon it he resolve to cancel the inauguration of the small temple and chapel several of which have be first vow by king tatius in the crisis of the battle against romulus and afterward consecrate and dedicate by he at the very outset of the foundation of this work it be say that the god exert they divinity to declare the future greatness of so mighty a empire for though the bird declare for the unhallowing of all the other chapel they do not declare themselves in favor of it in the case of that of terminus -lrb- 51 -rrb- this omen and augury be take to import that the fact of terminus not change he residence and that he be the only one of the god who be not call out of the consecrated bound devote to he worship be a presage of the lasting stability of the state in general this be accept as a omen of its lasting character there follow another prodigy portend the greatness of the empire it be report that the head of a man with the face entire be find by the workman when digging the foundation of the temple the sight of this phenomenon by no doubtful indication portend that this temple should be the seat of empire and the capital of the world and so declare the soothsayer both those who be in the city and those whom they have summon from etrurium to consult on this subject the king 's mind be thereby encourage to greater expense in consequence of which the spoil of pometium which have be destine to complete the work scarcely suffice for lay the foundation on this account i be more inclined to believe fabius -lrb- not to mention he be the more ancient authority -rrb- that there be only forty talent than piso who say that forty thousand pound of silver by weight be set apart for that purpose a sum of money neither to be expect from the spoil of any one city in those time and one that would more than suffice for the foundation of any building even the magnificent building of the present day tarquin intent upon the completion of the temple have send for workman from all part of etrurium employ on it not only the public money but also workman from the people and when this labor in itself no inconsiderable one be add to they military service still the people murmur less at build the temple of the god with they own hand than at be transfer as they afterward be to other work which while less dignified require considerably greater toil such be the erection of bench in the circus and conduct underground the principal sewer the receptacle of all the filth of the city two work the like of which even modern splendor have scarcely be able to produce -lrb- 52 -rrb- after the people have be employ in these work because he both consider that such a number of inhabitant be a burden to the city where there be no employment for they and further be anxious that the frontier of the empire should be more extensively occupy by send colonist he send colonist to signium -lrb- 53 -rrb- and circeius -lrb- 54 -rrb- to serve as defensive outpost hereafter to the city on land and sea while he be thus employ a frightful prodigy appear to he a serpent glide out of a wooden pillar after cause dismay and flight in the palace not so much strike the king 's heart with sudden terror as it fill he with anxious solicitude accordingly since etruscan soothsayer be only employ for public prodigy terrify at this so to say private apparition he determine to send to the oracle of delphus the most celebrated in the world and not venture to intrust the response of the oracle to any other person he despatch he two son to greece through land unknown at that time and yet more unknown sea titus and arrun be the two who set out they be accompany by lucius junius brutus the son of tarquinium the king 's sister a youth of a entirely different cast of mind from that of which he have assume the disguise he have hear that the chief man of the city among they he own brother have be put to death by he uncle resolve to leave nothing in regard to he ability that might be dread by the king nor anything in he fortune that might be coveted and thus to be secure in the contempt in which he be hold see that there be but little protection in justice therefore have designedly fashion himself to the semblance of foolishness and allow himself and he whole estate to become the prey of the king he do not refuse to take even the surname of brutus -lrb- 55 -rrb- that under the cloak of this surname the genius that be to be the future liberator of the roman people lie conceal might bide its opportunity he in reality be bring to delphi by the tarquinius rather as a object of ridicule than as a companion be say to have bear with he as a offering to apollo a golden rod inclose in a staff of cornel-wood hollow out for the purpose a mystical emblem of he own mind when they arrive there and have execute they father 's commission the young man 's mind be seize with the desire of inquire to which of they the sovereignty of rome should fall they say that the reply be utter from the inmost recess of the cave young man whichever of you shall first kiss he mother shall enjoy the sovereign power at rome the tarquinius order the matter to be keep secret with the utmost care that sextus who have be leave behind at rome might be ignorant of the response of the oracle and have no share in the kingdom they then cast lot among themselves to decide which of they should first kiss he mother after they have return to rome brutus think that the pythian response have another meaning as if he have stumble and fall touch the ground with he lip she be forsooth the common mother of all mankind after this they return to rome where preparation be be make with the greatest vigor for a war against the rutulian the rutulian a very wealthy nation consider the country and age in which they live be at that time in possession of ardea -lrb- 56 -rrb- they wealth be itself the actual occasion of the war : for the roman king whose resource have be drain by the magnificence of he public work be desirous of enrich himself and also of soothing the mind of he subject by a large present of booty as they independently of the other instance of he tyranny be incense against he government because they feel indignant that they have be keep so long employ by the king as mechanic and in labor only fit for slave a attempt be make to see if ardea could be take at the first assault when that prove unsuccessful the enemy begin to be distressed by a blockade and by siege-works in the standing camp as usually happen when a war be tedious rather than severe furlough be easily obtain more so by the officer however than the common soldier the young prince also sometimes spend they leisure hour in feast and mutual entertainment one day as they be drink in the tent of sextus tarquinius where collatinus tarquinius the son of egerius be also at supper they fall to talk about they wife every one commend he own extravagantly : a dispute thereupon arise collatinus say there be no occasion for word that it might be know in a few hour how far he wife lucretium excel all the rest if then add he we have any youthful vigor why should we not mount we horse and in person examine the behavior of we wife let that be the surest proof to every one which shall meet he eye on the unexpected arrival of the husband they be heat with wine come on then cry all they immediately gallop to rome where they arrive when darkness be begin to fall from thence they proceed to collatium -lrb- 57 -rrb- where they find lucretium not after the manner of the king 's daughter-in-law whom they have see spend they time in luxurious banqueting with they companion but although the night be far advance employ at she wool sit in the middle of the house in the midst of she maid who be work around she the honor of the contest regard the woman rest with lucretium she husband on he arrival and the tarquinius be kindly receive the husband proud of he victory give the young prince a polite invitation there a evil desire of violate lucretium by force seize sextus tarquinius both she beauty and she proved chastity urge he on then after this youthful frolic of the night they return to the camp after a interval of a few day sextus tarquinius without the knowledge of collatinus come to collatium with one attendant only : there he be make welcome by they as they have no suspicion of he design and have be conduct after supper into the guest chamber burning with passion when all around seem sufficiently secure and all fast asleep he come to the bedside of lucretium as she lay asleep with a draw sword and with he left hand press down the woman 's breast say : be silent lucretium i be sextus tarquinius i have a sword in my hand you shall die if you utter a word when the woman awake terrify from sleep see there be no help and that impend death be nigh at hand then tarquin declare he passion entreat mixed threat with entreaty try all mean to influence the woman 's mind when he see she be resolve and uninfluenced even by the fear of death to the fear of death he add the fear of dishonor declare that he would lay a murder slave naked by she side when dead so that it should be say that she have be slay in base adultery when by the terror of this disgrace he lust -lrb- as it be victorious -rrb- have overcome she inflexible chastity and tarquin have depart exult in have triumph over a woman 's honor by force lucretium in melancholy distress at so dreadful a misfortune despatch one and the same messenger both to she father at rome and to she husband at ardea bidding they come each with a trusty friend that they must do so and use despatch for a monstrous deed have be work spurius lucretius come accompany by publius valerius the son of volesus collatinus with lucius junius brutus in company with whom as he be return to rome he happen to be meet by he wife 's messenger they find lucretium sit in she chamber in sorrowful dejection on the arrival of she friend the tear burst from she eye and on she husband inquire whether all be well by no means she reply for how can it be well with a woman who have lose she honor the trace of another man be on you bed collatinus but the body only have be violate the mind be guiltless death shall be my witness but give I you right hand and you word of honor that the adulterer shall not come off unpunished it be sextus tarquinius who a enemy last night in the guise of a guest have bear hence by force of arm a triumph destructive to I and one that will prove so to himself also if you be man all give they word in succession they attempt to console she grieve in heart as she be by turn the guilt of the act from she constrain as she have be by force upon the perpetrator of the crime declare that it be the mind sin not the body and that where there be no intention there be no guilt it be for you to see say she what be due to he as for I though i acquit myself of guilt i do not discharge myself from punishment nor shall any woman survive she dishonor by plead the example of lucretium she plunge a knife which she keep conceal beneath she garment into she heart and fall forward on the wound drop down expire she husband and father shriek aloud while they be overwhelm with grief brutus draw the knife out of the wound and hold it up before he reek with blood say : by this blood most pure before the outrage of a prince i swear and i call you o god to witness my oath that i will henceforth pursue lucius tarquinius superbus he wicked wife and all they child with fire sword and all other violent means in my power nor will i ever suffer they or any other to reign at rome then he give the knife to collatinus and after he to lucretius and valerius who be amaze at such a extraordinary occurrence and could not understand the newly develop character of brutus however they all take the oath as they be direct and they sorrow be completely change to wrath follow the lead of brutus who from that time cease not to call upon they to abolish the regal power they carry forth the body of lucretium from she house and convey it to the forum where they cause a number of person to assemble as generally happen by reason of the unheard-of and atrocious nature of a extraordinary occurrence they complain each for himself of the royal villainy and violence both the grief of the father affect they and also brutus who reprove they tear and unavailing complaint and advise they to take up arm as become man and roman against those who dare to treat they like enemy all the most spirited youth voluntarily present themselves in arm the rest of the young man follow also from thence after a adequate garrison have be leave at the gate at collatium and sentinel appoint to prevent any one give intelligence of the disturbance to the royal party the rest set out for rome in arm under the conduct of brutus when they arrive there the armed multitude cause panic and confusion wherever they go again when they see the principal man of the state place themselves at they head they think that whatever it might be it be not without good reason nor do the heinousness of the event excite less violent emotion at rome than it have do at collatium : accordingly they run from all part of the city into the forum and as soon as they come thither the public crier summon they to attend the tribune of the celere -lrb- 58 -rrb- with which office brutus happen to be at the time invest there a harangue be deliver by he by no means of the style and character which have be counterfeit by he up to that day concern the violence and lust of sextus tarquinius the horrid violation of lucretium and she lamentable death the bereavement of tricipitinus -lrb- 59 -rrb- in whose eye the cause of he daughter 's death be more shameful and deplorable than that death itself to this be add the haughty insolence of the king himself and the suffering and toil of the people bury in the earth in the task of cleanse ditch and sewer : he declare that roman the conqueror of all the surrounding state instead of warrior have become labourer and stone-cutter the unnatural murder of king servius tullius be recall and the fact of he daughter have drive over the body of she father in she impious chariot and the god who avenge parent be invoke by he by state these and i believe other fact still more shocking which though by no means easy to be detail by writer the then heinous state of thing suggest he so work upon the already incensed multitude that they deprive the king of he authority and order the banishment of lucius tarquinius with he wife and child he himself have select and arm some of the younger man who give in they name as volunteer set out for the camp at ardea to rouse the army against the king : the command in the city he leave to lucretius who have be already appoint prefect of the city by the king during this tumult tullium flee from she house both man and woman cursing she wherever she go and invoke upon she the wrath of the fury the avenger of parent news of these transaction have reach the camp when the king alarm at this sudden revolution be proceed to rome to quell the disturbance brutus -- for he have have notice of he approach -- turn aside to avoid meeting he and much about the same time brutus and tarquinius arrive by different route the one at ardea the other at rome the gate be shut against tarquin and sentence of banishment declare against he the camp welcome with great joy the deliverer of the city and the king 's son be expel two of

originate with priscus : that servius tullius have reign next that tarquinius superbus have not even in spite of the interval that have elapse give up all thought of the kingdom as be the property of another which it really be but think to regain it by crime and violence as if it be the heirloom of he family that after the expulsion of superbus the government be inthe hand of collatinus : that the

be prevail on by the general feeling of the state the consul apprehensive that hereafter the same lot might befall he when he term of office have expire as well as loss of property and other

human be from whom one could obtain what one want whether the deed might be a act of justice or of wrong that there be room for favor and good office that he could be angry and forgive that he know the difference between a friend and a enemy that the law be a deaf inexorable thing more beneficial and advantageous for the poor than for the rich that they allow no relaxation or indulgence if one

the mind of the young noble to those by whom they proposal be favourably receive they give letter from the tarquin and confer with they about admit the royal family into the city secretly by night the matter be first intrust to the brother vitellius and aquilius a sister of the vitellius be marry to brutus the consul and the issue of that marriage be the grown-up son titus and tiberius they also be

the senate which be in favor of the property be restore the ambassador make use of this as a pretext for linger in the city and the time which they have obtain from the consul to procure conveyance in which to remove the effect of the royal family they spend entirely in consultation with the conspirator and by persistent entreaty succeed in get letter give to they for the tarquin otherwise how could they feel sure that the representation make by the ambassador on matter of such importance be not false the letter give as a intended pledge of they sincerity cause the plot to be discover : for when the day before the ambassador set out to the tarquin they have sup by chance at the house of the vitellius and the conspirator have there discourse much together in private as be natural concern they revolutionary design one of the slave who have already observe what be on foot overhear they conversation he wait however for the opportunity when the letter should be give to the ambassador the

and quash the whole affair without any disturbance particular care be take of the letter to prevent they be lose or steal the traitor be immediately throw into prison : some doubt be entertain concern the treatment of the ambassador and though they conduct seem to justify they be consider as enemy the law of nation nevertheless prevail the consideration of the restoration of the king 's effect for which the senate have formerly vote be lay anew before they the father overcome by indignation expressly forbid either they restoration or confiscation they be give to the people to be rifle that have

not only with grief at the annihilation of such great hope but also with hatred and resentment when he see that the way be block against stratagem consider that war ought to be openly resort to go round as a suppliant to the city of etrurium implore above all the veientine and tarquinian not to suffer he a man spring from themselves of the same stock to perish before they eye a exile and in want together with he grown-up son after they have possess a kingdom recently so flourish that other have be invite to rome from foreign land to succeed to the throne that he a king while engage in extend the roman empire by arm have be drive out by he nearest relative by a villainous conspiracy that they have seize and divide he kingdom in portion among themselves because no one individual among they be deem sufficiently deserving of it : and have give up he effect to the people to pillage that no one might be without a share in the guilt that he be desirous of recover he country and he

have lose in war would be recover he name and relationship influence the people of tarquinius for it seem a high honor that they countryman should reign at rome accordingly the army of these two state follow tarquin to aid in the recovery of he kingdom and to take vengeance upon the roman in war when they enter roman territory the consul march to meet the enemy valerius lead the infantry in a square battalion : brutus march in front with the cavalry to reconnoitre in like manner the enemy 's horse form the van of the army : arrun tarquinius the king 's son be in command : the king himself

the temple of jupiter on the capitol have not yet be dedicate the conul valerius and horatius cast lot which should dedicate it the duty fall by lot to horatius publicolum depart to conduct the war against the veientine the friend of valerius be more annoyed than the circumstance demand that the dedication of so celebrate a temple be give to horatius have endeavor by every means to prevent it when all other attempt have be try and fail at the moment when the consul be hold the door-post during he offering of prayer to the god they suddenly announce to he the startling intelligence that he son be dead and that while he family be polluted by death he could not dedicate the temple whether he do not believe that it be true or whether he possess such great strength of mind be neither hand down for certain nor be it easy to decide on receive the news hold the door-post without turn off he attention in any other way from the business he be engage complete the form of prayer and dedicate the temple such be the transaction at home and abroad during the first year after the expulsion of the king after this publius valerius for the second time and titus lucretius be elect consul by this time the tarquin have flee to lar porsina king of clusium there mingle advice with entreaty they now beseech he not to suffer they who be descend from the etruscan and of the same stock and name to live in exile and poverty now advise he also not to let the rise practice of expel king pass unpunished liberty in itself have charm enough and unless king defend they throne with as much vigor as the people strive for liberty the highest be put on a level with the lowest there would be nothing exalt in state nothing to be distinguish above the rest that the end of regal government the most beautiful institution both among god and man be close at hand porsina think it a great honor to the tuscan both that there should be a king at rome and that one belong to the etruscan nation march toward rome with a hostile army never before on any other occasion do such terror seize the senate so powerful be the state of clusium -lrb- 9 -rrb- at that time and so great the renown of porsina nor do they dread they enemy only but even they own citizen lest the common people of rome smitten with fear should by receive the tarquin into the city accept peace even at the price of slavery many concession be therefore grant to the people by the senate during that period by way of conciliate they they attention in the first place be direct to the market and person be send some to the country of the volscian other to cumae to buy up corn the privilege of sell salt also be withdraw from private individual because it be sell at a exorbitant price while all the expense fall upon the state : -lrb- 10 -rrb- and the people be free from duty and tax inasmuch as the rich since they be in a position to bear the burden should contribute they the poor they say pay tax enough if they bring up they child this indulgence on the part of the father accordingly keep the state so unite during they subsequent adversity in time of siege and famine that the lowest as much as the highest abhor the name of king nor do any single individual afterward gain such popularity by intriguing practice as the whole body of the senate at that time by they excellent government on the approach of the enemy they all withdraw for protection from the country into the city and protect the city itself with military garrison some part seem secure by the wall other by the tiber between the sublician -lrb- 11 -rrb- bridge well-nigh afford a passage to the enemy have it not be for one man horatius cocle : in he the protect spirit of rome on that day find a defense he happen to be post on guard at the bridge : and when he see the janiculum take by a sudden assault and the enemy pour down from thence at full speed and he own party in confusion abandon they arm and rank seize hold of they one by one standing in they way and appeal to the faith of god and man he declare that they flight would avail they nothing if they desert they post if they cross the bridge and leave it behind they there would soon be greater number of the enemy in the palatium and capitol than in the janiculum therefore he advise and charge they to break down the bridge by sword by fire or by any violent means whatsoever that he himself would receive the attack of the enemy as far as resistance could be offer by the person of one man he then stride to the front entrance of the bridge and be easily distinguish among those whose back be see as they give way before the battle he strike the enemy with amazement by he surprising boldness as he face round in arm to engage the foe hand to hand two however a sense of shame keep back with he spurius larcius and titus herminius both man of high birth and renown for they gallant exploit with they he for a short time stand the first storm of danger and the severest brunt of the battle afterward as those who be cut down the bridge call upon they to retire and only a small portion of it be leave he oblige they also to withdraw to a place of safety then cast he stern eye threateningly upon all the noble of the etruscan he now challenge they singly now reproach they all as the slave of haughty tyrant who unmindful of they own freedom come to attack that of other for a considerable time they hesitate look round one upon another wait to begin the fight a feeling of shame then stir the army and raise a shout they hurl they weapon from all side on they single adversary and when they have all stick in the shield he hold before he and he with no less obstinacy keep possession of the bridge with firm step they now begin to strive to thrust he down from it by they unite attack when the crash of the fall bridge and at the same time the shout raise by the roman for joy at have complete they task check they assault with sudden consternation then cocle say father tiberinus holy one i pray thee receive these arm and this thy soldier in thy favor stream so in full armor just as he be he leapedinto the tiber and amid shower of dart that fall upon he swim across unharmed to he comrade have dare a deed which be likely to obtain more fame than belief with posterity -lrb- 12 -rrb- the state show itself grateful toward such distinguished valor a statue of he be erect in the comitium and as much land be give to he as he could draw a furrow round in one day with a plough the zeal of private individual also be conspicuous in the midst of public honor for notwithstanding the great scarcity each person contribute something to he in proportion to he private means deprive himself of he own means of support porsina repulse in he first attempt have change he plan to a siege of the city and a blockade and pitch he camp in the plain and on the bank of the tiber place a garrison in the janiculum then send for boat from all part both to guard the river so as to prevent any provision be convey up stream to rome and also that he soldier might get across to plunder in different place as opportunity offer in a short time he so harass all the country round rome that not only be everything else convey out of the country but even the cattle be drive into the city and nobody venture to drive they without the gate this liberty of action be grant to the etruscan not more from fear than from design : for the consul valerius eager for a opportunity of fall unaware upon a number of they together in loose order careless of take vengeance in trifling matter reserve himself as a serious avenger for more important occasion accordingly in order to draw out the pillager he order a large body of he man to drive out they cattle the next day by the esquiline gate which be farthest from the enemy think that they would get intelligence of it because during the blockade and scarcity of provision some of the slave would turn traitor and desert and in fact they do learn by the information of a deserter and party far more numerous than usual cross the river in the hope of seize all the booty at once then publius valerius command titus herminius with a small force to lie in ambush at the second milestone on the road to gabius and spurius larcius with a party of light-armed youth to post himself at the colline gate while the enemy be pass by and then to throw himself in they way to cut off they return to the river the other consul titus lucretius march out of the naevian gate with some company of soldier while valerius himself lead some choose cohort down from the colan mount these be the first who be see by the enemy herminius when he perceive the alarm rush from he ambush and fall upon the rear of the etruscan who have turn against valerius the shout be return on the right and leave from the colline gate on the one side and the naevian on the other thus the plunderer be put to the sword between both be neither they match in strength for fight and all the way be block up to prevent escape : this put a end to the disorderly raid of the etruscan the blockade however be carry on none the less and corn be both scarce and very dear porsina still entertain the hope that by continue the blockade he would be able to reduce the city when gaius mucius a young noble who consider it a disgrace that the roman people who even when in a state of slavery while under the king have never be confine within they wall during any war or blockade by any enemy should now when a free people be blockade by these very etruscans whose army they have often route -- and think that such disgrace ought to be avenge by some great and daring deed at first design on he own responsibility to make he way into the enemy 's camp then be afraid that if he go without the permission of the consul and unknown to all he might perhaps be seize by the roman guard and bring back as a deserter since the circumstance of the city at the time render such a charge credible he approach the senate father say he i desire to cross the tiber and enter the enemy 's camp if i may be able not as a plunderer nor as a avenger to exact retribution for they devastation : a greater deed be in my mind if the god assist the senate approve he set out with a dagger conceal under he garment when he reach the camp he station himself where the crowd be thickest near the king 's tribunal there as the soldier happen to be receive they pay and the king 's secretary sit by he similarly attire be busily engage and generally address by the soldier he kill the secretary against whom chance blindly direct the blow instead of the king be afraid to ask which of the two be porsina lest by display he ignorance of the king he should disclose who he himself be as he be move off in the direction where with he bloody dagger he have make a way for himself through the dismayed multitude the crowd run up on hear the noise and he be immediately seize and bring back by the king 's guard : be set before the king 's tribunal even then amid the perilous fortune that threaten he more capable of inspiring dread than of feel it i be say he a roman citizen man call I gaius mucius a enemy i wish to slay a enemy nor have i less courage to suffer death than i have to inflict it both to do and to suffer bravely be a roman 's part nor have i alone harbour such feeling toward you there follow after I a long succession of aspirant to the same honor therefore if you choose prepare yourself for this peril to be in danger of you life from hour to hour : to find the sword and the enemy at the very entrance of you tent : such be the war we the youth of rome declare against you dread not a army in the field nor a battle you will have to contend alone and with each of we one by one when the king furious with rage and at the same time terrify at the danger threateningly command fire to be kindle about he if he do not speedily disclose the plot at which in he threat he have darkly hint mucius say see here that you may understand of how little account the body be to those who have great glory in view and immediately thrust he right hand into the fire that be light for sacrifice when he allow it to burn as if he spirit be quite insensible to any feeling of pain the king well-nigh astounded at this surprising sight leap from he seat and command the young man to be remove from the altar depart say he thou who hast act more like a enemy toward thyself than toward I i would bid thee go on and prosper in thy valor if that valor be on the side of my country i now dismiss thee unharmed and unhurt exempt from the right of war then mucius as if in return for the kindness say : since bravery be hold in honor with you that you may obtain from I by you kindness that which you could not obtain by threat know that we be three hundred the chief of the roman youth who have conspire to attack you in this manner the lot fall upon I first the rest will be with you each in he turn accord to the fortune that shall befall I who draw the first lot until fortune on some favourable opportunity shall have deliver you into they hand mucius to whom the surname of scaevolum -lrb- 13 -rrb- be afterward give from the loss of he right hand be let go and ambassador from porsina follow he to rome the danger of the first attempt in which nothing have protect he but the mistake of he secret assailant and the thought of the risk of life he would have to run so often in proportion to the number of survive conspirator that remain make so strong a impression upon he that of he own accord he offer term of peace to the roman in these term the restoration of the tarquin to the throne be propose and discuss without success rather because he feel he could not refuse that to the tarquin than from ignorance that it would be refuse he by the roman in regard to the restoration of territory to the veientine he request be grant and the obligation of give hostage if they wish the garrison to be withdraw from the janiculum be extort from the roman peace be conclude on these term porsina lead he troops down from the janiculum and withdraw from roman territory the father bestow upon gaius mucius in reward for he valor some land on the other side of the tiber which be afterward call the mucian meadow by this honor pay to valor woman also be rouse to deed that bring glory to the state among other a young woman name claelium one of the hostage escape she keeper and as the camp of the etruscan have be pitch not far from the bank of the tiber swim over the river amid the dart of the enemy at the head of a band of maiden and bring they all back in safety to they relation at rome when news of this be bring to the king at first furious with rage he send deputy to rome to demand the hostage claelium say that he do not set great store by the rest : afterward he feeling be change to admiration he say that this deed surpass those of man like cocle and mucius and further declare that as he would consider the treaty break if the hostage be not deliver up so if she be give up he would send she back unharmed and unhurt to she friend both side keep faith : the roman restore they pledge of peace accord to treaty : and with the etruscan king valor find not only security but also honor and after praise the maiden he promise to give she as a present half the hostage allow she to choose whom she please when they have all be lead forth she be say to have pick out those below the age of puberty a choice which both reflect honor upon she maiden delicacy and be one likely to be approve of by consent of the hostage themselves -- that those who be of such a age as be most expose to injury should above all other be deliver from the enemy peace be renew the roman reward this instance of bravery uncommon in a woman with a uncommon kind of honor : a equestrian statue which represent a maiden sit on horseback be erect at the top of the via sacra -lrb- 14 -rrb- the custom hand down from the ancient and which have continue down to we time among other usage at public sale that of sell the goods of king porsina be inconsistent with this account of so peaceful a departure of the etruscan king from the city the origin of this custom must either have arise during the war and not be abandon in time of peace or it must have grow from a milder beginning than the form of expression seem on the face of it to indicate of sell the goods as if take from a enemy of the account hand down the most probable be that porsina when retire from the janiculum make a present to the roman of he camp rich with store of provision convey from the neighbouring fertile field of etrurium as the city be then exhaust owe to the long siege : that then to prevent its contents be plunder as if it belong to a enemy when the people be admit they be sell and call the goods of porsina the expression rather convey the idea of a thankworthy gift than a auction of the king 's property see that this never even come into the power of the roman people porsina have abandon the war against the roman that he army might not seem to have be lead into those part to no purpose send he son arrun with part of he force to besiege aricia the unexpected occurrence at first terrify the arician : afterward aid which have be send for both from the people of latium and from cumæ -lrb- 15 -rrb- inspire such hope that they venture to try the issue of a pitched battle at the beginning of the battle the etruscan attack so furiously that they route the arician at the first onset but the cuman cohort employ stratagem against force move off a little to one side and when the enemy be carry beyond they in loose array they wheel round and attack they in the rear by this mean the etruscan when on the point of victory be hem in and cut to piece a very small number of they have lose they general and have no nearer refuge come to rome without they arm in the plight and guise of suppliant there they be kindly receive and distribute in different lodgings when they wound have be attend to some with affection for they host and for the city cause many other to remain at rome : a quarter be assign they to dwell in which have ever since be call the tuscan street -lrb- 16 -rrb- spurius lucretius and publius valerius publicolum be next elect consul in that year ambassador come from porsina for the last time to discuss the restoration of tarquin to the throne and when answer have be give they that the senate would send deputy to the king the most distinguish of that order be forthwith despatch to explain that it be not because the answer could not have be give in a few word -- that the royal family would not be receive -- that select member of the senate have be depute to he rather than a answer give to he ambassador at rome but in order that all mention of the matter might be put a end to forever and that they mind might not be disturbed amid so many mutual act of kindness on both side by he ask what be adverse to the liberty of the roman people and by they refuse he -lrb- unless they be willing to promote they own destruction -rrb- whom they would willingly refuse nothing that the roman people be not now under a kingly government but in the enjoyment of freedom and be accordingly resolve to open they gate to enemy sooner than to king that it be the wish of all that the end of they city 's freedom might also be the end of the city itself wherefore if he wish rome to be safe they entreat he to suffer it to be free the king overcome by feeling of respect reply : since that be you firm and fix resolve i will neither annoy you by importunity by urge the same request too often to no purpose nor will i disappoint the tarquin by hold out hope of aid which it be not in my power to give they whether they have need of peace or of war let they go hence and seek another place of exile that nothing may hinder the peace between we to kindly word he add deed still more friendly : he deliver up the remainder of the hostage and restore to they the land of the veientine which have be take from they by the treaty conclude at the janiculum tarquin now that all hope of return be cut off go into exile to tusculum -lrb- 17 -rrb- to he son-in-law octavius mamilius thus a lasting peace be conclude between porsina and the roman the next consul be marcus valerius and publius postumius during that year war be carry on successfully against the sabine the consul receive the honor of a triumph upon this the sabine make preparation for war on a larger scale to make head against they and to prevent any sudden danger arise from tusculum from which quarter war though not openly declare be suspect publius valerius be create consul a fourth time and titus lucretius a second time a disturbance that arise among the sabine between the advocate of war and of peace transfer considerable strength from they to the roman for attius clausus who be afterward call appius claudius at rome be himself a advocate of peace when hard press by the agitator for war and be no match for the party flee from regillum to rome accompany by a great number of dependent the rights of citizenship and land on the other side of the anio be bestow on they this settlement be call the old claudian tribe and be subsequently increase by the addition of new tribesman who keep arrive from that district appius be choose into the senate be soon after advance to the rank of the highest in that order the consul enter the territory of the sabine with a hostile army and when both by lay waste they country and afterward by defeat they in battle they have so weaken the power of the enemy that for a long time there be no reason to dread the renewal of the war in that quarter they return to rome in triumph the following year agrippa menenius and publius postumius be consul publius valerius by universal consent the ablest man in rome in the art both of peace and war die cover with glory but in such straitened private circumstance that there be not enough to defray the expense of a public funeral : one be give he at the public charge the matron mourn for he as they have do for brutus the same year two latin colony pometium and cora -lrb- 18 -rrb- revolt to the auruncan -lrb- 19 -rrb- war be commence against the auruncan and after a large army which boldly meet the consul as they be enter they frontier have be defeat all the operation of the auruncan war be concentrate at pometium nor after the battle be over do they refrain from slaughter any more than when it be go on : the number of the slay be considerably greater than that of the prisoner and the latter they put to death indiscriminately nor do the wrath of war spare even the hostage three hundred in number whom they have receive this year also the consul celebrate a triumph at rome the succeed consul opiter verginius and spurius cassius first endeavor to take pometium by storm and afterward by means of mantlet -lrb- 20 -rrb- and other work but the auruncan stir up against they more by a irreconcilable hatred than induce by any hope of success or by a favourable opportunity have sally forth more of they arm with light torch than sword fill all place with fire and slaughter have fire the mantlet slay and wound many of the enemy they almost succeed in slaying one of the consul who have be throw from he horse and severely wound : which of they it be authority do not mention upon this the roman return to the city unsuccessful : the consul be take back with many more wound with doubtful hope of he recovery after a short interval sufficient for attend to they wound and recruit they army they attack pometium with greater fury and increase strength when after the mantlet and the other military work have be repair the soldier be on the point of mount the wall the town surrender yet though the town have surrender the auruncan be treat with no less cruelty than if it have be take by assault : the chief man be behead : the rest who be colonist be sell by auction the town be raze and the land sell the consul obtain a triumph more from have violently gratify they -lrb- 21 -rrb- resentment than in consequence of the importance of the war thus conclude in the following year postumus cominius and titus larcius be consul in that year during the celebration of the game at rome as some courtesan be be carry off by some of the sabine youth in wanton frolic a crowd assemble a quarrel ensue and almost a battle : and in consequence of this trifling occurrence the whole affair seem to point to a renewal of hostility which inspire even more apprehension than a latin war they fear be further increase because it be know for certain that thirty different state have already enter into a confederacy against they at the instigation of octavius mamilius while the state be trouble during the expectation of such important event the idea of nominate a dictator be mention for the first time but in what year or who the consul be in whom confidence be not repose because they belong to the party of the tarquin -- for that also be report -- or who be elect dictator for the first time be not satisfactorily establish among the oldest authority however i find that titus larcius be appoint the first dictator and spurius cassius master of the horse they choose man of consular dignity : so the law that be pass for the election of a dictator ordain for this reason i be more inclined to believe that larcius who be of consular rank be attach to the consul as they director and superior rather than manius valerius the son of marcus and grandson of volesus who have not vet be consul moreover have they intend a dictator to be choose from that family under any circumstance they would much rather have choose he father marcus valerius a man of consular rank and of approve merit on the first creation of the dictator at rome when they see the axis carry before he great awe come upon the people -lrb- 22 -rrb- so that they become more attentive to obey order for neither as be the case under the consul who possess equal power could the assistance of one of they be invoke nor be there any appeal nor any chance of redress but in attentive submission the creation of a dictator at rome also terrify the sabine and the more so because they think he be create on they account accordingly they send ambassador to treat concern peace to these when they earnestly entreat the dictator and senate to pardon a youthful offence the answer be give that the young man might be forgive but not the old see that they be continually stir up one war after another nevertheless they continue to treat about peace which would have be grant if the sabine have bring themselves to make good the expense incur during the war as be demand war be proclaim a truce however with the tacit consent of both party preserve peace throughout the year servius sulpicius and manius tullius be consul the next year : nothing worth mention happen titus aebutius and gaius vetusius succeed in they consulship fidea be besiege crustumerium take and præneste -lrb- 23 -rrb- revolt from the latin to the roman nor be the latin war which have now be foment for several year any longer defer aulus postumius the dictator and titus aebutius he master of the horse set out with a numerous army of horse and foot meet the enemy 's force at the lake regillus -lrb- 24 -rrb- in the territory of tusculum and because it be rumor that the tarquin be in the army of the latin they rage could not be restrain so that they immediately come to a engagement accordingly the battle be considerably more severe and fierce than other for the general be present not only to direct matter by they instruction but expose they own person they meet in combat and there be hardly one of the principal officer of either army who come off unwounded except the roman dictator as postumius be encourage he man in the first line and draw they up in order tarquinius superbus though now advance in year and enfeebled urge on he horse to attack he : and be wound in the side he be carry off by a party of he man to a place of safety in like manner on the other wing aebutius master of the horse have charge octavius mamilius nor be he approach unobserved by the etruscan general who in like manner spur he horse against he and such be they impetuosity as they advance with lance couch that aebutius be pierce through the arm and mamilius run through the breast the latin receive the latter into they second line aebutius as he be unable to wield he lance with he wounded arm retire from the battle the latin general no way discourage by he wound stir up the fight : and because he see that he own man be dishearten send for a company of roman exile command by the son of lucius tarquinius this body inasmuch as they fight with greater fury owe to the loss of they country and the seizure of they estate for a while revive the battle when the roman be now begin to give ground in that quarter marcus valerius brother of publicolum have observe young tarquin boldly parade himself at the head of he exile fire besides with the renown of he house that the family which have gain glory by have expel the king might also have the glory of destroy they put spur to he horse and with he javelin couch make toward tarquin tarquin retreat before he infuriate foe to a battalion of he own man as valerius ride rashly into the line of the exile one of they attack he and run he sideways through the body and as the horse be in no way impede by the wound of he rider the roman sink to the ground expire with he arm fall over he body postumius the dictator see the fall of so distinguish a man and that the exile be advance boldly at a run and he own man dishearten and give ground give the signal to he own cohort a choose body of man which he keep for the defense of he person to treat every roman soldier whom they see flee from the battle as a enemy upon this the roman in fear of the danger on both side turn from flight and attack the enemy and the battle be restore the dictator 's cohort then for the first time engage in the fight and with person and courage unimpaired fall on the wearied exile and cut they to piece there another engagement take place between the lead officer the latin general on see the cohort of the exile almost surround by the roman dictator hurry up some company of reserve to the front titus herminius a lieutenant-general see they advance in a body and recognize mamilius distinguish among they by he armor and dress encounter the leader of the enemy with violence so much greater than the master of the horse have show a little before that at one thrust he run he through the side and slew he while strip the body of he enemy he himself receive a wound with a javelin and though bring back to the camp victorious die while it be be dress then the dictator hurry up to the cavalry entreat they as the infantry be tire out to dismount and take up the fight they obey he order dismount fly to the front and take the place of the first line cover themselves with they target the infantry immediately recover they courage when they see the young noble sustain a share of the danger with they the mode of fight be now the same for all then at length the latin be beat back and they line dishearten give way the horse be then bring up to the cavalry that they might pursue the enemy : the infantry likewise follow thereupon the dictator disregard nothing that hold out hope of divine or human aid be say to have vow a temple to castor and to have promise reward to the first and second of the soldier who should enter the enemy 's camp such be the ardor of the roman that they take the camp with the same impetuosity wherewith they have route the enemy in the field such be the engagement at the lake regillus the dictator and master of the horse return to the city in triumph for the next three year there be neither settle peace nor open war the consul be q cloelius and t larcius they be succeed by a sempronius and m minucius during they consulship a temple be dedicate to saturn and the festival of the saturnalia institute the next consul be a postumius and t verginius i find in some author this year give as the date of the battle at lake regillus and that a postumius lay down he consulship because the fidelity of he colleague be suspect on which a dictator be appoint so many error as to date occur owe to the order in which the consul succeed be variously give that the remoteness in time of both the event and the authority make it impossible to determine either which consul succeed which or in what year any particular event occur ap claudius and p servilius be the next consul this year be memorable for the news of tarquin 's death he death take place at cuma whither he have retire to seek the protection of the tyrant aristodemus after the power of the latin be break the news be receive with delight by both senate and pleb but the elation of the patrician be carry to excess up to that time they have treat the common with the utmost deference now they leader begin to practice injustice upon they the same year a fresh batch of colonist be send to complete the number at signium a colony found by king tarquin the number of tribe at rome be increase to twenty-one the temple of mercury be dedicate on may 15 the relation with the volscian during the latin war be neither friendly nor openly hostile the volscian have collect a force which they be intend to send to the aid of the latin have not the dictator forestall they by the rapidity of he movement a rapidity due to he anxiety to avoid a battle with the combined army to punish they the consul lead the legion into the volscian country this unexpected movement paralyse the volscian who be not expect retribution for what have be only a intention unable to offer resistance they give as hostage three hundred child belong to they nobility draw from cora and pometium the legion accordingly be march back without fight relieve from the immediate danger the volscian soon fall back on they old policy and after form a armed alliance with the hernican make secret preparation for war they also despatch envoy through the length and breadth of latium to induce that nation to join they but after they defeat at lake regillus the latin be so incense against every one who advocate a resumption of hostility that they do not even spare the volscian envoy who be arrest and conduct to rome there they be hand over to the consul and evidence be produce show that the volscian and hernican be prepare for war with rome when the matter be bring before the senate they be so gratify by the action of the latin that they send back six thousand prisoner who have be sell into slavery and also refer to the new magistrate the question of a treaty which they have hitherto persistently refuse to consider the latin congratulate themselves upon the course they have adopt and the advocate of peace be in high honor they send a golden crown as a gift to the capitoline jupiter the deputation who bring the gift be accompany by a large number of the release prisoner who visit the house where they have work as slave to thank they former master for the kindness and consideration show they in they misfortune and to form tie of hospitality with they at no previous period have the latin nation be on more friendly term both politically and personally with the roman government but a war with the volscian be imminent and the state be tear with internal dissension the patrician and the plebeian be bitterly hostile to one another owe mainly to the desperate condition of the debtor they loudly complain that whilst fight in the field for liberty and empire they be oppress and enslave by they fellow-citizen at home they freedom be more secure in war than in peace safer amongst the enemy than amongst they own people the discontent which be become of itself continually more embittered be still further aggravate by the striking suffering of a individual a man advance in year rush into the forum with the token of he utter misery upon he he clothes be cover with filth he personal appearance still more pitiable pale and emaciate in addition a long beard and hair give a wild look to he countenance notwithstanding he wretched appearance however he be recognize and people say that he have be a centurion and compassionate he recount other distinction that he have gain in war : he himself exhibit scar on he breast in front which bear witness to honorable battle in several place when they repeatedly inquire the reason of he plight and wretched appearance a crowd have now gather round he almost like a regular assembly he say that while serve in the sabine war because he have not only be deprive of the produce of he land in consequence of the depredation of the enemy but he residence have also be burn down all he effect pillage he cattle drive off and a tax impose on he at a time when it press most hardly upon he he have get into debt : that this debt increase by exorbitant interest have strip he first of he father 's and grandfather 's farm then of all he other property lastly that like a waste sickness it have reach he person : that he have be drag by he creditor not into servitude but into a house of correction and a place of torture he then show he back disfigure with the mark of recent scourging at this sight and these word a great uproar arise the tumult now no longer confine itself to the forum but spread everywhere through the entire city the nexus -lrb- 25 -rrb- both those who be imprison and those who be now at liberty hurry into the street from all quarter and implore the protection of the quirite nowhere be there lack of volunteer to join the disturbance they run in crowd through all the street from all point to the forum with loud shout such of the senator as happen to be in the forum fall in with this mob at great peril to themselves and it might not have refrain from actual violence have not the consul publius servilius and appius claudius hastily interfere to quell the disturbance the multitude however turn toward they and show they chain and other mark of wretchedness say that they deserve all this -lrb- 26 -rrb- mention each of they in reproachful term the military service perform by himself by one in one place by another in another they call upon they with menace rather than entreaty to assemble the senate and stand round the senate-house in a body determine themselves to be witness and director of the public resolve very few of the senator whom chance have throw in the way be get together by the consul fear keep the rest away not only from the senate-house but even from the forum and no business could be transact owe to they small attendance then indeed the people begin to think they be be trick and put off : and that such of the senator as absented themselves do so not through accident or fear but with the express purpose of obstruct business : that the consul themselves be shuffling that they misery be without doubt hold up to ridicule matter have now almost come to such a pass that not even the majesty of the consul could restrain the violence of the people wherefore uncertain whether they would incur greater danger by stay at home or venture abroad they at length come into the senate but though the house be now by this time full not only be the senator unable to agree but even the consul themselves appius a man of violent temperament think the matter ought to be settle by the authority of the consul and that if one or two be seize the rest would keep quiet servilius more inclined to moderate remedy think that while they mind be in this state of excitement they could be bent with greater ease and safety than they could be break meanwhile a alarm of a more serious nature present itself some latin horse come full speed to rome with the alarming news that the volscian be march with a hostile army to besiege the city this announcement -- so completely have discord split the state into two -- affect the senator and people in a far different manner the people exult with joy and say that the god be come to take vengeance on the tyranny of the patrician they encourage one another not to give in they name -lrb- 27 -rrb- declare that it be better that all should perish together than that they should perish alone let the patrician serve as soldier let the patrician take up arm so that those who reap the advantage of war should also undergo its danger but the senate deject and confound by the double alarm they feel inspire both by they own countryman and by the enemy entreat the consul servilius whose disposition be more inclined to favor the people that he would extricate the commonwealth beset as it be with so great terror then the consul have dismiss the senate come forward into the assembly there he declare that the senate be solicitous that the interest of the people should be consult : but that alarm for the safety of the whole commonwealth have interrupt they deliberation regard that portion of the state which though indeed the largest portion be yet only a portion : nor could they see that the enemy be almost at the gate allow anything to take precedence of the war : nor even though there should be some respite be it either to the credit of the people not to have take up arm in defense of they country unless they first receive pay nor consistent with the dignity of the senator to have adopt measure of relief for the distressed fortune of they countryman through fear rather than afterward of they own free will he then further give he speech the stamp of sincerity by a edict by which he ordain that no one should detain a roman citizen either in chain or in prison so that he would thereby be deprive of the opportunity of enrol he name under the consul and that no one should either take possession of or sell the goods of any soldier while on service or detain he child or grandchild in custody for debt on the publication of this edict both the debtor who be present immediately give in they name and crowd of person hasten from all quarter of the city from private house as they creditor have no right to detain they person run together into the forum to take the military oath these make up a considerable body of man nor do any other exhibit more conspicuous bravery or activity during the volscian war the consul lead out he force against the enemy and pitch he camp at a little distance from they the next night the volscian rely on the dissension among the roman make a attempt on they camp to see if there be any chance of desertion or treachery during the night the sentinel on guard perceive they : the army be call up and the signal be give they run to arm thus the attempt of the volscian be frustrate the remainder of the night be give up to repose on both side the next morning at daybreak the volscian have fill the trench attack the rampart and already the fortification be be demolish on every side when the consul after have delay a little while for the purpose of test the feeling of the soldier although all from every quarter and before all the debtor be cry out for he to give the signal at length when they great eagerness become unmistakable give the signal for sally forth and let out the soldiery impatient for the fight at the very first onset the enemy be route the fugitive be harass in the rear as far as the infantry be able to follow they : the cavalry drive then in consternation up to they camp in a short time the legion have be draw around it the camp itself be take and plunder since panic have drive the volscian even from thence also on the next day the legion be lead to suessa pometium whither the enemy have retreat in a few day the town be take and after be take be give up for plunder whereby the need of the soldier be somewhat relieve the consul lead back he victorious army to rome with the greatest renown to himself on he departure for rome he be meet by the deputy of the ecetran a tribe of the volscian who be alarm for the safety of they state after the capture of pometium by a decree of the senate peace be grant they but they be deprive of they land immediately after this the sabine also frighten the roman : for it be rather a alarm than a war news be bring into the city during the night that a sabine army have advance as far as the river anio plunder the country : that the country house there be be pillage and set fire to indiscriminately aulus postumius who have be dictator in the latin war be immediately send thither with all the cavalry force the consul servilius follow he with a pick body of infantry the cavalry cut off most of the straggler nor do the sabine legion make any resistance against the battalion of infantry when it come up with they tire both by they march and nightly raid surfeit with eating and drinking in the country house a great number of they have scarcely sufficient strength to flee thus the sabine war be hear of and finish in a single night on the follow day when all be sanguine that peace have be secure in every quarter ambassador from the auruncan present themselves before the senate threaten to declare war unless the troops be withdraw from the volscian territory the army of the auruncan have set out from home at the same time as the ambassador and the report that this army have be see not far from aricia throw the roman into such a state of confusion that neither could the senate be consult in regular form nor could the roman while themselves take up arm give a pacific answer to those who be advance to attack they they march to aricia in hostile array engage with the auruncan not far from that town and in one battle the war be end after the defeat of the auruncan the people of rome victorious in so many war within a few day be look to the consul to fulfill he promise and to the senate to keep they word when appius both from he natural pride and in order to undermine the credit of he colleague issue a decree concern borrow money in the harshest possible term from this time both those who have be formerly in confinement be deliver up to they creditor and other also be take into custody whenever this happen to any soldier he appeal to the other consul a crowd gather about servilius : they throw he promise in he tooth severally upbraid he with they service in war and the scar they have receive they call upon he either to lay the matter before the senate or as consul to assist he fellow-citizen as commander he soldier these remonstrance affect the consul but the situation of affair oblige he to act in a shuffling manner : so completely have not only he colleague but the whole of the patrician party enthusiastically take up the opposite cause and thus by play a middle part he neither escape the odium of the people nor gain the favor of the senator the patrician look upon he as want in energy and a popularity-hunting consul the people as deceitful : and it soon become evident that he have become as unpopular as appius himself a dispute have arise between the consul as to which of they should dedicate the temple of mercury the senate refer the matter from themselves to the people and ordain that to whichever of they the task of dedication should be intrust by order of the people he should preside over the market establish a guild of merchant -lrb- 28 -rrb- and perform the ceremony in presence of the pontifex maximus the people intrust the dedication of the temple to marcus laetorius a centurion of the firstrank which as would be clear to all be do not so muchout of respect to a person on whom a office above he rank have be confer as to affront the consul upon this one of the consul particularly and the senator be highly incensed : however the people have gain fresh courage and proceed in quite a different manner to what they have at first intend for when they despair of redress from the consul and senate whenever they see a debtor lead into court they rush together from all quarter neither could the decree of the consul be hear distinctly for the noise and shout nor when he have pronounce the decree do any one obey it violence be the order of the day and apprehension and danger in regard to personal liberty be entirely transfer from the debtor to the creditor who be individually maltreat by the crowd before the very eye of the consul in addition the dread of the sabine war spread and when a levy be decree nobody give in he name : appius be enraged and bitterly inveigh against the self-seeking conduct of he colleague in that he by the inactivity he display to win the favor of the people be betray the republic and besides not have enforce justice in the matter of debt likewise neglect even to hold a levy in obedience to the decree of the senate yet he declare that the commonwealth be not entirely desert nor the consular authority altogether degrade that he alone and unaided would vindicate both he own dignity and that of the senator when day by day the mob embolden by license stand round he he command a note ringleader of the seditious outbreak to be arrest he as he be be drag off by the lictor appeal to the people nor would the consul have allow the appeal because there be no doubt regard the decision of the people have not he obstinacy be with difficulty overcome rather by the advice and influence of the lead man than by the clamor of the people with such a superabundance of courage be he endow to support the weight of public odium the evil gain ground daily not only by open clamor but what be far more dangerous by secession and by secret conference at length the consul so odious to the common resign office servilius like by neither party appius highly esteem by the senator then aulus verginius and titus vetusius enter on the consulship upon this the common uncertain what sort of consul they be likely to have hold nightly meeting some of they upon the esquiline and other upon the aventine lest when assemble in the forum they should be throw into confusion by be oblige to adopt hasty resolution and proceed inconsiderately and at hap-hazard the consul judge this proceed to be of dangerous tendency as it really be lay the matter before the senate but when it be lay before they they could not get they to consult upon it regularly it be receive with a uproar on all side and by the indignant shout of the father at the thought that the consul throw on the senate the odium for that which should have be carry out by consular authority assuredly if there be real magistrate in the republic there would have be no council at rome but a public one as it be the republic be divide and split into a thousand senate-house and assembly some meeting be hold on the esquiline other on the aventine one man like appius claudius -- for such a one be of more value than a consul -- would have disperse those private meeting in a moment when the consul thus rebuke ask they what it be that they desire they to do declare that they would carry it out with as much energy and vigor as the senator wish the latter issue a decree that they should push on the levy as briskly as possible declare that the people have become insolent from want of employment when the senate have be dismiss the consul assemble the tribunal and summon the younger man by name when none of they answer to he name the people crowd round after the manner of a general assembly declare that the people could no longer be impose on : that they should never enlist one single soldier unless the engagement make publicly with the people be fulfil : that liberty must be restore to each before arm should be give that so they might fight for they country and fellow-citizen and not for lord and master the consul understand the order of the senate but see none of those who talk so big within the wall of the senate-house present themselves to share the odium they would incur in fact a desperate contest with the common seem at hand therefore before they have recourse to extremity they think it advisable to consult the senate a second time then indeed all the younger senator almost fly to the chair of the consul command they to resign the consulate and lay aside a office which they lack the courage to support both plan have be sufficiently make proof of the consul at length say : conscript father that you may not say that you have not be forewarn know that a great disturbance be at hand we demand that those who accuse we most loudly of cowardice shall assist we when hold the levy we will proceed accord to the resolution of the most intrepid among you since it so please you return to they tribunal they purposely command one of the leader of the disturbance who be in sight to be summon by name when he stand without say a word and a number of man stand round he in a ring to prevent violence be offer the consul send a lictor to seize he but he be thrust back by the people then indeed those of the father who attend the consul exclaim against it as a intolerable insult hurry down from the tribunal to assist the lictor but when the violence of the people be turn from the lictor who have merely be prevent from arrest the man against the father the riot be quell by the interposition of consul during which however without the use of stone or weapon there be more noise and angry word than actual injury inflict the senate summon in a tumultuous manner be consult in a manner still more tumultuous those who have be beat demand a inquiry and the most violent of they attempt to carry they point not so much by vote as by clamor and bustle at length when they passion have subside and the consul reproach they that there be no more presence of mind in the senate than in the forum the matter begin to be consider in order three different opinion be hold publius verginius be against extend relief to all he vote that they should consider only those who rely on the promise of publius servilius the consul have serve in the war against the volscian auruncan and sabine titus larcius be of opinion that it be not now a fitting time for service only to be reward : that all the people be overwhelm with debt and that a stop could not be put to the evil unless measure be adopt for the benefit of all : nay further if the condition of different party be different discord would thereby rather be inflamed than heal appius claudius be naturally of a hard disposition and further infuriate by the hatred of the common on the one hand and the praise of the senator on the other insist that such frequent riot be cause not by distress but by too much freedom : that the people be rather insolent than violent : that this mischief in fact take its rise from the right of appeal since threat not authority be all that remain to the consul while permission be give to appeal to those who be accomplice in the crime come add he let we create a dictator from whom there lie no appeal and this madness which have set everything ablaze will immediately subside then let I see the man who will dare to strike a lictor when he shall know that that person whose authority he have insult have sole and absolute power to flog and behead he to many the opinion of appius appear as in fact it be harsh and severe on the other hand the proposal of verginius and larcius appear injurious from the precedent they establish : that of larcius they consider especially so as one that would destroy all credit the advice of verginius be reckon to be most moderate and a happy medium between the other two but through party spirit and man 's regard for they private interest which always have and always will stand in the way of public council appius prevail and be himself near be create dictator -- a step which would certainly have alienate the common at a most dangerous juncture when the volscian the aequan and the sabine all happen to be in arm at the same time but the consul and elder of the senate take care that this command in its own nature uncontrollable should be intrust to a man of mild disposition they elect marcus valerius son of volesus dictator the people though they see that this magistrate be appoint against themselves yet as they possess the right of appeal by he brother 's law have nothing harsh or tyrannical to fear from that family afterward a edict publish by the dictator which be almost identical in term with that of the consul servilius further inspirit they but think reliance could be more safely place both in the man and in he authority -lrb- 29 -rrb- they abandon the struggle and give in they name ten legion be raise a larger army than have ever be raise before -lrb- 30 -rrb- of these each of the consul have three legion assign he the dictator command four the war could not now be any longer defer the aequan have invade the territory of the latin : the deputy of the latter beg the senate either to send they assistance or to allow they to arm themselves for the purpose of defend they own frontier it seem safer that the latin should be defend without they be arm than to allow they to handle arm again vetusius the consul be send to they assistance : thereby a stop be put to the raid the aequan retire from the plain and depend more on the advantage of position than on they arm secure themselves on the height of the mountain the other consul have set out against the volscian lest he in like manner might waste time -lrb- 31 -rrb- provoke the enemy to pitch they camp nearer and to risk a regular engagement by ravage they land both army stand ready to advance in front of they line in hostile array in a plain between the two camp the volscian have considerably the advantage in number : accordingly they enter into battle in loose order and in a spirit of contempt the roman consul neither advance he force nor allow the enemy 's shout to be return but order he man to stand with they spear fix in the ground and whenever the enemy come to a hand-to-hand encounter to draw they sword and attack they with all they force to carry on the fight the volscian weary with run and shout attack the roman who appear to they paralyzed with fear but when they perceive the vigorous resistance that be make and see the sword glitter before they eye just as if they have fall into a ambuscade they turn and flee in confusion nor have they sufficient strength even to flee as they have enter into action at full speed the roman on the other hand as they have quietly stand they ground at the beginning of the action with physical vigor unimpaired easily overtake the weary foe take they camp by assault and have drive they from it pursue they to velitrae -lrb- 32 -rrb- into which city conquer and conqueror together rush in one body by the promiscuous slaughter of all rank which there ensue more blood be shed than in the battle itself quarter be give to a few who throw down they arm and surrender while these operation be go on among the volscian the dictator route the sabine among whom by far the most important operation of the war be carry on put they to flight and strip they of they camp by a charge of cavalry he have throw the center of the enemy 's line into confusion in the part where owe to the wing be extend too widely they have not properly strengthen they line with company in the center the infantry fall upon they in they confusion : by one and the same charge the camp be take and the war conclude there be no other battle in those time more memorable than this since the action at the lake regillus the dictator ride into the city in triumph besides the usual honor a place in the circus be assign to he and he descendant to see the public game : a curule chair -lrb- 33 -rrb- be fix in that place the territory of velitra be take from the conquer volscian : colonist be send from rome to velitrae and a colony lead out thither some considerable time afterward a engagement with the aequan take place but against the wish of the consul because they have to approach the enemy on unfavourable ground : the soldier however complain that the affair be be purposely protracted in order that the dictator might resign he office before they themselves return to the city and so he promise might come to nothing like those of the consul before force he at all hazard to march he army up the hill this imprudent step through the cowardice of the enemy turn out successful : for before the roman come within range the aequan amaze at they boldness abandon they camp which they have pitch in a very strong position and run down into the valley that lay behind they there abundant plunder be find : the victory be a bloodless one while military operation have thus prove successful in three quarter neither senator nor people have dismiss they anxiety in regard to the issue of domestic question with such powerful influence and such skill have the usurer make arrangement so as to disappoint not only the people but even the dictator himself for valerius after the return of the consul vetusius of all the measure bring before the senate make that on behalf of the victorious people the first and put the question what it be they pleasure should be do with respect to the debtor and when he report be disallow he say : as a supporter of reconciliation i be not approve of you will ere long wish depend on it that the common of rome have supporter like myself for my part i will neither further disappoint my fellow-citizen nor will i be dictator to no purpose intestine dissension and foreign war have cause the republic to stand in need of such a magistrate peace have be secure abroad it be impede at home i will be a witness to the disturbance as a private citizen rather than as dictator accordingly quit the senate-house he resign he dictatorship the reason be clear to the people : that he have resign he office from indignation at they treatment accordingly as if he promise have be fully keep since it have not be he fault that he word have not be make good they escort he on he return home with favor shout of acclamation fear then seize the senator lest if the army be disband secret meeting and conspiracy would be renew accordingly although the levy have be hold by the dictator yet suppose that as they have swear obedience to the consul the soldier be bind by they oath they order the legion to be lead out of the city under the pretext of hostility have be renew by the aequan by this course of action the sedition be accelerate and indeed it be say that it be at first contemplate to put the consul to death that the legion might be discharge from they oath : but that be afterward inform that no religious obligation could be render void by a criminal act they by the advice of one sicinius retire without the order of the consul to the sacred mount -lrb- 34 -rrb- beyond the river anio three mile from the city : this account be more commonly adopt than that which piso -lrb- 35 -rrb- have give that the secession be make to the aventine there without any leader they camp be fortify with a rampart and trench remain quiet take nothing but what be necessary for subsistence they remain for several day neither molest nor molest great be the panic in the city and through mutual fear all be in suspense the people leave by they fellow in the city dread the violence of the senator : the senator dread the people who remain in the city not feel sure whether they prefer they to stay or depart on the other hand how long would the multitude which have secede remain quiet what would be the consequence hereafter if in the meantime any foreign war should break out they certainly consider there be no hope leave save in the concord of the citizen : that this must be restore to the state at any price under these circumstance it be resolve that agrippa menenius a eloquent man and a favorite with the people because he be spring from they should be send to negotiate with they be admit into the camp he be say to have simply relate to they the follow story in a old-fashioned and unpolished style : at the time when the part of the human body do not as now all agree together but the several member have each they own counsel and they own language the other part be indignant that while everything be provide for the gratification of the belly by they labor and service the belly rest calmly in they midst do nothing but enjoy the pleasure afford it they accordingly enter into a conspiracy that neither should the hand convey food to the mouth nor the mouth receive it when present nor the tooth have anything to chew : while desire under the influence of this indignation to starve out the belly the individual member themselves and the entire body be reduce to the last degree of emaciation thence it become apparent that the office of the belly as well be no idle one that it do not receive more nourishment than it supply send as it do to all part of the body that blood from which we derive life and vigor distribute equally through the vein when perfect by the digestion of the food -lrb- 36 -rrb- by draw a comparison from this how like be the internal sedition of the body to the resentment of the people against the senator he succeed in persuade the mind of the multitude then the question of reconciliation begin to be discuss and a compromise be effect on certain condition : that the common should have magistrate of they own whose person should be inviolable who should have the power of render assistance against the consul and that no patrician should be permit to hold that office accordingly two tribune of the common be create gaius licinius and lucius albinus these create three colleague for themselves it be clear that among these be sicinius the ring-leader of the sedition with respect to the other two there be less agreement who they be there be some who say that only two tribune be elect on the sacred mount and that there the lex sacra -lrb- 37 -rrb- be pass during the secession of the common spurius cassius and postumus cominius enter on the consulship during they consulate a treaty be conclude with the latin state to ratify this one of the consul remain at rome : the other who be send to take command in the volscian war route and put to flight the volscian of antium -lrb- 38 -rrb- and pursue they till they have be drive into the town of longulum take possession of the wall next he take polusca also a city of the volscian : he then attack coriolus -lrb- 39 -rrb- with great violence there be at that time in the camp among the young noble gnaeus marcius a youth distinguish both for intelligence and courage who be afterward surname coriolanus while the roman army be besiege coriolus devote all its attention to the townspeople who be keep shut up within the wall and there be no apprehension of attack threaten from without the volscian legion set out from antium suddenly attack they and the enemy sally forth at the same time from the town marcius at that time happen to be on guard he with a choose body of man not only beat back the attack of those who have sally forth but boldly rush in through the open gate and have cut down all who be in the part of the city nearest to it and hastily seize some blaze torch throw they into the house adjoining the wall upon this the shout of the townsman mingle with the wailing of the woman and child occasion at first by fright as be usually the case both increase the courage of the roman and naturally dispirit the volscian who have come to bring help see that the city be take thus the volscian of antium be defeat and the town of coriolus be take and so much do marcius by he valor eclipse the reputation of the consul that have not the treaty conclude with the latin by spurius cassius alone in consequence of the absence of he colleague and which be engrave on a brazen column serve as a memorial of it it would have be forget that postumus cominius have conduct the war with the volscian in the same year die agrippa menenius a man all he life equally a favorite with senator and common endear still more to the common after the secession this man the mediator and impartial promoter of harmony among he countryman the ambassador of the senator to the common the man who bring back the common to the city do not leave enough to bury he publicly the people bury he by the contribution of a sextan -lrb- 40 -rrb- per man titus geganius and publius minucius be next elect consul in this year when abroad there be complete rest from war and at home dissension be heal another far more serious evil fall upon the state : first dearness of provision a consequence of the land lie untilled owe to the secession of the common then a famine such as attack those who be besiege and matter would certainly have end in the destruction of the slave and common have not the consul adopt precautionary measure by send person in every direction to buy up corn not only into etrurium on the coast to the right of ostium and through the territory of the volscian along the coast on the leave as far as cuma but into sicily also in quest of it to such a extent have the hatred of they neighbor oblige they to stand in need of assistance from distant country when corn have be buy up at cumae the ship be detain as security for the property of the tarquinian by the tyrant aristodemus who be they heir among the volscian and in the pomptine territory it could not even be purchase the corn dealer themselves incur danger from the violence of the inhabitant corn be bring from etrurium by way of the tiber : by means of this the people be support in such straitened resource they would have be harass by a most inopportune war have not a dreadful pestilence attack the volscian when on the point of begin hostility the mind of the enemy be so terrify by this calamity that they feel a certain alarm even after it have abate the roman both augment the number of they colonist at velitra and despatch a new colony to the mountain of norba -lrb- 41 -rrb- to serve as a stronghold in the pomptine district then in the consulship of marcus minucius and aulus sempronius a great quantity of corn be import from sicily and it be debate in the senate at what price it should be offer to the common many be of opinion that the time be come for crush the common and recover those rights which have be wrest from the senator by secession and violence in particular marcius coriolanus a enemy to tribunician power say : if they desire corn at its old price let they restore to the senator they former rights why do i like a captive send under the yoke as if i have be ransom from robber behold plebeian magistrate and sicinius invest with power be i to submit to these indignity longer than be necessary be i who have refuse to endure tarquin as king to tolerate sicinius let he now secede let he call away the common the road lie open to the sacred mount and to other hill let they carry off the corn from we land as they do three year since let they have the benefit of that scarcity which in they mad folly they have themselves occasion i venture to say that overcome by these suffering they will themselves become tiller of the land rather than take up arm and secede prevent they from be till it be not so easy to say whether it should have be do but i think that it might have be practicable for the senator on the condition of lower the price of provision to have rid themselves of both the tribunician power and all the regulation impose on they against they will this proposal both appear to the senate too harsh and from exasperation well-nigh drive the people to arm : they complain that they be now be attack with famine as if they be enemy that they be be rob of food and sustenance that the corn bring from foreign country the only support with which fortune have unexpectedly furnish they be be snatch from they mouth unless the tribune be deliver in chain to gnaeus marcius unless satisfaction be exact from the back of the common of rome that in he a new executioner have arise one to bid they either die or be slave he would have be attack as he be leave the senate-house have not the tribune very opportunely appoint he a day for trial : thereupon they rage be suppress every one see himself become the judge the arbiter of the life and death of he foe at first marcius listen to the threat of the tribune with contempt say that it be the right of afford aid not of inflict punishment that have be confer upon that office : that they be tribune of the common and not of the senator but the common have rise with such violent determination that the senator feel themselves oblige to sacrifice one man to arrive at a settlement they resist however in spite of oppose odium and exert collectively the power of the whole order as well as individually each he own at first a attempt be make to see if by post they client -lrb- 42 -rrb- in several place they could quash the whole affair by deter individual from attend meeting and cabal then they all proceed in a body -- one would have say that all the senator be on they trial -- earnestly entreat the common that if they would not acquit a innocent man they would at least for they sake pardon assume he guilty one citizen one senator as he do not attend in person on the day appoint they persist in they resentment he be condemn in he absence and go into exile among the volscian threaten he country and even then cherish all the resentment of a enemy -lrb- 43 -rrb- the volscian receive he kindly on he arrival and treat he still more kindly every day in proportion as he resentful feeling toward he countryman become more marked and at one time frequent complaint at another threat be hear he enjoy the hospitality of attius tullius who be at that time by far the chief man of the volscian people and have always be a determine enemy of the roman thus while long-standing animosity stimulate the one and recent resentment the other they concerted scheme for bring about a war with rome they do not readily believe that they own people could be persuade to take up arm so often unsuccessfully try see that by many frequent war and lastly by the loss of they youth in the pestilence they spirit be now break they feel that in a case where animosity have now die away from length of time they must proceed by scheming that they feeling might become exasperate under the influence of some fresh cause for resentment it happen that preparation be be make at rome for a renewal of the great game -lrb- 44 -rrb- the cause of this renewal be as follow : on the day of the game in the morning when the show have not yet begin a certain head of a family have drive a slave of he through the middle of the circus while he be be flog tie to the fork : -lrb- 45 -rrb- after this the game have be begin as if the matter have nothing to do with any religious difficulty soon afterward titus latinius a plebeian have a dream in which jupiter appear to he and say that the person who dance before the game have displeased he unless those game be renew on a splendid scale danger would threaten the city : let he go and announce this to the consul though he mind be not altogether free from religious awe he reverence for the dignity of the magistrate lest he might become a subject for ridicule in the mouth of all overcome he religious fear this delay cost he dear for he lose he son within a few day and that there might be no doubt about the cause of this sudden calamity the same vision present itself to he in the midst of he sorrow of heart seem to ask he whether he have be sufficiently requite for he contempt of the deity that a still heavier penalty threaten he unless he go immediately and deliver the message to the consul the matter be now still more urgent while however he still delay and keep put it off he be attack by a severe stroke of disease a sudden paralysis then indeed the anger of the god frighten he weary out therefore by he past suffering and by those that threaten he he convene a meeting of he friend and relative and after he have detail to they all he have see and hear and the fact of jupiter have so often present himself to he in he sleep and the threat and anger of heaven speedily fulfil in he own calamity he be with the unhesitating assent of all who be present convey in a litter into the forum to the presence of the consul from the forum by order of the consul he be carry into the senate-house and after he have recount the same story to the senator to the great surprise of all behold another miracle : he who have be carry into the senate-house deprive of the use of all he limb be report to have return home on he own foot after he have discharge he duty the senate decree that the game should be celebrate on as magnificent a scale as possible to those game a great number of volscian come at the suggestion of attius tullius before the game have commence tullius as have be arrange privately with marcius approach the consul and say that there be certain matter concern the common-wealth about which he wish to treat with they in private when all witness have be order to retire he say : i be reluctant to say anything of my countryman that may seem disparage i do not however come to accuse they of any crime actually commit by they but to see to it that they do not commit one the mind of we people be far more fickle than i could wish we have learn that by many disaster see that we be still preserve not through we own merit but thanks to you forbearance there be now here a great multitude of volscian the game be go on : the city will be intent on the exhibition i remember what be do in this city on a similar occasion by the youth of the sabine my mind shudder at the thought that anything should be do inconsiderately and rashly i have deem it right that these matter should be mention beforehand to you consul both for you sake and ours with regard to myself it be my determination to depart hence home immediately that i may not be taint with the suspicion of any word or deed if i remain have say this he depart when the consul have lay the matter before the senate a matter that be doubtful though vouch for by a thoroughly reliable authority the authority more than the matter itself as usually happen urge they to adopt even needless precaution and a decree of the senate have be pass that the volscian should quit the city crier be send in different direction to order they all to depart before night they be at first smitten with great panic as they run in different direction to they lodgings to carry away they effect afterward when set out indignation arise in they breast to think that they as if polluted with crime and contaminate have be drive away from the game on festival day a meeting so to speak both of god and man as they go along in a almost unbroken line tullius who have precede they to the fountain of ferentina -lrb- 46 -rrb- receive the chief man as each arrive and complain and give vent to expression of indignation lead both those who eagerly listen to language that favor they resentment and through they the rest of the multitude into a plain adjoining the road there have begin a address after the manner of a public harangue he say : though you be to forget the former wrong inflict upon you by the roman people the calamity of the nation of the volscian and all other such matter with what feeling pray do you regard this outrage offer you to-day whereby they have open the game by insulting we do you not feel that a triumph have be gain over you this day that you when leave be the observe of all citizen foreigner and so many neighbouring state that you wife you child be lead in mockery before the eye of man what do you suppose be the feeling of those who hear the voice of the crier what of those who see we depart what of those who meet this ignominious cavalcade what except that it be assuredly a matter of some offence against the god : and that because if we be present at the show we should profane the game and be guilty of a act that would need expiation for this reason we be drive away from the dwelling of these pious people from they meeting and assembly what then do it not occur to you that we still live because we have hasten we departure -- if indeed this be a departure and not rather a flight and do you not consider this to be the city of enemy in which if you have delay a single day you must all have die war have be declare against you to the great injury of those who declare it if you be man thus be both on they own account fill with resentment and further incite by this harangue they severally depart to they home and by stir up each he own state succeed in bring about the revolt of the entire volscian nation the general select to take command in that war by theunanimous choice of all the state be attius tullius and gnaeus marcius a exile from rome in the latter of whom far greater hope be repose these hope he by no means disappoint so that it be clearly see that the roman commonwealth be powerful by reason of its general rather than its military force have march to circeii he first expel from thence the roman colonist and hand over that city in a state of freedom to the volscian from thence pass across the country through by-road into the latin way he deprive the roman of the follow recently acquire town satricum longulum polusca coriolus he next himself master of lavinium and then take in succession corbio vitellium trebium labicus and pedum -lrb- 47 -rrb- lastly he march from pedum toward rome and have pitch he camp at the cluilian trench five mile from the city he openly ravage the roman territory guard be send among the devastator to preserve the land of the patrician uninjured whether it be that he be chiefly incense against the plebeian or whether he object be that dissension might arise between the senator and the people and it certainly would have arise -- so powerfully do the tribune by inveigh against the lead man of the state incite the plebeian already exasperate in themselves -- have not apprehension of danger from abroad the strongest bond of union unite they mind though distrustful and mutually hostile the only matter in which they be not agree be this : that while the senate and consul rest they hope on nothing else but arm the plebeian prefer anything to war spurius nautius and sextus furius be now consul while they be review the legion post guard along the wall and other place where they have determine that there should be outpost and watch a vast multitude of person demand peace terrify they first by they seditious clamouring and then compel they to convene the senate to consider the question of send ambassador to gnaeus marcius the senate approve the proposal when it be evident that the spirit of the plebeian be give way ambassador send to marcius to treat concern peace bring back the haughty answer : if they land be restore to the volscian the question of peace might then be consider if they be mind to enjoy the plunder of war at they ease he remember both the injurious treatment of he countryman as well as the kindness of stranger would do he utmost to make it appear that he spirit be irritated by exile not crush the same envoy be send a second time be not admit into the camp it be record that the priest also array in the vestment of they office go as suppliant to the enemy 's camp but that they do not influence he mind any more than the ambassador then the matron assemble in a body around veturium the mother of coriolanus and he wife volumnium : whether that be the result of public counsel or of woman 's fear i can not clearly ascertain anyhow they succeed in induce veturium a woman advance in year and volumnium with she two son by marcius to go into the camp of the enemy and in prevail upon woman to defend the city by entreaty and tear since man be unable to defend it by arm when they reach the camp and it be announce to coriolanus that a great crowd of woman be approach he as one who have be affect neither by the public majesty of the state as represent by its ambassador nor by the sanctity of religion so strikingly spread before he eye and understanding in the person of its priest be at first much more obdurate against woman 's tear then one of he acquaintance who have recognize veturium distinguish beyond all the rest by she sorrowful mien standing in the midst with she daughter-in-law and grandchild say unless my eye deceive I you mother and wife and child be at hand coriolanus bewilder almost like one who have lose he reason rush from he seat and offer to embrace he mother as she meet he but she turn from entreaty to wrath say : before i permit you embrace let I know whether i have come to a enemy or to a son whether i be in you camp a captive or a mother have length of life and a hapless old age reserve I for this -- to behold you first a exile then a enemy have you have the heart to lay waste this land which give you birth and nurture you though you have come in a incensed and vengeful spirit do not you resentment abate when you enter its border when rome come within view do not the thought enter you mind -- within those wall be my house and household god my mother wife and child so then have i not be a mother rome would not now be besiege : have i not a son i might have die free in a free country but i can now suffer nothing that will not bring more disgrace on you than misery on I nor most wretched as i be shall i be so for long look to these whom if you persist either a untimely death or lengthen slavery await then he wife and child embrace he : and the lamentation proceeding from the entire crowd of woman and they bemoan they own lot and they country 's at length overcome the man then have embrace he family he send they away he himself withdraw he camp from the city after he have draw off he troops from roman territory they say that he die overwhelm by the hatred excite against he on account of this act different writer give different account of he death : i find in fabius -lrb- 48 -rrb- far the most ancient authority that he live to a advanced age : at any rate this writer state that in he old age he often make use of the expression that exile be far more miserable to the aged the man of rome be not grudging in the award of they due praise to the woman so truly do they live without disparage the merit of other : a temple be build and dedicate to female fortune to serve also as a record of the event the volscian afterward return have be join by the aequan into roman territory : the latter however would no longer have attius tullius as they leader hence from a dispute whether the volscian or the aequan should give the general to the ally army a quarrel and afterward a furious battle break out therein the good fortune of the roman people destroy the two army of the enemy by a contest no less ruinous than obstinate titus sicinius and gaius aquilius be make consul the volscian fall to sicinius as he province the hernican -- for they too be in arm -- to aquilius that year the hernican be completely defeat they meet and part with the volscian without any advantage be gain on either side spurius cassius and proculus verginius be next make consul a treaty be conclude with the hernican two third of they land be take from they : of this the consul cassius propose to distribute one half among the latin the other half among the common to this donation he desire to add a considerable portion of land which though public property -lrb- 49 -rrb- he allege be possess by private individual this proceeding alarm several of the senator the actual possessor at the danger that threaten they property the senator moreover feel anxiety on public grounds fear that the consul by he donation be establish a influence dangerous to liberty then for the first time a agrarian law be propose which from that time down to the memory of we own day have never be discuss without the greatest civil disturbance the other consul oppose the donation support by the senator nor indeed be all the common oppose to he : they have at first begin to feel disgust that this gift have be extend from the citizen to the ally and thus render common : in the next place they frequently hear the consul verginius in the assembly as it be prophesy that the gift of he colleague be pestilential : that those land be sure to bring slavery to those who receive they : that the way be be pave to a throne else why be it that the ally be thus include and the latin nation what be the object of a third of the land that have be take be restore to the hernican so lately they enemy except that those nation might have cassius for they leader instead of coriolanus the dissuader and opposer of the agrarian law now begin to be popular both consul then vie with each other in humor the common verginius say that he would suffer the land to be assign provide they be assign to no one but a roman citizen cassius because in the agrarian donation he seek popularity among the ally and be therefore lower in the estimation of he countryman command in order that by another gift he might win the affection of the citizen that the money receive for the sicilian corn should be refund to the people that however the people spurn as nothing else than a ready money bribe for regal authority : so uncompromisingly be he gift reject as if there be abundance of everything in consequence of they inveterate suspicion that he be aim at sovereign power as soon as he go out of office it be certain that he be condemn and put to death there be some who represent that he father be the person who carry out the punishment : that he have try the case at home scourge he and put he to death and consecrate he son 's private property to cere that out of this a statue be set up and inscribe present out of the property of the cassian family in some author i find it state which be more probable that a day be assign he to stand he trial for high treason by the quaestor -lrb- 50 -rrb- caeso fabius and lucius valerius and that he be condemn by the decision of the people that he house be demolish by a public decree : this be the spot where there be now a open space before the temple of tellus -lrb- 51 -rrb- however whether the trial be hold in private or public he be condemn in the consulship of servius cornelius and quintus fabius the resentment of the people against cassius be not last the charm of the agrarian law now that its proposer be remove of itself enter they mind : and they desire of it be further kindle by the meanness of the senator who after the volscian and æquans have be completely defeat in that year defraud the soldier of they share of the booty whatever be take from the enemy be sell by the consul fabius and the proceeds lodge in the public treasury all who bear the name of fabius become odious to the common on account of the last consul : the patrician however succeed in get cæso fabius elect consul with lucius æmilius the common still further aggravate at this provoke war abroad by exciting disturbance at home -lrb- 52 -rrb- in consequence of the war civil dissension be then discontinue patrician and common unite under the command of æmilius overcome the volscian and æquans who renew hostility in a successful engagement the retreat however destroy more of the enemy than the battle so perseveringly do the cavalry pursue they when route during the same year on the ides of July -lrb- 53 -rrb- the temple of castor be dedicate : it have be vow during the latin war in the dictatorship of postumius : he son who be elect duumvir for that special purpose dedicate it in that year also the mind of the people be excite by the allurement of the agrarian law the tribune of the people endeavor to enhance they authority in itself agreeable to the people by promote a popular law the patrician consider that there be enough and more than enough frenzy in the multitude without any additional incitement view with horror largess and all inducement to ill-considered action : the patrician find in the consul most energetic abettor in resistance that portion of the commonwealth therefore prevail and not for the moment only but for the coming year also they succeed in secure the election of marcus fabius cæso 's brother as consul and one still more detest by the common for he persecution of cassius -- namely lucius valerius in that year also be a contest with the tribune the law come to nothing and the supporter of the law prove to be mere boaster by they frequent promise of a gift that be never grant the fabian name be thenceforward hold in high repute after three successive consulate and all as it be uniformly test in contend with the tribune accordingly the honor remain for a considerable time in that family as be right well place a war with veius be then begin : the volscian also renew hostility but while they strength be almost more than sufficient for foreign war they only abuse it by contend among themselves in addition to the distract state of the public mind prodigy from heaven increase the general alarm exhibit almost daily threat in the city and in the country and the soothsayer be consult by the state and by private individual declare at one time by means of entrails at another by bird that there be no other cause for the deity have be rouse to anger save that the ceremony of religion be not duly perform these terror however terminate in this that oppia a vestal virgin be find guilty of a breach of chastity suffer punishment -lrb- 54 -rrb- quintus fabius and gaius julius be next elect consul during this year the dissension at home be not abate while the war abroad be more desperate the æquans take up arm : the veientine also invade and plunder the roman territory : as the anxiety about these war increase cæso fabius and spurius furius be appoint consul the æquans be lay siege to ortona a latin city the veientine now sate with plunder threaten to besiege rome itself these terror which ought to have assuage the feeling of the common increase they still further : and the people resume the practice of decline military service not of they own accord as before but spurius licinius a tribune of the people think that the time have come for force the agrarian law on the patrician by extreme necessity have undertake the task of obstruct the military preparation however all the odium against the tribunician power be direct against the author of this proceeding : and even he own colleague rise up against he as vigorously as the consul and by they assistance the consul hold the levy a army be raise for the two war simultaneously one be intrust to fabius to be lead against the veientine the other to furius to operate against the æquans in regard to the latter indeed nothing take place worthy of mention fabius have considerably more trouble with he countryman than with the enemy : that one man alone as consul sustain the commonwealth which the army be do its best to betray as far as in it lay from hatred of the consul for when the consul in addition to he other military talent of which he have exhibit abundant instance in he preparation for and in he conduct of war have so draw up he line that he route the enemy 's army solely by a charge of he cavalry the infantry refuse to pursue they when route nor although the exhortation of they general whom they hate have no effect upon they could even they own infamy and the immediate public disgrace and subsequent danger likely to arise if the enemy recover they courage induce they to quicken they pace or even if nothing else to stand in order of battle without order they face about and with a sorrowful air -lrb- one would have think they defeat -rrb- they return to camp execrating at one time they general at another the vigor display by the cavalry nor do the general know where to look for any remedy for so harmful a precedent : so true be it that the most distinguished talent will be more likely find deficient in the art of manage a countryman than in that of conquer a enemy the consul return to rome not have so much increase he military glory as irritated and exasperate the hatred of he soldier toward he the patrician however succeed in keep the consulship in the fabian family they elect marcus fabius consul gnaeus manlius be assign as a colleague to fabius this year also find a tribune to support a agrarian law this be tiberius pontificius who pursue the same tactic as if it have succeed in the case of spurius licinius obstruct the levy for a little time the patrician be once more perplexed appius claudius declare that the tribunician power have be put down the year before for the moment by the fact for the future by the precedent establish since it be find that it could be render ineffective by its own strength for that there never would be want a tribune who would both be willing to obtain a victory for himself over he colleague and the good-will of the better party to on advancement of the public weal : that more tribune than one if there be need of more than one would be ready to assist the consul : and that in fact one would be sufficient even against all -lrb- 55 -rrb- only let the consul and lead member of the senate take care to win over if not all at least some of the tribune to the side of the commonwealth and the senate the senator instruct by the counsel of appius both collectively address the tribune with kindness and courtesy and the man of consular rank accord as each possess private personal influence over they individually and partly by conciliation partly by authority prevail so far as to make they consent that the power of the tribunician office should be beneficial to the state and by the aid of four tribune against one obstructor of the public good the consul carry out the levy they then set out to the war against veius to which auxiliary have assemble from all part of etrurium not so much influence by feeling of regard for the veientine as because they have form a hope that the power of rome could be destroy by internal discord and in the general council of all the state of etrurium the lead man murmur that the power of rome would last forever unless they be distract by disturbance among themselves : that this be the only poison this the bane discover for powerful state to render mighty empire mortal : that this evil a long time check partly by the wise measure of the patrician partly by the forbearance of the common have now proceed to extremity : that two state be now form out of one : that each party have its own magistrate its own law : that although at first they be accustom to be turbulent during the levy still these same individual have notwithstanding ever be obedient to they commander during war : that as long as military discipline be retain no matter what might be the state of the city the evil might have be withstand : but that now the custom of not obey they officer follow the roman soldier even to the camp : that in the last war even in a regular engagement and in the very heat of battle by consent of the army the victory have be voluntarily surrender to the vanquish aequan : that the standard have be desert the general abandon on the field and that the army have return to camp without order : without doubt if they persevere rome might be conquer by means of she own soldiery : nothing else be necessary save a declaration and show of war : the fate and the god would of themselves manage the rest these hope have arm the etruscan who by many change of fortune have be vanquish and victor in turn the roman consul also dread nothing else but they own strength and they own arm the recollection of the most mischievous precedent set in the last war be a terrible warning to they not to let matter go so far that they would have two army to fear at the same time accordingly they keep within they camp avoid battle owe to the two-fold danger that threaten they think that length of time and circumstance themselves would perchance soften down resentment and bring they to a healthy frame of mind the veientine enemy and the etruscan proceed with proportionately greater precipitation they provoke they to battle at first by ride up to the camp and challenge they at length when they produce no effect by revile the consul and the army alike they declare that the pretence of internal dissension be assume as a cloak for cowardice : and that the consul rather distrust the courage than disbelieve the sincerity of they soldier : that inaction and idleness among man in arm be a novel form of sedition besides this they utter insinuation partly true and partly false as to the upstart nature of they race and origin while they loudly proclaim this close to the very rampart and gate the consul bear it without impatience : but at one time indignation at another shame agitate the breast of the ignorant multitude and divert they attention from intestine evil they be unwilling that the enemy should remain unpunished they do not wish success either to the patrician or the consul foreign and domestic hatred struggle for the mastery in they mind : at length the former prevail so haughty and insolent be the jeer of the enemy they crowd in a body to the general 's tent they desire battle they demand that the signal should be give the consul confer together as if to deliberate they continue the conference for a long time : they be desirous of fight but that desire they consider should be check and conceal that by opposition and delay they might increase the ardor of the soldiery now that it be once rouse the answer be return that the matter in question be premature that it be not yet time for fighting : let they keep within they camp they then issue a proclamation that they should abstain from fighting : if any one fight without order they would punish he as a enemy when they be thus dismiss they eagerness for fight increase in proportion as they believe the consul be less disposed for it the enemy moreover who now show themselves with greater boldness as soon as it be know that the consul have determine not to fight further kindle they ardor for they suppose that they could insult they with impunity that the soldier be not trust with arm that the affair would explode in a violent mutiny that a end have come to the roman empire rely on these hope they run up to the gate heap abuse on the roman and with difficulty refrain from assault the camp then indeed the roman could no longer endure they insult : they run from every quarter of the camp to the consul : they no longer as formerly put forth they demand with reserve through the mediation of the centurion of the first rank but all proceed indiscriminately with loud clamor the affair be now ripe yet still they hesitate then fabius as he colleague be now incline to give way in consequence of he dread of mutiny in face of the increase uproar have command silence by sound of trumpet say : i know that those soldier be able to conquer gneius manlius : by they own conduct they themselves have prevent I from know that they be willing accordingly i have resolve and determine not to give the signal unless they swear that they will return from this battle victorious the soldier have once deceive the roman consul in the field the god he will never deceive there be a centurion marcus flavoleius one of the foremost in demand battle : say he marcus fabius i will return victorious from the field he invoke upon himself should he deceive they the wrath of father jove mar gradivus and the other god after he in succession the whole army severally take the same oath after they have be swear the signal be give : they take up arm and march into battle full of rage and of hope they bid the etruscan now utter they reproach : now severally demand that the enemy so ready of tongue should face they now that they be arm on that day both common and patrician alike show distinguish bravery : the fabian family shine forth most conspicuous : they be determine to recover in that battle the affection of the common estrange by many civil contest the army be draw up in order of battle nor do the veientine foe and the etruscan legion decline the contest they entertain a almost certain hope that the roman would no more fight with they than they have with the aequan that even some more serious attempt be not to be despair of consider the sorely irritated state of they feeling and the critical condition of affair the result turn out altogether different : for never before in any other war do the roman soldier enter the field with greater fury so exasperated be they by the taunt of the enemy on the one hand and the dilatoriness of the consul on the other before the etruscan have time to form they rank they javelin have be rather throw away at random in the first confusion than aim at the enemy the battle have become a hand-to-hand encounter even with sword in which the fury of war rage most fiercely among the foremost the fabian family be distinguish for the sight it afford and the example it present to its fellow-citizen one of these quintus fabius who have be consul two year before as he advance at the head of he man against a dense body of veientine and incautiously engage amid numerous party of the enemy receive a sword-thrust through the breast at the hand of a tuscan embolden by he bodily strength and skill in arm : on the weapon be extract fabius fall forward on the wound both army feel the fall of this one man and the roman in consequence be begin to give way when the consul marcus fabius leap over the body of he prostrate kinsman and hold he buckler in front cry out : be this what you swear soldier that you would return to the camp in flight be you so afraid of you most cowardly foe rather than of jupiter and mar by whom you have swear well then i who have take no oath will either return victorious or will fall fight here beside thee quintus fabius then caeso fabius the consul of the preceding year address the consul : brother be it by these word you think you will prevail on they to fight the god by whom they have swear will bring it about let we also as become man of noble birth as be worthy of the fabian name kindle the courage of the soldier by fight rather than by exhortation thus the two fabius rush forward to the front with spear present and carry the whole line with they the battle be thus restore in one quarter gnaeus manlius the consul with no less ardor encourage the fight on the other wing where the course of the fortune of war be almost identical for as the soldier eagerly follow quintus fabius on the one wing so do they follow the consul manlius on this as he be drive the enemy before he now nearly route when have receive a severe wound he retire from the battle they fall back suppose that he be slay and would have abandon the position have not the other consul gallop at full speed to that quarter with some troops of horse support they drooping fortune cry out that he colleague be still alive that he himself be now at hand victorious have route the other wing manlius also show himself in sight of all to restore the battle the well-known face of the two consul kindle the courage of the soldier : at the same time too the enemy 's line be now thinner since rely on they superior number they have draw off they reserve and despatch they to storm the camp this be assault without much resistance : and while they waste time bethink themselves of plunder rather than fight the roman triarius -lrb- 56 -rrb- who have not be able to sustain the first shock have send a report to the consul of the position of affair return in a compact body to the prætorium -lrb- 57 -rrb- and of they own accord renew the battle the consul manlius also have return to the camp and post soldier at all the gate have block up every passage against the enemy this desperate situation arouse the fury rather than the bravery of the etruscan for when rush on wherever hope hold out the prospect of escape they have advance with several fruitless effort a body of young man attack the consul himself who be conspicuous by he arm the first missile be intercept by those who stand around he afterward they violence could not be withstand the consul fall smitten with a mortal wound and all around he be put to flight the courage of the etruscan increase terror drive the roman in dismay through the entire camp and matter would have come to extremity have not the lieutenant -lrb- 58 -rrb- hastily seize the body of the consul open a passage for the enemy at one gate -lrb- 59 -rrb- through this they rush out and go away in the utmost disorder they fall in with the other consul who have be victorious there a second time they be cut down and route in every direction a glorious victory be win saddened however by two such illustrious death the consul therefore on the senate vote he a triumph reply that if the army could triumph without its general he would readily accede to it in consideration of its distinguished service in that war : that for he own part as he family be plunge in grief in consequence of the death of he brother quintus fabius and the commonwealth in some degree bereave by the loss of one of she consul he would not accept the laurel disfigure by public and private grief the triumph thus decline be more illustrious than any triumph actually enjoy so true it be that glory refuse at a fitting moment sometimes return with accumulate lustre he next celebrate the two funeral of he colleague and brother one after the other himself deliver the funeral oration over both wherein by yield up to they the praise that be he own due he himself obtain the greatest share of it and not unmindful of that which he have determine upon at the beginning of he consulate namely the regain the affection of the people he distribute the wounded soldier among the patrician to be attend to most of they be give to the fabius : nor be they treat with greater attention anywhere else from this time the fabius begin to be popular and that not by aught save such conduct as be beneficial to the state accordingly caeso fabius have be elect consul with titus verginius not more with the good-will of the senator than of the common give no attention either to war or levy or anything else in preference until the hope of concord be now in some measure assure the feeling of the common should be unite with those of the senator at the earliest opportunity accordingly at the beginning of the year he propose that before any tribune should stand forth as a supporter of the agrarian law the patrician themselves should be beforehand in bestow the gift unasked and make it they own : that they should distribute among the common the land take from the enemy in as equal a proportion as possible that it be but just that those should enjoy it by whose blood and labor it have be win the patrician reject the proposal with scorn : some even complain that the once vigorous spirit of caeso be run riot and decay through a surfeit of glory there be afterward no party struggle in the city the latin however be harass by the incursion of the aequan caeso be send thither with a army cross into the territory of the aequan themselves to lay it waste the aequan retire into the town and keep themselves within the wall : on that account no battle worth mention be fight however a reverse be sustain at the hand of the veientine foe owe to the rashness of the other consul and the army would have be all cut off have not caeso fabius come to they assistance in time from that time there be neither peace nor war with the veientine : they mode of operation have now come very near to the form of brigandage they retire before the roman troops into the city when they perceive that the troops be draw off they make incursion into the country alternately mock war with peace and peace with war thus the matter could neither be drop altogether nor bring to a conclusion besides other war be threaten either at the moment as from the aequan and volscian who remain inactive no longer than be necessary to allow the recent smart of they late disaster to pass away or at no distant date as it be evident that the sabine ever hostile and all etrurium would soon begin to stir up war : but the veientine a constant rather than a formidable enemy keep they mind in a state of perpetual uneasiness by petty annoyance more frequently than by any real danger to be apprehend from they because they could at no time be neglect and do not suffer the roman to turn they attention elsewhere then the fabian family approach the senate : the consul speak in the name of the family : conscript father the veientine war require as you know a unremitting rather than a strong defense do you attend to other war : assign the fabius as enemy to the veientine we pledge ourselves that the majesty of the roman name shall be safe in that quarter that war as if it be a family matter it be we determination to conduct at we own private expense in regard to it let the republic be spare the expense of soldier and money the warmest thanks be return to they the consul leave the senate-house accompany by the fabius in a body who have be stand in the porch of the senate-house await the decree of the senate return home they be order to attend on the follow day in arm at the consul 's gate : they then retire to they home the report spread through the entire city they extol the fabius to the sky : that a single family have undertake the burden of the state that the veientine war have now become a private concern a private quarrel if there be two family of the same strength in the city let they demand the one the volscian for itself the other the aequan that all the neighbouring state could be subdue while the roman people all the time enjoy profound peace the day follow the fabius take up arm they assemble where they have be order the consul come forth in he military robe behold the whole family in the porch draw up in order of march be receive into the center he order the standard to be advance never do a army march through the city either smaller in number or more distinguish in renown and more admire by all three hundred and six soldier all patrician all of one family not one of whom a honest senate would reject as a leader under any circumstance whatever proceed on they march threaten the veientine state with destruction by the might of a single family a crowd follow one part belong to themselves consist of they kinsman and comrade who contemplate no half measure either as to they hope or anxiety but everything on a grand scale : -lrb- 60 -rrb- the other arouse by solicitude for the public weal unable to express they esteem and admiration they bid they proceed in they brave resolve proceed with happy omen and render the issue proportionate to the undertaking : thence to expect consulship and triumph all reward all honor from they as they pass the capitol and the citadel and the other sacred edifice they offer up prayer to all the god that present themselves to they sight or to they mind that they would send forward that band with prosperity and success and soon send they back safe into they country to they parent in vain be these prayer utter have set out on they luckless road by the right-hand arch of the carmental gate -lrb- 61 -rrb- they arrive at the river cremera : -lrb- 62 -rrb- this appear a favourable situation for fortify a outpost lucius aemilius and gaius servilius be then create consul and as long as there be nothing else to occupy they but mutual devastation the fabius be not only able to protect they garrison but through the entire tract where the tuscan territory adjoin the roman they protect all they own district and ravage those of the enemy spread they force along both frontier there be afterward a cessation though not for long of these depredation : while both the veientine have send for a army from etrurium -lrb- 63 -rrb- assault the outpost at the cremera and the roman troops bring up by the consul lucius aemilius come to a close engagement in the field with the etruscan the veientine however have scarcely time to draw up they line : for during the first alarm while they be enter the line behind they color and they be station they reserve a brigade of roman cavalry charge they suddenly in flank deprive they of all opportunity not only of open the fight but even of stand they ground thus be drive back to the red rock -lrb- 64 -rrb- -lrb- where they have pitch they camp -rrb- as suppliant they sue for peace and after it be grant owe to the natural inconsistency of they mind they regret it even before the roman garrison be withdraw from the cremera again the veientine state have to contend with the fabius without any additional military armament : and not merely do they make raid into each other 's territory or sudden attack upon those carry on the raid but they fight repeatedly on level ground and in pitched battle : and one family of the roman people oftentimes gain the victory over a entire etruscan state and a most powerful one for those time this at first appear mortifying and humiliating to the veientine : then they conceive the design suggest by the state of affair of surprising they daring enemy by a ambuscade they be even glad that the confidence of the fabius be increase owe to they great success wherefore cattle be frequently drive in the path of the plunder party as if they have fall in they way by accident and tract of land leave abandon by the flight of the peasant : and reserve body of armed man send to prevent the devastation retreat more frequently in pretended than in real alarm by this time the fabius have conceive such contempt for the enemy that they believe that they arm as yet invincible could not be resist either in any place or on any occasion : this presumption carry they so far that at the sight of some cattle at a distance from cremera with a extensive plain lie between they run down to they in spite of the fact that some scattered body of the enemy be visible : and when anticipate nothing and in disorderly haste they have pass the ambuscade place on either side of the road itself and disperse in different direction have begin to carry off the cattle that be stray about as be usual when frighten the enemy start suddenly in a body from they ambuscade and surround they both in front and on every side at first the noise of they shout spread terrify they then weapon assail they from every side : and as the etruscan close in they also be compel hem in as they be by a unbroken body of armed man to form themselves into a square of narrower compass the more the enemy press on : this circumstance render both they own scarcity of number noticeable and the superior number of the etruscan whose rank be crowd in a narrow space then have abandon the plan of fight which they have direct with equal effort in every quarter they all turn they force toward one point strain every effort in that direction both with they arm and body and form themselves into a wedge they force a passage the way lead to a gradually ascend hill : here they first halt : presently as soon as the higher ground afford they time to gain breath and to recover from so great a panic they repulse the foe as they ascend : and the small band assist by the advantage of the ground be gain the victory have not a party of the veientine send round the ridge of the hill make they way to the summit : thus the enemy again get possession of the higher ground all the fabius be cut down to a man and the fort be take by assault : it be generally agree that three hundred and six be slay that one only who have nearly attain the age of puberty survive who be to be the stock for the fabian family and be destine to prove the greatest support of the roman people in dangerous emergency on many occasion both at home and in war -lrb- 65 -rrb- at the time when this disaster be sustained gaius horatius and titus menenius be consul menenius be immediately send against the tuscan now elate with victory on that occasion also a unsuccessful battle be fight and the enemy take possession of the janiculum : and the city would have be besiege since scarcity of provision distressed they in addition to the war -- for the etruscan have pass the tiber -- have not the consul horatius be recall from the volscian and so closely do that war approach the very wall that the first battle be fight near the temple of hope -lrb- 66 -rrb- with doubtful success and a second at the colline gate there although the roman gain the upper hand by only a trifling advantage yet that contest render the soldier more serviceable for future battle by the restoration of they former courage aulus verginius and spurius servilius be next choose consul after the defeat sustain in the last battle the veientine decline a engagement -lrb- 67 -rrb- ravages be commit and they make repeat attack in every direction upon the roman territory from the janiculum as if from a fortress : nowhere be cattle or husbandman safe they be afterward entrap by the same stratagem as that by which they have entrap the fabius : have pursue cattle which have be intentionally drive on in all direction to decoy they they fall into a ambuscade in proportion as they be more numerous -lrb- 68 -rrb- the slaughter be greater the violent resentment result from this disaster be the cause and beginning of one still greater : for have cross the tiber by night they attempt to assault the camp of the consul servilius be repulse from thence with great slaughter they with difficulty make good they retreat to the janiculum the consul himself also immediately cross the tiber and fortify he camp at the foot of the janiculum : at daybreak on the follow morning be both somewhat elated by the success of the battle of the day before more however because the scarcity of corn force he to adopt measure however dangerous provide only they be more expeditious he rashly march he army up the steep of the janiculum to the camp of the enemy and be repulse from thence with more disgrace than when he have repulse they on the precede day he be save both himself and he army by the intervention of he colleague the etruscan hem in between the two army and present they rear to the one and the other by turn be completely destroy thus the veientine war be crush by a successful piece of audacity -lrb- 69 -rrb- together with peace provision come in to the city in greater abundance both by reason of corn have be bring in from campanium and as soon as the fear of want which every one feel be likely to befall himself leave they by the corn be bring out which have be store then they mind once more become wanton from plenty and ease and they seek at home they former subject of complaint now that there be none abroad the tribune begin to excite the common by they poisonous charm the agrarian law : they rouse they against the senator who oppose it and not only against they as a body but against particular individual quintus considius and titus genucius the proposer of the agrarian law appoint a day of trial for titus menenius : the loss of the fort of cremera while the consul have he standing camp at no great distance from thence be the cause of he unpopularity this crushed he though both the senator have exert themselves in he behalf with no less earnestness than in behalf of coriolanus and the popularity of he father agrippa be not yet forget the tribune however act leniently in the matter of the fine : though they have arraign he for a capital offence they impose on he when find guilty a fine of only two thousand ass this prove fatal to he they say that he could not brook disgrace and anguish of mind : and that in consequence he be carry off by disease another senator spurius servilius be soon after arraign as soon as he go out of office a day of trial have be appoint for he by the tribune lucius caedicius and titus statius immediately at the beginning of the year in the consulship of gaius nautius and publius valerius : he do not however like menenius meet the attack of the tribune with supplication on the part of himself and the patrician but with firm reliance on he own integrity and he personal popularity the battle with the tuscan at the janiculum be also the charge bring against he : but be a man of impetuous spirit as he have formerly do in time of public peril so now in the danger which threaten himself he dispel it by boldly meet it by confute not only the tribune but the common also in a haughty speech and upbraid they with the condemnation and death of titus menenius by the good office of whose father the common have formerly be re-establish and now have those magistrate and enjoy those law by virtue of which they then act so insolently : he colleague verginius also who be bring forward as a witness aid he by assign to he a share of he own glory : however -- so have they change they mind -- the condemnation of menenius be of greater service to he the contest at home be now conclude a war against the veientine with whom the sabine have unite they force break out afresh the consul publius valerius after auxiliary have be send for from the latin and hernican be despatch to veii with a army immediately attack the sabine camp which have be pitch before the wall of they ally and occasion such great consternation that while scatter in different direction they sally forth in small party to repel the assault of the enemy the gate which he first atack be take : then within the rampart a massacre rather than a battle take place from within the camp the alarm spread also into the city the veientine run to arm in as great a panic as if veius have be take : some come up to the support of the sabine other fall upon the roman who have direct all they force against the camp for a little while they be disconcerted and throw into confusion then they in like manner form two front and make a stand : and the cavalry be command by the consul to charge route the tuscan and put they to flight and in the self-same hour two army and two of the most influential and powerful of the neighbouring state be vanquish while these event be take place at veius the volscian and æquans have pitch they camp in latin territory and lay waste they frontier the latin be join by the hernican without either a roman general or roman auxiliary by they own effort strip they of they camp besides recover they own effect they obtain immense booty the consul gaius nautius however be send against the volscian from rome the custom i suppose be not approve of that the ally should carry on war with they own force and accord to they own plan without a roman general and troops there be no kind of injury and petty annoyance that be not practice against the volscian they could not however be prevail on to come to a engagement in the field lucius furius and gaius manlius be the next consul the veientine fall to manlius as he province no war however follow : a truce for forty year be grant they at they request but they be order to provide corn and pay for the soldier disturbance at home immediately follow in close succession on peace abroad : the common be goad by the spur employ by the tribune in the shape of the agrarian law the consul no whit intimidate by the condemnation of menenius nor by the danger of servilius resist with they utmost might gnæus genucius a tribune of the people drag the consul before the court on they go out of office lucius æmilius and opiter verginius enter upon the consulate instead of verginius i find vopiscus julius give as consul in some annals in this year -lrb- whoever be the consul -rrb- furius and manlius be summon to trial before the people in sordid garb solicit the aid of the younger patrician as much as that of the common : they advise they caution they to keep themselves from public office and the administration of public affair and indeed to consider the consular fasce the toga prætexta and curule chair as nothing else but a funeral parade : that when deck with these splendid insignia as with fillet -lrb- 70 -rrb- they be doom to death but if the charm of the consulate be so great they should even now rest satisfied that the consulate be hold in captivity and crush by the tribunician power that everything have to be do by the consul at the beck and command of the tribune as if he be a tribune 's beadle if he stir if he regard the patrician at all if he think that there exist any other party in the state but the common let he set before he eye the banishment of gnæeus marcius the condemnation and death of menenius fire by these word the patrician from that time hold they consultation not in public but in private house and remote from the knowledge of the majority at which when this one point only be agree on that the accuse must be rescue either by fair means or foul the most desperate proposal be most approve nor do any deed however daring lack a supporter -lrb- 71 -rrb- accordingly on the day of trial when the people stand in the forum on tiptoe of expectation they at first begin to feel surprised that the tribune do not come down then the delay now become more suspicious they believe that he be hinder by the noble and complain that the public cause be abandon and betray at length those who have be wait before the entrance of the tribune 's residence announce that he have be find dead in he house as soon as rumor spread the news through the whole assembly just as a army disperse on the fall of its general so do they scatter in different direction panic chiefly seize the tribune now teach by they colleague 's death how utterly ineffectual be the aid the devote law afford they -lrb- 72 -rrb- nor do the patrician display they exultation with due moderation and so far be any of they from feel compunction at the guilty act that even those who be innocent wish to be consider to have perpetrate it and it be openly declare that the tribunician power ought to be subdue by chastisement immediately after this victory that involve a most ruinous precedent a levy be proclaimed and the tribune be now overawe the consul accomplish they object without any opposition then indeed the common become enraged more at the inactivity of the tribune than at the authority of the consul : they declare there be a end of they liberty : that thing have return to they old condition : that the tribunician power have die along with genucius and be bury with he that other means must be devise and adopt by which the patrician might be resist : and that the only means to that end be for the people to defend themselves since they have no other help : that four-and-twenty lictor wait on the consul and they man of the common people : that nothing could be more despicable or weaker if only there be person to despise they that each person magnify those thing and make they object of terror to himself when they have excite one another by these word a lictor be despatch by the consul to volero publilius a man belong to the common because he declare that have be a centurion he ought not to be make a common soldier volero appeal to the tribune when no one come to he assistance the consul order the man to be strip and the rod to be get ready i appeal to the people say volero since the tribune prefer to see a roman citizen scourge before they eye than themselves to be butcher by you each in he bed the more vehemently he cry out the more violently do the lictor tear off he clothes and strip he then volero be both himself a man of great bodily strength and aid by he partisan have thrust back the lictor retire into the thickest part of the crowd where the outcry of those who express they indignation be loudest cry out : i appeal and implore the protection of the common assist I fellow-citizen : assist I fellow-soldier : it be no use to wait for the tribune who themselves stand in need of you aid the man excite make ready as if for battle : and it be clear that a general crisis be at hand that no one would have respect for anything either public or private right when the consul have face this violent storm they soon find out that authority unsupported by strength have but little security the lictor be maltreat and the fasce break they be drive from the forum into the senate-house uncertain how far volero would follow up he victory after that the disturbance subside have order the member to be summon to the senate they complain of the insult offer to themselves of the violence of the people of the daring conduct of volero after many violent measure have be propose the older member prevail who do not approve of the rash behavior of the common be meet by the resentment of the patrician the common have warmly espouse the cause of volero at the next meeting secure he election as tribune of the people for that year in which lucius pinarius and public furius be consul : and contrary to the opinion of all who think that he would make free use of he tribuneship to harass the consul of the preceding year postpone private resentment to the public interest without the consul be attack even by a single word he bring a bill before the people that plebeian magistrate should be elect at the comitium tributa -lrb- 73 -rrb- a measure of no small importance be now propose under a aspect at first sight by no means alarming but one of such a nature that it really deprive the patrician of all power of elect whatever tribune they please by the suffrage of they client the patrician resist to the utmost this proposal which meet with the greatest approval of the common : and though none of the college -lrb- 74 -rrb- could be induce by the influence either of the consul or of the chief member of the senate to enter a protest against it which be the only means of effectual resistance yet the matter a weighty one from its own importance be spin out by party struggle for a whole year the common re-elected volero as tribune the senator consider that the matter would end in a desperate struggle elect as consul appius claudius the son of appius who be both hate by and have hate the common ever since the contest between they and he father titus quinctius be assign to he as he colleague immediately at the beginning of the year -lrb- 75 -rrb- no other question take precedence of that regard the law but like volero the originator of it so he colleague lætorius be both a more recent as well as a more energetic supporter of it he great renown in war make he overbear because in the age in which he live no one be more prompt in action he while volero confine himself to the discussion of the law avoid all abuse of the consul break out into accusation against appius and he family as have ever be most overbearing and cruel toward the roman common contend that he have be elect by the senator not as consul but as executioner to harass and torture the people : he tongue unskilled in speech as be natural in a soldier be unable to give adequate expression to the freedom of he sentiment when therefore language fail he he say : roman since i do not speak with as much readiness as i make good what i have speak attend here to-morrow i will either die before you eye or will carry the law on the follow day the tribune take possession of the platform : the consul and the noble take they place together in the assembly to obstruct the law lætorius order all person to be remove except those go to vote the young noble keep they place pay no regard to the officer then lætorius order some of they to be seize the consul appius insist that the tribune have no jurisdiction over any one except a plebeian for that he be not a magistrate of the people in general but only of the common and that even he himself could not accord to the usage of they ancestor by virtue of he authority remove any person because the word be as follow : if ye think proper depart quirite he be easily able to disconcert lætorius by discuss he right thus contemptuously the tribune therefore burn with rage send he officer to the consul the consul send he lictor to the tribune exclaim that he be a private individual without military office and without civil authority : and the tribune would have be roughly handle have not both the entire assembly rise up with great warmth in behalf of the tribune against the consul and a crowd of people belong to the excited multitude rush from all part of the city into the forum appius however withstand this great storm with obstinacy and the contest would have end in a battle not without bloodshed have not quinctius the other consul have intrust the man of consular rank with the task of remove he colleague from the forum by force if they could not do so in any other way himself now assuage the rage people by entreaty now implore the tribune to dismiss the assembly let they say he give they passion time to cool : delay would not in any respect deprive they of they power but would add prudence to strength and the senator would be under the control of the people and the consul under that of the senator the people be with difficulty pacify by quinctius the other consul with much more difficulty by the patrician the assembly of the people have be at length dismiss the consul convene the senate in which though fear and resentment by turn have produce a diversity of opinion the more they mind be call off by lapse of time from passion to reflection the more adverse do they become to contentiousness so that they return thanks to quinctius because it be owe to he exertion that the disturbance have be quiet appius be request to give he consent that the consular dignity should be merely so great as it could be in a state if it be to be unite : it be declare that as long as the tribune and consul claim all power each for he own side no strength be leave between : that the commonwealth be distract and tear asunder : that the object aim at be rather to whom it should belong than that it should be safe appius on the contrary call god and man to witness that the commonwealth be be betray and abandon through cowardice that it be not the consul who have fail to support the senate but the senate the consul : that more oppressive condition be now be submit to than have be submit to on the sacred mount overcome however by the unanimous feeling of the senator he desist : the law be carry without opposition then for the first time the tribune be elect in the comita tributa piso be the authority for the statement that three be add to the number as if there have be only two before he also give the name of the tribune gnæus siccius lucius numitorius marcus duellius spurius icilius lucius mecilius during the disturbance at rome a war break out with the volscian and æquans who have lay waste the country so that if any secession of the people take place they might find a refuge with they afterward when matter be settle they move back they camp appius claudius be send against the volscian the æquans fall to quinctius as he province appius exhibit the same severity in war as at home only more unrestrained because it be free from the control of the tribune he hate the common with a hatred greater than that inherit from he father : he have be defeat by they : when he have be choose consul as the only man able to oppose the influence of the tribune a law have be pass which former consul have obstruct with less effect amid hope of the senator by no means so great as those now place in he he resentment and indignation at this stir he imperious temper to harass the army by the severity of he command it could not however be subdue by any exercise of authority with such a spirit of opposition be the soldier fill they carry out all order slowly indolently carelessly and stubbornly : neither shame nor fear restrain they if he wish the march to be accelerate they designedly go more slowly : if he come up to they to encourage they in they work they all relax the energy which they have before exert of they own accord : they cast down they eye in he presence they silently curse he as he pass by so that that spirit unconquered by plebeian hatred be sometimes move every kind of severity have be try without effect he no longer hold any intercourse with the soldier he say the army be corrupt by the centurion he sometimes gibingly call they tribune of the people and volero none of these circumstance be unknown to the volscian and they press on with so much the more vigor hope that the roman soldier would entertain the same spirit of opposition against appius as they have formerly exhibit against the consul fabius however they show themselves still more embittered against appius than against fabius for they be not only unwilling to conquer like the army of fabius but even wish to be conquer when lead forth into the field they make for they camp in ignominious flight and do not stand they ground until they see the volscian advance against they fortification and the dreadful havoc in the rear of they army then they be compel to put forth they strength for battle in order that the now victorious enemy might be dislodge from they line while however it be sufficiently clear that the roman soldier be only unwilling that the camp should be take in regard to all else they glory in they own defeat and disgrace when the haughty spirit of appius in no wise break by this behavior of the soldier purpose to act with still greater severity and summon a meet the lieutenant and tribune flock around he recommend he by no means to decide to put he authority to the proof the entire strength of which lay in unanimous obedience say that the soldier generally refuse to come to the assembly and that they voice be hear on all side demand that the camp should be remove from the volscian territory : that the victorious enemy be but a little time ago almost at the very gate and rampart and that not merely a suspicion but the visible form of a grievous disaster present itself to they eye yield at last -- since they gain nothing save a respite from punishment -- have prorogue the assembly and give order that they march should be proclaim for the follow day at daybreak he give the signal for departure by sound of trumpet at the very moment when the army have get clear of the camp be form itself the volscian as if they have be arouse by the same signal fall upon those in the rear : from these the alarm spread to the van throw both the battalion and company into such a state of consternation that neither could the general 's order be distinctly hear nor the line draw up no one thought of anything but flight in such loose order do they make they way through heap of dead body and arm that the enemy cease they pursuit sooner than the roman they flight the soldier have at length rally from they disorder flight the consul after he have in vain follow he man bid they return pitch he camp in a peaceful part of the country and have convene a assembly after inveigh not without good reason against the army as traitor to military discipline deserter of they post ask they one by one where be they standard where they arm he first beat with rod and then behead those soldier who have throw down they arm the standard-bearer who have lose they standard and also the centurion and those who receive double allowance -lrb- 76 -rrb- who have desert they rank with respect to the rest of the rank and file every tenth man be draw by lot for punishment on the other hand the consul and soldier among the æquans vie with each other in courtesy and act of kindness : quinctius be naturally milder in disposition and the ill-fated severity of he colleague have cause he to give freer vent to he own good temper this remarkable agreement between the general and he army the æquans do not venture to meet but suffer the enemy to go through they country commit devastation in every direction nor be depredation commit more extensively in that quarter in any precede war the whole of the booty be give to the soldier in addition they receive praise in which the mind of soldier find no less pleasure than in reward the army return more reconcile both to they general and also thanks to the general to the patrician declare that a parent have be give to they a tyrant to the other army by the senate the year which have pass with varied success in war and violent dissension at home and abroad be render memorable chiefly by the election of tribe a matter which be more important from the victory in the contest -lrb- 77 -rrb- that be undertake than from any real advantage for more dignity be withdraw from the election themselves by the fact that the patrician be exclude from the council than influence either add to the common or take from the patrician -lrb- 78 -rrb- a still more stormy year follow when lucius valerius and titus æmilius be consul both by reason of the struggle between the different order concern the agrarian law as well as on account of the trial of appius claudius for whom marcus duilius and gnæus siccius appoint a day of trial as a most active opposer of the law and one who support the cause of the possessor of the public land as if he be a third consul -lrb- 79 -rrb- never before be a accuse person so hateful to the common bring to trial before the people overwhelm with they resentment against himself and also against he father the patrician too seldom make equal exertion so readily on one 's behalf : they declare that the champion of the senate and the upholder of they dignity set up as a barrier against all the storm of the tribune and common be expose to the resentment of the common although he have only exceed the bound of moderation in the contest appius claudius himself be the only one of the patrician who make light both of the tribune and common and he own trial neither the threat of the common nor the entreaty of the senate could ever persuade he even to change he garb or accost person as a suppliant or even to soften or moderate he usual harshness of speech in the least degree when he cause be to be plead before the people the expression of he countenance be the same the same stubbornness in he look the same spirit of pride in he language : so that a great part of the common feel no less awe of appius when on he trial than they have feel for he when consul he plead he cause only once and in the same haughty style of a accuser which he have be accustom to adopt on all occasion : and he so astounded both the tribune and the common by he intrepidity that of they own accord they postpone the day of trial and then allow the matter to die out no long interval elapse : before however the appoint day come he die of some disease and when the tribune of the people endeavor to put a stop to he funeral panegyric the common would not allow the burial day of so great a man to be defraud of the customary honor : and they listen to he eulogy when dead as patiently as they have listen to the charge bring against he when live and attend he obsequy in vast number in the same year the consul valerius have march with a army against the aequan and be unable to draw out the enemy to a engagement proceed to attack they camp a dreadful storm come down from heaven accompany by thunder and hail prevent he then on a signal for a retreat be give they surprise be excite by the return of such fair weather that they feel scruple about attack a second time a camp which be defend as it be by some divine power : all the violence of the war be direct to plunder the country the other consul aemilius conduct the war in sabine territory there also because the enemy confine themselves within they wall the land be lay waste then the sabine rouse by the burning not only of the farm but of the village also which be thickly inhabit after they have fall in with the raider retire from a engagement the issue of which be leave undecided and on the follow day remove they camp into a safer situation this seem a sufficient reason to the consul why he should leave the enemy as conquered and depart thence although the war be as yet unfinished during these war while dissension still continue at home titus numicius priscus and aulus verginius be elect consul the common appear determine no longer to brook the delay in accept the agrarian law and extreme violence be on the point of be resort to when it become know by the smoke from the burning farm and the flight of the peasant that the volscian be at hand this circumstance check the sedition that be now ripe and on the point of break out the consul under the immediate compulsion of the senate lead forth the youth from the city to war and thereby render the rest of the common more quiet and the enemy indeed have merely fill the roman with fear that prove groundless depart in great haste numicius march to antium against the volscian verginius against the aequan there after they have nearly meet with a great disaster in a attack from a ambuscade the bravery of the soldier restore they fortune which have be endanger through the carelessness of the consul affair be conduct better in the case of the volscian the enemy be route in the first engagement and drive in flight into the city of antium a very wealthy place consider the time : the consul not venture to attack it take from the people of antium another town caeno -lrb- 80 -rrb- which be by no means so wealthy while the aequan and volscian engage the attention of the roman army the sabine advance in they depredation even to the gate of the city : then they themselves a few day later sustain from the two army heavier loss than they have inflict both the consul have enter they territory under the influence of exasperation at the close of the year to some extent there be peace but as frequently at other time a peace disturb by contest between the patrician and common the exasperated common refuse to attend the consular election : titus quinctius and quintus servilius be elect consul through the influence of the patrician and they dependent : the consul have a year similar to the precede disturb at the beginning and afterward tranquil by reason of war abroad the sabine cross the plain of crustumerium by force march after carry fire and sword along the bank of the anio be repulse when they have nearly come up to the colline gate and the wall drive off however great booty of man and cattle : the consul servilius have pursue they with a army bent on attack they be unable to overtake the main body itself in the level country : he however extend he devastation over such a wide area that he leave nothing unmolested by war and return after have obtain booty many time greater than that carry off by the enemy the public cause be also extremely well support among the volscian by the exertion both of the general and the soldier first a pitched battle be fight on level ground with great slaughter and much bloodshed on both side : and the roman because they small number cause they loss to be more keenly feel would have give way have not the consul by a well-timed fiction reanimate the army by cry out that the enemy be in flight on the other wing have charge they by believe themselves victorious become so the consul fear lest by press on too far he might renew the contest give the signal for retreat a few day intervene both side rest as if by tacit suspension of hostility : during these day a vast number of person from all the state of the volscian and equan come to the camp feeling no doubt that the roman would depart during the night if they perceive they accordingly about the third watch -lrb- 81 -rrb- they come to attack the camp quinctius have allay the confusion which the sudden panic have occasion and order the soldier to remain quiet in they tent lead out a cohort of the hernican for a advance guard : the trumpeter and horn blower he mount on horseback and command they to sound they trumpet before the rampart and to keep the enemy in suspense till daylight : during the rest of the night everything be so quiet in the camp that the roman have even the opportunity of sleeping -lrb- 82 -rrb- the sight of the armed infantry whom they both consider to be more numerous than they be and at the same time roman the bustle and neighing of the horse which become restless both from the fact of strange rider be mount on they and moreover from the sound of the trumpet frightening they keep the volscian intently await a attack of the enemy when the day dawn the roman invigorate and have enjoy a full sleep on be march out to battle at the first onset cause the volscian to give way wearied as they be from standing and keep watch : though indeed the enemy rather retire than be route because in the rear there be hill to which the unbroken rank behind the first line have a safe retreat the consul when he come to the uneven ground halt he army the infantry be keep back with difficulty they loudly demand to be allow to pursue the discomfited foe the cavalry be more violent : crowd round the general they cry out that they would proceed in front of the first line while the consul hesitate rely on the valor of he man yet have little confidence in the nature of the ground they all cry out that they would proceed and execution follow the shout fix they spear in the ground in order that they might be lighter to mount the height they advance uphill at a run the volscian have discharge they missile weapon at the first onset hurl down the stone that lay at they foot upon the roman as they be make they way up and have throw they into confusion by incessant blow strive to drive they from the higher ground : thus the left wing of the roman be nearly overborne have not the consul dispel they fear by rouse they to a sense of shame as they be on the point of retreat chide at the same time they temerity and they cowardice at first they stand they ground with determine firmness then as they recover they strength by still hold they position they venture to advance of themselves and renew they shout they encourage the whole body to advance : then have make a fresh attack they force they way up and surmount the unfavourable ground they be now on the point of gain the summit of the hill when the enemy turn they back and pursued and pursuer at full speed rush into the camp almost in one body during this panic

already in he former consulship recommend the bestowal of land on the people accordingly in he second consulship also both the advocate of the agrarian law encourage themselves to hope for the passing of the measure and the tribune take it up think that a result that have be frequently attempt in opposition to the consul might be obtain now that at any rate one consul support it : the consul remain firm in he opinion the possessor of state land -lrb- 1 -rrb- -- and these a considerable part of the patrician -- transfer the odium of the entire affair from the tribune to the consul complain that a man who hold the first office in the state be busy himself with proposal more befitting the tribune and be gain popularity by make present out of other people 's property a violent contest be at hand have not fabius compromise the matter by a suggestion disagreeable to neither party that under the conduct and auspices of titus quinctius a considerable tract of land have be take in the preceding year from the volscian : that a colony might be send to antium a neighbouring and conveniently situate maritime city : in this manner the common would come in for land without any complaint on the part of the present occupier and the state remain at peace this proposition be accept he secure the appointment of titus quinctius aulus verginius and publius furius as triumvir for distribute the land : such as wish to receive land be order to give in they name the attainment of they object create disgust immediately as usually happen and so few give in they name that volscian colonist be add to fill up the number : the rest of the people prefer to ask for land in rome rather than to receive it elsewhere the aequan sue for peace from quintus fabius -lrb- he have go thither with a army -rrb- and they themselves break it by a sudden incursion into latin territory in the following year quintus servilius -lrb- for he be consul with spurius postumius -rrb- be send against the aequan pitch he camp permanently in latin territory : unavoidable inaction hold the army in check since it be attack by illness the war be protracted to the third year when quintus fabius and titus quinctius be consul to fabius because he as conqueror have grant peace to the aequan that sphere of action be assign in a unusual manner -lrb- 2 -rrb- he set out with a sure hope that he name and renown would reduce the aequan to submission send ambassador to the council of the nation and order they to announce that quintus fabius the consul state that he have bring peace to rome from the aequan that from rome he now bring they war with that same right hand but now arm which he have formerly give to they in amity that the god be now witness and would presently take vengeance on those by whose perfidy and perjury that have come to pass that he however be matter as they might even now prefer that the aequan should repent of they own accord rather than suffer the vengeance of a enemy if they repent they would have a safe retreat in the clemency they have already experienced but if they still take pleasure in perjury they would wage war with the god enrage against they rather than they enemy these word have so little effect on any of they that the ambassador be near be ill-treated and a army be send to algidum -lrb- 3 -rrb- against the roman when news of this be bring to rome the indignity of the affair rather than the danger cause the other consul to be summon from the city thus two consular army advance against the enemy in order of battle intend to come to a engagement at once but as it happen that not much of the day remain one of the advance guard of the enemy cry out : this be make a show of war roman not wage it : you draw up you army in line of battle when night be at hand we need a longer period of daylight for the contest which be to come tomorrow at sunrise return to the field : you shall have a opportunity of fight never fear the soldier sting by these taunt be march back into camp till the follow day think that a long night be approach which would cause the contest to be delay then indeed they refresh they body with food and sleep : on the follow day when it be light the roman army take up they position some considerable time before at length the aequan also advance the battle be hotly contest on both side because the roman fight under the influence of resentment and hatred while the aequan be compel by a consciousness of danger incur by misconduct and despair of any confidence be repose in they hereafter to venture and to have recourse to the most desperate effort the aequan however do not withstand the attack of the roman troops and when have be defeat they have retire to they own territory the savage multitude with feeling not at all more disposed to peace begin to rebuke they leader : that they fortune have be intrust to the hazard of a pitched battle in which mode of fight the roman be superior that the aequan be better adapt for depredation and incursion and that several party act in different direction conduct war with greater success than the unwieldy mass of a single army accordingly have leave a guard over the camp they march out and attack the roman frontier with such fury that they carry terror even to the city : the fact that this be unexpected also cause more alarm because it be least of all to be fear that a enemy vanquish and almost besiege in they camp should entertain thought of depredation : and the peasant rush through the gate in a state of panic cry out that it be not a mere raid nor small party of plunderer but exaggerate everything in they groundless fear whole army and legion of the enemy that be close at hand and that they be hasten toward the city in hostile array those who be nearest carry to other the report hear from these report vague and on that account more groundless : and the hurry and clamor of those call to arm bear no distant resemblance to the panic that arise when a city have be take by storm it so happen that the consul quinctius have return to rome from algidum : this bring some relief to they terror and the tumult be calm after chide they for they dread of a vanquished enemy he set a guard on the gate then a meeting of the senate be summon and a suspension of business proclaim by they authority : he himself have set out to defend the frontier leave behind quintus servilius as prefect of the city find no enemy in the country affair be conduct with distinguished success by the other consul who have attack the enemy where he know that they would arrive laden with booty and therefore march with they army the more encumber cause they depredation to prove they destruction few of the enemy escape from the ambuscade all the booty be recover thus the return of the consul quinctius to the city put a end to the suspension of business which last four day a census -lrb- 4 -rrb- be then hold and the lustrum -lrb- footnote : the ceremony of purification take place every five year hence justrum come to be use for a period of five year -rrb- close by quinctius : the number of citizen rate be say to have be one hundred and four thousand seven hundred and fourteen not count orphan of both sex nothing memorable occur afterward among the æquans they retire into they town allow they possession to be consume by fire and devastate the consul after he have repeatedly carry devastation with a hostile army through the whole of the enemy 's country return to rome with great glory and booty the next consul be aulus postumius albus and spurius furius fusus furius be by some writer write fusius this i mention to prevent any one think that the change which be only in the name be in the person themselves there be no doubt that one of the consul be about tobegin hostility against the æquans the latter accordingly seek help from the volscian of ecetra this be readily grant -lrb- so keenly do these state contend in inveterate hatred against the roman -rrb- and preparation for war be make with the utmost vigor the hernican come to hear of it and warn the roman that the ecetran have revolt to the æquans : the colony of antium also be suspect because after the town have be take a great number of the inhabitant have flee thence for refuge to the æquans : and these soldier behave with the very greatest bravery during the course of the war after the æquans have be drive into the town when this rabble return to antium it alienate from the roman the colonist who be already of they own accord dispose to treachery the matter not yet be ripe when it have be announce to the senate that a revolt be intend the consul be charge to inquire what be go on the lead man of the colony be summon to rome when they have attend without reluctance they be conduct before the senate by the consul and give such answer to the question that be put to they that they be dismiss more suspected than they have come after this war be regard as inevitable spurius furius one of the consul to whom that sphere of action have fall have march against the aequan find the enemy commit depredation in the country of the hernican and be ignorant of they number because they have nowhere be see all together he rashly hazard a engagement with a army which be no match for they force be drive from he position at the first onset he retreat to he camp nor be that the end of he danger for both on the next night and the follow day he camp be beset and assault with such vigor that not even a messenger could be despatch thence to rome the hernican bring news both that a unsuccessful battle have be fight and that the consul and army be besiege and inspire the senate with such terror that the other consul postumius be charge to see to it that the commonwealth take no harm -lrb- 5 -rrb- a form of decree which have ever be deem to be one of extreme urgency it seem most advisable that the consul himself should remain at rome to enlist all such as be able to bear arm : that titus quinctius should be send as proconsul -lrb- 6 -rrb- to the relief of the camp with the army of the ally : to complete this army the latin and hernican and the colony of antium be order to supply quinctius with troops hurriedly raised-such be the name -lrb- subitarius -rrb- that they give to auxiliary raise for sudden emergency during those day many maneuver and many attack be carry out on both side because the enemy have the advantage in number attempt to harass the roman force by attack they on many side as not likely to prove sufficient to meet all attack while the camp be be besiege at the same time part of the army be send to devastate roman territory and to make a attempt upon the city itself should fortune favor lucius valerius be leave to guard the city : the consul postumius be send to prevent the plundering of the frontier there be no abatement in any quarter either of vigilance or activity watch be station in the city outpost before the gate and guard along the wall : and a cessation of business be observe for several day as be necessary amid such general confusion in the meantime the consul furius after he have at first passively endure the siege in he camp sally forth through the main gate -lrb- 7 -rrb- against the enemy when off they guard and though he might have pursue they he stop through apprehension that a attack might be make on the camp from the other side the lieutenant furius -lrb- he be also the consul 's brother -rrb- be carry away too far in pursuit : nor do he in he eagerness to follow they up observe eitherhi own party return or the attack of the enemy on he rear : be thus shut out have repeatedly make many unavailing effort to force he way to the camp he fall fight bravely in like manner the consul turn about to renew the fight on be inform that he brother be surround rush into the thick of the fight rashly rather than with sufficient caution be wound and with difficulty rescue by those around he this both damp the courage of he own man and increase the boldness of the enemy who be encourage by the death of the lieutenant and by the consul 's wound could not afterward have be withstand by any force as the roman have be drive into they camp be again be besiege be a match for they neither in hope nor in strength and the very existence of the state would have be imperil have not titus quinctius come to they relief with foreign troops the latin and hernican army he attack the aequan on they rear while they attention be fix on the roman camp and while they be insultingly display the head of the lieutenant : and a sally be make at the same time from the camp at a signal give by himself from a distance he surround a large force of the enemy of the aequan in roman territory the slaughter be less they flight more disorderly as they straggle in different direction drive they plunder before they postumius attack they in several place where he have post body of troops in advantageous position they while stray about and pursue they flight in great disorder fall in with the victorious quinctius as he be return with the wound consul then the consular army by its distinguished bravery amply avenge the consul 's wound and the death of the lieutenant and the slaughter of the cohort heavy loss be both inflict and receive on both side during those day in a matter of such antiquity it be difficult to state so as to inspire conviction the exact number of those who fight or fall : antias valerius however venture to give a estimate of the number : that in the hernican territory there fall five thousand eight hundred roman that of the predatory party of the aequan who stray through the roman frontier for the purpose of plunder two thousand four hundred be slay by the consul aulus postumius that the rest of the body which fall in with quinctius while drive its booty before they by no means get off with a loss equally small : of these he assert that four thousand and by way of state the number exactly two hundred and thirty be slay after they return to rome the cessation of business be abandon the sky seem to be all ablaze with fire and other prodigy either actually present themselves before man 's eye or exhibit imaginary appearance to they affrighted mind to avert these terror a solemn festival for three day be proclaim during which all the shrine be fill with a crowd of man and woman earnestly implore the favor of the god after this the latin and hernican cohort be send back to they respective home after they have be thank by the senate for they spirited conduct in war the thousand soldier from antium be dismiss almost with disgrace because they have come after the battle too late to render assistance the election be then hold : lucius aebutius and publius servilius be elect consul and enter on they office on the calends of August -lrb- 8 -rrb- accord to the practice of begin the year on that date it be a unhealthy season and it so happen that the year -lrb- 9 -rrb- be pestilential to the city and country and not more to man than to cattle and they themselves increase the severity of the disease by admit the cattle and the peasant into the city in consequence of they dread of devastation this collection of animal of every kind mingle together both distressed the inhabitant of the city by the unusual stench and also the peasant crowd together into they confine dwelling by heat and want of sleep while they attendance on each other and actual contact help to spread disease while they be hardly able to endure the calamity that press upon they ambassador from the hernican suddenly bring word that the aequan and volscian have unite they force and pitch they camp in they territory : that from thence they be devastate they frontier with a immense army in addition to the fact that the small attendance of the senate be a proof to the ally that the state be prostrate by the pestilence they further receive this melancholy answer : that the hernican as well as the latin must now defend they possession by they own unaided exertion that the city of rome through the sudden anger of the god be ravage by disease if any relief from that calamity should arise that they would afford aid to they ally as they have do the year before and always on other occasion the ally depart carry home instead of the melancholy news they have bring news still more melancholy see that they be now oblige to sustain by they own resource a war which they would have with difficulty sustain even if back by the power of rome the enemy no longer confine themselves to the hernican territory they proceed thence with determine hostility into the roman territory which be already devastate without the injury of war there without any one meet they not even a unarmed person they pass through entire tract destitute not only of troops but even uncultivated and reach the third milestone on the gabinian road -lrb- 10 -rrb- aebutius the roman consul be dead : he colleague servilius be drag out he life with slender hope of recovery most of the lead man the chief part of the patrician nearly all those of military age be stricken down with disease so that they not only have not sufficient strength for the expedition which amid such a alarm the state of affair require but scarcely even for quietly mount guard those senator whose age and health permit they personally discharge the duty of sentinel the patrol and general supervision be assign to the plebeian aedile : on they devolve the chief conduct of affair and the majesty of the consular authority the commonwealth thus desolate since it be without a head and without strength be save by the guardian god and good fortune of the city which inspire the volscian and æquans with the disposition of freebooter rather than of enemy for so far be they mind from entertain any hope not only of take but even of approach the wall of rome and so thoroughly do the sight of the house in the distance and the adjacent hill divert they thought that on a murmur arise throughout the entire camp -- why should they waste time in indolence without booty in a wild and desert land amid the pestilence engender by cattle and human being when they could repair to place as yet unattacked -- the tusculan territory abound in wealth they suddenly pull up they standard -lrb- 11 -rrb- and by cross-country march pass through the lavican territory to the tusculan hill : to that quarter the whole violence and storm of the war be direct in the meantime the hernican and latin influence not only by compassion but by a feeling of shame if they neither oppose the common enemy who be make for the city of rome with a hostile army nor afford any aid to they ally when besiege march to rome with united force not find the enemy there they follow they track in the direction they be report to have take and meet they as they be come down from tusculan territory into the alban valley : there a battle be fight under circumstance by no means equal and they fidelity prove by no means favourable to the ally for the time be the havoc cause by pestilence at rome be not less than that cause by the sword among the ally : the only survive consul die as well as other distinguished man marcus valerius titus verginius rutilus augur : servius sulpicius chief priest of the curie : -lrb- 12 -rrb- while among undistinguished person the virulence of the disease spread extensively : and the senate destitute of human aid direct the people 's attention to the god and to vow : they be order to go and offer supplication with they wife and child and to entreat the favor of heaven besides the fact that they own suffering oblige each to do so when summon by public authority they fill all the shrine the prostrate matron in every quarter sweep the temple with they hair beg for a remission of the divine displeasure and a termination to the pestilence from this time whether it be that the favor of the god be obtain or that the more unhealthful season of the year be now over the bodily condition of the people now rid of disease gradually begin to be more healthy and they attention be now direct to public concern after the expiration of several interregnum publius valerius publicolum on the third day after he have enter on he office of interrex -lrb- 13 -rrb- procure the election of lucius lucretius tricipitinus and titus veturius -lrb- or vetusius -rrb- geminus to the consulship they enter on they consulship on the third day before the ides of August -lrb- 14 -rrb- the state be now strong enough not only to repel a a hostile attack but even to act itself on the offensive therefore when the hernican announce that the enemy have cross over into they boundary assistance be readily promise : two consular army be enrol veturius be send against the volscian to carry on a offensive war tricipitinus be post to protect the territory of the ally from devastation proceed no further than into the countryof the hernican veturius route and put the enemy to flight in the first engagement a party of plunderer lead over the praenestine mountain and from thence send down into the plain be unobserved by lucretius while he lay encamp among the hernican these lay waste all the countryaround praeneste and gabius : from the gabinian territory they turn they course toward the height of tusculum great alarm be excite in the city of rome also more from the suddenness of the affair than because there be not sufficient strength to repel the attack quintus fabius be in command of the city he have arm the young man and post guard make thing secure and tranquil the enemy therefore not venture to approach the city when they be return by a circuitous route carry off plunder from the adjacent place they caution be now more relax in proportion as they remove to a greater distance from the enemy 's city fall in with the consul lucretius who have already reconnoitr he line of march and whose army be draw up in battle array and resolve upon a engagement accordingly have attack they with predetermine resolution though with considerably inferior force they route and put to flight they numerous army while smitten with sudden panic and have drive they into the deep valley where means of egress be not easy they surround they there the power of the volscian be almost entirely annihilate in some annals i find that thirteen thousand four hundred and seventy fall in battle and in flight that one thousand seven hundred and fifty be take alive that twenty-seven military standard be capture : and although in account there may have be some exaggeration in regard to number undoubtedly great slaughter take place the victorious consul have obtain immense booty return to he former standing camp then the consul join camp the volscian and æquans also unite they shattered strength this be the third battle in that year the same good fortune give they victory the enemy be route and they camp take thus the affair of rome return to they former condition and success abroad immediately excite commotion in the city gaius terentilius harsa be tribune of the people in that year : he consider that a opportunity be afford for tribunician intrigue during the absence of the consul begin after railing against the arrogance of the patrician for several day before the people to inveigh chiefly against the consular authority as be excessive and intolerable for a free state : for that in name only be it less hateful in reality it be almost more cruel than the authority of the king : that forsooth in place of one two master have be accept with unbounded and unlimited power who themselves unrestrained and unbridled direct all the terror of the law and all kind of punishment against the common now in order that they unbounded license might not last forever he would bring forward a law that five person be appoint to draw up law regard the consular power by which the consul should use that right which the people should have give he over they not consider they own caprice and license as law notice have be give of this law as the patrician be afraid lest in the absence of the consul they should be subject to the yoke the senate be convene by quintus fabius prefect of the city who inveigh so vehemently against the bill and its proposer that no kind of threat or intimidation be omit by he which both the consul could supply even though they surround the tribune in all they exasperation : that he have lie in wait and have seize a favourable opportunity have make a attack on the commonwealth if the god in they anger have give they any tribune like he in the preceding year during the pestilence and war it could not have be endure : that when both the consul be dead and the state prostrate and enfeebled in the midst of the general confusion he would have propose law to abolish the consular government altogether from the state that he would have head the volscian and æquans in a attack on the city what if the consul behave in a tyrannical or cruel manner against any of the citizen be it not open to he to appoint a day of trial for they to arraign they before those very judge against any one of whom severity might have be exercise that he by he conduct be render not the consular authority but the tribunician power hateful and insupportable which after have be in a state of peace and on good term with the patrician be now be bring back anew to its former mischievous practice nor do he beg of he not to proceed as he have begin of you the other tribune say fabius we beg that you will first of all consider that that power be appoint for the aid of individual not for the ruin of the community that you be create tribune of the common not enemy of the patrician to we it be distressing to you a source of odium that the republic now bereft of its chief magistrate should be attack you will diminish not you rights but the odium against you confer with you colleague that he may postpone this business till the arrival of the consul to be then discuss afresh even the æquans and the volscian when we consul be carry off by pestilence last year do not harass we with a cruel and tyrannical war the tribune confer with terentilius and the bill be to all appearance defer but in reality abandon the consul be immediately send for lucretius return with immense spoil and much greater glory and this glory he increase on he arrival by expose all the booty in the campus martius so that each person might for the space of three day recognize what belong to he and carry it away the remainder for which no owner be forthcoming be sell a triumph be by universal consent due to the consul but the matter be defer as the tribune again urge he law this to the consul seem of greater importance the business be discuss for several day both in the senate and before the people : at last the tribune yield to the majesty of the consul and desist then they due honor be pay to the general and he army he triumph over the volscian and æquans he troops follow he in he triumph the other consul be allow to enter the city in ovation -lrb- 15 -rrb- unaccompanied by he soldier in the following year the terentilian law be bring forward again by the entire college engage the serious attention of the new consul who be publius volumnius and servius sulpicius in that year the sky seem to be on fire and a violent earthquake take place : it be believe that a ox speak a phenomenon which have not be credit in the previous year : among other prodigy there be a shower of flesh which a large flock of bird be say to have carry off by peck at the fall piece : that which fall to the ground be say to have lie scatter about just as it be for several day without become taint the book be consult -lrb- 16 -rrb- by the duumvirus for sacred rite : danger of attack to be make on the highest part of the city and of consequent bloodshed be predict as threaten from a assemblage of stranger among other thing admonition be give that all intestine disturbance should be abandon -lrb- 17 -rrb- the tribune allege that that be do to obstruct the law and a desperate contest be at hand on a sudden however that the same order of event might be renew each year the hernican announce that the volscian and the æquans in spite of they strength be much impaired be recruit they army : that the center of event be situate at antium that the colonist of antium openly hold council at ecetra : that there be the head -- there be the strength -- of the war as soon as this announcement be make in the senate a levy be proclaim : the consul be command to divide the management of the war between they that the volscian should be the sphere of action of the one the æquans of the other the tribune loudly declare openly in the forum that the story of the volscian war be nothing but a got-up farce : that the hernican have be train to act they part : that the liberty of the roman people be now not even crush by manly effort but be baffle by cunning because it be now no longer believe that the volscian and the æquans who be almost utterly annihilate could of themselves begin hostility new enemy be seek for : that a loyal colony and one in they very vicinity be be render infamous : that war be proclaim against the unoffending people of antium in reality wage with the common of rome whom load with arm they be determine to drive out of the city with precipitous haste wreak they vengeance on the tribune by the exile and expulsion of they fellow-citizen that by these means -- and let they not think that there be any other object contemplate -- the law be defeat unless while the matter be still in abeyance while they be still at home and in the grab of citizen they take precaution so as to avoid be drive out of possession of the city or be subject to the yoke if they only have spirit support would not be want : that all the tribune be unanimous : that there be no apprehension from abroad no danger that the god have take care in the preceding year that they liberty could be defend with safety thus speak the tribune but on the other side the consul have place they chair -lrb- 18 -rrb- within view of they be hold the levy thither the tribune hasten down and carry the assembly along with they a few -lrb- 19 -rrb- be summon as it be by way of make a experiment and instantly violence ensue whomsoever the lictor lay hold of by order of the consul he the tribune order to be release nor do he own proper jurisdiction set a limit to each but they rest they hope on force and whatever they set they mind upon be to be gain by violence just as the tribune have behave in impede the levy in the same manner do the consul conduct themselves in obstruct the law which be bring forward on each assembly day the beginning of the riot be that the patrician refuse to allow themselves to be move away when the tribune order the people to proceed to give they vote scarcely any of the older citizen mixed themselves up in the affair inasmuch as it be one that would not be direct by prudence but be entirely abandon to temerity and daring the consul also frequently keep out of the way lest in the general confusion they might expose they dignity to insult there be one cæso quinctius a youth who pride himself both on the nobility of he descent and he bodily stature and strength to these endowment bestow on he by the god he himself have add many brave deed in war and eloquence in the forum so that no one in the state be consider readier either in speech or action when he have take he place in the midst of a body of the patrician pre-eminent above the rest carry as it be in he eloquence and bodily strength dictatorship and consulship combine he alone withstand the storm of the tribune and the populace under he guidance the tribune be frequently drive from the forum the common route and disperse such as come in he way come off ill-treated and strip : so that it become quite clear that if he be allow to proceed in this way the law be as good as defeat then when the other tribune be now almost throw into despair aulus verginius one of the college appoint a day for cæso to take he trial on a capital charge by this proceeding he rather irritated than intimidate he violent temper : so much the more vigorously do he oppose the law harass the common and persecute the tribune as if in a regular war the accuser suffer the accuse to rush headlong to he ruin and to fan the flame of odium and supply material for the charge he intend to bring against he : in the meantime he proceed with the law not so much in the hope of carry it through as with the object of provoke rash action on the part of cæso after that many inconsiderate expression and action of the younger patrician be put down to the temper of cæso alone owe to the suspicion with which he be regard : still the law be resist also aulus verginius frequently remark to the people : be you now sensible quirite that you can not at the same time have cæso as a fellow-citizen and the law which you desire though why do i speak of the law he be a hindrance to you liberty he surpass all the tarquin in arrogance wait till that man be make consul or dictator whom though but a private citizen you now see exercise kingly power by he strength and audacity many agree complain that they have be beat by he : and moreover urge the tribune to go through with the prosecution the day of trial be now at hand and it be evident that people in general consider that they liberty depend on the condemnation of cæso : then at length be force to do so he solicit the common individually though with a strong feeling of indignation he relative and the principal man of the state attend he titus quinctius capitolinus who have be thrice consul recount many splendid achievement of he own and of he family declare that neither in the quinctian family nor in the roman state have there ever appear such a promising genius display such early valor that he himself be the first under whom he have serve that he have often in he sight fight against the enemy spurius furius declare that cæso have be send to he by quinctius capitolinus have come to he aid when in the midst of danger that there be no single individual by whose exertion he consider the common weal have be more effectually re-established lucius lucretius the consul of the preceding year in the full splendor of recent glory share he own meritorious service with cæso he recount he battle detail he distinguished exploit both in expedition and in pitched battle he recommend and advise they to choose rather that a youth so distinguished endowed with all the advantage of nature and fortune and one who should prove the greatest support of whatsoever state he should visit should continue to be a fellow-citizen of they own rather than become the citizen of a foreign state : that with respect to those quality which give offence in he hot-headedness and overboldness they be such as increase year remove more and more every day : that what be lack prudence increase day by day : that as he fault decline and he virtue ripen they should allow so distinguish a man to grow old in the state among these he father lucius quinctius who bear the surname of cincinnatus without dwelling too often on he service so as not to heighten public hatred but solicit pardon for he youthful error implore they to forgive he son for he sake who have not give offence to any either by word or deed but while some through respect or fear turn away from he entreaty other by the harshness of they answer complain that they and they friend have be ill-treated make no secret of what they decision would be independently of the general odium one charge in particular bear heavily on the accuse that marcus volscius fictor who some year before have be tribune of the people have come forward to bear testimony : that not long after the pestilence have rage in the city he have fall in with a party of young man rioting in the subura -lrb- 20 -rrb- that a scuffle have take place : and that he elder brother not yet perfectly recover from he illness have be knock down by cæso with a blow of he fist : that he have be carry home half dead in the arm of some bystander and that he be ready to declare that he have die from the blow : and that he have not be permit by the consul of former year to obtain redress for such a atrocious affair in consequence of volscius vociferate these charge the people become so excited that cæso be near be kill through the violence of the crowd verginius order he to be seize and drag off to prison the patrician oppose force to force titus quinctius exclaim that a person for whom a day of trial for a capital offence have be appoint and whose trial be now close at hand ought not to be outrage before he be condemn and without a hear the tribune reply that he would not inflict punishment on he before he be condemn : that he would however keep he in prison until the day of trial that the roman people might have a opportunity of inflict punishment on one who have kill a man -lrb- 21 -rrb- the tribune be appeal to get themselves out of the difficulty in regard to they prerogative of render aid by a resolution that adopt a middle course : they forbid he be throw into confinement and declare it to be they wish that the accuse should be bring to trial and that a sum of money should be promise to the people in case he should not appear how large a sum of money ought to be promise be a matter of doubt : the decision be accordingly refer to the senate the accuse be detain in public custody until the patrician should be consult : it be decide that bail should be give : they bind each surety in the sum of three thousand ass how many surety should be give be leave to the tribune they fix the number at ten : on this number of surety the prosecutor admit the accuse to bail -lrb- 22 -rrb- he be the first who give public surety be discharge from the forum he go the follow night into exile among the tuscan when on the day of trial it be plead that he have withdraw into voluntary exile nevertheless at a meeting of the comitium under the presidency of verginius he colleague when appeal to dismiss the assembly : -lrb- 23 -rrb- the fine be rigorously exact from he father so that have sell all he effect he live for a considerable time in a out-of-the-way cottage on the other side of the tiber as if in exile this trial and the proposal of the law give full employment to the state : in regard to foreign war there be peace when the tribune as if victorious imagine that the law be all but pass owe to the dismay of the patrician at the banishment of cæso and in fact as far as regard the senior of the patrician they have relinquish all share in the administration of the commonwealth the junior more especially those who be the intimate friend of cæso redouble they resentful feeling against the common and do not allow they spirit to fail but the greatest improvement be make in this particular that they temper they animosity by a certain degree of moderation the first time when after cseso 's banishment the law begin to be bring forward these array and well prepare with a numerous body of client so attack the tribune as soon as they afford a pretext for it by attempt to remove they that no one individual carry home from thence a greater share than another either of glory or ill-will but the people complain that in place of one cæso a thousand have arise during the day that intervene when the tribune take no proceedings regard the law nothing could be more mild or peaceable than those same person they salute the plebeian courteously enter into conversation with they and invite they home : they attend they in the forum -lrb- 24 -rrb- and suffer the tribune themselves to hold the rest of they meeting without interruption : they be never discourteous to any one either in public or in private except on occasion when the matter of the law begin to be agitate in other respects the young man be popular and not only do the tribune transact all they other affair without disturbance but they be even re-elected or the following year without even a offensive expression much less any violence be employ but by soothing and carefully manage the common the young patrician gradually render they tractable by these artifice the law be evade through the entire year the consul gaius claudius the son of appius and publius valerius publicolum take over the government from they predecessor in a more tranquil condition the next year have bring with it nothing new : thought about carry the law or submit to it engross the attention of the state the more the younger patrician strive to insinuate themselves into favor with the plebeian the more strenuously do the tribune strive on the other hand to render they suspicious in the eye of the common by allege that a conspiracy have be form that cæso be in rome that plan have be concerted for assassinate the tribune for butcher the common that the commission assign by the elder member of the patrician be that the young man should abolish the tribunician power from the state and the form of government should be the same as it have be before the occupation of the sacred mount at the same time a war from the volscian and æquans which have now become a fix and almost regular occurrence every year be apprehend and another evil nearer home start up unexpectedly exile and slave to the number of two thousand five hundred seize the capitol and citadel during the night under the command of appius herdonius a sabine those who refuse to join the conspiracy and take up arm with they be immediately massacre in the citadel : other during the disturbance flee in headlong panic down to the forum : the cry to arm and the enemy be in the city be hear alternately the consul neither dare to arm the common nor to suffer they to remain unarmed uncertain what sudden calamity have assail the city whether from without or within whether arise from the hatred of the common or the treachery of the slave : they try to quiet the disturbance and while try to do so they sometimes arouse they for the populace panic-stricken and terrify could not be direct by authority they give out arm however but not indiscriminately only so that as it be yet uncertain who the enemy be there might be a protection sufficiently reliable to meet all emergency the remainder of the night they pass in post guard in suitable place throughout the city anxious and uncertain who the enemy be and how great they number daylight subsequently disclose the war and its leader appius herdonius summon the slave to liberty from the capitol say that he have espouse the cause of all the most unfortunate in order to bring back to they country those who have be exile and drive out by wrong and to remove the grievous yoke from the slave : that he have rather that be do under the authority of the roman people if there be no hope in that quarter he would rouse the volscian and aequan and would try even the most desperate remedy the whole affair now begin to be clearer to the patrician and consul besides the news however which be officially announce they dread lest this might be a scheme of the veientine or sabine and further as there be so many of the enemy in the city lest the sabine and etruscan troops might presently come up accord to a concerted plan and they inveterate enemy the volscian and aequan should come not to ravage they territory as before but even to the gate of the city as be already in part take many and various be they fear the most prominent among which be they dread of the slave lest each should harbor a enemy in he own house one whom it be neither sufficiently safe to trust nor by distrust to pronounce unworthy of confidence lest he might prove a more deadly foe and it scarcely seem that the evil could be resist by harmony : no one have any fear of tribune or common while other trouble so predominate and threaten to swamp the state : that fear seem a evil of a mild nature and one that always arise during the cessation of other ill and then appear to be lull to rest by external alarm yet at the present time that almost more than anything else weigh heavily on they sink fortune : for such madness take possession of the tribune that contend that not war but a empty appearance of war have take possession of the capitol to divert the people 's mind from attend to the law : that these friend and client of the patrician would depart in deeper silence than they have come if they once perceive that by the law be pass they have raise these tumult in vain they then hold a meeting for pass the law have call away the people from arm in the meantime the consul convene the senate another dread present itself by the action of the tribune greater than that which the nightly foe have occasion when it be announce that the man be lay aside they arm and quit they post publius valerius while he colleague still detain the senate hasten from the senate-house and go thence into the meeting-place to the tribune what be all this say he o tribune be you determine to overthrow the commonwealth under the guidance and auspices of appius herdonius have he be so successful in corrupt you he who by he authority have not even influence you slave when the enemy be over we head be it you pleasure that we should give up we arm and law be propose then direct he word to the populace : if quirite no concern for you city or for yourselve move you at least revere the god of you country now make captive by the enemy jupiter best and greatest queen juno and minerva and the other god and goddess -lrb- 25 -rrb- be be besiege a camp of slave now hold possession of the tutelary god of the state do this seem to you the behavior of a state in its sens such a crowd of enemy be not only within the wall but in the citadel command the forum a senate-house : in the meanwhile meeting be be hold in the forum the senate be in the senate-house : just as when tranquility prevail the senator give he opinion the other roman they vote do it not behoove all patrician and plebeian consul tribune god and man of all class to bring aid with arm in they hand to hurry into the capitol to liberate and restore to peace that most August residence of jupiter best and greatest o father romulus do thou inspire thy progeny with that determination of thine by which thou didst formerly recover from these same sabine this citadel when capture by gold order they to pursue this same path which thou as leader and thy army pursue lo i as consul will be the first to follow thee and thy footstep as far as i a mortal can follow a god then in conclude he speech he say that he be ready to take up arm that he summon every citizen of rome to arm if any one should oppose that he heedless of the consular authority the tribunician power and the devote law would consider he as a enemy whoever and wheresoever he might be in the capitol or in the forum let the tribune order arm to be take up against publius valerius the consul since they forbid it against appius herdonius that he would dare to act in the case of the tribune as the founder of he family -lrb- 26 -rrb- have dare to act in the case of the king it be now clear that matter would come to violent extremity and that a quarrel among roman would be exhibit to the enemy the law however could neither be carry nor could the consul proceed to the capitol night put a end to the struggle that have be begin the tribune yield to the night dread the arm of the consul -lrb- 27 -rrb- when the ringleader of the disturbance have be remove the patrician go about among the common and mingle in they meeting spread statement suit to the occasion : they advise they to take heed into what danger they be bring the commonwealth : that the contest be not one between patrician and common but that patrician and common together the fortress of the city the temple of the god the guardian god of the state and of private family be be deliver up to the enemy while these measure be be take in the forum for the purpose of appease the disturbance the consul in the meantime have retire to visit the gate and the wall fear that the sabine or the veientine enemy might bestir themselves during the same night messenger reach tusculum with news of the capture of the citadel the seizure of the capitol and also of the generally disturbed condition of the city lucius mamilius be at that time dictator at tusculum he have immediately convoke the senate and introduce the messenger earnestly advise that they should not wait until ambassador come from rome sue for assistance that the danger itself and importance of the crisis the god of ally and the good faith of treaty demand it that the god would never afford they a like opportunity of oblige so powerful a state and so near a neighbor it be resolve that assistance should be send the young man be enrol and arm give they on they way to rome at break of day at a distance they exhibit the appearance of enemy the æquans or volscian be think to be come then after the groundless alarm be remove they be admit into the city and descend in a body into the forum there publius valerius have leave he colleague with the guard of the gate be now draw up he force in order of battle the great influence of the man produce a effect on the people when he declare that when the capitol be recover and the city restore to peace if they allow themselves to be convince what hide guile be contain in the law propose by the tribune he mindful of he ancestor mindful of he surname and remember that the duty of protect the people have be hand down to he as hereditary by he ancestor would offer no obstruction to the meeting of the people follow he as they leader in spite of the fruitless opposition of the tribune they march up the ascent of the capitoline hill the tusculan troops also join they ally and citizen vie with each other as to which of they should appropriate to themselves the honor of recover the citadel each leader encourage he own man then the enemy begin to be alarm and place no dependence on anything but they position while they be in this state of alarm the roman and ally advance to attack they they have already burst into the porch of the temple when publius valerius be slay while cheer on the fight at the head of he man publius volumnius a man of consular rank see he fall have direct he man to cover the body he himself rush forward to take the place and duty of the consul owe to they excitement and impetuosity this great misfortune pass unnoticed by the soldier they conquer before they perceive that they be fight without a leader many of the exile defile the temple with they blood many be take prisoner : herdonius be slay thus the capitol be recover with respect to the prisoner punishment be inflict on each accord to he station as he be a freeman or a slave the tusculan receive the thanks of the roman : the capitol be cleansed and purify the common be state to have throw every man a farthing into the consul 's house that he might be bury with more splendid obsequy order be thus establish the tribune then urge the patrician to fulfill the promise give by publius valerius they press on claudius to free the shade of he colleague from breach of faith and to allow the matter of the law to proceed the consul assert that he would not suffer the discussion of the law to proceed until he have appoint a colleague to assist he these dispute last until the time of the election for the substitution of a consul in the month of December by the most strenuous exertion of the patrician lucius quinctius cincinnatus caeso 's father be elect consul to enter upon office without delay the common be dismay at be about to have for consul a man incense against they powerful by the support of the patrician by he own merit and by reason of he three son not one of whom be inferior to caeso in greatness of spirit while they be he superior in the exercise of prudence and moderation whenever occasion require when he enter upon office in he frequent harangue from the tribunal he be not more vehement in restrain the common than in reprove the senate owe to the listlessness of which body the tribune of the common now become a standing institution exercise regal authority by means of they readiness of speech and prosecution not as if in a republic of the roman people but as if in a ill-regulated household that with he son caeso valor constancy all the splendid qualification of youth in war and in peace have be drive and exile from the city of rome : that talkative and turbulent man sower of discord twice and even thrice re-elected tribune by the vilest intrigue live in the enjoyment of regal irresponsibility do that aulus verginius say he deserve less punishment than appius herdonius because he be not in the capitol considerably more by hercule if any one will look at the matter fairly herdonius if nothing else by avow himself a enemy thereby as good as give you notice to take up arm : this man by deny the existence of war take arm out of you hand and expose you defenceless to the attack of slave and exile and do you -- i will speak with all due respect for gaius claudius and publius valerius now no more -- do you decide to advance against the capitoline hill before you expel those enemy from the forum i feel ashamed in the sight of god and man when the enemy be in the citadel in the capitol when the leader of the exile and slave after profane everything take up he residence in the shrine of jupiter best and greatest arm be take up at tusculum sooner than at rome it be a matter of doubt whether lucius mamilius the tusculan leader or publius valerius and gaius claudius the consul recover the roman citadel and we who formerly do not suffer the latin to touch arm not even in they own defense when they have the enemy on they very frontier should have be take and destroy now have not the latin take up arm of they own accord tribune be this bring aid to the common to expose they in a defenceless state to be butcher by the enemy i suppose if any one even the humblest individual of you common -- which portion you have as it be break off from the rest of the state and create a country and a commonwealth of you own -- if any one of these be to bring you word that he house be beset by a armed band of slave you would think that assistance should be afford he : be then jupiter best and greatest when hem in by the arm of exile and of slave deserving of no human aid and do these person claim to be consider sacred and inviolable to whom the god themselves be neither sacred nor inviolable well but load as you be with crime against both god and man you proclaim that you will pass you law this year verily then on the day i be create consul it be a disastrous act of the state much more so even than the day when publius valerius the consul fall if you shall pass it now first of all say he quirite it be the intention of myself and of my colleague to march the legion against the volscian and the aequan i know not by what fatality we find the god more propitious when we be at war than in peace how great the danger from those state would have be have they known that the capitol be besiege by exile it be better to conjecture from what be past than to learn by actual experience the consul 's harangue have a great effect on the common : the patrician recover they spirit believe the state re-establish the other consul a more ardent partner than promoter of a measure readily allow he colleague to take the lead in measure of such importance claim to himself he share of the consular duty in carry these measure into execution then the tribune mock these declaration as empty go on to ask how the consul be go to lead out a army see that no one would allow they to hold a levy but reply quinctius we have no need of a levy since at the time publius valerius give arm to the common to recover the capitol they all take a oath to he that they would assemble at the command of the consul and would not depart without he permission we therefore publish a order that all of you who have swear attend to-morrow under arm at the lake regillus the tribune then begin to quibble and want to absolve the people from they obligation assert that quinctius be a private person at the time when they be bind by the oath but that disregard of the god which possess the present generation have not yet gain ground : nor do every one accommodate oath and law to he own purpose by interpret they as it suit he but rather adapt he own conduct to they wherefore the tribune as there be no hope of obstruct the matter attempt to delay the departure of the army the more earnestly on this account because a report have go out both that the augur have be order to attend at the lake regillius and that a place be to be consecrate where business might be transact with the people by auspices : and whatever have be pass at rome by tribunician violence might be repeal there in the assembly -lrb- 28 -rrb- that all would order what the consul desire : for that there be no appeal at a greater distance than a mile -lrb- 29 -rrb- from the city : and that the tribune if they should come there would like the rest of the quirite be subject to the consular authority this alarm they : but the greatest anxiety which affect they mind be because quinctius frequently declare that he would not hold a election of consul that the malady of the state be not of a ordinary nature so that it could be stop by the ordinary remedy that the commonwealth require a dictator so that whoever attempt to disturb the condition of the state might feel that from the dictatorship there be no appeal the senate be assemble in the capitol thither the tribune come with the common in a state of great consternation : the multitude with loud clamor implore the protection now of the consul now of the patrician : nor could they move the consul from he determination until the tribune promise that they would submit to the authority of the senate then on the consul 's lay before they the demand of the tribune and common decree of the senate be pass : that neither should the tribune propose the law during that year nor should the consul lead out the army from the city -- that for the future the senate decide that it be against the interest of the commonwealth that the same magistrate should be continue and the same tribune be reappoint the consul conform to the authority of the senate : the tribune be reappoint notwithstanding the remonstrance of the consul the patrician also that they might not yield to the common in any particular themselves propose to re-elect lucius quinctius consul no address of the consul be deliver with greater warmth during the entire year can i be surprise say he if you authority with the people be hold in contempt o conscript father it be you yourselve who be weaken it forsooth because the common have violate a decree of the senate by reappoint they magistrate you yourselve also wish it to be violate that you may not be outdo by the populace in rashness as if greater power in the state consist in the possession of greater inconstancy and liberty of action for it be certainly more inconstant and greater folly to render null and void one 's own decree and resolution than those of other do you o conscript father imitate the unthinking multitude and do you who should be a example to other prefer to transgress by the example of other rather than that other should act rightly by yours provide only i do not imitate the tribune nor allow myself to be declare consul contrary to the decree of the senate but as for you gaius claudius i recommend that you as well as myself restrain the roman people from this licentious spirit and that you be persuade of this as far as i be concern that i shall take it in such a spirit that i shall not consider that my attainment of office have be obstruct by you but that the glory of have decline the honor have be augmented and the odium which would threaten I if it be continue lessen thereupon they issue this order jointly : that no one should support the election of lucius quinctius as consul : if any one should do so that they would not allow the vote the consul elect be quintus fabius vibulanus -lrb- for the third time -rrb- and lucius cornelius maluginensis the census be take during that year it be a matter of religious scruple that the lustrum should be close on account of the seizure of the capitol and the death of the consul in the consulship of quintus fabius and lucius cornelius disturbance wake out immediately at the beginning of the year the tribune be urge on the common the latin and hernican bring word that a formidable war be threaten on the part of the volscian and æquans that the troops of the volscian be now in the neighborhood of antium great apprehension be also entertain that the colony itself would revolt : and with difficulty the tribune be prevail upon to allow the war to be attend to first the consul divide they respective sphere of action fabius be commission to march the legion to antium : to cornelius be assign the duty of keep guard at rome lest any portion of the enemy 's troops as be the practice of the aequan should advance to commit depredation the hernican and latin be order to supply soldier in accordance with the treaty and of the army two third consist of ally the remainder of roman citizen when the ally arrive on the appoint day the consul pitch he camp outside the porta capena -lrb- 30 -rrb- then after the army have be review he set out for antium and encamp not far from the town and fixed quarter of the enemy there when the volscian not venture to risk a engagement because the contingent from the aequan have not yet arrive be make preparation to see how they might protect themselves quietly within they rampart on the follow day fabius draw up not one mixed army of ally and citizen but three body of the three state separately around the enemy 's work he himself occupy the center with the roman legion he order they to watch for the signal for action so that at the same time both the ally might begin the action together and retire together if he should give order to sound a retreat he also post the proper cavalry of each division behind the front line have thus assail the camp at three different point he surround it : and press on from every side he dislodge the volscian who be unable to withstand he attack from the rampart have then cross the fortification he drive out from the camp the crowd who be panic-stricken and incline to make for one direction upon this the cavalry who could not have easily pass over the rampart have stand by till then as mere spectator of the fight come up with they while fly in disorder over the open plain and enjoy a share of the victory by cut down the affrighted troops great be the slaughter of the fugitive both in the camp and outside the line but the booty be still greater because the enemy be scarcely able to carry off they arm with they and the entire army would have be destroy have not the wood cover they in they flight while these event be take place at antium the aequan in the meanwhile send forward the flower of they youth surprise the citadel of tusculum by night : and with the rest of they army sit down at no great distance from the wall of tusculutn so as to divide the force of the enemy -lrb- 31 -rrb- news of this be quickly bring to rome and from rome to the camp at antium affect the roman no less than if it have be announce that the capitol be take so recent be the service render by the tusculan and the very similarity of the danger seem to demand a return of the aid that have be afford fabius give up all thought of everything else remove the booty hastily from the camp to antium : and have leave a small garrison there hurry on he army by force march to tusculum the soldier be allow to take with they nothing but they arm and whatever baked provision be at hand the consul cornelius send up provision from rome the war be carry on at tusculum for several month with one part of he army the consul assail the camp of the aequan he have give part to the tusculan to aid in the recovery of they citadel they could never have make they way up to it by force : at length famine cause the enemy to withdraw from it when matter subsequently come to extremity they be all send under the yoke -lrb- 32 -rrb- by the tusculan unarmed and naked while return home in ignominious flight they be overtake by the roman consul at algidum and cut to piece to a man -lrb- 33 -rrb- after this victory have march back he army to columan -lrb- so be the place name -rrb- he pitch he camp there the other consul also as soon as the roman wall cease to be in danger now that the enemy have be defeat set out from rome thus the consul have enter the territory of the enemy on two different side in eager rivalry plunder the territory of the volscian on the one hand and of the aequan on the other i find it state by several writer that the people of antium revolt during the same year that lucius cornelius the consul conduct that war and take the town i would not venture to assert it for certain because no mention be make of the matter in the older writer this war be conclude a tribunician war at home alarm the senate the tribune hold that the detention of the army abroad be due to a fraudulent motive : that that deception be intend to prevent the passing of the law that they however would none the less go through with the matter they have undertake publius lucretius however the prefect of the city so far prevail that the proceedings of the tribune be postpone till the arrival of the consul a new cause of disturbance have also arise the quæstors -lrb- 34 -rrb- aulus cornelius and quintus servilius appoint a day of trial for marcus volscius because he have come forward as a manifestly false witness against caeso for it be establish by many proof that the brother of volscius from the time he first fall ill have not only never be see in public but that he have not even leave he bed after he have be attack by illness and that he have die of a waste disease of several month ' standing and that at the time to which the witness have refer the commission of the crime caeso have not be see at rome : while those who have serve in the army with he positively state that at that time he have regularly attend at he post along with they without any leave of absence many on they own account propose to volscius to refer the matter to the decision of a arbitrator as he do not venture to go to trial all these point coincide render the condemnation of volscius no less certain than that of caeso have be on the testimony of volscius the tribune be the cause of delay who say that they would not suffer the quæstors to hold the assembly concern the accuse unless it be first hold concern the law thus both matter be spin out till the arrival of the consul when they enter the city in triumph with they victorious army because nothing be say about the law many think that the tribune be strike with dismay but they in reality -lrb- for it be now the close of the year -rrb- be eager to obtain a fourth tribuneship have turn away they effort from the law to the discussion of the election and when the consul with the object of lessen they dignity oppose the continuation of they tribuneship with no less earnestness than if the law in question have be propose the victory in the contest be on the side of the tribune in the same year peace be grant to the aequan on they sue for it the census begin in the preceding year be complete : this be say to have be the tenth lustrum that be complete from the date of the foundation of the city the number of citizen rate be one hundred and seventeen thousand three hundred and nineteen the consul obtain great glory this year both at home and in war because they establish peace abroad while at home though the state be not in a condition of absolute harmony yet it be less harass by dissension than at other time lucius minucius and gaius nautius be next elect consul take up the two cause which remain undecided from the preceding year as before the consul obstruct the law the tribune the trial of volscius : but in the new quæstors there be greater power and greater influence with marcus valerius son of manius and grandson of volesus titus quinctius capitolinus who have be thrice consul be appoint quaestor since caeso could neither be restore to the quinctian family nor to the state though a most promising youth do he justly and as in duty bind prosecute the false witness who have deprive a innocent person of the power of plead he cause when verginius more than any of the tribune busy himself about the passing of the law the space of two month be allow the consul to examine into the law : on condition that when they have satisfy the people as to what secret design be conceal under it -lrb- 35 -rrb- they should then allow they to give they vote the grant of this respite establish tranquility in the city the aequan however do not allow they long rest : in violation of the treaty which have be make with the roman the year before they confer the chief command on gracchus cloelius he be then by far the chief man among the aequan under the command of gracchus they advance with hostile depredation into the district of labicus from thence into that of tusculum and laden with booty pitch they camp at algidum to that camp come quintus fabius publius volumnius aulus postumius ambassador from rome to complain of the wrong commit and to demand restitution in accordance with the treaty the general of the aequan command they to deliver to the oak the message they bring from the roman senate that he in the meantime would attend to other matter a oak a mighty tree whose shade form a cool resting-place overhang the general 's tent then one of the ambassador when depart cry out : let both this consecrate oak and all the god hear that the treaty have be break by you and both lend a favourable ear to we complaint now and assist we arm presently when we shall avenge the rights of god and man that have be violate simultaneously as soon as the ambassador return to rome the senate order one of the consul to lead he army into algidum against gracchus to the other they assign as he sphere of action the devastation of the country of the aequan the tribune after they usual manner attempt to obstruct the levy and probably would have eventually succeed in do so have not a new and additional cause of alarm suddenly arise a large force of sabine commit dreadful devastation advance almost up to the wall of the city the field be lay waste the city be smite with terror then the common cheerfully take up arm two large army be raise the remonstrance of the tribune be of no avail nautius lead one against the sabine and have pitch he camp at eretum -lrb- 36 -rrb- by trifling incursion mostly by night he so desolate the sabine territory that in comparison with it the roman border seem almost undamaged by the war minucius neither have the same good fortune nor display the same energy in conduct he operation : for after he have pitch he camp at no great distance from the enemy without have experience any reverse of importance he keep himself through fear within the camp when the enemy perceive this they boldness increase as usually happen from the fear of other and have attack he camp by night when open force avail little they draw line of circumvallation around it on the follow day before these could close the means of egress by a rampart throw up on all side five horseman despatch between the enemy ' post bring news to rome that the consul and he army be besiege nothing could have happen so unexpected nor so unlooked-for accordingly the panic and the alarm be as great as if the enemy be besiege the city not the camp they summon the consul nautius and when there seem to be but insufficient protection in he and it be determine that a dictator should be appoint to retrieve they shatter fortune lucius quinctius cincinnatus be appoint by universal consent it be worth while for those person who despise all thing human in comparison with riches and who suppose that there be no room either for exalted honor or for virtue except where riches abound in great profusion to listen to the following : lucius quinctius the sole hope of the empire of the roman people cultivate a farm of four acre on the other side of the tiber which be call the quinctian meadow exactly opposite the place where the dock-yard now be there whether lean on a stake while digging a trench or while plough at any rate as be certain while engage on some work in the field after mutual exchange of salutation have take place be request by the ambassador to put on he toga and listen to the command of the senate -lrb- with wish that it might turn out well both for he and the commonwealth -rrb- he be astonished and ask whether all be well bid he wife racilium immediately bring he toga from the hut as soon as he have put it on and come forward after have first wipe off the dust and sweat the ambassador congratulating he unite in salute he as dictator : they summon he into the city and tell he what terror prevail in the army a vessel be prepare for quinctius by order of the government and he three son have come out to meet he receive he on landing at the other side then he other relative and he friend : then the greater part of the patrician accompany by this numerous attendance the lictor go before he he be conduct to he residence -lrb- 37 -rrb- there be a numerous concourse of the common also : but they by no means look on quinctius with the same satisfaction as they consider both that he be vest with excessive authority and be likely to prove still more arbitrary by the exercise of that same authority during that night however nothing be do except that guard be post in the city on the next day the dictator have enter the forum before daylight appoint as he master of the horse lucius tarquitius a man of patrician family but who though he have serve he campaign on foot by reason of he scanty means be yet consider by far the most capable in military matter among the roman youth with he master of the horse he enter the assembly proclaim a suspension of public business order the shop to be close throughout the city and forbid any one to attend to any private affair then he command all who be of military age to attend under arm in the campus martius before sunset with dress provision for five day and twelve stake apiece : those whose age render they unfit for active service be order to prepare victuals for the soldier near they while the latter be get they arm ready and procuring stake accordingly the young man run in all direction to procure the stake they take they whatever be nearest to each : no one be prevent from do so : all attend readily accord to the dictator 's order then the troops be draw up not more suitably for a march than for a engagement should occasion require it the dictator himself march at the head of the legion the master of the horse at the head of he cavalry in both body such exhortation be deliver as circumstance require : that they should quicken they pace that there be need of despatch that they might reach the enemy by night that the consul and the roman army be besiege that they have now be shut up for three day that it be uncertain what each day or night might bring with it that the issue of the most important affair often depend on a moment of time the soldier to please they leader exclaim among themselves : standard-bearer hasten follow soldier at midnight they reach algidum : and as soon as they perceive that they be near the enemy they halt there the dictator ride about and have observe as far as could be ascertain by night what the extent of the camp be and what be its nature command the tribune of the soldier to order the baggage to be throw into one place and that the soldier with they arm and bundle of stake should return to they rank he order be execute then with the regularity which they have observe on the march he draw the entire army in a long column around the enemy 's camp and direct that when the signal be give they should all raise a shout and that on the shout be raise each man should throw up a trench before he post and fix he palisade the order be issue the signal follow : the soldier carry out they instruction the shout echo around the enemy : it then pass beyond the camp of the enemy and reach that of the consul : in the one it occasion panic in the other great joy the roman observe to each other with exultation that this be the shout of they countryman and that aid be at hand take the initiative and from they watch-guard and outpost dismay the enemy the consul declare that there must be no delay that by that shout not only they arrival be intimate but that hostility be already begin by they friend and that it would be a wonder if the enemy 's camp be not attack on the farther side he therefore order he man to take up arm and follow he the battle be begin during the night they give notice by a shout to the dictator 's legion that on that side also the decisive moment have arrive the aequan be now prepare to prevent the work from be draw around they when the battle be begin by the enemy from within have turn they attention from those employ on the fortification to those who be fight on the inside lest a sally should be make through the center of they camp they leave the night free for the completion of the work and continue the fight with the consul till daylight at daybreak they be now encompass by the dictator 's work and be scarcely able to maintain the fight against one army then they line be attack by the army of quinctius which immediately after complete its work return to arm here a new engagement press on they : the former one have in no wise slackened then as the danger that beset they on both side press they hard turn from fight to entreaty they implore the dictator on the one hand the consul on the other not to make the victory they total destruction and to suffer they to depart without arm they be order by the consul to apply to the dictator : he incense against they add disgrace to defeat he give order that gracchus cloelius they general and the other leader should be bring to he in chain and that the town of corbio should be evacuate he add that he do not desire the life of the æquans : that they be at liberty to depart but that a confession might at last be wring from they that they nation be defeat and subdue they would have to pass under the yoke the yoke be form of three spear two fix in the ground and one tie across between the upper end of they under this yoke the dictator send the æquans the enemy 's camp which be full of all they belongings -- for he have send they out of the camp half naked -- have be take he distribute all the booty among he own soldier only : rebuke the consul 's army and the consul himself he say : soldier you shall not enjoy any portion of the spoil take from that enemy to whom you yourselve nearly become a spoil : and you lucius minucius until you begin to assume a spirit worthy of a consul shall command these legion only as lieutenant minucius accordingly resign he office of consul and remain with the army as he have be command but so meekly obedient be the mind of man at that time to authority combine with superior merit that this army remember he kindness rather than they own disgrace both vote a golden crown of a pound weight to the dictator and salute he as they preserver when he set out the senate at rome convene by quintus fabius prefect of the city order quinctius to enter the city in triumph in the order of march in which he be come the leader of the enemy be lead before he car : the military standard be carry before he : he army follow laden with spoil banquet be say to have be spread before the house of all and the soldier partaking of the entertainment follow the chariot with the triumphal hymn and the usual jest -lrb- 38 -rrb- after the manner of reveller on that day the freedom of the state be grant to lucius mamilius of tusculum amid universal approbation the dictator would have immediately lay down he office have not the assembly for the trial of marcus volscius the false witness detain he the fear of the dictator prevent the tribune from obstruct it volscius be condemn and go into exile at lanuvium quinctius lay down he dictatorship on the sixteenth day have be invest with it for six month during those day the consul nautius engage the sabine at eretum with distinguished success : besides the devastation of they land this additional blow also befall the sabine fabius be send to algidum as successor to minucius toward the end of the year the tribune begin to agitate concern the law but because two army be away the patrician carry they point that no proposal should be make before the people the common succeed in elect the same tribune for the fifth time it be say that wolf see in the capitol be drive away by dog and that on account of that prodigy the capitol be purify such be the transaction of that year quintus minucius and gaius horatius pulvillus be the next consul at the beginning of this year when there be peace abroad the same tribune and the same law occasion disturbance at home and matter would have proceed further -- so highly be man 's mind inflamed-had not news be bring as if for the very purpose that by a night attack of the aequan the garrison at corbio have be cut off the consul convene the senate : they be order to raise a hasty levy and to lead it to algidum then the struggle about the law be abandon a new dispute arise regard the levy the consular authority be on the point of be overpower by tribunician influence when a additional cause of alarm arise : that the sabine army have make a descent upon roman territory to commit depredation and from thence be advance toward the city this fear influence the tribune to allow the soldier to be enrol not without a stipulation however that since they themselves have be foiled for five year and as the present college be but inadequate protection for the common ten tribune of the people should henceforward be elect necessity extort this concession from the patrician : they only exact this proviso that they should not hereafter see the same man tribune the election for the tribune be hold immediately lest that measure also like other might remain unfulfilled after the war in the thirty-sixth year after the first tribune ten be elect two from each class and provision be make that they should be elect in this manner for the future the levy be then hold minucius march out against the sabine but find no enemy horatius when the æquans have put the garrison at corbio to the sword have take ortona also fight a battle at algidum in which he slew a great number of the enemy and drive they not only from algidum but from corbio and ortona he also raze corbio to the ground for have betray the garrison marcus valerius and spurius verginius be next elect consul quiet prevail at home and abroad the people be distressed for provision on account of the excessive rain a law be propose to make mount aventine public property -lrb- 39 -rrb- the same tribune of the people be re-elect in the following year titus romilius and gaius veturius be consul they strongly recommend the law in all they harangue declare that they be ashamed that they number have be increase to no purpose it that matter should be neglect during they two year in the same manner as it have be during the whole precede five while they be most busily employ in these matter a alarming message come from tusculum that the æquans be in tusculan territory the recent service of that state make they ashamed of delay relief both the consul be send with a army and find the enemy in they usual post in algidum there a battle be fight : upward of seven thousand of the enemy be slay the rest be put to flight : immense booty be obtain this the consul sell on account of the low state of the treasury this proceeding however bring they into odium with the army and also afford the tribune material for bring a charge against the consul before the common accordingly as soon as they go out of office in the consulship of spurius tarpeius and aulus aternius a day of trial be appoint for romilius by gaius calvius cicero tribune of the people for veturius by lucius alienus plebeian ædile they be both condemn to the great mortification of the patrician : romilius to pay ten thousand ass veturius fifteen thousand nor do this misfortune of they predecessor render the new consul more timid they say that on the one hand they might be condemn and that on the other the common and tribune could not carry the law then have abandon the law which by be repeatedly bring forward have now lose consideration the tribune adopt a milder method of proceed with the patrician let they say they at length put a end to dispute if law draw up by plebeian displeased they at least let they allow legislator to be choose in common both from the common and from the patrician who might propose measure advantageous to both party and such as would tend to the establishment of liberty on principle of equality the patrician do not disdain to accept the proposal they claim that no one should propose law except he be a patrician when they agree with respect to the law and differ only in regard to the proposer ambassador be send to athen spurius postumius albus aulus manlius publius sulpicius camerinus who be order to copy out the celebrated law of solon and to make themselves acquaint with the institution custom and law of the other state of greece the year be peaceful as regard foreign war the follow one when publius curiatius and sextus quinctilius be consul be still more quiet owe to the tribune observe uninterrupted silence which be occasion in the first place by they wait for the return of the ambassador who have go to athen and for the account of the foreign law in the next place two grievous calamity arise at the same time famine and pestilence destructive to man and equally so to cattle the land be leave desolate the city exhaust by a constant succession of death many illustrious family be in mourn the flamen quirinali -lrb- 40 -rrb- servius cornelius die also the augur gaius horatius pulvillus in he place the augur elect gaius veturius and that with all the more eagerness because he have be condemn by the common the consul quinctilius die and four tribune of the people the year be render a melancholy one by these manifold disaster as far as foreign foe be concern there be perfect quiet then gaius menenius and publius sestius capitolinus be elect consul nor in that year be there any foreign war : but disturbance arise at home the ambassador have now return with the athenian law the tribune therefore insist the more urgently that a beginning should at length be make of compile the law it be resolve that decemvir should be elect to rule without appeal and that there should be no other magistrate during that year there be for a considerable time a dispute whether plebeian should be admit among they : at length the point be concede to the patrician provide that the icilian law regard the aventine and the other devote law be not repeal in the three hundred and second year after the foundation of rome the form of government be a second time change the supreme power be transfer from consul to decemvir as it have pass before from king to consul the change be less remarkable because not of long duration for the joyous commencement of that government afterward run riot through excess on that account the sooner do the arrangement fall to the ground and the practice be revive that the name and authority of consul should be commit to two person the decemvir appoint be appius claudius titus genucius publius sestius lucius veturius gaius julius aulus manlius publius sulpicius publius curiatius titus romilius spurius postumius on claudius and genucius because they have be consul elect for that year the honor be confer in compensation for the honor of the consulate and on sestius one of the consul of the former year because he have propose the plan itself to the senate against the will of he colleague next to these be consider the three ambassador who have go to athen so that the honor might serve at once as a recompense for so distant a embassy while at the same time they consider that person acquaint with the foreign law would be of use in draw up the new code of justice the other make up the number they say that also person advance in year be appoint by the last suffrage in order that they might oppose with less warmth the opinion of other the direction of the entire government rest with appius through the favor of the common and he have assume a demeanor so different that from be a severe and harsh persecutor of the people he become suddenly a courter of the common and strove to catch every breath of popular favor they administer justice to the people individually every tenth day on that day the twelve fasce attend the administrator of justice one officer attend each of he nine colleague and in the midst of the singular unanimity that exist among themselves -- a harmony that sometimes prove prejudicial to private person -- the strictest equity be show to other in proof of they moderation it will be enough to instance a single case as a example though they have be appoint to govern without appeal yet upon a dead body be find bury in the house of publius sestius -lrb- 41 -rrb- a man of patrician rank and produce in the assembly gaius julius a decemvir appoint a day of trial for sestius in a matter at once clear and heinous and appear before the people as prosecutor of the man whose lawful judge he be if accuse : and relinquish he right -lrb- 42 -rrb- so that he might add what have be take from the power of the office to the liberty of the people while highest and lowest alike obtain from they this prompt administration of justice undefile as if from a oracle at the same time they attention be devote to the framing of law and the ten table be propose amid the intense expectation of all they summon the people to a assembly : and order they to go and read the law that be exhibit -lrb- 43 -rrb- and heaven grant it might prove favourable advantageous and of happy result to the commonwealth themselves and they child that they have equalize the rights of all both the highest and the lowest as far as could be devise by the ability of ten man : that the understanding and counsel of a greater number have greater weight let they turn over in they mind each particular among themselves discuss it in conversation and bring forward for public discussion whatever might be superfluous or defective under each particular : that the roman people should have such law only as the general consent might appear not so much to have ratify when propose as to have itself propose when they seem sufficiently correct in accordance with public opinion regard each section of the law as it be publish the law of the ten table be pass at the assembly voting by century which even at the present time amid the immense heap of law crowd one upon the other still remain the source of all public and private jurisprudence a rumor then spread that two table be need on the addition of which a digest as it be of the whole roman law could be complete the desire for this give rise as the day of election approach to a request that decemvir be appoint again the common by this time besides that they detest the name of consul no less than that of king do not even require the tribunician aid as the decemvir in turn allow a appeal but when the assembly for the election of decemvir be proclaim for the third market-day the flame of ambition burst out so powerfully that even the first man of the state begin to canvass individual -- fear i suppose that the possession of such high authority might become accessible to person not sufficiently worthy if the post be leave unoccupied by themselves -- humbly solicit from those very commons with whom they have often contend a honor which have be oppose by they with all they might the fact of they dignity be now lay aside in a contest at they time of life and after they have fill such high official position stimulate the exertion of appius claudius you would not have know whether to reckon he among the decemvir or the candidate he resemble at time more closely one canvass for office than one invest with it he asperse the noble extol all the most unimportant and insignificant candidate surround by the duellius and icilii who have be tribune he himself bustle about the forum through they means he recommend himself to the common until even he colleague who till then have be devote to he heart and soul turn they eye on he wonder what he be about it be evident to they that there be no sincerity in it that such affability amid such pride would surely prove not disinterested that this excessive lowering of himself and condescend to familiarity with private citizen be characteristic not so much of one eager to retire from office as of one seek the means of continue that office not daring openly to oppose he wish they set about mitigate he ardor by humor it they by common consent confer on he as be the youngest the office of preside at the election this be a artifice to prevent he appoint himself which no one ever do except the tribune of the people and that with the very worst precedent he however declare that with the favor of fortune he would preside at the election seize upon what should have be a obstacle as a lucky opportunity : and have succeed by a coalition in keep out of office the two quinctius capitolinus and cincinnatus and he own uncle gaius claudius a man most steadfast in the cause of the nobility and other citizen of equal eminence he secure the appointment as decemvir of man by no means they equal distinction -- himself in the first instance a proceeding which honorable man disapprove of greatly as no one believe that he would have venture to do it with he be elect marcus cornelius maluginensis marcus sergius lucius minucius quintus fabius vibulanus quintus poetilius titus antonius merenda cæso duilius spurius oppius cornicen manius rabuleius this be the end of appius 's play a part at variance with he disposition henceforward he begin to live accord to he natural character and to mould to he own temper he new colleague before they enter upon office they daily hold meeting in private : then instruct in they unruly design which they concoct apart from other now no longer dissemble they arrogance difficult of access captious to all who converse with they they protracted the matter until the ides of may the ides of may be at that time the usual period for begin office accordingly at the attainment of they magistracy they render the first day of they office remarkable by threat that inspire great terror for while the precede decemvir have observe the rule that only one should have the fasce and that this emblem of royalty should pass to all in rotation to each in he turn lo on a sudden they all come forth each with twelve fasce one hundred and twenty lictor fill the forum and carry before they the axis tie up with the fasce -lrb- 44 -rrb- give the explanation that it be of no consequence that the axe should be take away since they have be appoint without appeal there appear to be ten king and terror be multiply not only among the humblest individual but even among the principal man of the patrician who think that a excuse for the beginning of bloodshed be be seek for : so that if any one should have utter a word that hint at liberty either in the senate or in a meeting of the people the rod and axis would also instantly be bring forward for the purpose of intimidate the rest for besides that there be no protection in the people as the right of appeal have be abolish they have also by mutual consent prohibit interference with each other : whereas the precede decemvir have allow the decision pronounce by themselves to be amend by appeal to any one of they colleague and have refer to the people some point which seem naturally to come within they own jurisdiction for a considerable time the terror seem equally distribute among all rank gradually it begin to be direct entirely against the common while they spare the patrician arbitrary and cruel measure be take against the lower class as be person with whom interest usurp the force of justice they all take account of person rather than of cause they concerted they decision at home and pronounce they in the forum if any one appeal to a colleague he depart from the one to whom he have appeal in such a manner that he regret that he have not abide by the sentence of the former a irresponsible rumor have also go abroad that they have conspire in they tyranny not only for the present time but that a clandestine league have be conclude among they on oath that they would not hold the comitium but by perpetuate the decemvirate would retain supreme power now that it have once come into they possession the plebeian then begin narrowly to watch the countenance of the patrician and to strive to catch a glimpse of liberty from that quarter by apprehend slavery from which they have bring the republic into its present condition the lead member of the senate detest the decemvir detest the common they neither approve of what be go on and they consider that what befall the latter be not undeserved they be unwilling to assist man who by rush too eagerly toward liberty have fall into slavery : they even heap injury on they that from disgust at the present state of thing two consul and the former constitution might at length be regret by this time the greater part of the year have pass and two table of law have be add to the ten table of the former year and if these law also have be pass in the assembly of the century there would now have remain no reason why the republic should require that form of government they be anxiously wait to see how long it would be before the assembly would be proclaim for the election of consul the only thing that trouble the common be by what mean they should re-establish the tribunician power that bulwark of they liberty now so long discontinue no mention in the meantime be make of the election further the decemvir who have at first exhibit themselves to the people surround by man of tribunician rank because that be deem popular now guard themselves by band of young patrician : crowd of these beset the tribunal they harry the common and plunder they effect : when fortune be on the side of the more powerful individual in regard to whatever be coveted and now they spare not even they person : some be beat with rod other have to submit to the axe and that such cruelty might not go unrewarded a grant of he effect follow the punishment of the owner corrupt by such bribe the young noble not only make no opposition to oppression but openly avow a preference for they own selfish gratification rather than for the liberty of all the ides of may come round without any magistrate be elect in place of those retire private person -lrb- 45 -rrb- come forward as decemvir without any abatement either in they determination to enforce they authority or any alteration in the insignia display as outward sign of office that indeed seem undoubted regal tyranny liberty be now deplore as lose forever : no champion of it stand forth or seem likely to do so and not only be the roman themselves sink in despondency but they begin to be look down upon by the neighbouring state who feel indignant that sovereign power should be in the hand of a state where liberty do not exist the sabine with a numerous body of man make a incursion into roman territory and have commit extensive devastation after they have drive off with impunity booty of man and cattle they recall they troops which have be disperse in different direction to eretum where they pitch they camp ground they hope on the dissension at rome which they expect would prove a obstruction to the levy not only the courier but also the flight of the country people through the city inspire they with alarm the decemvir leave in a dilemma between the hatred of the patrician and people take counsel what be to be do fortune moreover bring a additional cause of alarm the aequan on the opposite side pitch they camp at algidum and by raid from there ravage tusculan territory news of this be bring by ambassador from tusculum implore assistance the panic thereby occasion urge the decemvir to consult the senate now that two war at once threaten the city they order the patrician to be summon into the senate-house well aware what a storm of resentment be ready to break upon they they feel that all would heap upon they the blame for the devastation of they territory and for the danger that threaten and that that would give they a opportunity of endeavor to abolish they office if they do not unite in resist and by enforce they authority with severity on a few who show a intractable spirit repress the attempt of other when the voice of the crier be hear in the forum summon the senator into the senate-house to the presence of the decemvir this proceeding as altogether new because they have long since give up the custom of consult the senate attract the attention of the people who full of surprise want to know what have happen and why after so long a interval they be revive a custom that have fall into abeyance : state that they ought to thank the enemy and the war that any of the custom of a free state be comply with they look around for a senator through all part of the forum and seldom recognize one anywhere : they then direct they attention to the senate-house and to the solitude around the decemvir who both themselves judge that they power be universally detest while the common be of opinion that the senator refuse to assemble because the decemvir now reduce to the rank of private citizen have no authority to convene they : that a nucleus be now form of those who would help they to recover they liberty if the common would but side with the senate and if as the patrician when summon refuse to attend the senate so also the common would refuse to enlist thus the common grumble there be hardly one of the patrician in the forum and but very few in the city in disgust at the state of affair they have retire into the country and busy themselves only with they private affair give up all thought of state concern consider that they themselves be out of reach of ill-treatment in proportion as they remove themselves from the meeting and converse of they imperious master when those who have be summon do not assemble state messenger be despatch to they house both to levy the penalty -lrb- 46 -rrb- and to make inquiry whether they purposely refuse to attend they bring back word that the senate be in the country this be more please to the decemvir than if they bring word that they be present and refuse obedience to they command they command they all to be summon and proclaim a meeting of the senate for the follow day which assemble in much greater number than they themselves have expect by this proceed the common consider that they liberty be betray by the patrician because the senate have obey those person as if they have a right to compel they who have already go out of office and be mere private individual be it not for the violence display by they however they show more obedience in come into the senate than obsequiousness in the opinion express by they as we have learn it be record that after appius claudius lay the subject of debate before the meeting and before they opinion be ask in order lucius valerius potitus excite a commotion by demand permission to express he sentiment concern the state and -- when the decemvir prevent he with threat -lrb- 47 -rrb- -- by declare that he would present himself before the people it be also record that marcus horatius barbatus enter the list with no less boldness call they ten tarquin and remind they that under the leadership of the valerius and horatius the king have be expel nor be it the mere name that man be then disgust with as be that by which it be proper that jupiter should be style as also romulus the founder of the city and the succeed king and a name too which have be retain also for the ceremony of religion -lrb- 48 -rrb- as a solemn one that it be the tyranny and arrogance of a king they then detest : and if these be not to be tolerate in that same king or the son of a king who would tolerate it in so many private citizen let they beware lest by prevent person from express they sentiment freely in the senate they oblige they to raise they voice outside the senate-house nor could he see how it be less allowable for he a private citizen to summon the people to a assembly than for they to convene the senate they might try whenever they please how much more determine a sense of wrong would be find to be when it be a question of vindicate one 's own liberty than ambition when the object be to preserve a unjust dominion that they propose the question concern the war with the sabine as if the roman people have any more important war on hand than that against those who have be elect for the purpose of frame law have leave no law in the state who have abolish election annual magistrate the regular change of ruler which be the only means of equalize liberty who though private citizen still possess the fasce and regal dominion that after the expulsion of the king patrician magistrate have be appoint and subsequently after the secession of the people plebeian magistrate what party be it he ask to which they belong to the popular party what have they ever do with the concurrence of the people to the party of the noble who for now nearly a entire year have not hold a meeting of the senate and then hold one in such a manner that they prevent the expression of sentiment regard the commonwealth let they not place too much hope in the fear of other the grievance which they be now suffer appear to man more oppressive than any they might apprehend while horatius be exclaim thus and the decemvir could not discover the proper bound either of they anger or forbearance nor see how the matter would end gaius claudius who be the uncle of appius the decemvir deliver a address more in the style of entreaty than reproach beseech he by the shade of he brother and of he father that he would hold in recollection the civil society in which he have be bear rather than the confederacy nefariously enter into with he colleague add that he besought this much more on appius 's own account than for the sake of the commonwealth for the commonwealth would claim its rights in spite of they if it could not obtain they with they consent : that however from a great contest great animosity be generally arouse : it be the result of the latter that he dread though the decemvir forbid they to speak on any subject save that which they have submit to they they feel too much respect for claudius to interrupt he he therefore conclude the expression of he opinion by move that it be they wish that no decree of the senate should be pass and all understand the matter thus that they be judge by claudius to be private citizen -lrb- 49 -rrb- and many of those of consular standing express they assent in word another measure more severe in appearance which order the patrician to assemble to nominate a interrex in reality have much less force for by this motion the mover give expression to a decide opinion that those person be magistrate of some kind or other who might hold a meeting of the senate while he who recommend that no decree of the senate should be pass have thereby declare they private citizen when the cause of the decemvir be now fail lucius cornelius maluginensis brother of marcus cornelius the decemvir have be purposely reserve from among those of consular rank to close the debate by affect a anxiety about the war defend he brother and he colleague by declare that he wonder by what fatality it have occur that those who have be candidate for the decemvirate either these or they friend have above all other attack the decemvir : or why when no one have dispute for so many month while the state be free from anxiety whether legal magistrate be at the head of affair they now at length sow the seed of civil discord when the enemy be nearly at the gate except it be that in a state of confusion they think that they object would be less clearly see through for the rest it be unfair that any one should prejudge a matter of such importance while they mind be occupy with a more momentous concern it be he opinion that in regard to what valerius and horatius allege -- that the decemvir have go out of office before the ides of may -- the matter should be discuss in the senate and leave to they to decide when the war which be now impending be over and the commonwealth restore to tranquility and that appius claudius be even now prepare to take notice that a account have to be render by he of the election which he himself as decemvir hold for elect decemvir whether they be elect for one year or until the law which be want be ratify it be he opinion that all other matter should be disregard for the present except the war and if they think that the report regard it be propagate without foundation and that not only the messenger but also the ambassador of the tusculan have state what be false he think that scout should be dispatch to bring back more certain information but if credit be give both to the messenger and the ambassador that the levy should be hold at the very earliest opportunity that the decemvir should lead the army whither each think proper : and that no other matter should take precedence the junior patrician almost succeed in get this resolution pass on a division accordingly valerius and horatius rise again with greater vehemence loudly demand that it should be allow they to express they sentiment concern the republic that they would address a meeting of the people if owe to party effort they be not allow to do so in the senate : for that private individual whether in the senate or in a general assembly could not prevent they : nor would they yield to they imaginary fasce appius now consider that the crisis be already nigh at hand when they authority would be overpower unless the violence of these be resist with equal boldness say it will be better for you not to utter a word on any subject except the subject of discussion and against valerius when he refuse to be silent for a private individual he command a lictor to proceed when valerius from the threshold of the senate-house now crave the protection of the citizen lucius cornelius embrace appius put a end to the struggle not in reality consult the interest of he whose interest he pretend to consult -lrb- 50 -rrb- and after permission to say what he please have be obtain for valerius by means of cornelius when this liberty do not extend beyond word the decemvir attain they object the man of consular rank also and senior member from the hatred of tribunician power still rankle in they bosom the longing for which they consider be much more keenly feel by the common than for the consular power almost prefer that the decemvir themselves should voluntarily resign they office at some future period than that the people should once more become prominent through hatred against these if the matter quietly conduct should again return to the consul without popular turbulence that the common might be induce to forget they tribune either by the intervention of war or by the moderation of the consul in exercise they authority a levy be proclaim without objection on the part of the patrician the young man answer to they name as the government be without appeal the legion have be enrol the decemvir proceed to arrange among themselves who should set out to the war who should command the army the leading man among the decemvir be quintus fabius and appius claudius the war at home appear more serious than abroad the decemvir consider the violence of appius better suit to suppress commotion in the city that fabius possess a disposition rather lack in firmness in a good purpose than energetic in a bad one for this man formerly distinguish at home and abroad have be so alter by he office of decemvir and the influence of he colleague that he choose rather to be like appius than like himself to he the war among the sabine be intrusted manius rabuleius and quintus paetilius be send with he as colleague marcus cornelius be send to algidum with lucius minucius titus antonius caeso duillius and marcus sergius : they appoint spurius oppius to assist appius claudius in protect the city while all the decemvir be to enjoy equal authority the republic be manage with no better success in war than at home in this the only fault in the general be that they have render themselves object of hatred to they fellow-citizen : in other respects the entire blame lay with the soldier who lest any enterprise should be successfully conduct under the leadership and auspices of the decemvir suffer themselves to be beat to they own disgrace and that of they general they army be route both by the sabine at eretum and by the æquans in algidum flee from eretum during the silence of the night they fortify they camp nearer the city on a elevated position between fidena and crustumerium nowhere encounter on equal ground the enemy who pursue they they protect themselves by the nature of the ground and a rampart not by valor or arm they conduct be more disgraceful and greater loss also be sustain in algidum they camp too be lose and the soldier strip of all they arm munitions and supplies betake themselves to tusculum determine to procure the means of subsistence from the good faith and compassion of they host and in these notwithstanding they conduct they be not disappointed such alarming account be bring to rome that the patrician have now lay aside they hatred of the decemvir pass a order that watch should be hold in the city and command that all who be not hinder by reason of they age from carry arm should mount guard on the wall and form outpost before the gate they also vote that arm should be send to tusculum besides a re-enforcement and that the decemvir should come down from the citadel of tusculum and keep they troops encamp that the other camp should be remove from fidena into sabine territory and the enemy by they thus attack they first should be deter from entertain any idea of assault the city in addition to the reverse sustained at the hand of the enemy the decemvir be guilty of two monstrous deed one abroad and the other in the city they send lucius siccius who be quarter among the sabine to take observation for the purpose of select a site for a camp : he avail himself of the unpopularity of the decemvir be introduce in he secret conversation with the common soldier suggestion of a secession and the election of tribune : the soldier whom they have send to accompany he in that expedition be commission to attack he in a convenient place and slay he they do not kill he with impunity several of the assassin fall around he as he offer resistance since possess great personal strength and display courage equal to that strength he defend himself against they although surround the rest bring news into the camp that siccius while fight bravely have fall into a ambush and that some soldier have be lose with he at first the account be believe afterward a party of man who go by permission of the decemvir to bury those who have fall when they observe that none of the body there be strip and that siccius lay in the midst fully armed and that all the body be turn toward he while there be neither the body of any of the enemy nor any trace of they departure bring back he body say that he have assuredly be slay by he own man the camp be now fill with indignation and it be resolve that siccius should be forthwith bring to rome have not the decemvir hasten to bury he with military honor at the public expense he be bury amid the great grief of the soldiery and with the worst possible infamy of the decemvir among the common people another monstrous deed follow in the city originate in lust and attend by result not less tragical than that deed which have bring about the expulsion of the tarquin from the city and the throne through the violation and death of lucretium : so that the decemvir not only come to the same end as the king but the reason also of they lose they power be the same appius claudius be seize with a criminal passion for violate the person of a young woman of plebeian rank lucius verginius the girl 's father hold a honorable rank among the centurion at algidum a man who be a pattern of uprightness both at home and in the service he wife and child be bring up in the same manner he have betroth he daughter to lucius icilius who have be tribune a man of spirit and of approve zeal in the interest of the people appius burning with desire attempt to seduce by bribe and promise this young woman now grow up and of distinguished beauty and when he perceive that all the avenue of he lust be bar by modesty he turn he thought to cruel and tyrannical violence consider that as the girl 's father be absent there be a opportunity for commit the wrong he instruct a dependent of he marcus claudius to claim the girl as he slave and not to yield to those who demand she enjoyment of liberty pend judgment the tool of the decemvir 's lust lay hand on the girl as she be come into the forum -- for there the elementary school be hold in booth -- call she the daughter of he slave and a slave herself and command she to follow he declare that he would drag she off by force if she demur the girl be strike dumb with terror a crowd collect at the cry of she nurse who beseech the protection of the citizen the popular name of she father verginius and of she betrothed icilius be in every one 's mouth esteem for they gain the good-will of they acquaintance the heinousness of the proceeding that of the crowd she be now safe from violence forasmuch as the claimant say that there be no occasion for rouse the mob that he be proceed by law not by force he summon the girl into court she supporter advise she to follow he they reach the tribunal of appius the claimant rehearse the farce well know to the judge as be in presence of the actual author of the plot that the girl bear in he house and clandestinely transfer from thence to the house of verginius have be father on the latter : that what he state be establish by certain evidence and that he would prove it even if verginius himself who would be the principal sufferer be judge : that meanwhile it be only fair the servant should accompany she master the supporter of verginium after they have urge that verginius be absent on business of the state that he would be present in two day if word be send to he and that it be unfair that in he absence he should run any risk regard he child demand that appius should adjourn the whole matter till the arrival of the father that he should allow the claim for she liberty pend judgment accord to the law pass by himself and not allow a maiden of ripe age to encounter the risk of she reputation before that of she liberty appius preface he decision by observe that the very same law which the friend of verginius put forward as the plea of they demand show how strongly he himself be in favor of liberty : that liberty however would find secure protection in the law on this condition only that it vary neither with respect to case or person for with respect to those individual who be claim as free that point of law be good because any citizen could proceed by law in such a matter : but in the case of she who be in the hand of she father there be no other person in whose favor she master need relinquish he right of possession -lrb- 51 -rrb- that it be he decision therefore that she father should be send for : that in the meantime the claimant should not be deprive of the right which allow he to carry off the girl with he at the same time promise that she should be produce on the arrival of he who be call she father when there be many who murmur against the injustice of this decision rather than any one individual who venture to protest against it the girl 's great-uncle publius numitorius and she betrothed icilius appear on the scene : and way be make for they through the crowd the multitude think that appius could be most effectually resist by the intervention of icilius the lictor declare that he have decide the matter and attempt to remove icilius when he begin to raise he voice such a monstrous injustice would have fire even a cool temper by the sword appius say he must i be remove hence that you may secure silence about that which you wish to be conceal this young woman i be about to marry to have and to hold as my lawful wife wherefore call together all the lictor of you colleague also order the rod and axis to be get ready : the betrothed wife of icilius shall not pass the night outside she father 's house no : though you have take from we the aid of we tribune and the power of appeal to the common of rome the two bulwark for the maintenance of we liberty absolute authority have not therefore be give to you lust over we wife and child vent you fury on we back and neck let chastity at least be secure if violence shall be offer to she i shall implore the protection of the citizen here present on behalf of my betrothed verginius that of the soldier on behalf of he only daughter all of we the protection of god and man nor shall you carry that sentence into effect without we blood i demand of you appius consider again and again to what length you be proceed verginius when he come will see to it what conduct he be to pursue with respect to he daughter : only let he be assure of this that if he yield to the claim of this man he will have to look out for another match for he daughter as for my part in vindicate the liberty of my spouse life shall leave I sooner than honor the multitude be now rouse and a contest seem threaten the lictor have take they stand around icilius they do not however proceed beyond threat while appius say that it be not verginium who be be defend by icilius but that be a restless man and even now breathe the spirit of the tribuneship he be seek a opportunity for create a disturbance that he would not afford he the chance of do so on that day but in order that he might now know that the concession have be make not to he petulance but to the absent verginius to the name of father and to liberty that he would not decide the case on that day nor introduce a decree : that he would request marcus claudius to forego somewhat of he right and to suffer the girl to be bail till the next day however unless the father attend on the follow day he give notice to icilius and to man like icilius that as the framer of it he would maintain he own law as a decemvir he firmness : that he would certainly not assemble the lictor of he colleague to put down the promoter of sedition that he would be content with he own when the time of this act of injustice have be defer and the friend of the maiden have retire it be first of all determine that the brother of icilius and the son of numitorius both active young man should proceed thence straight to the city gate and that verginius should be summon from the camp with all possible haste : that the safety of the girl depend on he be present next day at the proper time to protect she from wrong they proceed accord to direction and gallop at full speed carry the news to she father when the claimant of the maiden be press icilius to lay claim to she and give bail for she appearance and icilius say that that be the very thing that be be do purposely waste the time until the messenger send to the camp should finish they journey the multitude raise they hand on all side and every one show himself ready to go surety for icilius and he with he eye full of tear say : this be a great favor to-morrow i will avail myself of you assistance : at present i have sufficient surety thus verginia be bail on the security of she relation appius have delay a short time that he might not appear to have sit on account of that case alone when no one make application to he all other concern be set aside owe to the interest display in this one case betook himself home and write to he colleague in the camp not to grant leave of absence to verginius and even to keep he in confinement this wicked scheme be too late as it deserve : for verginius have already obtain he leave have set out at the first watch while the letter regard he detention be deliver on the follow morning without effect but in the city at daybreak when the citizen be stand in the forum on the tiptoe of expectation verginius clothe in mourning conduct he daughter also shabbily attire attend by some matron into the forum with a considerable body of supporter he there begin to go around and solicit people : and not only entreat they aid give out of kindness but demand it as a right : say that he stand daily in the field of battle in defense of they wife and child nor be there any other man whose brave and intrepid deed in war could be record in greater number what avail it if while the city be secure from danger they child have to endure these calamity which be the worst that could be dread if it be take utter these word just like one deliver a public harangue he solicit the people individually similar argument be put forward by icilius : the attendant throng of woman produce more effect by they silent tear than any word with a mind stubbornly proof against all this -- such a attack of frenzy rather than of love have pervert he mind -- appius ascend the tribunal and when the claimant go on to complain briefly that justice have not be administer to he on the precede day through party influence before either he could go through with he claim or a opportunity of reply be afford to verginius appius interrupt he the preamble with which he preface he decision ancient author may have hand down perhaps with some degree of truth but since i nowhere find any that be probable in the case of so scandalous a decision i think it best to state the bare fact which be generally admit that he pass a sentence consign she to slavery at first a feeling of bewilderment astounded all cause by amazement at so heinous a proceeding : then for some time silence prevail then when marcus claudius proceed to seize the maiden while the matron stand around and be meet by the piteous lamentation of the woman verginius menacingly stretch forth he hand toward appius say : to icilius and not to you appius have i betrothed my daughter and for matrimony not for prostitution have i bring she up would you have man gratify they lust promiscuously like cattle and wild beast whether these person will endure such thing i know not i do not think that those will do so who have arm in they hand when the claimant of the girl be repulse by the crowd of woman and supporter who be stand around she silence be proclaim by the crier the decemvir as if he have lose he reason owe to he passion state that not only from icilius 's abusive harangue of the day before and the violence of verginius of which he could produce the entire roman people as witness but from authentic information also he have ascertain that secret meeting be hold in the city throughout the night with the object of stir up sedition : that he accordingly be aware of that danger have come down with armed soldier not to molest any peaceable person but in order to punish as the majesty of the government demand those who disturb the tranquility of the state it will therefore say he be better to remain quiet : go lictor disperse the crowd and clear the way for the master to lay hold of he slave after he have thunder out these word full of wrath the multitude of they own accord disperse and the girl stand desert a sacrifice to injustice then verginius when he see no aid anywhere say : i beg you appius first pardon a father 's grief if i have attack you too harshly : in the next place suffer I to ask the nurse here in presence of the maiden what all this mean that if i have be falsely call she father i may depart hence with mind more tranquil permission have be grant he draw the girl and the nurse aside to the booth near the chapel of cloacina -lrb- 52 -rrb- which now go by the name of the new booth : -lrb- 53 -rrb- and there snatch a knife from a butcher in this the only one way i can my daughter say he do i secure to you you liberty he then plunge it into the girl 's breast and look back toward the tribunal say with this blood i devote thee -lrb- 54 -rrb- appius and thy head appius arouse by the cry raise at so dreadful a deed order verginius to be seize he armed with the knife clear the way whithersoever he go until protect by the crowd of person attend he he reach the gate icilius and numitorius take up the lifeless body and show it to the people they deplore the villainy of appius the fatal beauty of the maiden and the cruel lot of the father -lrb- 55 -rrb- the matron follow cry out : be this the condition of rear child be these the reward of chastity and other thing which female grief on such occasion suggest when they complaint be so much the more affect in proportion as they grief be more intense from they want of self-control the man and more especially icilius speak of nothing but the tribunician power and the right of appeal to the people which have be take from they and give vent to they indignation in regard to the condition of public affair the multitude be excite partly by the heinousness of the misdeed partly by the hope of recover they liberty on a favourable opportunity appius first order icilius to be summon before he then when he refuse to come to be seize : finally when the officer be not allow a opportunity of approach he he himself proceed through the crowd with a body of young patrician order he to be lead away to prison now not only the multitude but lucius valerius and marcus horatius the leader of the multitude stand around icilius and have repulse the lictor declare that if appius should proceed accord to law they would protect icilius from one who be but a private citizen if he should attempt to employ force that even in that case they would be no unequal match for he hence arise a violent quarrel the decemvir 's lictor attack valerius and horatius : the fasce be break by the people appius ascend the tribunal horatius and valerius follow he they be attentively listen to by the assembly : the voice of the decemvir be drown with clamor now valerius as if he possess the authority to do so be order the lictor to depart from one who be but a private citizen when appius whose spirit be now broken alarm for he life betook himself into a house in the vicinity of the forum unobserved by he enemy with he head cover up spurius oppius in order to assist he colleague rush into the forum by the opposite side : he see they authority overpower by force distract then by various counsel and by listen to several adviser from every side he have become hopelessly confuse : eventually he order the senate to be convene because the official act of the decemvir seem displease to the greater portion of the patrician this step quiet the people with the hope that the government would be abolish through the senate the senate be of opinion that the common should not be stir up and that much more effectual measure should be take lest the arrival of verginius should cause any commotion in the army accordingly some of the junior patrician be send to the camp which be at that time on mount vecilius announce to the decemvir that they should do they utmost to keep the soldier from mutiny there verginius occasion greater commotion than he have leave behind he in the city for besides that he be see come with a body of nearly four hundred man who enrage in consequence of the disgraceful nature of the occurrence have accompany he from the city the unsheathed knife and he be himself besmear with blood attract to he the attention of the entire camp and the gown -lrb- 56 -rrb- see in many part of the camp have cause the number of people from the city to appear much greater than it really be when they ask he what be the matter in consequence of he weep for a long time he do not utter a word at length as soon as the crowd of those run together become quiet after the disturbance and silence ensue he relate everything in order as it have occur then extend he hand toward heaven address he fellow-soldier he beg of they not to impute to he that which be the crime of appius claudius nor to abhor he as the murderer of he child to he the life of he daughter be dearer than he own if she have be allow to live in freedom and chastity when he behold she drag to prostitution as if she be a slave think it better that he child should be lose by death rather than by dishonor through compassion for she he have apparently fall into cruelty nor would he have survive he daughter have he not entertain the hope of avenge she death by the aid of he fellow-soldier for they too have daughter sister and wife nor be the lust of appius claudius extinguish with he daughter but in proportion as it escape with greater impunity so much the more unbridled would it be that by the calamity of another a warning be give to they to guard against a similar injury as far as he be concern he wife have be take from he by destiny he daughter because she could no longer have live as a chaste woman have meet with a unfortunate but honorable death that there be now no longer in he family a opportunity for the lust of appius that from any other violence of he he would defend he person with the same spirit with which he have vindicate that of he daughter : that other should take care for themselves and they child while he utter these word in a loud voice the multitude respond with a shout that they would not be backward either to avenge he wrong or to defend they own liberty and the civilian mix with the crowd of soldier by utter the same complaint and by show how much more shocking these thing must have appear when see than when merely hear of and also by tell they that the disturbance at rome be now almost over -- and other have subsequently arrive who assert that appius have with difficulty escape with life have go into exile -- all these individual so far influence they that there be a general cry to arm and have pull up the standard they set out for rome the decemvir be alarm at the same time both by what they now see as well as by what they have hear have take place at rome run about to different part of the camp to quell the commotion while they proceed with mildness no answer be return to they : if any of they attempt to exert authority the soldier reply that they be man and be arm they proceed in a body to the city and occupy the aventine encourage the common as each person meet they recover they liberty and elect tribune of the people no other expression of violence be hear spurius oppius hold a meeting of the senate it be resolve that no harsh measure should be adopt inasmuch as occasion for sedition have be give by themselves -lrb- 57 -rrb- three man of consular rank spurius tarpeius gaius julius publius sulpicius be send as ambassador to inquire in the name of the senate by whose order they have desert the camp or what they mean by have occupy the aventine in arm and turn away they arm from the enemy have seize they own country they be at no loss for a answer : but they want some one to give the answer there be as yet no certain leader and individual be not bold enough to expose themselves to the invidious office the multitude only cry out with one accord that they should send lucius valerius and marcus horatius to they say that they would give they answer to they the ambassador be dismiss verginius remind the soldier that a little while before they have be embarrass in a matter of no very great difficulty because the multitude be without a head and that the answer give though not inexpedient be the result rather of a accidental agreement than of a concerted plan he opinion be that ten person should be elect to preside over the management of state affair and that they should be call tribune of the soldier a title suit to they military dignity when that honor be offer to himself in the first instance he reply reserve for a occasion more favourable to both of we you kind recognition of I the fact of my daughter be unavenged do not allow any office to be agreeable to I nor in the present disturbed condition of the state be it advantageous that those should be at you head who be most expose to party animosity if i be of any use the benefit to be gain from my service will be just as great while i be a private individual they accordingly elect military tribune ten in number meanwhile the army among the sabine be not inactive there also at the instance of icilius and numitorius a secession from the decemvir take place man 's mind be no less move when they recall to mind the murder of siccius than when they be fire with rage at the recent account of the disgraceful attempt make on the maiden to gratify lust when icilius hear that tribune of the soldier have be elect on the aventine lest the election assembly in the city should follow the precedent of the military assembly by elect the same person tribune of the common be well verse in popular intrigue and have a eye to that office himself he also take care before they proceed to the city that the same number should be elect by he own party with equal power they enter the city by the colline gate under they standard and proceed in a body to the aventine through the midst of the city there join the other army they commission the twenty tribune of the soldier to select two out of they number to preside over state affair they elect marcus oppius and sextus manilius the patrician alarm for the general safety though there be a meeting of the senate every day waste the time in wrangle more frequently than in deliberation the murder of siccius the lust of appius and the disgrace incur in war be urge as charge against the decemvir it be resolve that valerius and horatius should proceed to the aventine they refuse to go on any other condition than that the decemvir should lay down the badge of that office which they have resign at the end of the previous year the decemvir complain that they be now be degrade declare that they would not resign they office until those law for the sake of which they have be appoint be pass the people be inform by marcus duillius who have be tribune of the people that by reason of they continual contention no business be transact pass from the aventine to the sacred mount as duillius assert that no concern for business would enter the mind of the patrician until they see the city desert : that the sacred mount would remind they of the people 's firmness : that they would then know that matter could not be bring back to harmony without the restoration of the tribunician power have set out along the nomentan way which be then call the ficulean -lrb- 58 -rrb- they pitch they camp on the sacred mount imitate the moderation of they father by commit no violence the common follow the army no one whose age would permit he decline to go they wife and child attend they piteously ask to whom they be leave they in a city where neither chastity nor liberty be respect when the unusual solitude have create everywhere at rome a feeling of desolation when there be no one in the forum but a few old man : when after the patrician have be summon into the senate the forum appear desert by this time more besides horatius and valerius begin to exclaim what will you now wait for conscript father if the decemvir do not put a end to they obstinacy will you suffer all thing to go to wreck and ruin what power be that of yours decemvir which you embrace and hold so firmly do you mean to administer justice to wall and house be you not ashamed that a almost greater number of you lictor be to be see in the forum than of the other citizen what be you go to do in case the enemy should approach the city what if the common should come presently in arm in case we show ourselves little affect by they secession do you mean to end you power by the fall of the city well then either we must not have the common or they must have they tribune we shall sooner be able to dispense with we patrician magistrate than they with they plebeian that power when new and untried they wrest from we father much less will they now when once captivate by its charm endure the loss of : more especially since we do not behave with such moderation in the exercise of we power that they be in no need of the aid of the tribune when these argument be throw out from every quarter the decemvir overpower by the unite opinion of all declare that since such seem to be the feeling they would submit to the authority of the patrician all they ask for themselves be that they might be protect from popular odium they warn the senate that they should not by shed they blood habituate the people to inflict punishment on the patrician then valerius and horatius have be send to bring back the people on such term as might seem fit and to adjust all difference be direct to make provision also to protect the decemvir from the resentment and violence of the multitude they set forth and be receive into the camp amid the great joy of the people as they undoubted liberator both at the beginning of the disturbance and at the termination of the matter in consideration of these thing thanks be return to they on they arrival icilius deliver a speech in the name of the people when the term come to be consider on the ambassador inquire what the demand of the people be he also have already concerted the plan before the arrival of the ambassador make such demand that it become evident that more hope be place in the justice of they case than in arm for they demand the restoration of the tribunician office and the right of appeal which before the appointment of decemvir have be the support of the people and that it should be without detriment to any one to have instigate the soldier or the common to seek to recover they liberty by a secession concern the punishment only of the decemvir be they demand immoderate : for they think it but just that they should be deliver up to they and threaten to burn they alive the ambassador reply : you demand which have be the result of deliberation be so reasonable that they should be voluntarily offer to you : for you demand therein safeguard for you liberty not a means of arbitrary power to assail other you resentment we must rather pardon than indulge see that from you hatred of cruelty you rush into cruelty and almost before you be free yourselve already wish to lord it over you opponent shall we state never enjoy rest from punishment inflict either by the patrician on the roman common or by the common on the patrician you need a shield rather than a sword he be sufficiently and abundantly humble who live in the state on a equal footing with he fellow-citizen neither inflict nor suffer injury should you however at any time wish to render yourselve formidable when after you have recover you magistrate and law decision on we life and fortune shall be in you hand then you shall determine accord to the merit of each case : for the present it be sufficient that you liberty be recover all assent that they should act just as they think proper the ambassador assure they that they would speedily return have bring everything to a satisfactory termination when they have go and lay before the patrician the message of the common -- while the other decemvir since contrary to they own expectation no mention be make of they punishment -- raise no objection appius be of a truculent disposition and the chief object of detestation measure the rancor of other toward he by he own toward they say : i be not ignorant of the fate which threaten I i see that the contest against we be only defer until we arm be deliver up to we adversary blood must be offer up to popular rage i do not even hesitate to resign my decemvirate a decree of the senate be then pass : that the decemvir should as soon as possible resign they office that quintus furius chief pontiff should hold a election of plebeian tribune and that the secession of the soldier and common should not be detrimental to any one these decree of the senate be complete and the senate dismiss the decemvir come forth into the assembly and resign they office to the great joy of all news of this be carry to the common all those who remain in the city escort the ambassador this crowd be meet by another joyous body from the camp they congratulate each other on the restoration of liberty and concord to the state the deputy speak as follow before the assembly : be it advantageous fortunate and happy for you and the republic -- return to you country to you household god you wife and child but carry into the city the same moderation which you observe here where in spite of the press need of so many thing necessary for so large a number of person no man 's field have be injure go to the aventine whence you set out there in that auspicious place where you lay the first beginning of you liberty you shall elect tribune of the people the chief pontiff will be at hand to hold the election great be they approval and joy as evince in they assent to every measure they then pull up they standard and have set out for rome vie in exultation with all they meet silently under arm they march through the city and reach the aventine there the chief pontiff hold the meeting for the election they immediately elect as they tribune of the people first of all lucius verginius then lucius icilius and publius numitorius the uncle of verginius who have recommend the secession : then gaius sicinius the offspring of he who be record to have be elect first tribune of the common on the sacred mount and marcus duillius who have hold a distinguished tribuneship before the appointment of the decemvir and never fail the common in they contest with the decemvir marcus titinius marcus pomponius gaius apronius appius villius and gaius oppius be elect more from hope entertain of they than from any actual service when he enter on he tribuneship lucius icilius immediately bring before the people and the people enact that the secession from the decemvir which have take place should not prove detrimental to any individual immediately after duillius carry a proposition for elect consul with right of appeal -lrb- 59 -rrb- all these thing be transact in a assembly of the common in the flaminian meadow which be now call the flaminian circus -lrb- 60 -rrb- then through a interrex lucius valerius and marcus horatius be elect consul and immediately enter on they office they consulship agreeable to the people although it do no injury to the patrician be not however without give they offence for whatever measure be take to secure the liberty of the people they consider to be a diminution of they own power first of all when it be as it be a disputed point of law whether patrician be bind by regulation enact in a assembly of the common they propose a law in the assembly of the century that whatever the common order in the assembly of the tribe should be bind on the entire people by which law a most keen-edged weapon of offence be give to the motion introduce by tribune then another law make by a consul concern the right of appeal a singularly effective safeguard of liberty that have be upset by the decemviral power be not only restore but also guard for the time to come by the passing of a new law that no one should appoint any magistrate without appeal : -lrb- 61 -rrb- if any person should so appoint it should be lawful and right that he be put to death and that such killing should not be deem a capital offence and when they have sufficiently secure the common by the right of appeal on the one hand by tribunician aid on the other they revive for the tribune themselves the privilege that they person should be consider inviolable -- the recollection of which be now almost forget -- by renew after a long interval certain ceremony which have fall into disuse and they render they inviolable by religion as well as by a law enact that whosoever should offer injury to tribune of the people ædiles or judicial decemvir he person should be devote to jupiter and he property be sell at the temple of cere liber and libera expounder of the law deny that any person be by this law inviolable but assert that he who may do a injury to any of they be deem by law accurse : and that accordingly a ædile may be arrest and carry to prison by superior magistrate which though it be not expressly warrant by law -lrb- for a injury be do to a person to whom it be not lawful to do a injury accord to this law -rrb- be yet a proof that a ædile be not consider as sacred and inviolable the tribune however be sacred and inviolable accord to the ancient oath of the common when first they create that office there have be some who suppose that by this same horatian law provision be make for the consul also and the prætors because they be elect under the same auspices as the consul for a consul be call a judge this interpretation be refute because at this time it have not yet be customary for the consul to be style judge but prætor -lrb- 62 -rrb- these be the law propose by the consul it be also arrange by the same consul that decree of the senate which before that use to be suppress and alter at the pleasure of the consul should be deposit in the temple of cere under the care of the aedile of the common then marcus duillius tribune of the common bring before the people and the people enact that whoever leave the people without tribune and whoever cause a magistrate to be elect without appeal should be punish with stripe and behead all these enactment though against the feeling of the patrician pass off without opposition from they because as yet no severity be aim at any particular individual then both the tribunician power and the liberty of the common have be firmly establish the tribune now deem it both safe and seasonable to attack individual single out verginius as the first prosecutor and appius as defendant when verginius have appoint a day for appius to take he trial and appius have come down to the forum accompany by a band of young patrician the recollection of he most profligate exercise of power be instantly revive in the mind of all as soon as they behold the man himself and he satellite then say verginius : long speech be only mean for matter of a doubtful nature accordingly i shall neither waste time in dwelling on the guilt of this man before you from whose cruelty you have rescue yourselve by force of arm nor will i suffer he to add impudence to he other crime in defend himself wherefore appius claudius i pardon you for all the impious and nefarious deed you have have the effrontery to commit one after another for the last two year with respect to one charge only unless you shall choose a judge who shall acquit you that you have not sentence a free person to slavery contrary to the law i shall order that you be take into custody neither in the aid of the tribune nor in the judgment of the people could appius place any hope : still he both appeal to the tribune and when no one heed he be seize by the officer he exclaim i appeal the hearing of this one word that safeguard of liberty and the fact that it be utter from that mouth by which a free citizen be so recently consign to slavery cause silence and while they loudly declare each on he own behalf that at length the existence of the god be prove and that they do not disregard human affair and that punishment await tyranny and cruelty which punishment though late be however by no means light that that man now appeal who have abolish all right of appeal and that he implore the protection of the people who have trample under foot all the rights of the people : and that he be be drag off to prison destitute of the rights of liberty who have doom a free person to slavery the voice of appius himself be hear amid the murmur of the assembly implore the protection of the roman people he enumerate the service of he ancestor to the state at home and abroad : he own unfortunate anxiety for the interest of the roman common owe to which he have resign the consulship to the very great displeasure of the patrician for the purpose of equalize the law he then go on to mention those law of he the framer of which be drag off to prison though the law still remain in force however in regard to what bear especially on he own case he personal merit and demerit he would make trial of they when a opportunity should be afford he of state he defense at present he a roman citizen demand by the common right of citizenship that he be allow to speak on the day appoint and to appeal to the judgment of the roman people : he do not dread popular odium so much as not to place any hope in the fairness and compassion of he fellow-citizen but if he be lead to prison without be hear that he once more appeal to the tribune of the people and warn they not to imitate those whom they hate but if the tribune acknowledge themselves bind by the same agreement for abolish the right of appeal which they charge the decemvir with have conspire to form then he appeal to the people he implore the aid of the law pass that very year both by the consul and tribune regard the right of appeal for who would there be to appeal if this be not allow a person as yet uncondemned whose case have not be hear what plebeian or humble individual would find protection in the law if appius claudius could not that he would be a proof whether tyranny or liberty be establish by the new law and whether the right of appeal and of challenge against the injustice of magistrate be only hold out in idle word or really grant verginius on the other hand affirm that appius claudius be the only person who have no part or share in the law or in any covenant civil or human man should look to the tribunal the fortress of all villainy where that perpetual decemvir vent he fury on the property person and life of the citizen threaten all with he rod and axis a despiser of god and man surround by man who be executioner not lictor turn he thought from rapine and murder to lust tear a free-born maiden as if she have be a prisoner of war from the embrace of she father before the eye of the roman people and give she as a present to a dependent the minister to he secret pleasure : where too by a cruel decree and a most outrageous decision he arm the right hand of the father against the daughter : where he order the betroth and uncle on they raise the lifeless body of the girl to be lead away to prison affect more by the interruption of he lust than by she death : that the prison be build for he also which he be wont to call the domicile of the roman common wherefore though he might appeal again and again he himself would again and again propose a judge to try he on the charge of have sentence a free person to slavery if he would not go before a judge he order he to be take to prison as one already condemn he be throw into prison though without the disapprobation of any individual yet not without considerable emotion of the public mind since in consequence of the punishment by itself of so distinguish a man they own liberty begin to be consider by the common themselves as excessive -lrb- 63 -rrb- the tribune adjourn the day of trial meanwhile ambassador from the hernican and latin come to rome to offer they congratulation on the harmony exist between the patrician and common and as a offering on that account to jupiter best and greatest they bring into the capitol a golden crown of small weight as money at that time be not plentiful and the duty of religion be perform rather with piety than splendor on the same authority it be ascertain that the aequan and volscian be prepare for war with the utmost energy the consul be therefore order to divide the province between they the sabine fall to the lot of horatius the æquans to valerius after they have proclaim a levy for these war through the good office of the common not only the younger man but a large number consist of volunteer from among those who have serve they time -lrb- 64 -rrb- attend to give in they name : and hence the army be stronger not only in the number but also in the quality of its soldier owe to the admixture of veteran before they march out of the city they engrave on brass and fix up in public view the decemviral law which be name the twelve table there be some who state that the aedile discharge that office by order of the tribune gaius claudius who detest the crime of the decemvir and above all incense at the arrogant conduct of he brother-in-law have retire to regillum he ancestral home though advance in year he now return to the city to deprecate the danger threaten the man whose vicious practice have drive he into retirement go down to the forum in mourning garb accompany by the member of he house and by he client he appeal to the citizen individually and implore they not to stain the house of the claudius with such a indelible disgrace as to deem they worthy of bond and imprisonment to think that a man whose image would be hold in highest honor by posterity the framer of they law and the founder of roman jurisprudence should be lie manacled amongst nocturnal thief and robber let they turn they thought for a moment from feeling of exasperation to calm examination and reflection and forgive one man at the intercession of so many of the claudius rather than through they hatred of one man despise the prayer of many so far he himself would go for the honor of he family and he name but he be not reconcile to the man whose distressed condition he be anxious to relieve by courage they liberty have be recover by clemency the harmony of the order in the state could be strengthen some be move but it be more by the affection he show for he nephew than by any regard for the man for whom he be plead but verginius beg they with tear to keep they compassion for he and he daughter and not to listen to the prayer of the claudius who have assume sovereign power over the pleb but to the three tribune kinsman of verginium who after be elect to protect the plebeian be now seek they protection this appeal be feel to have more justice in it all hope be now cut off appius put a end to he life before the day of trial come soon after sp oppius be arraign by p numitorius he be only less detest than appius because he have be in the city when he colleague pronounce the iniquitous judgment more indignation however be arouse by a atrocity which oppius have commit than by he not have prevent one a witness be produce who after reckon up twenty-seven year of service and eight occasion on which he have be decorate for conspicuous bravery appear before the people wear all he decoration tear open he dress he exhibit he back lacerate with stripe he ask for nothing but a proof on oppius ' part of any single charge against he if such proof be forthcoming oppius though now only a private citizen might repeat all he cruelty towards he oppius be take to prison and there before the day of trial he put a end to he life he property and that of claudius be confiscate by the tribune they colleague change they domicile by go into exile they property also be confiscate m claudius who have be the claimant of verginium be try and condemn verginius himself however refuse to press for the extreme penalty so he be allow to go into exile to tibur verginium be more fortunate after she death than in she lifetime she shade after wander through so many house in quest of expiatory penalty at length find rest not one guilty person be now left great alarm seize the patrician the look of the tribune be now as menacing as those of the decemvir have be m duillius the tribune impose a salutary check upon they excessive exercise of authority we have go he say far enough in the assertion of we liberty and the punishment of we opponent so for this year i will allow no man to be bring to trial or cast into prison i disapprove of old crime long forget be rake up now that the recent one have be atone for by the punishment of the decemvir the unceasing care which both the consul be take to protect you liberty be a guarantee that nothing will be do which will call for the power of the tribune this spirit of moderation show by the tribune relieve the fear of the patrician but it also intensify they resentment against the consul for they seem to be so wholly devote to the pleb that the safety and liberty of the patrician be a matter of more immediate concern to the plebeian than they be to the patrician magistrate it seem as though they adversary would grow weary of inflict punishment on they sooner than the consul would curb they insolence it be pretty generally assert that they have show weakness since they law have be sanction by the senate and no doubt be entertain that they have yield to the pressure of circumstance after matter have be settle in the city and the position of the pleb firmly assure the consul leave for they respective province valerius wisely suspend operation against the army of the aequan and the volscian which have now unite at algidum : whereas if he have immediately intrust the issue to fortune i be incline to think that consider the feeling both of the roman and of they enemy at that time after the unfavourable auspices of the decemvir -lrb- 65 -rrb- the contest would have cost he heavy loss have pitch he camp at the distance of a mile from the enemy he keep he man quiet the enemy fill the space lie between the two camp with they army in order of battle and not a single roman make answer when they challenge they to fight at length weary with standing and wait in vain for a contest the aequan and volscian consider that the victory be almost yield to they go off some to hernican other to latin territory to commit depredation there be leave in the camp rather a garrison for its defense than sufficient force for a contest when the consul perceive this he in turn inspire the terror which he own man have previously feel and have draw up he troops in order of battle on he side provoke the enemy to fight when they conscious of they lack of force decline battle the courage of the roman immediately increase and they consider they vanquish as they stand panic-stricken within they rampart have stand throughout the day eager for the contest they retire at night and the roman now full of hope set about refreshing themselves the enemy in by no means equal spirit be now anxious despatched messenger in every direction to recall the plunder party those in the nearest place return : those who be farther off be not find when day dawn the roman leave the camp determine on assault the rampart unless a opportunity of fight present itself and when the day be now far advance and no movement be make by the enemy the consul order a advance and the troops be put in motion the aequan and volscian be seize with indignation at the thought that victorious army have to be defend by a rampart rather than by valor and arm wherefore they also earnestly demand the signal for battle from they general and receive it and now half of they have get out of the gate and the other in succession be march in order as they go down each to he own post when the roman consul before the enemy 's line support by they entire strength could get into close order advance upon they and have attack they before they be all as yet lead forth and before those who be have they line properly draw out he fall upon they a crowd almost begin to waver as they run from one place to another and gaze around upon themselves and look eagerly for they friend the shout and violent attack add to the already panic-stricken condition of they mind the enemy at first give way then have rally they spirit when they general on every side reproachfully ask they whether they intend to yield to vanquish foe the battle be restore on the other side the consul desire the roman to remember that on that day for the first time they fight as free man in defense of rome now a free city that it be for themselves they be about to conquer not to become when victorious the prize of the decemvir that it be not under the command of appius that operation be be conduct but under they consul valerius descend from the liberator of the roman people himself they liberator let they show that in former battle it have be the fault of the general and not of the soldier that they do not conquer that it be shameful to have exhibit more courage against they own countryman than against they enemy and to have dread slavery more at home than abroad that verginium be the only person whose chastity have be in danger in time of peace that appius have be the only citizen of dangerous lust but if the fortune of war should turn against they the child of all would be in danger from so many thousand of enemy that he be unwilling to forebode what neither jupiter nor they father mar would be likely to suffer to befall a city build under such auspices he remind they of the aventine and the sacred mount that they should bring back dominion unimpaired to that spot where they liberty have be win but a few month before and that they should show that the roman soldier retain the same disposition after the expulsion of the decemvir as they have possess before they be appoint and that the valor of the roman people have not deteriorate after the law have be equalize after he utter these word among the battalion of the infantry he hurry from they to the cavalry come young man say he show yourselve superior to the infantry in valor as you already be they superior in honor and in rank the infantry at the first onset have make the enemy give way now that they have give way do you give rein to you horse and drive they from the field they will not stand you charge even now they rather hesitate than resist they spur on they horse and charge at full speed against the enemy who be already throw into confusion by the attack of the infantry : and have break through the rank some dashing on to the rear of they line other wheeling about in the open space from the flank turn most of they away from the camp as they be now fly in all direction and by ride beyond they head they off the line of infantry the consul himself and the whole onset of the battle be bear toward the camp and have take it with considerable slaughter he get possession of still more considerable booty the fame of this battle carry not only to the city but to the other army also in sabine territory be welcome in the city with public rejoicing in the camp it inspirit the soldier to emulate such glory horatius by train they in sally and make trial of they in slight skirmish have accustom they to trust in themselves rather than remember the ignominy incur under the command of the decemvir and these trifling engagement have greatly contribute to the successful consummation of they hope the sabine elate at they success in the preceding year cease not to provoke and urge they to fight constantly ask why they waste time sally forth in small number and return like marauder and why they distribute the issue of a single war over a number of engagement and those of no importance why do they not meet they in the field and intrust to fortune the decision of the matter once and for all besides that they have already of themselves recover sufficient courage the roman be fire with exasperation at the thought that the other army would soon return victorious to the city that the enemy be now wantonly affront they with insolence : when moreover would they be a match for the enemy if they be not so then when the consul ascertain that the soldier loudly express these sentiment in the camp have summon a assembly he speak as follow : how matter have fare in algidum i suppose that you soldier have already hear as become the army of the free people to behave so have they behave through the good judgment of my colleague and the valor of the soldier the victory have be gain for my part i shall display the same judgment and determination as you yourselve o soldier display the war may either be prolong with advantage or be bring to a speedy conclusion if it be to be prolonged i shall take care by employ the same method of warfare with which i have begin that you hope and you valor may increase every day if you have now sufficient courage and it be you wish that the matter be decide come raise here a shout such as you will raise in the field of battle in token both of you wish and you valor whenthe shout be raise with great alacrity he assure they that he would comply with they wish -- and so might heaven prosper it -- and lead they next day into the field the remainder of the day be spend in get ready they arm on the follow day as soon as the sabine see the roman army be draw up in order of battle they too have long since be eager for the encounter advance the battle be one such as would be fight between two army who both have confidence in themselves the one on account of its long-standing and unbroken career of glory the other recently elate by its unusual success the sabine aid they strength also by stratagem for have form a line equal to that of the roman they keep two thousand man in reserve to make a attack on the left wing of the roman in the heat of the battle when these by a attack in flank be on the point of overpower that wing now almost surround about six hundred of the cavalry of two legion leap down from they horse and as they man be give way rush forward in front and at the same time both oppose the advance of the enemy and rouse the courage of the infantry first by share the danger equally with they and then by arouse in they a sense of shame it be a matter of shame that the cavalry should fight in they own proper fashion and in that of other and that the infantry should not be equal to the cavalry even when dismount -lrb- 66 -rrb- they march therefore to the fight which have be suspend on they part and endeavor to regain the ground which they have lose and in a moment not only be the battle restore but one of the wing of the sabine give way the cavalry protect between the rank of the infantry remount they horse they then gallop across to the other division to announce they success to they party at the same time also they charge the enemy now dishearten by the discomfiture of they stronger wing the valor of none shone forth more conspicuous in that battle the consul provide for all emergency he applaud the brave rebuke wherever the battle seem to slacken when reprove they display immediately the deed of brave man and a sense of shame stimulate these as much as praise the other the shout be raise anew all together make a united effort drive the enemy back nor could the roman attack be any longer resist the sabine drive in every direction through the country leave they camp behind they for the enemy to plunder there the roman recover the effect not of the ally as at algidum but they own property which have be lose by the devastation of they land for this double victory gain in two battle in two different place the senate in a niggardly spirit merely decree thanksgiving in the name of the consul for one day only the people go however on the second day also in great number of they own accord to offer thanksgiving and this unauthorized and popular thanksgive owe to they zeal be even better attend the consul by agreement come to the city within the same two day and summon the senate to the campius martius -lrb- 67 -rrb- when they be there relate the service perform by themselves the chief of the patrician complain that the senate be designedly convene among the soldier for the purpose of intimidation the consul therefore that there might be no room for such a charge call away the senate to the flaminian meadow where the temple of apollo now be -lrb- even then it be call the apollinare -rrb- there when a triumph be refuse by a large majority of the patrician lucius icilius tribune of the common bring a proposition before the people regard the triumph of the consul many person come forward to argue against the measure but in particular gaius claudius who exclaim that it be over the senate not over the enemy that the consul wish to triumph and that it be intend as a return for a private service to a tribune and not as a honor due to valor that never before have the matter of a triumph be manage through the people but that the consideration of that honor and the disposal of it have always rest with the senate that not even the king have infringe on the majesty of this most August body the tribune should not so occupy every department with they own authority as to allow the existence of no public council that the state would be free and the law equalize by these means only if each order retain its own rights and its own dignity after much have be say by the other senior patrician also to the same purpose all the tribe approve the proposition then for the first time a triumph be celebrate by order of the people without the authority of the senate this victory of the tribune and people be well-nigh terminate in a extravagance by no means salutary a conspiracy be form among the tribune that the same tribune might be re-elected and in order that they own ambition might be the less conspicuous that the consul also might have they office prolong they plead in excuse the combination of the patrician by which the privilege of the common be attempt to be undermine by the affront of the consul what would be the consequence when the law be as yet not firmly establish if they attack the new tribune through consul of they own party man like horatius and valerius would not always be consul who would regard they own interest as secondary after the liberty of the people by some concurrence of circumstance useful in view of the situation it fall by lot to marcus duillius before all other to preside at the election a man of prudence and who perceive the storm of public odium that be hang over they from the continuance of they office and when he declare that he would take no account of any of the former tribune and he colleague struggle to get he to allow the tribe to vote independently or to give up the office of preside at the election which he hold by lot to he colleague who would hold the election accord to law rather than accord to the pleasure of the patrician a contention be now excite when duillius have send for the consul to he seat and ask they what they contemplate do with respect to the consular election and they answer that they would appoint new consul then have secure popular supporter of a measure by no means popular he proceed with they into the assembly there the consul be bring forward before the people and ask what they would do if the roman people mindful of they liberty recover at home through they mindful also of they service in war should again elect they consul : and when they in no way change they opinion he hold the election after eulogize the consul because they persevere to the last in be unlike the decemvir and five tribune of the people have be elect when through the zealous exertion of the nine tribune who openly press they canvass the other candidate could not make up the require number of tribe he dismiss the assembly nor do he hold one afterward for the purpose of a election he say that the law have be satisfy which without any number be anywhere specify only enact that tribune who have be elect should be leave to choose they colleague and confirm those choose by they he then go on to recite the formulum of the law in which it be lay down : if i shall propose for election ten tribune of the common if from any cause you shall elect this day less than ten tribune of the people then that those whom they may have choose as colleague for themselves that these i say be legitimate tribune of the people on the same condition as those whom you shall on this day have elect tribune of the people when duillius persevere to the last state that the republic could not have fifteen tribune of the people have baffle the ambition of he colleague he resign office equally approve of by patrician and common the new tribune of the people in elect they colleague endeavor to gratify the wish of the patrician they even elect two who be patrician -lrb- 68 -rrb- and man of consular rank spurius tarpeius and aulus aternius the consul elect spurius herminius titus verginius cælimontanus not be specially incline to the cause either of the patrician or common have perfect tranquillity both at home and abroad lucius trebonius tribune of the common incense against the patrician because as he say he have be impose on by they in the matter of choose tribune and betray by he colleague bring forward a proposal that whoever propose he election of tribune of the people before the common should go on take the vote until he elect ten tribune of the people and he spend he tribuneship in worry the patrician whence the surname of asper be give he next marcus geganius macerinus and gaius julius be elect consul quiet some dispute that have arise between the tribune and the youth of the nobility without display any harshness against that power and at the same time preserve the dignity of the patrician by proclaim a levy for the war against the volscian and æquans they keep the people from riot by keep matter in abeyance affirm that everything be also quiet abroad owe to the harmony in the city and that it be only through civil discord that foreign foe take courage they anxiety for peace abroad be also the cause of harmony at home but notwithstanding the one order ever attack the moderation of the other act of injustice begin to be commit by the younger patrician on the common although the latter keep perfectly quiet where the tribune assist the more humble in the first place it accomplish little : and thereafter they do not even themselves escape ill-treatment : particularly in the latter month when injustice be commit through the combination among the more powerful and the power of the office become considerably weaker in the latter part of the year and now the common place some hope in the tribuneship if only they could get tribune like icilius : for the last two year they declare that they have only have mere name on the other hand the elder member of the patrician order though they consider they young man to be too overbearing yet prefer if bound be to be exceed that a superabundance of spirit should be exhibit by they own order rather than by they adversary so difficult a thing be moderation in maintain liberty while every one by pretend to desire equality exalt himself in such a manner as to put down another and man by they very precaution against fear cause themselves to become object of dread : and we saddle on other injustice repudiate on we own account as if it be absolutely necessary either to commit injustice or to submit to it titus quinctius capitolinus for the fourth time and agrippa furius be then elect consul find neither disturbance at home nor war abroad both however be impend the discord of the citizen could now no longer be check both tribune and common be exasperate against the patrician while if a day of trial be appoint for any of the nobility it always embroil the assembly in new struggle on the first report of these the æquans and volscian as if they have receive a signal take up arm also because they leader eager for plunder have persuade they that the levy proclaim two year previously could not be proceed with as the common now refuse obedience to military authority : that for that reason no army have be send against they that military discipline be subvert by licentiousness and that rome be no longer consider a common country for its citizen that whatever resentment and animosity they might have entertain against foreigner be now direct against themselves that now a opportunity offer itself for destroy wolf blind by intestine rage have unite they force they first utterly lay waste the latin territory : when none meet they to avenge the wrong then indeed to the great exultation of the adviser of the war they approach the very wall of rome carry they depredation into the district around the esquiline gate -lrb- 69 -rrb- point out to the city in mock insult the devastation of the land when they march back thence to corbio unmolested and drive they booty before they quinctius the consul summon the people to a assembly there i find that he speak to this effect : though i be conscious to myself of no fault quirite yet it be with the greatest shame i have come forward to you assembly to think that you should know this that this should be hand down on record to posterity that the æquans and volscian a short time since scarcely a match for the hernican have with impunity come with arm in they hand to the wall of rome in the fourth consulate of titus quinctius have i know that this disgrace be reserve for this year above all other though we have now long be live in such a manner and such be the state of affair that my mind can forebode nothing good i would have avoid this honor either by exile or by death if there have be no other means of escape it then if man of courage have hold those arm which be at we gate rome could have be take during my consulate i have have sufficient honor enough and more than enough of life : i ought to have die in my third consulate whom i pray do these most dastardly enemy despise we consul or you quirite if the fault lie in we take away the command from those who be unworthy of it and if that be not enough further inflict punishment on we if the fault be yours may there be none of god or man to punish you offence : do you yourselve only repent of they it be not you cowardice they have despise nor they own valor that they have put they trust in : have be so often route and put to flight strip of they camp mulct in they land send under the yoke they know both themselves and you it be the discord among the several order that be the curse of this city the contest between the patrician and common while we have neither bound in the pursuit of power nor you in that of liberty while you be wearied of patrician we of plebeian magistrate they have take courage in the name of heaven what would you have you desire tribune of the common we grant they for the sake of concord you long for decemvir we suffer they to be create you become weary of decemvir we compel they to resign office you resentment against these same person when they become private citizen still continue we suffer man of the highest family and rank to die or go into exile you wish asecond time to create tribune of the common you create they you wish to elect consul attach to you party and although we see that it be unjust to the patrician we have even resign ourselves to see a patrician magistracy concede as a offering to the people the aid of tribune right of appeal to the people the act of the common make binding on the patrician under the pretext of equalize the law the subversion of we privilege we have endure and still endure what end be there to be to we dissension when shall it be allow we to have a united city one common country we when defeat submit with greater resignation than you when victorious be it enough for you that you be object of terror to we the aventine be take against we : against we the sacred mount be seize when the esquiline be almost take by the enemy no one defend it and when the volscian foe be scale the rampart no one drive he off : it be against we you behave like man against we you be armed come when you have blockade the senate-house here and have make the forum the seat of war and fill the prison with the lead man of the state march forth through the esquiline gate with that same determine spirit or if you do not even venture thus far behold from you wall you land lay waste with fire and sword booty drive off house set on fire in every direction and smoking but i may be tell it be only the public weal that be in a worse condition through this : the land be burn the city be besiege the glory of the war rest with the enemy what in the name of heaven -- what be the state of you own private affair even now to each of you he own private loss from the country will be announce what pray be there at home whence you can recruit they will the tribune restore and re-establish what you have lose of sound and word they will heap on you as much as you please and of charge against the lead man law one after another and public meeting but from these meeting never have one of you return home more increase in substance or in fortune have any one ever bring back to he wife and child aught save hatred quarrel grudge public and private from which you may ever be protect not by you own valor and integrity but by the aid of other but by hercule when you serve under the command of we consul not under tribune in the camp and not in the forum and the enemy tremble at you shout in the field of battle not the roman patrician in the assembly have gain booty and take land from the enemy load with wealth and glory both public and private you use to return home in triumph to you household god : now you allow the enemy to go off laden with you property continue fast bind to you assembly live in the forum the necessity of take the field which you strive to escape still follow you it be hard on you to march against the æquans and the volscian : the war be at you gate : if it be not drive from thence it will soon be within you wall and will scale the citadel and capitol and follow you into you very house two year ago the senate order a levy to be hold and a army to be march out to algidum yet we sit down listless at home quarrel with each other like woman delight in present peace and not see that after that short-lived inactivity war will return with interest that there be other topic more please than these i well know but even though my own mind do not prompt I to it necessity oblige I to speak the truth rather than what be please i would indeed like to meet with you approval quirite but i be much more anxious that you should be preserve whatever sentiment you shall entertain toward I it have be so ordain by nature that he who address a crowd for he own private interest be more welcome than the man whose mind have nothing in view but the public interest unless perhaps you suppose that those public sycophant those flatterer of the common who neither suffer you to take up arm nor to live in peace excite and work you up for you own interest when excite you be to they source either of position or of profit : and because when the order be in accord they see that they themselves be of no importance in anything they prefer to be leader of a bad cause of tumult and sedition rather than of no cause at all if you can at last become wearied of all this and if you be willing to resume the habit practice by you forefather of old and formerly by yourselve in place of these new one i be ready to submit to any punishment if i do not in a few day rout and put to flight and strip of they camp those devastator of we land and transfer from we gate and wall to they city this terror of war by which you be now throw into consternation scarcely ever be the speech of a popular tribune more acceptable to the common than this of a most austere consul on that occasion the young man also who during such alarm have be accustom to employ the refusal to enlist as the sharpest weapon against the patrician begin to turn they attention to war and arm : and the flight of the rustic and those who have be rob and wound in the country by announce event more revolting even than what be before they eye fill the whole city with exasperation when they come into the senate there all turn to quinctius look upon he as the only champion of the majesty of rome : and the lead senator declare that he harangue be worthy of the consular authority worthy of so many consulship formerly bear by he worthy of he whole life full of honor frequently enjoy more frequently deserve that other consul have either flatter the common by betray the dignity of the patrician or by harshly maintain the rights of they order have render the multitude more exasperated by they effort to subdue they : that titus quinctius have deliver a speech mindful of the dignity of the patrician of the concord of the different order and above all of the need of the time they entreat he and he colleague to assume the management of the commonwealth they entreat the tribune by act in concert with the consul to join in drive back the war from the city and the wall and to induce the common to be obedient to the senate at so perilous a conjuncture : declare that they land be devastate and they city in a manner besiege they common country appeal to they as tribune and implore they aid by universal consent the levy be decree and hold when the consul give public notice that there be no time for consider claim for exemption that all the young man should attend on the follow morning at dawn in the campus martius that when the war be over they would afford time for inquire into the excuse of those who have not give in they name that the man should be hold as a deserter whose excuse they find unsatisfactory all the youth attend on the follow day the cohort -lrb- 70 -rrb- choose each they centurion : two senator be place at the head of each cohort we have read that all these measure be carry out with such expedition that the standard which have be bring forth from the treasury on that very day by the quæstors and convey to the campus start from thence at the fourth hour and the newly-raised army halt at the tenth milestone follow only by a few cohort of veteran soldier as volunteer the following day bring the enemy within sight and camp be join to camp near corbio on the third day when resentment urge on the roman and a consciousness of guilt for have so often rebel and a feeling of despair the other there be no delay in come to a engagement in the roman army though the two consul be invest with equal authority the supreme command be by the concession of agrippa resign to he colleague a arrangement most salutary in the conduct of matter of great importance and he who be prefer make a polite return for the ready condescension of the other who thus lower himself by make he he confidant in all he plan and share with he he honor and by put he on a equality with he although he be by no means as capable on the field of battle quinctius command the right agrippa the left wing the command of the center be intrust to spurius postumius albus as lieutenant-general publius sulpicius the other lieutenant-general be place at the head of the cavalry the infantry on the right wing fight with distinguished valor while the volscian offer a stout resistance publius sulpicius with he cavalry break through the center of the enemy 's line and though he might have return thence in the same way to he own party before the enemy restore they broken rank it seem more advisable to attack they in the rear and in a moment charge the line in the rear he would have disperse the enemy by the double attack have not the cavalry of the volscian and æquans keep he for some time engage by a mode of fight like he own then indeed sulpicius declare that there be no time for delay cry out that they be surround and would be cut off from they own friend unless they unite all they effort and despatch the engagement with the cavalry nor be it enough to rout the enemy without disable they they must slay horse and man that none might return to the fight or renew the battle that these could not resist they before whom a compact body of infantry have give way he order be address to no deaf ear by a single charge they route the entire cavalry dismount great number and kill with they javelin both the rider and the horse thus end the cavalry engagement then have attack the enemy 's infantry they send a account to the consul of what have be do where the enemy 's line be already give way the news both give fresh courage to the roman who be now gain the day and dismay the æquans who be begin to give way they first begin to be beat in the center where the furious charge of the cavalry have break they rank then the left wing begin to lose ground before the consul quinctius the contest be most obstinate on the right then agrippa in the vigor of he youth and strength see matter go more favourably in every part of the battle than in he own quarter snatch some of the standard from the standard-bearer and carry they on himself some even he begin to throw into the thick of the enemy -lrb- 71 -rrb- the soldier urge on by the fear of this disgrace attack the enemy thus the victory be equalize in every quarter news then come from quinctius that he be now victorious be about to attack the enemy 's camp that he be unwilling to break into it before he learn that they be beat in the left wing also if he have route the enemy let he now join he that all the army together might take possession of the booty agrippa be victorious with mutual congratulation advance toward he victorious colleague and the enemy 's camp there as there be but few to defend it and these be route in a moment they break into the fortification without a struggle and march back the army in possession of abundant spoil have recover also they own effect which have be lose by the devastation of the land i have not hear that they either themselves demand a triumph or that one be offer to they by the senate nor be any cause assign for the honor be either overlook or not hope for as far as i can conjecture at so great a distance of time since a triumph have be refuse to the consul horatius and valerius who in addition to the victory over the æquans and volscian have gain the glory of have also finish the sabine war the consul be ashamed to demand a triumph for one half of the service do by they lest even if they should have obtain it regard might appear to have be pay to person rather than to merit a disgraceful decision of the people regard the boundary of they ally mar the honorable victory obtain over they enemy the people of aricium -lrb- 72 -rrb- and of ardea who have frequently contend in arm concern a dispute piece of land weary out by many loss on either side appoint the roman people as arbitrator when they arrive to support they claim a assembly of the people be grant they by the magistrate the matter be debate with great warmth the witness be now produce when it be time for the tribe to be call and for the people to give they vote publius scaptius a plebeian advance in year rise up and say consul if it be permit I to speak on the public interest i will not suffer the people to be lead into a mistake in this matter when the consul say that he as unworthy of attention ought not to be hear and on he shout that the public interest be be betray order he to be put aside he appeal to the tribune the tribune as they be nearly always direct by the multitude rather than direct it grant scaptius leave to say what he please in deference to the people who be anxious to hear he he then begin : that he be now in he eighty-third year and that he have serve in that district which be now in dispute not even then a young man as he be already serve in he twentieth campaign when operation be go on at coriolus he therefore bring forward a fact forget by length of time -- one however deeply fix in he memory namely that the district now in dispute have belong to the territory of coriolus and after the taking of coriolus it have become come by right of war the public property of the roman people that he be surprised how the state of ardea and aricium could have the face to hope to deprive the roman people whom instead of lawful owner they have make arbitrator of a district the right of which they have never claim while the state of corioli exist that he for he part have but a short time to live he could not however bring himself old as he now be to desist claim by he voice the only means he now have a district which as a soldier he have contribute to acquire as far as a man could that he strenuously advise the people not to ruin they own interest by a idle feeling of delicacy the consul when they perceive that scaptius be listen to not only in silence but even with approbation call god and man to witness that a disgraceful enormity be be commit summon the principal senator : with they they go round to the tribe entreat that as judge they would not be guilty of a most heinous crime with a still worse precedent by convert the subject of dispute to they own interest more especially when even though it may be lawful for a judge to look after he own interest so much would by no means be acquire by keep the land as would be lose by alienate the affection of they ally by injustice for that the loss of reputation and confidence be of greater importance than could be estimate be this the answer the ambassador be to carry home be this to go out to the world be they ally to hear this be they enemy to hear it -- with what sorrow the one -- with what joy the other could they suppose that the neighbouring state would ascribe this proceed to scaptius a old babbler at assembly that scaptius would be render distinguish by this statue : but that the roman people would assume the character of a corrupt informer -lrb- 73 -rrb- and appropriator of the claim of other for what judge in a private cause ever act in such a way as to adjudge to himself the property in dispute that even scaptius himself would not act so though he have now outlive all sense of shame thus the consul thus the senator exclaim but covetousness and scaptius the adviser of that covetousness have more influence the tribe when convene decide that the district be the public property of the roman people nor can it be deny that it might have be so if they have go to other judge but as it be the infamy of the decision be not in any way diminish by the justice of the cause : nor do it appear more disgraceful or more repulsive to the people of aricium and of ardea than it do to the roman senate the
