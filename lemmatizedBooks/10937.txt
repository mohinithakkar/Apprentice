question depend for its motive merely on consideration of the text ' philologic interest or value it would to speak frankly never have be undertake the editor who disclaim qualification as a philologist regard these life as very valuable historical material publication of which may serve to light up some dark corner of we celtic ecclesiastical past he be egotist enough to hope that the present blaze of the track inadequate and feeble though it be may induce other and better equipped explorer to follow the present editor be study the life of declan -lrb- project gutenberg etext # 823 -rrb- for quite another purpose when some year since the zealous hon secretary of the irish text society suggest to he publication of the tract in its present form and addition of the life of carthach

rev paul walsh rev j macerlhean sj ma as well as to mr r o'foley who at much expense of time and labor have carefully read the proof and with unselfish prodigality of they scholarly resource have make many valuable suggestion and correction pp introduction -- general a most distinctive class of ancient irish literature and probably the class that be least popularly familiar be the hagiographical it be the present writer venture to submit as valuable as it be distinctive and as well worthy of study as it be neglect while annals tale and poetry have find editor the life of irish saint have remain largely a mine unworked into the cause of this strange neglect it be not the purpose of the present introduction to enter suffice it to glance in pass at one of the reason which have be allege in explanation scil : -- that the life be uncritical and romantic that they abound in wild legend chronological impossibility and all sort of incredible story and finally that miracle be multiply till the miraculous become the ordinary and that marvel be magnify till the narrative border on the ludicrous the saint as he be sketch be sometimes a positively repulsive be -- arrogant venomous and cruel he demand two eye or more for one and pucklike fairly revel in mischief as paint he be in fact more a pagan deity than a christian man the foregoing charge may or must be admit partially or in full but such admission imply no denial of the historical value of the life all archaic literature be it remembered be in a greater or less degree uncritical and it must be read in the light of the writer 's time and surroundings that imagination should sometimes run riot and the pen be carry beyond the boundary line of the strictly literal be perhaps nothing much to be marvel at in the case of the supernatural mind celt with religion for he theme do the scribe believe what he write when he recount the multiply marvel of he holy patron 's life doubtless he do -- and why not to the unsophisticated monastic and mediaeval mind as to the mind of primitive man the marvellous and supernatural be almost as real and near as the commonplace and natural if anyone doubt this let he study the mind of the modern irish peasant let he get beneath its surface and inside its guardian ring of shrink reserve there he will find the same material exactly as compose the mind of the tenth century biographer of declan and mochuda dreamer and visionary be of as frequent occurrence in erin of age ago as they be to-day then as now the supernatural and marvellous have a wondrous fascination for the celtic mind sometimes the attraction become so strong as seemingly to overbalance the faculty of distinguish fact from fancy of st bridget we be gravely tell that to dry she wet cloak she hang in out on a sunbeam another saint sail away to a foreign land on a sod from he native hillside more than once we find a flagstone turn into a raft to bear a missionary band beyond the sea st fursey exchange disease with he friend magnentius and stranger still the exchange be arrange and effect by correspondence to the saint moreover be ascribe life of incredible duration -- to mochta ibar seachnal and brendan for instance three hundred year each st mochemog be credit with a life of four hundred and thirteen year and so on clan or tribe rivalry be doubtless one of the thing which make for the invention and multiplication of miracle if the patron of the decy be credit with a miracle the tribesman of ossory must go one better and attribute to they tribal saint a marvel more striking still the hagiographer of decy retort for they patron by a claim of yet another miracle and so on it be to be fear too that occasionally a less worthy motive than tribal honor prompt the imagination of we irish hagiographer -- the desire to exploit the saint and he honor for worldly gain the life of the irish saint contain a immense quantity of material of first rate importance for the historian of the celtic church underneath the later concoction of fable be a solid substratum of fact which no serious student can ignore even where the narrative be otherwise plainly myth or fiction it shed many a useful sidelight on ancient manners custom and law as well as on the curious and often intricate operation of the celtic mind by life be here mean the old m biography which have come down to we from age before the invention of printing sometimes these life be style act generally we have only one standard life of a saint and of this there be usually several copy scatter in various library and collection occasionally a second life be find differ essentially from the first but as a rule the different copy be only recension of a single original some of the mss be parchment but the majority be in paper some life again be merely fragment and no doubt score if not hundred of other have be entirely lose of many hundred of we irish saint we have only the meager detail supply by the martyrology with perhaps occasional reference to they in the life of other saint again finally the memory of hundred and hundred of saint additional survive only in place name or be entirely lose there still survive probably over a hundred life -- possibly one hundred and fifty this however do not imply that therefore we have life of one hundred or one hundred and fifty saint for many of the saint whose act survive have really two set of the latter -- one in latin and the other in irish moreover of a few of the latin live and of a larger number of the irish life we have two or more recension there be for instance three independent life of st mochuda and one of these be in two recension the survive life naturally divide themselves into two great class -- the latin live and the irish -- write in latin and irish respectively we have a latin life only of some saint and irish life only of other and of other again we have a latin life and a irish it may be necessary to add the act which have be translate into latin by colgan or the bollandist do not of course rank as latin live whether the latin live proper be free translation of the irish life or the irish life translation of latin original remain still to a large extent a open question plummer -lrb- vita ssm hib introd -rrb- seem to favor the latin live as the original he reasoning here however leave one rather unconvinced this be not the place to go into the matter at length but a new bit of evidence which make against the theory of latin original may be quote it be furnish by the well know collection of latin live know as the codex salmanticensis to which be append brief marginal note in mixed middle irish and latin one such note to the life of st cuangus of lismore -lrb- recte liathmore -rrb- request a prayer for he who have translate the life out of the irish into latin if one of the life and this a typical or characteristic life be a translation we may perhaps assume that the other or most of they be translation also in any case we may assume as certain that there be original irish material or datum from which the formal life -lrb- irish or latin -rrb- be compile the latin life be contain mainly in four great collection the first and probably the most important of these be in the royal library at brussels include chiefly in a large m know as ` codex salmanticensis ' from the fact that it belong in the seventeenth century to the irish college of salamanca the second collection be in marsh 's library dublin and the third in trinity college library the two latter may for practical purpose be regard as one for they be sister mss -- copy from the same original the marsh 's library collection be almost certainly teste plummer the document refer to by colgan as codex kilkenniensis and it be quite certainly the codex ardmachanus of fleme the fourth collection -lrb- or the third if we take as one the two last mention -rrb- be in the bodleian at oxford amongst what be know as the rawlinson mss of minor importance for one reason or another be the collection of the franciscan library merchant ' quay dublin and in maynooth college respectively the first of the enumerated collection be publish ` in extenso ' about twenty-five year since by the marquis of bute while recently the gist of all the latin collection have be edit with rare scholarship by rev charle plummer of oxford incidentally may be note the one defect in mr plummer 's great work -- its author 's almost irritating insistence on pagan origin nature myth and heathen survival besides the marquis of bute and plummer colgan and the bollandist have publish some latin live and a few isolate life have be publish from time to time by other more or less competent editor the irish life though more numerous than the latin be less accessible the chief repertorium of the former be the burgundian or royal library brussels the m collection at brussels appear to have originally belong to the irish franciscan of louvain and much of it be in the well-known handwriting of michael o'clery there be also several collection of irish life in ireland -- in the royal irish academy for instance and trinity college library finally there be a few irish life at oxford and cambridge in the british museum marsh 's library & c and in addition there be many life in private hand in this connection it can be no harm and may do some good to note that a apparently brisk if unpatriotic trade in irish mss -lrb- include of course life of saint -rrb- be carry on with the united state wealthy often ignorant irish-american who be unable to read they be make collection of irish mss and rare irish book to ireland 's loss some irish mss too include life of saint have be carry away as memento of the old land by depart emigrant the date or period at which the life -lrb- latin and irish -rrb- be write be manifestly for half a dozen good reason a question of the utmost importance to the student of the subject alas that the question have to some extent successfully defy quite satisfactory solution we can so far only conjecture -- though the probability seem strong and the grounds solid the probability be that the latin live date as a rule from the twelfth and thirteenth century when they be put into something like they present form for reading -lrb- perhaps in the refectory -rrb- in the great religious house they be copy and re-copy during the succeed century and the scribe accord to they knowledge devotion or caprice make various addition subtraction and occasional multiplication the irish life be almost certainly of a somewhat earlier date than the latin and be base partly -lrb- ie as regard the bulk of the miracle -rrb- on local tradition and partly -lrb- ie as regard the purely historical element -rrb- on the authority of written material they too be no doubt copy and interpolate much as be the latin live the present copy of irish life date as a rule from the sixteenth and seventeenth century only and the fact that the latin and the irish life -lrb- where there be this double biography -rrb- sometimes agree very perfectly may indicate that the latin translation or life be very late the chief publish collection of irish saint ' life may be set down as seven scil : -- five in latin and one each in irish and english the latin collection be the bollandist ' colgan 's messingham 's fleming 's and plummer 's the irish collection be stoke ' -lrb- life of saint from the book of lismore -rrb- and the english be of course o'hanlon 's most striking probably of the characteristic of the life be they very evident effort to exalt and glorify the saint at any cost with this end of glorification in view the hagiographer be prepare to swallow everything and record anything he have in fact no critical sense and possibly he would regard possession of such a sense as rather a evil thing and use of it as irreverent he do not as a consequence succeed in present we with a very life-like or convincing portrait of either the man or the saint indeed the saint as draw in the life be as already hint a very unsaintlike individual -- almost as ready to curse as to pray and certainly very much more likely to smite the aggressor than to present to he the other cheek in the text we shall see st mochuda whose life be a specially sane piece of work cursing on the same occasion first king blathmac and the prince of cluain then the rich man cronan who sympathise with the eviction next a individual name dubhsulach who wink insolently at he and finally the people of st columba 's holy city of durrow who have stir up hostile feeling against he even gentle female saint can hurl a imprecation too st laisrech for instance condemn the land of those who refuse she tribute to -- nettle elder shrub and corncrake it be pretty plain that the compiler of the life have some prerogative claim or rights to uphold -- hence this frequent insistence on the evil of resist the saint and presumably he successor one characteristic of the irish ascetic appear very clear through all the exaggeration and all the biographical absurdity it be they spirit of intense mortification to understand this we have only to study one of the ancient irish monastic rule or one of the irish penitential as edit by d'achery -lrb- spicilegium -rrb- or wasserschleben -lrb- irische kanonensamerlung -rrb- severest fast unquestioning obedience and perpetual self renunciation be inculcate by the rule and we have ample evidence that they be observe with extraordinary fidelity the rule of maelruin absolutely forbid the use of meat or of beer such a prohibition a thousand year ago be a immensely more grievous thing than it would sound to-day wheaten bread might partially supply the place of meat to-day but meat be easier to procure than bread in the eighth century again a thousand year ago tea or coffee there be none and even milk be often difficult or impossible to procure in winter so severe in fact be the fast that religious sometimes die of it bread and water be find insufficient to sustain life and health gruel be substitute in some monastery and of this monastic gruel there be three variety : -- -lrb- a -rrb- gruel upon water in which the liquid be so thick that the meal reach the surface -lrb- b -rrb- gruel between two water in which the meal while it do not rise to the surface do not quite fall to the bottom and -lrb- c -rrb- gruel under water which be so weak and so badly boil that he meal easily fall to the bottom in the case of penitent the first brand of gruel be prescribe for light offence the second kind for sin of ordinary gravity and the gruel under water for extraordinary crime -lrb- vid messr gwynne and purton on the rule of maelruin & c -rrb- the most implicit exact and prompt obedience be prescribe and observe a overseer of mochuda 's monastery at rahen have occasion to order by name a young monk call colman to do something which involve he wade into a river instantly a dozen colman plunge into the water instance of extraordinary penance abound beside which the austerity of simon stylite almost pale the irish saint ' love of solitude be also a very marked characteristic desert place and solitary island of the ocean possess a apparently wonderful fascination for they the more inaccessible or forbid the island the more it be in request as a penitential retreat there be hardly one of the hundred island around the irish coast which one time or another do not harbor some saint or solitary upon its rocky bosom the testimony of the life to the saint ' love and practice of prayer be bear out by the evidence of more trustworthy document besides private prayer the whole psalter seem to have be recite each day in three part of fifty psalm each in addition a immense number of pater noster be prescribe the office and prayer be generally pretty liberally intersperse with genuflexion or prostration of which a certain anchorite perform as many as seven hundred daily another penitential action which accompany prayer be the ` cros-figul ' this be a extension of the arm in the shape of a cross if anyone want to know how difficult a practice this be let he try it for say fifteen minute regard recitation of the divine office it be of counsel and probably of precept that be should not be from memory merely but that the psalm should all be read for this a good reason be give by maelruin ie that the recitation might engage the eye as well as the tongue and think a irish homily refer to the mortification of the saint and religious of the time as martyrdom of which it distinguish three kind -- red white and blue red martyrdom be death for the faith white martyrdom be the discipline of fast labor and bodily austerity while blue martyrdom be abnegation of the will and heartfelt sorrow for sin one of the puzzle of irish hagiology be the great age attribute to certain saint -- period of two hundred three hundred and even four hundred year do the original compiler of the life intend this whatever the full explanation be the writer of the life be clearly animated by a desire to make they saint cotemporary and if possible a disciple of one or other of the great monastic founder or at any rate to prove he a pupil of one of the great school of erin there be special anxiety to connect the saint with bangor or clonard to effect the connection in question it be sometimes necessary to carry the life backwards at other time to carry it forwards and occasionally to lengthen it both backwards and forwards dr cha o'connor give a not very convincing explanation of the three-hundred-year life scil : -- that the saint live in three century -- during the whole of one century and in the end and begin respectively of the precede and succeed century this explanation even if satisfactory for the three-hundred-year life would not help at all towards the life of four hundred year a common explanation be that the scribe mistake numeral in the m before he and write the wrong figure there be no doubt that copying be a fruitful source of error as regard numeral it be much more easy to make a mistake in a numeral than in a letter the context will enable one to correct the letter while it will give he no clue as regard a numeral on the subject of the alleged longevity of irish saint anscombe have recently be elaborate in ` eriu ' a new and very ingenious theory somewhat unfortunately the author happen to be a rather frequent propounder of ingenious theory he explanation be briefly -- the use and confusion of different system of chronology he allege that the original writer use what be call the diocletian era or the era of the martyr as the ` terminus a quo ' of they chronological system and in support of he position he adduce the fact that this which be the most ancient of all ecclesiastical era be the era use by the schismatic in britain and that it be introduce by st patrick as against the contradiction anachronism and extravagance of the life we have to put the fact that generally speak the latter corroborate one another and that they receive extern corroboration from the annals such disagreement as occur be only what one would expect to find in document deal with time so remote to the credit side too must go the fact that reference to celtic geography and to local history be all as a rule accurate of continental geography and history however the writer of the life show much ignorance but scarcely quite as much as the corresponding ignorance show by continental writer about ireland the missionary method of the early irish church and its monastic or semi-monastic system be frequently refer to as peculiar if not unique a missionary system more or less similar must however have prevail generally in that age what other system could have be nearly as successful amongst a pagan people circumstance as the irish be the community system alone afford the necessary mutual encouragement and protection to the missionary each monastic station become a base of operation the numerous diminutive diocese quasi-diocese or tribal church be little more than extensive parish and the missionary bishop be little more in jurisdiction than glorified parish priest the bishop 's ` muintir ' that be the member of he household be he assistant clergy have convert the chieftain or head of the tribe the missionary have but to instruct and baptise the tribesman and to erect church for they land and material for the church be provide by the clan or the clan 's head and land for support of the missioner or of the missionary community be allot just as they have be previously allot to the pagan priesthood in fact there can be but little doubt that the land of the pagan priest become in many case the endowment of the christian establishment it be not necessary by the way to assume that the church in ireland as patrick leave it be formally monastic the clergy live in community it be true but it be under a somewhat elastic rule which be really rather a series of christian and religious counsel a more formal monasticism have develop by the time of mochuda this be evidently influence by the spread of st benedict 's rule as patrick 's quasi-monasticism nearly two century previously have be influence by pachomius and st basil through lerin the real peculiarity in ireland be that when the community-missionary system be no longer necessary it be not abandon as in other land but be rather develop and emphasise introduction -- st mochuda it be he -lrb- mochuda -rrb- that have the famous congregation consist of seven hundred and ten person a angel use to address every third man of they -lrb- martyrology of donegal -rrb- in some respects the life of mochuda here present be in sharp contrast to the corresponding life of declan the former document be in all essential a very sober historical narrative -- accurate wherever we can test it credible and harmonious on the whole philologically to be sure it be of little value -- certainly a much less valuable life than declan 's historically however -lrb- and question of the pre-patrician mission apart -rrb- it be immensely the more important document on one point do we feel inclined to quarrel with its author scil : that he have not give we more specifically the motive underlie mochuda 's expulsion from rahen -- one of the three worst counsel ever give in erin reading between he line we spell jealousy -- ` invidia religiosorum ' another jealousy too be suggest -- the mutual distrust of north and south which have be the canker-worm of irish political life for fifteen hundred year make intelligible if not justify the indignation of a certain distinguished irishman who want to know the man 's name in order to curse its owner who first divide ireland into two province three different life of mochuda be know to the present writer two of they be contain in a m at brussels -lrb- c\/r bindon p 8 13 -rrb- and of one of these there be a copy in a m of dineen 's in the royal irish academy -lrb- stowe collection a iv i -rrb- dineen appear to have be a cork or kerry man and to have work under the patronage of the rather note franciscan father franci matthew -lrb- o'mahony -rrb- who be put to death at cork by inchiquin in 1644 the bald text of dineen 's life be publish a few year since without translation in the ` irish rosary ' the corresponding brussels copy be in michael o'clery 's familiar hand in it occur the strange pagan-flavoured story of the british monk constantine o'clery 's copy be make in January 1627 at the friary of drouish from the book of tadhg o'ceanan and it be immediately follow by a tract entitle -- do macaib ua suanac the bell of mochuda by the way which the saint ring against blathmac be call the ` glassan ' of hui suanaig in later time the life here print which follow the latin life so closely that one seem a late translation of the other be as far as the editor be aware contain in a single m only this be m 23 50 rium in the handwriting of john murphy na raheenach murphy be a co cork schoolmaster scribe and poet of whom a biographical sketch will be find prefix by mr r a foley to a collection of murphy 's poem that he have edit the sobriquet na raheenach be really a kind of tribal designation the life be very full but be in its present form a comparatively late production it be transcribe by murphy between 1740 and 1750 it be much to be regret that the scribe tell we nothing of he original murphy but the way seem to have specialise to some extent in saint 's life and to have imbue he disciple with something of the same taste one of he pupil be maurice o'connor a scribe and shipwright of cove to whom we owe the life of st ciaran of saighir print in silva gadelica the reason of choice for publication here of the present life be avowedly non-philological the motive for preference be that it be the longest of the three life and for historical purpose the most important the life present considerable evidence of historical reliability its geography be detail and correct its reference to contemporary of mochuda be accurate on the whole and there be few inconsistency or none moreover it shed some new light on that chronic puzzle -- organization of the celtic church of ireland mochuda head of a great monastery at rahen be likewise a kind of pluralist parish priest with a parish in kerry administer in he name by deputed ecclesiastic and other parish similarly administer in kerrycurrihy rostellan west muskerry and spike island co cork when a chief parishioner lie seriously ill in distant corca duibhne mochuda himself come all the way from the center of ireland to administer the last rite to the die man and so on the relation of the people to the church and its minister be in many respects not at all easy to understand oblation for instance of themselves and they territory & c by chieftain be frequent oblation of monastery be make in a similar way probably this signify no more than that the chief region or monastery put itself under the saint 's jurisdiction or rule or both that there be other church too than the purely monastic appear from offering to mochuda of already exist church vg from the clanna ruadhan in decy & c lismore the most famous of mochuda 's foundation become within a century of the saint

-rrb- of northumbrium for instance be say to have partake of lismore 's hospitality and certainly cormac of cashel malachy and celsus of armagh and many other of the most distinguish of the scot partake thereof the roll of lismore 's calendared saint would require do the matter fall within we immediate province more than one page to itself some interesting reference to mochuda and he holy city occur in the life of one of he disciple st colman maic luachain edit for the rium by professor kuno meyer there be many indication in the present life that at one period and in the time of carthach the western boundary of decy extend far beyond the line at present recognize similar indication be furnish by the martyrology & c for instance the martyrology of donegal under November 28th record of the three son of bochra that they be of archadh raithin in uus mic caille in deisus mumhan and ibid p xxxvii it be state i ccondae corcaige ataid na desi muman not only imokilly but all co

cloneneigh -rrb- the diocese of lismore be make to extend to cork -- probably over the present barony of imokilly kinatallon and barrymore that part at least of condon and clangibbon be likewise include be inferrible from the fact that as late as the sixteenth century visitation kilworth found by colman maic luachain rank as a parish in the diocese of lismore further evidence point in the same direction be furnish by clondulane & c represent in the present life as within carthach 's jurisdiction the rule of st carthach be one of the few ancient irish so-called monastic rule survive it be in reality less a rule as the latter be now understand than a series of christian and religious counsel draw up by a spiritual master for he disciple it must not be understand from this that each religious house do not have it formal regulation the latter however seem to have depend largely upon the abbot 's spirit will or discretion the exist rule abound in allusion to forget practice and custom and to add to they obscurity they language be very difficult -- sometimes like the language of the brehon law unintelligible the rule ascribe to mochuda be certainly a document of great antiquity and may well have emanate from the seventh century and from the author whose name it bear the tradition of lismore and indeed of the irish church be constant in attribute it to he copy of the rule be find in numerous mss but many of they be worthless owe to the incompetence of the scribe to whom the difficult irish of the text be unintelligible the text in the leabhar breac have be make the basis of he edition of the rule by mac eaglaise a writer in the ` irish ecclesiastical record ' -lrb- 1910 -rrb- mac eaglaise 's edition though it be not all that could be desire be far the most satisfactory which have yet appear previous edition of the rule or part of it comprise one by dr reeve in he tract on the culdee one by kuno meyer in the ` gaelic journal ' -lrb- vol v -rrb- and another in ` archiv fuer cl ' -lrb- 3 bund 1905 -rrb- and another again in ` eriu ' -lrb- vol 2 p 172 -rrb- besides a free translation of the whole rule by o'curry in the ' i r record ' for 1864 the text of the ` record ' edition of 1910 be from leabhar breac collate with other mss the order in the various copy be not the same and some copy contain material which be want in other the rule commence with the ten commandment then it enumerate the obligation respectively of bishop abbot priest monk and culdee -lrb- anchorite -rrb- finally there be a section on the order of meal and on the refectory and another on the obligation of a king the follow excerpt on the duty of a abbot -lrb- ' i e record ' translation -rrb- will illustrate the style and spirit of the rule : of the abbot of a church 1 -- if you be the head man of a church noble be the power better for you that you be just who take the heirship of the king 2 -- if you be the head man of a church noble be the obligation preservation of the rights of the church from the small to the great 3 -- what holy church command preach then with diligence what you order to each one do it yourself 4 -- as you love you own soul

yours the healing of every host both strong and weak 6 -- yours to judge each one accord to grade and accord to deed he will advise you at judgment before the king 10 -- yours to rebuke the foolish to punish the host turn disorder into order -lrb- restraint -rrb- of the stubborn obstinate wretched reservation of the coarbship of mochuda at lismore in favor of kerryman be a extremely curious if not unique provision how long it continue in force we do not know probably it endure to the twelfth century and possibly the rule be not of strict interpretation christian o'connarchy who be bishop of lismore in the twelfth century be regard as a native of decy though the contrary be slightly suggest by he final retirement to kerry the alleged prophecy concern kerry man and the coarbship point to some rule regulation or law of mochuda life of st mochuda or bea mocuda the renowned bishop carthach commonly call mochuda be of the territory of ciarraighe luachra -lrb- north kerry -rrb- and of the

future mochuda be foretell to st brendan by a angel who declare : there will come to you a wonder-working brother who will be the patron of you and you kindred for ever the region of ciarraighe will be divide between you and he and carthach will be he name to multitude he advent will be cause for joy and he will gain multitude for heaven he first city will be raithen -lrb- rahen or rahan -rrb- in

of the hour mochuda say to he monk : -- we shall not eat to-day till each one of you have make he confession for he know that some one of they have ill will in he heart against another all the brethren thereupon confess to he one of they in the course of he confession state : i love not you miller and the cause of my lack of charity towards he be this that when i come to the mill he will not lift the load off the horse and he will neither help I to fill the meal sack nor to load they on the horse when fill and not this alone but he do everything that be disagreeable to I moreover i can not tell but god know why he so act often i have think of striking he or even beat he to death mochuda reply brother dear the prophet say -- ` declina a malo et fac bonum ' -lrb- psalm 36 -lrb- 37 -rrb- :27 -rrb- avoid evil and do good follow this precept let you act kindly towards the miller and that charity of yours will move he to charity towards you and ye shall yet be steadfast friend thing go on thus for three day -- the monk do all he could to placate the miller nevertheless the miller do not cease he persecution nor the brother he hate of the miller on the third day mochuda direct the brother to confess to he again the brother say : -- this be my confession father i do not yet love the miller mochuda observe : -- he will change to-night and to-morrow he will not break fast till you meet he and you shall sit on the same seat at the same table and you shall remain fast friend for the rest of you life all this come to pass for that monk be through the instruction of mochuda fill with the grace of the divine spirit and he glorified and praise mochuda for he recognize he as a man favor by the holy ghost on another occasion two british monk of mochuda 's monastery have a conversation in secret mochuda they say be very old though there be no immediate appearance of approach death -- and there be no doubt that he equal in virtue or good work will never be find -- therefore if he be out of the way one of we might succeed he let we then kill he as there be no likelihood of he natural death within a reasonable time they resolve therefore to drown he in the river towards close of the follow night and to conceal all trace so that the crime could never be discover they find he subsequently in a lonely place where he be accustom to pray they bind he tightly and carry he between they on they shoulder to the water on they way to the river they meet one of the monk who use to walk around the cemetery every night he say to they : what be that you carry they reply that it be portion of the monastic wash which they be take to the river he however under the insistent suggestion of the holy spirit believe they not he say : put down you load till we examine it they be constrain to obey and the burden prove to be -- mochuda the monk who detect -lrb- the propose murder -rrb- be the overseer of the homestead he say mournfully my god it be a dreadful work you be about mochuda say gently : -- son it be well for I have that be do to I for i should now be number among the holy martyr and it be bad for they -lrb- the two wicked monk -rrb- for it be with juda the betrayer of he lord they should be tortured for ever who have desire my death for they own advancement neither these wretched man themselves nor anyone of they nation shall be my coarb for ever but my successor shall be of he race through whom god have rescue I moreover my city shall never be without man of the british race who will be butt and laughing-stock and serve no useful purpose the person who save mochuda be of the ciarraighe race and it be of that same people that the coarb and successor of mochuda have commonly be ever since -lrb- see note 2 -rrb- mochuda refuse for a long while as we have already say to accept cattle or horse from anyone it be the monk themselves who dig and cultivate the land and they do all the haulage of the monastery on they own back st fionan however who be a kinsman of mochuda and have just return from rome come at this time on a visit to the monastery he reproach mochuda say : mochuda why do you impose the burden of brute beast upon rational being be it not for use of the latter that all other animal have be create of a truth i shall not taste food in this house till you have remedy this grievance thenceforth mochuda -- in honor of fionan -- permit he monk to accept horse and ox from the people and he free they from the hardship allude to sometime later the holy abbot lachtaoin -lrb- st lachten -rrb- compassionate mochuda and he monk because of they lack of cattle pay a visit to rahen bring with he a gift of thirty cow and a bull also a couple of cattleman and two dairymaid come near rahen he leave the cattle in a secluded place for he do not wish they to be see thereupon he go himself to the monastery and simulate illness request a drink of milk the house steward go to mochuda to tell he that lachtaoin be ill and required milk mochuda order the steward to fill a pitcher with water and bring it to he -- and this order be execute mochuda bless the water which immediately be change into sweet new milk apparently of that day 's milk he send the milk to lachtaoin but the latter identify it as milk miraculously produce he in turn bless it with the result that it be change back again into water he complain : -- it be not water but milk i have ask for the messenger related this fact publicly lachtaoin declare : -- mochuda be a good monk but he successor will not be able to change water to milk and to the messenger he say -- go to mochuda and tell he that i shall not break bread in this house until he accept the alms which i have bring to the community on mochuda agree to accept they he hand over the cattle and dairyman to the monk of rahen and the steward take charge of they mochuda say thereupon that he should not have accept the cattle but as a compliment to lachtaoin lachtaoin reply : -- from this day forward there will be plenty cattle and worldly substance in you dwelling-place and there will be a multitude of holy people in the other place whence you be to depart to heaven -lrb- for you will be exile from you present home -rrb- after they have mutually bless and take leave and pledge friendship lachtaoin depart once at harvest time the farm steward come to mochuda complain that though the crop be dead ripe a sufficient number of harvester could not be find mochuda answer : go in peace dear brother and god will send you satisfactory reaper this promise be fulfil for a band of angel come to the ripest and largest field reap and bind a great deal quickly and gather the crop into one place the monk marvel though they know it be god 's work and they praise and thank he and mochuda the spirit of obedience amongst mochuda 's monk be such that if any senior member of the community order another to lie in the fire he would be obey as a instance of this -- some of the brethren be on one occasion bake bread in a oven when one the monk say to another younger than himself the bread be burn : take it out instantly there be a iron shovel for draw out the bread but the brother could not find it on the instant he heed not the flame which shoot out of the oven 's mouth but catch the hot bread and shift it with he hand and suffer no hurt whatever on another day the monk be engage in labor beside the river which run through the monastery one of the senior monk call upon a young monk name colman to do a certain piece of work immediately as he have not name any particular colman twelve monk of the name rush into the water the readiness and exactness of the obedience practice be display in this incident great moreover be they meekness and patience in sickness or ill-health as appear from the case of the monk out of the wound of whose body maggot fall as he walk yet he never complain or tell anyone or leave he work for two moment although it be plain from he appearance that he health be decline and he be grow thinner from day to day the brother pity he very much at length mochuda question he -- put he under obedience to tell the truth -- as to the cause of he decline the monk thereupon show he he side which be tear by a twig tie fast around they mochuda ask he who have do that barbarous and intolerable thing to he the monk answer : -- one day while we be draw log of timber from the wood my girdle break from the strain so that my clothes hang loose a monk behind I see this and cut a twig tie it so tightly around my side that it have cause my flesh to mortify mochuda ask -- and why do you not loosen the twig the monk reply -- because my body in not my own and he who tie it -lrb- the withe -rrb- have never loose it it be a whole year since the withe have be fasten around he mochuda say to he : -- brother you have suffer great pain as a reward thereof take now you choice -- you restoration to bodily health or spiritual health by

the prophecy of columcille and other holy man that mochuda should be expel from rahen the king of tara blathmac the son of aodh slaine and he brother diarmuid come together with some clergy of the cluain earaird -lrb- clonard -rrb- community to carry out the eviction -lrb- in ad 635 -rrb- they say to he leave this monastery and region and seek a place for yourself elsewhere mochuda reply -- in this place i have desire to end my day here i have be many year serve god and have almost reach the end of my life therefore i shall not depart unless i be drag hence by the hand against my will for it be not become a old man to abandon easily the place in which he have spend great part of he life then the noble return to blathmac and they make various complaint of mochuda accuse he falsely of

you shall possess the kingdom of god and you shall reign in you brother 's stead and you face which you have turn from I shall never be turn from you enemy moreover the reproach which the king will presently cast upon you for not do the work he have set you will be you praise and you pride at the same time as a penalty for you evil design toward I and you greater readiness to drive I out you son

irreverently towards mochuda mochuda say to he : -- thus shall you be -- with one eye close and a grin on you countenance -- to the end of you life and of you descendant many will be similarly afflict yet another member of the company one cailche scurrilously abused and cursed mochuda to he mochuda say : -- dysentery will attack you immediately and murrain that will cause you death the misfortune

above or the sea below colman answer : -- let each restrain that which be nearest to he -- for molua be on the upper or stream side and colman on the lower or sea side molua say to colman -- forbid you the sea side to flow naturally and i shall forbid the stream side then with great faith they proceed to cross the river they sign the river with the sign of christ 's cross and the water stand on either hand and apart so that the dry earth appear between the side bank of water rise high because there be no passage up or down so that the ridge be very elevated on both the sea and stream side the water remain thus till such time as all mochuda 's people have cross mochuda himself be the last to pass over and the path across be so level that it offer no obstacle to foot-passenger or chariot but be like a level plain so that they cross dryshod as the jordan fall back for josue the son of nun -lrb- josue 3:17 -rrb- soon as mochuda have cross over he bless the water and command they to
