end my dear young friend it be not my purpose to detain you with a long preface because i be aware that long preface be seldom read but i wish to inform you that i have write this book in the humble hope of be useful to those in whom i be so anxiously interested i be myself happy in acknowledge the endearing appellation of mother and i love _ all _ child and regard they as priceless treasure entrust to the care and guidance of parent and teacher with whom it rest in a great measure to render they blessing to they fellow-creature and happy themselves or contrariwise should the perusal of this little volume imbue you with a taste for the beautiful and ennobling science of geography my object will be gain and that such may be the result of these humble endeavor be the sincere wish of you affectionate friend fanny osborne london chapter i oh ye sea and flood bless ye the lord : praise he and magnify he forever oh what beautiful weather exclaim george wilton as he draw he chair nearer the fire this sort of evening be so suitable for story-telling that i regret more than ever the disagreeable necessity which have take mr stanley to foreign country and break up we delightful party but yet there be enough of we remain at home to form a society we _ might _ manage without he do not you remember papa you say when julium manver be with we last summer we be to examine into the particulars respect the sea and ocean of the world and not once be the subject mention while we be at herne bay although the sea be continually before we to remind we of it be we _ ever _ to have any more of those conversation i like they amazingly and i be sure i learn a great deal more geography by they than i ever do out of goldsmith or any other dry lesson-book which compel one to learn by rule i wish dear papa you would settle to have these meeting again we would write down all the particulars and enclose they in a letter to mr stanley : i be sure he would be quite pleased i think he would george reply mr wilton and i also think that we have be rather careless in this matter but at the same time you must remember that the fault do not rest solely with we for when we appoint certain time during we sojourn at herne bay for these same geographical discussion on every occasion something occur to prevent the meeting and all we arrangement fall to the ground since then the illness of you sister -- which thank god have terminate so happily -- the departure of mr stanley and the removal to we present abode all these circumstance conspire to render ineffectual any attempt at regularity and preclude the possibility of a occasional quiet chat on this really important subject the past present and future in the history of man be so connect with the position of the great sea of the globe and the navigation of they that i _ do _ regard the study of geography as one of the _ most important _ branch of a christian education and now that all impediment be remove i think we may venture to propose the re-establishment of we little society and as we be deprive of the valuable service of mr stanley we must endeavor to supply he place by procure the aid of another _ learn _ friend who will not consider it derogatory to assist in we edifying amusement and in order to render these meeting more extensively beneficial and interesting i further propose that we increase we number by admit two new member to be select by you my dear child from amongst you juvenile acquaintance but we must not admit any except on the original term which be ` that each member add he or she mite of information to the general fund ' what say mamma about it suppose we put it to the vote oh dear papa exclaim emma i be quite sure _ that _ will be unnecessary grandy have often talk of the meeting hold last year and regret that there seem no disposition to renew they therefore we be sure of _ she _ vote mamma be so useful with _ she _ description that _ she _ be not likely to object then you know dear papa how very much _ i _ enjoy these conversation and as far as any one else be concerned i be convince that _ my _ candidate will be glad to prepare a portion of the subject as she admission fee and will be as much interested in the welfare of the society as we old member be who have already feel the advantage arise from it may we decide now papa all hand be raise in reply and the resolution carry unanimously i have a question to ask say george may we have the meeting twice during the month instead of once as before it will induce we to be more industrious as we shall be oblige to work to get up the information i can share the labor with emma now because i can write easily and quickly besides it will be such pleasant employment for the half-holiday very well my dear say mr wilton then once a fortnight it shall be and take care as the time will be short that you be thoroughly prepare : do not reckon on I for i can not assist you as mr stanley do so you must be in a great measure dependent upon you own resource my library be at you disposal and i hope you will have sufficient perseverance to investigate each point carefully before you come to a decision should you require assistance in the preparation of any particular part of the subject of course i shall have no objection to render it but remember i do not promise to be a active member as i wish you to exert yourselve and be in some degree independent it will thus be more advantageous to you : it will not only impress all you learn effectually on you mind but improve you reasoning faculty and enable you to understand much that the most careful explanation might fail to render intelligible and when shall we begin papa ask emma mr wilton my engagement until the 7th of February be so numerous as to preclude the possibility of my presence at a meeting before that time but after the 7th inst i shall be more at liberty and we will if you please commence we voyage and -lrb- wind and weather permit -rrb- travel on regularly and perseveringly until we have circumnavigate the globe agree agree merrily shout the child i know which of my friend i shall ask say george and i fancy i can guess who will be emma 's new member i fancy you can not return emma : i do not intend to tell any one either until i hear whether or not she can come therefore check you inquisitiveness master george and wait patiently for you will not know before the 7th when i will introduce my friend now say grandy have settle the most important part of the business i have a few word to say you must all be aware that in the account of sea and ocean there can not possibly be so much time disposed of in descriptive fact as there be in we former conversation concern the river of the world which be so numerous and require so many minute particulars in trace they course that they positively -lrb- although occupy a smaller portion of the globe -rrb- take more time to sail over in we ship ` the research ' than the boundless ocean which occupy two third of we world it will under these circumstance be advisable to illustrate we subject largely and to lose no opportunity of extend it for we benefit we need not fear to exhaust the topic for do not the vast water encompass the globe and can we contemplate these great work of we creator without have we heart fill with wonder and admiration this my child will lead we to the right source to the author of all the wonder contain in ` heaven and earth and in the water under the earth ' and if we possess any gratitude we heart will be raise in thankfulness to he who ` have do all thing well ' and we shall bless he for give we power of discernment and reasoning faculty which not only enable we to see and appreciate the goodness of god but also by he grace assist we to turn we knowledge to advantage for we temporal and eternal good we may now say mr wilton leave these resolution to be act upon at a proper time and as we have two hour ' leisure before supper if you dear mother will tell we one of you sweet story of real life it will be both a pleasant and profitable way of pass the evening we have all employment for we finger and can work while we listen george and i with we pencil and you lady with you sewing and knit grandy well what must it be something nautical i suppose for as we be about to set sail in a few day it will be appropriate will it not george oh yes dear grandy a nautical story if you please #story of frederic hamilton # the first time i see frederic hamilton be on board the ` neptune ' outward bind for jamaica : he be then a lad of twelve or fourteen year : i can not be sure which but i remember he be tall for he age and extremely good look there be so many circumstance during the voyage which bring I in contact with this boy and so many occasion to arouse my sympathy in he behalf -lrb- for he be evidently in delicate health and unfit for laborious work -rrb- that in a short time i become deeply interested concern he and i determine as soon as i have recover from sea-sickness to watch for a opportunity of inquire into the particulars of he earlier history i must first tell you before proceed with the story of my hero that the captain of the ` neptune ' be a very harsh cruel man and make every one on board he vessel as uncomfortable as he could by he violent temper and ungentlemanly conduct i be the only lady-passenger and have it not be for the kindness of my fellow-traveller i scarcely think i could have survive all the terror of that dreadful voyage the sailor without one dissentient voice declare they have never sail with such a master and wish they have know a trifle of the rough side of he character before they engage with he and then he would have have to seek long enough to make up a crew for not one of they would have ship with he ' they even go so far as to say that if at any time they could escape from the vessel they would not hesitate a moment but would get away and leave the captain to work the ship by himself i could not take part with the captain because i see too much of he tyranny to entertain a particle of respect for he and i confess i be not in the least surprised at the language of the ill-used sailor he have no good feature in he character that i could discover for he be mean vulgar discontented and brutal he never encourage the man in the performance of they duty by kind expression on the contrary he never address they on the most simple matter without oath and imprecation and oftentimes enforce he command with a rope 's end or he fist we have yet other cause of discomfort besides these continual uproar contrary wind constant gale and violent storm make we heart fail from fear we know the captain could not expect _ he _ blessing whose law he openly set at defiance indeed by he life and conversation he prove that he ` care for none of these thing ' i believe he be a clever seaman : he have certainly have much experience have be upward of fifty time across the atlantic : so that we feel at ease with regard to the _ management _ of the ship but we do not put we trust in the skill of the captain alone for of what avail would that be if the lord withhold he hand and leave we to perish no my dear we see that the captain never pray and we feel there be a greater necessity for we to be diligent in the duty and daily nay hourly we entreat the forbearance and assistance of almighty god to conduct we in safety to land after a time the man become very unmanageable for they hate the captain : he treat they like slave and impose upon they on every occasion so that at length goad to desperation by he cruelty they positively refuse to handle a rope until he agree to the term they intend to propose the captain fierce as he be feel it would be useless to contend with twenty angry man and he know the passenger would not befriend he : he therefore deem it expedient to endeavor to conciliate they by promise he never intend to perform and after a few hour ' confusion all be again comparatively quiet i could tell you much more about the quarrel and disturbance of which we unfortunate passenger have to be the passive witness and which accustom as we be to they in the day-time fill I with greater horror than i can describe break upon the stillness of the night when all be quiet but the troubled ocean whose murmur instead of arouse serve to lull we into a deeper repose yes often when no other sound but the low splashing of the wave against the side of the ship be to be hear and we be all either sleep quietly or think deeply of home and friend loud cry and shout would reach we and in a instant we would all be gather together to inquire into the cause of the disturbance it be always the captain and some of the man fight and on one occasion the battle be so close to we actually in the cabin between the captain and the steward that i scream aloud and do not remember ever to have be so much alarmed but as my principal object be to make you acquaint with frederic hamilton and not with _ my _ adventure i will say no more about captain simmon and he ship than be necessary in the course of my tale i be just get over the unpleasant sensation of sea-sickness when one morning as i be dress in my berth a noise of scuffle on the quarter-deck over my head interrupted my operation i lay my brush on the table and listen at first i could distinguish nothing and think it be the captain and a sailor dispute i continue my toilet when suddenly a piercing cry reach I and i know the voice to be frederic 's at the same time the sound of heavy blow fall on my ear and again i recognize he voice : he call out so loudly that i hear he distinctly say ` oh sir have mercy pray pray do not kill I oh sir think of my mother and have pity upon I i _ will _ try to please you sir indeed indeed i will oh mercy mercy ' he cry become fainter and fainter while the blow continue accompany occasionally by the gruff voice of the captain until my soul shrink with horror i could endure it no longer i rush out of my cabin and there on the poop behold a sight i can never forget poor frederic be lash to the shroud with he hand above he head which be then droop on he shoulder he back bare and bleed the brutal captain be stand by with a thick rope in he grasp which by the crimson stain upon it sufficiently prove the vile purpose for which its service have just be require i call out hastily and angrily to the captain to cease beat the boy and declare i would fetch out the gentleman to interfere if he do not stop he unmanly behavior he glare on I with the fiercest expression imaginable -lrb- for he be in a towering rage -rrb- and tell I i have better not meddle with _ he _ in the performance of he duty for he would do as he like _ he _ be master of the ship and nobody else and he would like to see anybody else try to be then he make use of such fearful language that i dread to approach he but my fear lest he should again attack the boy overcome my fear for he in he anger and i ascend the ladder he desire nay _ command _ I to retire to my cabin but i say ` no captain i will not stir hence until you release frederic and if you strike he again i will be a witness of you cowardly behavior towards a poor boy whose only fault be want of strength to do the work assign he i be quite sure whatever you may say on board-ship you will not be able to justify you conduct on shore ' he do not again address I but mutter curse loud and deep he untie the faint boy and give he a savage push lay he prostrate on the deck : he then walk forward and begin to shout aloud he order to the man on the main-deck the man at the helm pity the poor boy call to the boatswain who be stand on the forecastle and beg he to send some water to throw over the lad and some dress for he wound back i stay by he for a short time and when he be somewhat recover i go below i fancied when i meet the captain at the dinner-table that he look rather ashamed for i have relate the whole affair to the other passenger and he could perceive by they indifference towards he that they despise he for he cowardice he try to be jocular but could not succeed in exciting we risibility : we do not even encourage he joke by the shadow of a smile and he seem uneasy during the remainder of the time we sit at table i now feel more than ever interested in the fate of frederic hamilton and be not sorry i have say so much in the morning prudence might have dictate milder language certainly but my indignation be arouse and when i find that my remonstrance have the desire effect i do not repent of my impetuosity about a week after this unhappy occurrence as i be lean over the rail on the quarter-deck watch the shoal of porpoise -lrb- for we be then in a warm latitude -rrb- playing in the bright blue sea at the vessel 's side the boatswain who be a fine specimen of a sea-faring man come up and seat himself on a fowl-coop near I commence sort rope-yarn for the man to spin presently frederic walk up the ladder with a bucket of water to pour into the trough for the thirsty poultry who be stretch they neck through the bar and open they bill longing for the refreshing draught : the heat be overpower and the poor thing be closely pack in they miserable coop i remark to william how pale the boy look and how thin and say i fear he be not only badly treated but have not proper nourishment ` why ma'am ' say he ` to say the truth the lad 's not be use to this kind of living and it be the worst thing as ever happen to he to be bring on board the neptune with we skipper for a master you see madam ' he continue ` he father be a parson but _ he _ be dead and the mother try hard to persuade the lad -lrb- for poor thing he be she only boy -rrb- to turn parson too when he father die but no the boy have set he mind on go to sea and as he have no friend who could help he to go to school or college and he godfather captain hartly offer to pay the apprenticeship fee if he mother would let he learn navigation she at last though much against she will consent that he should be bind apprentice to we skipper here but it pretty nigh break she heart to part with the child and she beg the captain to use he gently and bear with he a little for he be not so hardy as many boy of he age and moreover have be accustom to kindness and delicate treatment the lad be a fine noble-hearted lad but he be not strong and it be my opinion that the master want to get rid of he to have the fee for nothing and he be try what hard live hard work and hard usage will do towards make he go the faster but he have better mind what he be about there be many a man on board that can speak a good word for frederic when he get ashore and if all come out it will go hard with the master the poor lad cry himself to sleep every night and when he be asleep he have no rest for in he dream he talk of he mother and sister and often sob loud enough to wake the man whose hammock swing near he i be very sorry to see all this for he be a fine boy as i say before and we be all fond of he but he be not fit for this kind of work leastwise not yet i be glad you have take notice of he madam for though you can not do any good while we be at sea may be when you come ashore you will not forget poor frederic hamilton ' when the boatswain leave I i walk up and down the deck ponder on these thing and contrive all sort of scheme for the relief of my young friend and wonder how i could manage to have some conversation with he on the subject when a circumstance occur which at once enable I not only to learn all i be anxious to know but also in a great measure to improve he condition on board the ` neptune ' i know that frederic must have be train up in the fear of the lord for he daily conduct testify that he not only know what be right but try to perform it also and notwithstanding the severe trial he have to undergo while with we on the voyage to jamaica yet i never hear a harsh or disrespectful expression fall from he lip but he would attribute all the captain 's unkind treatment of he to something wrong in himself and he every day try beyond he strength to obtain a look of approbation from he stern master but alas he know not to whom he look although he be cuff and kick about whenever he try to be brisk in the task allot to he he be always the same patient melancholy little fellow throughout the voyage sometimes during the night watch i have catch the musical tone of he voice as he walk the quarter-deck when the captain be in he berth fast asleep the boy be comparatively happy and as the ship sail quietly along in the pale moonlight he thought would wander back to the home of he beloved mother and sister and the buoyancy of youthful spirit gain the ascendency over more melancholy musing he would for a while forget he present sorrow and almost involuntarily break out in singing some of the sweet hymn in which he have be accustom to join when the little family assemble for devotional exercise it be then i use to open my cabin window and breathlessly listen to the clear voice of my gentle protégé and not unfrequently could even distinguish the word he sing now loud -- now soft as he approach or retreat one hymn in particular seem to be a special favorite and be so applicable to he situation that i have remember several of the verse ` jesus i my cross have take all to leave and follow thee : destitute despise forsake thou from hence my all shall be perish every fond ambition all i have seek and hope and know yet how rich be my condition -- god and heaven be still my own ` man may trouble and distress I ` twill but drive I to thy breast life with trial hard may press I heaven will bring I sweeter rest oh ` tis not in grief to harm I while thy love be leave to I oh ` twere not in joy to charm I be that joy unmixed with thee ` take my soul thy full salvation rise o'er sin and fear and care joy to find in every station something still to do or bear think what spirit dwell within thee what a father 's smile be thine what thy savior do to win thee -- child of heav 'n should ` st thou repine ` haste then on from grace to glory arm by faith and wing by prayer heaven 's eternal day 's before thee heaven 's own hand shall guide thee there soon shall close thy earthly mission swift shall pass thy pilgrim day hope soon change to glad fruition faith to sight and prayer to praise ' emma what a beautiful hymn grandmamma i should like to learn those word but i want to hear how you get frederic away from that horrid man and what become of he afterwards because i can not understand why you be tell we _ this _ story i know you never tell we anything for amusement only grandy no my dear child this story be not solely for you amusement this morning i observe a strangeness in george 's behavior when he be request to put up he microscope and assist in lay the cloth because john be out and he be aware that hannah have sprain she foot and could not walk up and down stair he say such extraordinary thing about be ill-used and work hard and never have a hour to amuse himself that i be desirous of convince he that it be quite possible -lrb- with god 's assistance -rrb- not only to bear all this without think it a shame as george term it but even to praise god for the trouble and trial which may fall to you lot and i also wish to inform he that there _ be _ some boy more patient and grateful than himself but i see by the color mount to he cheek that my boy be sorry for he past behavior nevertheless i will continue my story and now for the _ incident _ as i presume you will call it emma we be about a week 's voyage from jamaica the wind be favorable but light the sky clear the sun directly overhead -- we be all begin to feel the effect of a warm climate the sailor be loosely clothe in canvass trousers strip shirt and straw hat and go lazily about they work -- the ship move as lazily through the ripple wave -- the man at the helm draw he hat over he eye to shade they from the glare of the sun and lounge listlessly upon the wheel -- the captain be below take a nap to the great relief of man and boy -- some of the passenger be sit on the poop under a awning drowsily peruse a book or old newspaper some lean on the taffrail watch the many-colored dolphin and those beautiful but spiteful little creature the portuguese man-of-war which look so splendid as they sail gently on the smooth surface of the blue ocean every little ripple cause a change of color in they transparent sail i be admire these curious navigator as i stand with two or three friend who like myself feel idle and care only to dispose of the time in the most agreeable manner attainable in such a ship with such a commander and i say rather thoughtlessly consider frederic be at my side ` how i should like to possess one of those little creature i suppose they _ can _ be catch ' frederic move from I and a instant after he be on the forecastle presently i hear a splash in the water and lean over the rail i see he swim after a fine specimen which shine in all the bright and vary color of the rainbow as it float proudly by he have no sooner reach the treasure and make a grasp at it than he give a loud scream for the creature have encircle the poor boy 's body with its long fibrous leg or as they be properly call ` tentaculum ' he struggle violently for he be in great agony at length he escape and be help on deck by one of the man who say he wish ` he have know what the youngster have in he head and he would have prevent he attempt to catch such a thing ' for _ he _ be aware of the extraordinary peculiarity of these singular little creature when he come on deck he look exactly as if he have be roll in a bed of nettle and the steward have to rub he with oil and give he medicine to reduce the fever cause by the pain of the sting you may be sure that directly the captain hear of this affair he be more disposed to chastise than to pity we friend frederic but i interfere and beg he would leave he to I as i have be the cause of the disaster and must now make amends by attend he until he be well enough to return to he duty the captain be very much displeased and i regret extremely that a foolish wish of mine should have cause so much annoyance and feel it my duty to endeavor to alleviate the boy 's suffering as much as possible poor frederic he be lay up three or four day and have experience enough to caution he against ever again attempt to _ capture _ a ` portuguese man-of-war ' -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the ancient be say to have derive the art of navigation from these animal which in calm weather be see float on the surface of the water with some of they tentaculum extend at they side while two arm that be furnish with membranaceous appendage serve the office of sail these animal raise themselves to the surface of the sea by eject the sea-water from they shell and on the approach of danger they draw they arm and with they a quantity of water which occasion they to sink immediately by possess this power they be but rarely take perfect as the instant they be disturb they disappear they be more frequently catch in the net of fisherman than any other way or find left dry on rock -rrb- i use to sit by he hammock for hour talk and read to he when one day as i close my book to leave he he say with a sigh while tear fill he eye ' i be very grateful to you madam for you kindness to I : you have be a friend when i most need one how my dear mother would love you if she know what you have do for she boy but i do not deserve that any one should love _ I _ i have be wilful and disobedient and my sorrow be not half so great as in justice for my wickedness they ought to be but every day prove to I that god be long-suffering and merciful and doeth we good continually i have thank he often and often for make you love I and i feel so happy that in the midst of my trial god have raise I up a friend to cheer I in the path of duty to teach I how to correct my fault and to sympathize with I in my daily sorrow god will bless you for it madam ' he continue : ` he will bless you for befriend the orphan in he loneliness and my mother will bless you and pray god to shower he mercy thick and plenteous on you all the day of you life ' he pause and bury he face in the scanty covering of he bed he weep unrestrainedly i be hasten away for my heart be full and the effort to check my tear almost choke I when he raise he head and stretch he hand towards I say ' i want to tell you something more madam if you will not think I bold but my heart reproach I every time i see you kind face i feel as if i be impose upon you and fancy that do you know more about I you would deem I unworthy of you interest and attention may i relate to you all i can remember of myself before i come here it will be such a comfort to have some person near I who will allow I to talk of those i love without ridicule I and call I home-sick ' this be the very point at which i have be for some time aim as i do not wish to ask he for the particulars not know whether the question might wind he feeling but now that he offer to tell I i be delighted and readily answer he appeal assure he nothing would give I greater pleasure than to hear a account of himself from he own lip : ` but ' i add ' i can not wait now for they be striking eight bell : i must go in to dinner : after dinner i will come to you again and listen to all you have to say so farewell for the present my dear boy in a hour 's time i will be with you ' as soon as dinner be over i return to frederic : he look so pleased i shall never forget the glow that overspread he fair face as i enter the berth for he be really handsome he eye be bright hazel he hair auburn and wave over he head in the most graceful curl while he complexion be the clearest and most beautiful i have ever see i find a seat on a chest near he hammock and tell he i be ready to attend to he narrative he begin : -- ` the first impression i have of home be when i be about five year old and be surround by a little troop of brother and sister for i can remember when there be seven healthy happy child in my boyhood 's home we live at feltham middlesex in the pretty parsonage-house it be situate at the end of a long avenue of elm-tree whose arch bough meet over we head sheltered we from the mid-day glare here in the winter we use to trundle we hoop and in the summer stroll about to gather bright berry from the hedge to make chain for the adornment of we bower but death come to we happy home and make sad the heart of we good parent : the whooping-cough be very prevalent in the village and a child of one of the villager who occasionally come to my father for relief bring the contagion amongst we and in a short time we be all seize with it two sister die in one day and the morning they be lay in the grave sweet baby breathe he last then my mother fall sick and she be very ill indeed my brother and i be place in a cot by she bedside and when pain have prevent I sleep i have be comfort by hear this dear kind mother beseech god to spare she boy she seem regardless of she own suffering and only repine when she think how useful she might have be to we have _ she _ too not be lay on a bed of sickness but fever and delirium come on and we be remove from she chamber the next day poor frank die and be bury by the side of clara and lucy the funeral service be read by my dear father who be enable to stand under all these trial of he faith for god sustain he and have train we up in the fear and admonition of the lord he do not grieve as one without hope when he darling be take from he for he know they be go to a better world and be happy in the bosom of they heavenly father he greatest trial be the illness of my mother but before we be all quite well she be able to leave she chamber and once again kneel with we at we family altar to return thanks to god for he many mercy there be only three of she seven child leave to she and when my father bless god that they be not render childless my mother 's feeling overpower she and she be bear faint from the room ` but i fear i be tire you with these melancholy account madam you know not how deeply i enjoy the recollection of those day for through this wilderness of sorrow there be a narrow stream of happiness placidly glide to which we could turn amidst the trouble of the world and refresh we faint soul and though we grieve at the remembrance of the loved one now go from we yet we would not have recall they to these scene of woe to share future trouble with we oh no my dear father be a faithful follower of christ he use to show we so many cause for thankfulness in we late affliction which he say be blessing in disguise that happiness and tranquillity be soon restore to we home ` two or three year glide by and when i be eleven year old my father one day call I into he study and look seriously at I say frederic my child god have be very good to you he have spare you life through many danger you of all my son only remain to I and may you day be many and prosperous now what can you render unto the lord for all he mercy towards you ought not the life god have so

portion of the lord 's vineyard and he blessing and the blessing of a fond father will ever attend you step ' i raise my eye to my father 's face and for the first time notice how pale and haggard he look all the bright and joyous expression of he countenance when in health have give place to a mild and melancholy shade of sadness which affect I painfully for the thought strike I that my father be soon to be call away ' i evade answer he question and when he find i do not reply he say my son let we ask the direction of almighty god in this great work i knelt with he and be lose in admiration i could not remove my eye from he face during the prayer he whole soul seem absorb in communion with god and as i gazed i wonder what the glorious angel must be like when the face of my beloved father while here on earth look so exquisitely lovely glowing in the beauty of holiness ` for several day the conversation in the study be continually in my mind i could think of nothing else i do not like the profession well enough to have choose it myself for i disliked retirement but after a inward struggle betwixt my inclination and my duty i resolve that to please my father i would study for the church one day my godfather captain hartly come to see we and he take great notice of I he ask I if i should like to go to sea then he tell I such fine thing about life in the navy and on board ship that my wavering mind fire at he description and i determine to be a sailor for such a life would be more congenial to my feeling than the quiet life of a country clergyman i do not mention this to my father for he be ill and i fear to grieve he nevertheless have he ask I i should certainly have open my heart to he without dissimulation i often fret when i think how sorry he would be to hear that i do not care to be engage in the service of _ he _ master when one morning as i be lie in bed a servant come into my room and desire I to hasten to my father 's chamber to receive he blessing for he be die ' i do hasten i know not how i get there i rush into he arm i throw myself on he neck and feel as if i too must die he be too much exhaust to speak but he place he hand on my head and slightly move he lip the expression of he feature tell in plain language that he heart be engage in prayer he _ be _ pray and for I -- I he unworthy son and when i consider that i could not comply with he wish without be a hypocrite i think my heart would burst for several minute be my dear father thus occupy then turn to my weep mother who be kneel by the bedside he softly utter she name alas it be with he parting breath for gently as a infant fall asleep on the bosom of its nurse do my revered parent fall asleep in the arm of that savior who have be he guide and comforter through life and who accompany he through the dark valley and by he presence make bright the narrow path which lead to the abode of the redeem ` the only earthly friend we have to look to in we bereavement be captain hartly and he could only promise to assist I if i would enter the navy or go on board a merchant-ship my poor mother object to this and i remain at home another twelvemonth and again mourn the loss of a dear relative my sister bertha fall a victim to consumption exactly nine month after the death of my lament father it be cruel to leave my mother under such circumstance particularly as she remonstrate with I so earnestly on my project of go to sea and offer to make any sacrifice if i would consent to go to college and follow out my father 's plan but my heart be fix and every visit from my godfather tend to inflame I still more with a longing for a sea-faring life and at length i tell he i be willing to be bind apprentice to a captain of a merchant-ship rather than lose the chance of go to sea he eagerly embrace the offer and in a few week the affair be settle satisfactorily for all party but my dear mother and sister marian weep bitterly when the letter come which conclude the arrangement and inform I what day to be on board my mother go to see the captain and entreat he to be kind to I but she know not the disposition of the man to whose care i be entrust or i be sure nothing would have induce she to consent to my plan i dare say it be all for the best i shall perhaps learn my duty better with captain simmon than i should have do with a kinder master it be well my mother know nothing of this for even believe i should be treat with the utmost kindness the separation be almost more than she have fortitude to bear and she bid I farewell nearly heart-broken i have never cease to regret that i prefer my own will to the authority of my parent i deserve all i suffer and much more for my rebellion against they this madam be all i have to tell you i hope you will not cast I off because i have be so self-willed for _ here _ i have no friend to aid I and i still feel the same desire for my present mode of life i be quite sure i be not suit for a clergyman but i do not think i could live long with _ this _ captain if i could get ship in another vessel with a master not quite so severe in a little time i should be able to work for money and assist my dear mother and if she see I occasionally and know i be well and happy she would be content and thankful ' such be frederic 's simple account of himself in five day we come in sight of port royal and anchor off there during the night : the next day we go ashore and my brother herbert who be a merchant in kingston be ready to receive I and welcome I to he house i take the earliest opportunity of speak to he concern frederic : he promise to make some arrangement for the boy 's advantage and he fulfil he promise he get he transfer to the ` albatross ' captain hill a kind gentlemanly man there frederic remain for several year and gain such approbation by he exemplary conduct that at length he become first mate and afterwards -lrb- on the death of captain hill -rrb- master a few year back captain hartly die leave he considerable property he make it he first business to settle he mother comfortably and she be now reside with marian -lrb- who marry a surgeon -rrb- in st john 's wood he next purchase a ship and have already make six voyage in she to the west indy so that you see all thing have prosper with frederic hamilton because ` he fear the lord always ' i hear from he after every voyage and have see he several time since he become a great man and a ship-owner but he be not alter in _ one _ respect for he be still the same grateful affectionate creature as when i first meet he on board the ` neptune ' he story prove the truth of the text ' i have never see the righteous forsake nor he child beg they bread ' mr and mr wilton be as much pleased as the child with this little story of grandy 's reminiscence and now george say mr wilton carry my drawing into the study for i hear john come up-stair with the supper george collect he papa 's pencil and paper emma fold up the cotton frock she have be make for one of she young pupil in the sunday-school lock she work-box clear the table of all sign of they recent occupation and take she seat by the side of she brother the child be not allow except on particular occasion to sit up after ten o'clock but as it be mr wilton 's wish that they should be present night and morning at family prayer he always have supper about nine o'clock to give they time for they devotions before retire to rest supper over the domestic be summon and have humbly petition for pardon and grace they beseech the protection of almighty god during the night season then with heart fill with love to god and good-will towards all man they retire to they several apartment and silence reign throughout the house chapter ii beautiful sublime and glorious mild majestic foam free -- over time itself victorious image of eternity every day throughout the follow week the young folk be busily engage it be needless to specify the nature of they occupation or the reason of they untiring industry : it will be sufficient for they credit to mention that they do not work with the foolish desire of ostentatiously display a larger portion of information than the rest of the party but really because they be fond of study and as they advance in knowledge they become more sensible of they own comparative ignorance and more anxious to learn they make no parade of they own ability be equally gratify at the meeting whether they be require to speak or be silent and no evil passion disturb they repose when they hear other member more praise than themselves to prove this the young lady to whom emma have decidedly give the preference amongst she companion be three year she senior have nearly complete she education and be a clever intelligent girl consequently it be very probable that she would far surpass she in knowledge and be in fact more serviceable to the society than emma ever have be or could hope to be for some time to come but emma 's heart be a stranger to the wicked feeling of jealousy it be overflow with kindness and she be delighted that she know a person so agreeable and so efficient to introduce and think how admirably they would travel o'er the glad water of the bright blue sea if all the new member be as well qualify as dora leslie day after day pass and every day add to they store for they devote at least two hour of they recreation to the pleasant and profitable occupation of make discovery in the great ocean and smaller sea and when they close they book it be with a sigh that they be oblige to leave this interesting study to attend to other business of equal importance on the evening of the 7th instant the large round table in the front drawing-room present a formidably learn appearance cover with map papers and book and surround with chair place at convenient distance for the accommodation of the member of the geographical society they be to take tea in another apartment that evening to give they a opportunity of arrange the requisite document before the party assemble and thereby prevent much trouble and confusion george 's blue eye sparkle with joy as he carefully fold he large paper of note and place it in a atla and then for the first time he confess that he feel very curious to see the new member they have scarcely conclude they arrangement when there be a knock at the hall-door and seize he sister 's hand george hurry down stair the arrival be shortly announce for strange to say the two young friend arrive at the same instant john open the parlor door and usher in miss dora leslie -- master charle dorn these young people never have previously meet at mr wilton 's house as member of he geographical society it seem necessary that there should be a formal introduction -- at least so think george and as he propose it they require he to perform the ceremony which he do in a most facetious way affix the initial mg after every name they be all seat around the cheerful fire laugh heartily when again john throw open the door and announce mr barraud immediately they mirth be check for to the younger folk this gentleman be a total stranger mr wilton advance to greet he friend and mr wilton and grandy both appear delighted to see he : they converse together some time until tea be ready when the conversation become more general and we little friend be occasionally require to give a opinion before i proceed any farther i should like to make you acquaint with charle dorn and dora leslie perhaps if i give you a slight sketch of they personal appearance you could contrive to form a tolerably correct estimate of they character from the conversation in which they both figure to such advantage at the evening meeting hold in the drawing-room of mr wilton 's hospitable mansion charle dorn -- no we ought to describe the lady first dora leslie be fourteen year of age a gentle quiet girl with a meek yet intelligent countenance which speak of sorrow far beyond she year and a decide expression of placidity which none but the people of god wear be stamp upon she delicate feature and glowing in she mild blue eye she have be in early childhood encompass by the heavy cloud of worldly sorrow : she have weep over the tomb of both she parent but now that she could think calmly of she affliction she could kiss the rod which chasten she and praise god for thus testify he exceed love towards a sinful child she trial have indeed be sanctify to she they have change but not sadden she heart for she be at the time of she visit to the wilton a cheerful happy girl delight in the innocent amusement suitable to she age though ever ready to turn all event to the advantage of she fellow-creature and the glory of she god but i be tell you more than i intend i be only to describe she person and here i be give a full true and particular account of the beauty of she mind also well i trust you will excuse I for the mind and the body be so nearly connect that it be impossible to give a just idea of the grace of one without in some degree touch upon the merit of the other i will now turn to charle dorn as i think i have say enough of dora leslie to induce you to regard she with friendliness charle dorn be a fine romp boy of eleven year he have no bright flaxen curl like we friend george but straight dark hair which however be so glossy and neat that no person think it unbecome he eye be the blackest i ever see and so sparkling when animated with merriment that it be impossible to resist they influence and maintain a serious deportment if he be incline to excite you risibility charle be a merry boy but so innocent in he mirth that mr wilton be always please to have he for he son 's companion know by observation that he mirth be devoid of mischief and that he possess a most inquire mind which urge george on to the attainment of much solid knowledge that would be greatly serviceable to he in after year i flatter myself you will from this slight sketch be able to form some idea of the new member and regard they as old acquaintance as you already do emma and george while they be drink tea there be a animated conversation which still continue when the meal be over until the tray have disappear and john have brush the crumb from the table when mr wilton say suppose we adjourn into the next room and commence business there be a general move and in a few moment the table be surround and each person prepare to enjoy the evening 's occupation miss leslie seat george next to she because she could assist he considerably in find place on the map and charle dorn be gallant enough to offer to point out the locality for emma thus they be arrange grandy only be away from the table : she be in she customary seat by the fire with the pussy at she foot and she finger nimbly engage on a _ par à tête _ which she be knit with extraordinary facility consider she age and impaired vision who be to commence inquire mr wilton emma what have you prepared emma dora be to begin papa and my paper will be require presently mr wilton very well we be all ready dora and most attentive i think as we have hitherto commence with we own quarter of the world it would be more systematic to do so now be you prepare for the sea of europe dora i will readily impart all _ i _ have prepare sir and be thankful to listen to the rest europe be bound on the north by the frozen ocean south by the mediterranean sea east by asia and west by the atlantic ocean sea be smaller collection of water than ocean i have select they for we first consideration and think the mediterranean the most important of europe i have place it at the head of my list this sea separate europe from africa and be the largest inland sea in the world it contain some beautiful island and wash the shore of many country plant with the myrtle the palm and the olive and famous both in history and geography as scene of remarkable adventure warfare and discovery numerous river from italy turkey spain and france empty they water into this great sea africa send a contribution from the mighty nile that valuable river which be of such inestimable benefit to the egyptian the principal island in the mediterranean be sicily sardinia corsica candium cyprus rhode majorca minorca and iviza there be score of smaller isle such as malta zante cephalonium -lrb- the two latter be include in the ionian isle -rrb- but it would be endless work to particularize each spot of earth fertile or otherwise inhabit or uninhabited in every sea unless there be something positively interesting connect with they or something important to be know concern they i believe mr wilton undertake to supply the particulars of which we be in need with respect to the various island already specify therefore i close my paper for the present mr wilton sicily formerly call trinacrium from its triangular shape be separate from italy by the strait of messina which be seven mile across in these strait be the ancient scyllum and charybdi long regard as object of terror but now owe to the improved state of navigation they be of little consequence and have cease to excite fear in the heart of the poor mariner the chief town of sicily be messina palermo and syracuse in the middle of this island stand the famous burning mountain etna of sardinium the chief town be cagliari corsica be a beautifully wooded country : its capital be bastium the great napoleon bonaparte be bear at ajaccio a sea port in this island mr barraud there be two interesting association with napoleon to be see in the mediterranean off toulon one be a old dismantle frigate which be moor just within the watergate of the basin and carefully roof over and paint she be the ` muiron ' with a inscription in large character on the stern as follow : -- ` cette frégate prise à venise est celle qui ramena napoleon d'egypte ' every boat which pass from the man of war to the town must go immediately under the stern of the muiron the hold of the muiron be at present use as a dungeon for the forçats or galley-slave who misbehave the next association with the emperor be a stately frigate in deep mourn paint entirely black which claim the distinction of have bring the remains of napoleon to france ` la belle poule ' be the pride of french frigate -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : vide sketch of travel by franci schroeder -rrb- mr wilton candium be the ancient crete : it be a fine fertile island about 160 mile jong and 30 broad the famous mount ida of heathen mythology -lrb- now only a broken rock -rrb- stand here with many other remains of antiquity and through nearly the whole length of this island run the chain of white mountain so call on account of they snow covering the island abound with cattle sheep swine poultry and game all excellent and the wine make there be balmy and delicious the people of candium be formerly celebrate for they want of veracity st paul allude to they evil habit in the first chapter of he epistle to titus where he say ` the cretian be always liar ' there be some remarkably ugly dog in candium which seem to be a race between the wolf and the fox cyprus contain the renowned papho : it be not quite so long a island as candium but it be ten mile broader rhode be fifty mile long and twenty-five broad at the north of the harbor stand the celebrated colossus of brass once reckon one of the wonder of the world it be place with a foot on either side of the harbor so that ship in full sail pass between its leg this enormous statue be 130 foot high it be throw down by a earthquake and afterwards destroy and take to piece in the year ad 653 of majorca i have little to say : its chief town be majorca port mahon be the capital of minorca and iviza be the principal town in the island of that name malta -- -lrb- illustration : valette -rrb- george excuse I for interrupt you dear mamma but i wish grandy to tell I if malta be the same island as the melita mention in the 28th chapter of the act of the apostle where st paul be shipwrecked grandy yes my dear it be commonly suppose to be the same it be a very rocky island inhabit by a people whom most modern traveller describe as very selfish very insincere and very superstitious the population amount to upward of 63000 in the day of st paul the inhabitant be without doubt a uncivilized race for he call they a barbarous people ` and the barbarous people show we no little kindness : for they kindle a fire and receive we every one because of the present rain and because of the cold ' here it be that from the circumstance of st paul experience no evil effect from the viper cling to he hand that the people conclude he to be a god here too he be allow to perform many mighty work such as heal the sick & c which cause he to be ` honor with many honor ' and ` when they depart they be laden with the bounty of the people ' can any one of you young folk tell I the name of the chief town in this little island yes madam reply charle i know it it be valetta so name from the noble provençal valette who after vainly endeavor to defend the holy sepulchre from the defilement of the infidel be by they drive with he faithful christian army from island to island until he ultimately plant the standard of the cross on this sea-girt rock and bravely and successfully withstand the attack of he enemy malta be give to the knight of st john of jerusalem in 1530 by the emperor charle v when the turk drive they out of rhode they have since be call ` knight of malta ' the island be in possession of the english dora and so be the ionian island which include zante cephalonium and st maura : they be all pretty spot near the coast of greece mr wilton in the mediterranean sea lay the largest ship in the world the ` mahmoud : ' it be float off beyrout i can tell you papa say george the size of the largest ship in the time of henry viii it be call the ` henrus grace à dieu ' and be of 1000 ton burthen it require 349 soldier 301 sailor and 50 gunner to man she mr wilton that be the first double-decked ship build in england it cost # 14000 and be complete in 1509 before this twenty-four gun-ship be the largest in we navy and these have no port-hole the gun be on the upper deck only port-hole be invent by descharge a french builder at brest in the year 1500 charle that be a useful and simple invention enough : it must have be very inconvenient to have all the gun on the upper deck besides there could not be space for so many as the vessel of war carry now pray what be the size of a first-rate man-of-war and how many gun do she carry mr barraud the ` caledonium ' build at plymouth in 1808 be 2616 ton burthen carry 120 gun and require 875 man without officer you can imagine the size of a vessel that could contain so many man but all be not so large : that be a first-rate : there be some sixth-rate which only carry twenty gun be not more than 400 ton burthen and they complement of man be only 155 the intermediate ship 2d 3d 4th and 5th rate vary in every respect accord to they size and be class accord to they force and burthen only first and second-rate man-of-war have three deck ship of the line include all vessel up to the highest rate and not lower than the frigate george how i should like to have a fleet of ship will you buy I more dear papa when i have rig the ` stanley ' i be get on very fast with she emma have stitch all the sail and only three little man remain to be dress while i have cut the block and set the rope in order it will look very handsome when it be quite finish but a miniature fleet would be beautiful to launch on the lake at horbury next summer if i rig this vessel properly may i have some other of different size with port-hole to put cannon in the ` stanley ' you know be a merchantman but _ now _ i want some men-of-war mr wilton my dear when you friend send you the ` stanley ' do you remember how delighted you be and the remark you make at the time _ i _ have not forget you exclamation -- ` now i be a ship-owner i should be quite satisfied if i be a man to possess one vessel to cross the great ocean and bring all sort of curiosity from foreign land i should not care to have half a dozen because they would be a great deal of trouble to I and would make I anxious and unhappy ' how quickly you have change you opinion i fear that if you have a little fleet you desire would not be check for you would after a while be wish for large ship and real man and instead of be a contented ship-owner would not be satisfy with any station short of the lord high admiral i do not think it would be wise in I to gratify you desire in this matter for then i should be like the foolish father of whom krummacher relate a story oh what be it papa inquire george : will you tell we mr wilton a father return from the sea-coast to he own home and bring with he for he son some beautiful shell which he have pick up on the shore the delight of the boy be great he take they and sort they and count they over he call all he playfellow to show they he treasure and they could talk of nothing but the beautiful shell he daily find new beauty and give each of they a name but in a few month the boy 's father say to himself ' i will now give he a still higher pleasure i will take he to the coast of the sea itself there he will see thousand more of beautiful shell and may choose for himself ' when they come to the beach the boy be amaze at the multitude of shell that lay around and he go to and fro and pick they up but one seem still more beautiful than another and he keep always change those he have gather for fresh shell in this manner he go about change vex and out of humor with himself at length tire of stoop and compare and select he throw away all he have pick up and return home weary of shell he give away all those which have afford he so much pleasure then he father be sorry and say ' i have act unwisely the boy be happy in he small pleasure and i have rob he of he simplicity and both of we of a gratification ' now my boy do not this advise you to be content with such thing as you have king solomon say ` better be a little with the fear of the lord than great treasure and trouble therewith ' and surely you trouble would be largely increase be you to have a whole fleet of ship to rig and fit up against next summer and i rather think emma would be bring forward various objection as she time would be require to prepare the sail and dress the sailor indeed dear papa say emma i have have quite enough trouble with he ` merchantman ' for george be so very particular i be sure i could not dress the marine for a man-of-war : they require a immense deal of care in fitting they clothes : loose trousers and check shirt be easy to make but tight jacket and trousers with all the other _ et ceteras _ require to dress a marine would be more than i should like to undertake as i feel convinced i could not do it to the _ admiral 's _ satisfaction charle george shall i give you the dictionary definition of a admiral george i know what a admiral be he be a officer of the first rank but i do not know what the dictionary say charle then i will tell you how to distinguish he : accord to falconer a admiral may be distinguish by a flag display at he main-top-gallant-mast-head this cause a burst of merriment when emma exclaim that sound very droll charle but i understand it : it refer to the admiral 's ship do it not papa mr wilton yes my dear the sicilian be the first by whom the title be adopt in 1244 : they take it from the eastern nation who often visit they well george do not you think you have better be content with you merchant-ship because then you can reckon on emma 's service george i will try papa to exercise my patience on the ` stanley ' and be satisfy to _ read _ of the men-of-war now dear papa i want to know if the mediterranean have ever be freeze over like the thame mr wilton not exactly like the thame but it _ have _ be freeze in the year 1823 the mediterranean be one sheet of ice the people of the south never experience so severe a winter or if they do there be no mention make of it in history emma ought not venice be nearly or totally surround by water to be include in the island of the mediterranean mr wilton it be not in the mediterranean my dear but situate to the north of the adriatic sea which sea be undoubtedly connect with the mediterranean as be many other sea and gulf for instance we may include the archipelago or egean sea the sea of marmora the gulf of tarento and the first-mentioned the adriatic sea or gulf of venice the mouth of which be also call the ionian sea and i can not tell you how many smaller gulf or more properly speak bay beside for in the archipelago alone there be no fewer than eleven however while we be so near it may be of some advantage to take a peep at venice ` the dream-like city of a hundred isle : ' that expression be a poetical exaggeration for venice be build upon seventy-two small island over the several canal be lay nearly five hundred bridge most of they build of stone the rialto be once consider the largest single-arched bridge in the world and be well know to english reader from the work of we greatest dramatist shakspeare -- the ` merchant of venice ' and from ` venice preserve ' write by the unhappy poet otway who die of starvation although no longer the brilliant and prosperous city from whose story shakspeare select such abundant subject for he pen there be yet much to admire and wonder at on the great canal which have a wind course between the two principal part of the city be situate the most magnificent of the great house or palace as they be term some of they of a beautiful style of architecture with front of istrian marble and contain valuable collection of picture the canal penetrate to every part of the town so that almost every house have a communication by a landing-stair lead directly into the house by one way and on to the water by another the place of coach be supply by gondola which be light skiff with cabin in which four or five person can sit covered and furnished with a door and glass window like a carriage they be propel by one man standing near the stern with a single oar which he push move the boat in the same direction as he look those person who be not rich enough to possess a gondola of they own hire they as we do cab when they require to go abroad the venetian territory be as fruitful as any in italy abound with vineyard and mulberry plantation its chief town be venice -lrb- which i have describe -rrb- padua verona milan cremona lodus and mantua venice be once at the head of the european naval power ` she merchant be prince and she trafficker the honorable of the earth ' but now -- ` she pageant on the sunny wave be go she glory live in memory 's page alone ' in a beautiful poem write by the lament miss landon there be some very appropriate line : -- ` but she glory be depart and she pleasure be no more like a pale queen broken-hearted left lonely on the shore no more thy wave be cumber with she galley bold and free for she day of pride be number and she rule no more the sea she sword have leave she keep she prow forget the tide and the adriatic weep wail round he mourning bride ' \* \* \* \* \* ` in those strait be desolation and darkness and dismay -- venice no more a nation have own the stranger 's sway ' charle i have some scrap belong to the ` tideless sea ' which will come in here very well the first be the account of the bosphorus now call the canal of constantinople situate between the euxine and the sea of marmora the whole length of it be about seventeen mile and most delightful excursion be make on it in pretty vessel call ` caique ' they rest so lightly on the water that you be never certain of be ` safely stow ' the rower be splendid-looking fellow from two to four in number each man with two light scull and they sit lightly on thwart on the same level with the gunwale of the caique they costume be beautiful the head cover with the crimson tarbouche and the long silk tassel dangle over the shoulder a loose vest of striped silk and cotton fine as gauze with wide open collar and loose flow sleeve a brilliant-colored shawl envelop the waist and huge fold of turkish trousers extend to the knee the leg be bare and a yellow slipper finish the fanciful costume in the aft part of this caique be the space allot for the ` fare ' a crimson-cushioned little divan -lrb- 3 -rrb- in the bottom of the boat in which two person can lounge comfortably the finish of the caique be often extraordinary -- finest fret-work and moulding carve and model as for cleopatra the caique of the sultan be the richest boat in the world and probably the most rapid and easy they be man by twenty or thirty oarsman and the embellishment and conceit of ornament be superb nothing can exceed the delightful sensation of the motion and the skill of the rower in swiftly turn and avoid contact with the myriad of caique be astonishing my next scrap be about the hellespont -lrb- 4 -rrb- situate between the sea of marmora and the archipelago : it be broader at the mouth than at any other part about half-way up the width be not more than a mile and the effect be more like a superb river than a strait its length of forty-three mile should also give it a better claim to the title of a river in the year 1810 on the 10th of may lord byron accompany by a friend a lieutenant on board the ` salsette ' swim across the hellespont from abydo to sesto a distance of four mile but this be more than the breadth of the stream and cause principally by the rapidity of the current which continually carry they out of the way the stream at this particular place be only a mile in width it be here also that leander be report to have swam every night in the depth of winter to meet he beloved hero and alas for both swam once too often -lrb- footnote 3 : more properly write diwaun -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : thus name from helle who accord to poetical tradition perish in these water and from pontus the greek word for sea -rrb- mr wilton before we sail out of the mediterranean i wish to mention the singular loss of the ` mentor ' a vessel belong to lord elgin the collector of the athenian marble now call by he name and to be see in the british museum the vessel be cast away off cerigo with no other cargo on board but the sculpture : they be however too valuable to be give up for lose because they have go to the bottom of the sea a plan be adopt for recover they and it occupy a number of diver three year before the operation be complete for the mentor be sink in ten fathom water and the case of marble be so heavy as to require amazing skill and good management to be ultimately successful the case be all finally recover and none of the contents in the least damage when they be forward to england the whole cost of these marble all expense include in the collect weigh up and convey be estimate at the enormous sum of 36000_l _ charle when be this valuable collection make sir mr wilton it be many year in hand i believe about the year 1799 investigation commence but the ` mentor ' be lose in 1802 and the marble do not all arrive in england until the end of the year 1812 since then a immense number of valuable medal have be add to the collection dora may we now sail through the strait of gibraltar into the atlantic mr wilton we must necessarily pass through the strait of gibraltar to get out of the mediterranean but as we propose to examine into the different situation of the lesser division of water _ first _ we will merely sail through a _ portion _ of the atlantic and have a little information concern the bay of biscay dora the bay of biscay wash the shore of france and spain but the sea be so very rough there that i think be we voyage _ real _ instead of _ imaginary _ we should all be anxious to leave this bay as quickly as possible : and the next name on the list be the british channel emma i have that the british channel be the southern boundary of great britain and extend to the coast of france the island in this channel be the isle of wight -- capital newport -- guernsey jersey alderney and sark mr wilton the isle of wight have from time immemorial be eulogize for its beautiful scenery it be about twenty-three mile from east to west and twelve from north to south you have all hear of the needle which obtain they name from a lofty pointed rock on the western coast bear a resemblance to that little implement and which with other piece of rock have be disjoint from the mainland by the force of the wave this rock be 120 foot high about seventy year ago it fall and totally disappear in the sea the height of the cliff now stand be in some place 600 foot and when view from a distance they be magnificent in the extreme in this island she majesty queen victorium have a delightful residence guernsey be the most westerly of the channel island : it be eight mile one way and six mile the other very fertile with a mild and healthy climate a striking object present itself on approach guernsey call castle cornet situate on a rock somewhat less than half a mile from the shore entirely surround by water suppose to have be build by the roman and formerly the residence of the governor mr barraud i have read a curious description of a most remarkable thunder storm which visit this place in December 1672 it be as follow : -- on Sunday night about 12 o'clock the magazine of the castle be blow up with the powder in it by the lightning the night be very stormy and tempestuous and the wind blow hard in a instant of time not only the whole magazine contain the powder be blow up in the air but also the house and lodgings of the castle particularly some fair and beautiful building that have just before be erect at great expense under the care and direction of lord viscount hatton -lrb- then governor -rrb- who be at the same time within the building of the castle all which building be with many other reduce to a confused heap of stone and several person bury in the ruin in the upper part of the castle at a place call the new building be kill by the accident the dowager lady hatton by the fall of the ceiling of she chamber which fall in four piece one of they upon she breast and kill she on the spot the lady hatton wife to the governor be likewise destroy in the follow manner : -- she ladyship be greatly terrify at the thunder and lightning insist -lrb- before the magazine blow up -rrb- upon be remove from the chamber she be in to the nursery where have cause she woman to come also to be with she in order to have join in prayer in a few minute after that noble lady and she woman fall a sacrifice by one corner of the nursery-room fall in upon they and be the next morning both find dead in the same room be also kill a nurse who be find dead have my lord 's second daughter fast in she arm hold a small silver cup in she hand which she usually play with and which be all rimpled and bruised yet the young lady do not receive the least hurt the nurse have likewise one of she hand fix upon the cradle in which lay my lord 's youngest daughter and the cradle be almost fill with rubbish : yet the child receive no sort of prejudice a considerable number of other person be all destroy by the same accident -lrb- 5 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : vide history of guernsey by dicey -rrb- mr wilton what a very remarkable preservation of those little child who could deny the finger of god with such wonderful instance of he omnipotence before they eye surely such event must shake the totter foundation of infidelity and cause the most disbelieving to confess ` the lord he be god ' jersey be the next island for consideration but i know so little of it that i must refer you to some person better acquaint with the subject charle i have be to jersey madam and shall be happy to afford you the trifling information i have gain respect its peculiarity jersey the largest of the channel island be situate in a deep bay of the french coast from which it be distant twenty mile its extreme length from east to west be twelve mile its breadth six the island be fertile and beautiful it enjoy a mild and salubrious climate the coast be stud with granite rock and indented by small bay which add greatly to the beauty of the scenery the chief town be st helier 's -- its principal trade be with newfoundland : ship-building be carry on extensively the native be kind but thrifty and parsimonious mr wilton thank you charle you description be short and very much to the purpose the channel island i believe be attach to england as the private property of william the conqueror : the french have make several unsuccessful attempt to gain possession of they the native be norman and the language norman-french these island enjoy a political constitution of they own exemption from all duty and various privilege grant they by royal charter they be much attach to the english government but entirely averse to the french we will now pass over the other island and ` put we ship about ' we will stop to view the eddystone lighthouse mr wilton before we quit the shore of france i wish to read you a extract from leigh ritchie 's travel sketch you remember in we conversation on the river last winter that we mention the stain that would ever remain on havre from the prominent part take by the inhabitant in the dreadful traffic in slave the extract i be about to read be from the journal of a youth name romaine on board the ` rodeur ' a vessel of 200 ton which clear out of havre for guadaloupe on the 15th January 1819 the boy write to he mother while the vessel lay at bony in the river calabar on the coast of africa : -- ` since we have be at this place i have become more accustomed to the howling of these negro at first it alarm I and i could not sleep the captain say if they behave well they will be much better off at guadaloupe and i be sure i wish the ignorant creature would come quietly and have it over to-day one of the black whom they be force into the hold suddenly knock down a sailor and attempt to leap overboard he be catch however by the leg by another of the crew and the sailor rise in a passion hamstring he with he cutlass the captain see this knock the butcher flat upon the deck with a handspike i will teach you to keep you temper say he he be the best slave of the lot ' the boy then run to the chain and see the slave who be find to be ` useless ' drop into the sea where he continue to swim after he have sink under the water make a red track which break widen fade and be see no more at last they get fairly to sea the captain be describe as be in the best temper in the world walk the deck rub he hand hum a tune and rejoice that he have six dozen slave on board man woman and child and all in ` prime marketable condition ' the boy say they cry be so terrible that he dare not go and look into the hold that at first he could not close he eye the sound so freeze he blood and that one night he jump up and in horror run to the captain 's room he be sleep profoundly with the lamp shine upon he face calm as marble the boy do not like to disturb he the next day two of the slave be find dead in the hold suffocate by the foulness of the atmosphere the captain be inform of this and order they in gang to the forecastle to take the fresh air the boy run up on deck to see they he do not find they so very unwell but add ` that black be so much alike that one can hardly tell ' on reach the ship 's side first one then another then a third of the slave leap into the sea before the eye of the astonished sailor other make the attempt but be knock flat on the deck and the crew keep watch over they with handspike and cutlass until they should receive order from the captain the negro who have escape keep gambolling upon the wave yell what appear like a song of triumph in the burden of which some on deck join the ship soon leave the ` ignorant creature ' behind and they voice be hear more and more faint the black head of one and then another disappear until the sea be without a spot and the air without a sound the captain have finish he breakfast come on deck and be inform of the revolt he grow pale with rage and in dread of lose all he cargo determine to make a example he select six from those who have join in the chorus have three hang and three shoot before they companion that night the boy could not sleep the negro in consequence of the revolt be keep closer than ever as a consequence ophthalmia make its appearance among they the captain be compel to have they between deck and the surgeon attend they ` just as if they be white man ' all the slave then the crew save one the captain surgeon and mate the boy and at last the solitary one of the crew be stone blind ` mother ' say the boy ` you son be blind for ten day ' some of the crew be swearing from morning till night some singing abominable song some kiss the crucifix and make vow to the saint the ship in the meanwhile helmless but with sail set drive on like the phantom vessel be assail by a storm and the canvass burst with loud report the mast strain and crack she carry on she course down the abyss of billow and be cast forth like a log on the height of the water the storm die away when the crew be startle with a sound which prove to be a hail from another vessel they ask for hand and be answer with a demand for like assistance the one crew be too few to spare they and the other be too blind to go ` at the commencement of this horrible coincidence ' continue the boy ` there be a silence among we for some moment like that of death it be break by a fit of _ laughter _ in which i join myself and before we awful merriment be over we could hear by the sound of the curse which the spaniard shout against we that the st leo have drift away ' the captain crew and some of the slave gradually recover some partially with the loss of a eye other entirely the conclusion of the journal must be tell in the boy 's own word : -- ` this morning the captain call all hand on deck negro and all the shore of guadaloupe be in sight i think he be go to return god thanks publicly for we miraculous escape be you quite certain say the mate that the cargo be insure i be reply the captain : every slave that be lose must be make good by the underwriter besides would you have _ I _ turn my ship into a hospital for the support of blind negro they have cost we enough already do you duty the mate pick out the thirty-nine negro who be completely blind and with the assistance of the rest of the crew tie a piece of ballast to the leg of each the miserable wretch be then throw into the sea ' tear glisten in the eye of the child during the perusal of this melancholy account and emma cover she face with she hand weep aloud poor poor people exclaim george oh how glad i be that the english have no slave those wicked captain and sailor deserve to be hang for treat they so cruelly grandy ` vengeance be mine saith the lord ' these wicked man will one day be call to a awful account for the cruelty exercise on they hapless brethren and not _ they _ alone but also the purchaser of these wretched slave who when possess of they still cause they to groan in bondage and misery without once consider that negro also be the work of god 's hand and be make immortal equally with themselves notwithstanding they different complexion for ` god be no respecter of person ' and he take as much interest in the soul of a poor negro as in that of the greatest white potentate on the earth mr barraud the glory of one of we celebrated navigator be tarnish by not merely a participation in but by be actually the originator of the slave-trade in the english dominion sir john hawkin be the first englishman who engage in the slave-trade and he acquire such reputation for he skill and success on a voyage to guinea make in 1564 that on he return home queen elizabeth grant he by patent for he crest a _ demi-moor _ in he proper color bind with a cord it be in those day consider a honorable employment and be common in most other civilized country of the world : it be the vice of the age : therefore we must not condemn sir john hawkin individually for it be probable that he merely regard it as a lucrative branch of trade and like the rest of the world at that period do no consider it as in the slightest degree repugnant to justice or christianity i presume we next halting-place will be portsmouth dora yes sir we be to anchor in portsmouth harbor because charle have a excellent account of the wreck of the ` royal george ' which be so immediately connect with this naval town will be more appropriate here than elsewhere will you read it charle charle willingly the narrative be write by one of the survivor a mr ingram who live many year after at wood ford near bristol #the wreck of the royal george # ` the royal george be a ship of one hundred gun in August 1782 she come to spithead in a very complete state so that there be no occasion for the pump to be touch oftener than once in every three or four day by the 29th of August she have get six month ' provision on board and also many ton of shot the ship have she top gallant-yard up the blue flag of admiral kempenfeldt be fly at the mizen and the ensign be hoist on the ensign-staff -- and she be to have sail in about two day to join the grand fleet in the mediterranean it be ascertain that the water-cock must be take out and a new one put in the water-cock be something like a tap of a barrel it be in the hold of a ship on the starboard side and at that part of the ship call the well by turn a handle which be inside the ship the sea-water be let into a cistern in the hold and it be from that pump up to wash the deck in some ship the water be draw up the side in bucket and there be no water-cock to get out the old water-cock it be necessary to make the ship heel so much on she larboard side as to raise the outside of this apparatus above water this be do at about eight o'clock on the morning of the 27th August to do it the whole of the gun on the larboard side be run out as far as they would go quite to the breast of the gun and the starboard gun draw in amidship and secure by tackle two to every gun one on each side this bring the water-nearly on a level with the port-hole of the larboard side of the lower gun-deck the man be work at the water-cock on the outside of the ship for near a hour the ship remain all on one side as i have state ` at about nine o'clock be or rather before we have just finish we breakfast and the last lighter with rum on board have come alongside : this vessel be a sloop of about fifty ton and belong to three brother who use to carry thing on board the man-of-war she be lash to the larboard side of the royal george and we be pipe to clear the lighter and get the rum out of she and stow it in the hold of the royal george i be in the waist of we ship on the larboard side bear the rum-cask over as some of we man be aboard the sloop to sling they ` at first no danger be apprehend from the ship be on one side although the water keep dash in at the port-hole at every wave and there be mouse in the lower part of the ship which be disturb by the water which dash in they be hunt in the water by the man and there have be a rare game go on however by nine o'clock the additional quantity of rum aboard the ship and also the quantity of sea-water which have dash in through the port-hole bring the larboard port-hole of the lower gun-deck nearly level with the sea as soon as that be the case the carpenter go on the quarter-deck to the lieutenant of the watch to ask he to give order to right ship as the ship could not bear it however the lieutenant make he a very short answer and the carpenter then go below this officer be the third lieutenant he have not join we long : he name i do not recollect he be a good-sized man between thirty and forty year of age the man call he jib and-stay-sail-jack for if _ he _ have the watch in the night he would be always bother the man to alter the sail and it be up jib and down jib and up foresail and down foresail every minute however the man consider he more of a troublesome officer than a good one and from a habit he have of move he finger about when walk the quarter-deck the man say he be a organ-player from london : but i have no reason to know this be the case the captain 's name be waghorn he be on board but where he be i do not know : however captain if anything be to be do when the ship be in harbor seldom interfere but leave it all to the officer of the watch the admiral be either in he cabin or in the steerage -lrb- i do not know which -rrb- and the barber who have be to shave he have just leave the admiral be a man upward of seventy year of age he be a thin tall man and stoop a good deal ` as i have already state the carpenter leave the quarter-deck and go below in a very short time he come up again and ask the lieutenant of the watch to right ship and say again that the ship could not bear it myself and a good many more be at the waist of the ship and at the gangway and hear what pass as we know the danger and begin to feel aggrieved for there be some capital seaman aboard who know what they be about quite as well or better than the officer ` in a very short time in a minute or two i should think lieutenant -lrb- now admiral sir ph -rrb- durham order the drummer to be call to beat to right ship the drummer be call in a moment and the ship be then just begin to sink i jump off the gangway as soon as the drummer be call there be no time for he to beat he drum and i do not know that he have even have time to get it i run down to my station and by the time i have get there the man be tumble down the hatchway one over another to get to they station as quick as possible to right ship my station be at the third gun from the head of the ship on the starboard side of the lower gun-deck close by where the cable pass i say to the second captain of we gun whose name be carrell -lrb- for every gun have a first and second captain though they be only sailor -rrb- let we try to bouse we gun out without wait for the drum as it will help to ` right ship ' we push the gun but it run back upon we and we could not start he the water then rush in at nearly all the port-hole of the larboard side of the lower gun-deck and i directly say to carrell ned lay hold of the ring-bolt and jump out of the port-hole the ship be sink and we shall all be drown he lay hold of the ring-bolt and jump out at the port-hole into the sea : i believe he be drown for i never see he afterwards i immediately get out at the same port-hole which be the third from the head of the ship on the starboard side of the lower gun-deck and when i have do so i see the port-hole as full of head as it could cram all try to get out ' i catch hold of the best bower-anchor which be just above I to prevent fall back again into the port-hole and seize hold of a woman who be try to get out of the same place i drag she out the ship be full of jew woman and people sell all sort of thing i throw the woman from I and see all the head drop back again in at the port-hole for the ship have get so much on she larboard side that the starboard port-hole be as much upright as if the man have try to get out of the top of a chimney with nothing for they leg and foot to act upon i throw the woman from I and just after that moment the air that be between deck draft out at the port-hole very swiftly it be quite a huff of wind and it blow my hat off the ship then sink in a moment i try to swim but i could not although i plunge as hard as i could both hand and foot the sinking of the ship draw I down so : indeed i think i must have go down within a yard as low as the ship do when the ship touch the bottom the water boil up a great deal and then i feel that i could swim and begin to rise ` when i be about half-way up to the top of the water i put my right hand on the head of a man who be nearly exhaust he wear long hair as do many of the man at that time he try to grapple I and he put he four finger into my right shoe alongside the outer edge of my foot i succeed in kick my shoe off and put my hand on he shoulder i shove he away : i then rise to the surface of the water ` at the time the ship be sink there be a barrel of tar on the starboard side of she deck and that have roll to the larboard and stave as the ship go down and when i rise to the top of the water the tar be float like fat on the top of a boiler i get the tar about my hair and face : but i strike it away as well as i could and when my head come above water i hear the cannon ashore firing for distress i look about I and at the distance of eight or ten yard from I i see the main topsail halyard block above water : the water be about thirteen fathom deep and at that time the tide be come in i swam to the main topsail halyard block get on it and sit upon it and then i ride the fore main and mizen top be all above water as be a part of the bow-sprit and part of the ensign-staff with the ensign upon it ` in go down the mainyard of the royal george catch the boom of the rum-lighter and sink she and there be no doubt that this make the royal george more upright in the water when sink than she otherwise would have be as she do not lie much more on she beam-end than small vessel often do when leave dry on a bank of mud ` when i get on the main topsail halyard block i see the admiral 's baker in the shroud of the mizen-top-mast and directly after that the woman whom i have pull out of the port-hole come roll by : i say to the baker who be a irishman name robert cleary bob reach out you hand and catch hold of that woman that be a woman i pull out of the port-hole : i dare say she be not dead he say i dare say she be dead enough it be of no use to catch hold of she i reply i dare say she be not dead he catch hold of the woman and hang she head over one of the ratlin of the mizen shroud and there she hang by the chin which be hitch over the ratlin but a surf come and knock she backwards and away she go roll over and over a captain of a frigate which be lie at spithead come up in a boat as fast as he could i dash out my left hand in a direction towards the woman as a sign to he he see it and see the woman he man leave off rowing and they pull the woman aboard they boat and lay she on one of the thwart the captain of the frigate call out to I my man i must take care of those who be in more danger than you i say i be safely moor now sir there be a seaman name hibb hang by he two hand from the main-stay and as he hang the sea wash over he every now and then as much as a yard deep over he head and when he see it come he roar out : however he be but a fool for that for if he have keep himself quiet he would not have waste he strength and he would have be able to take the chance of hold on so much the longer the captain of the frigate have he boat row to the main-stay but they get the stay over part of the head of the boat and be in great danger before they get hibb on board the captain of the frigate then get all the man that be in the different part of the rig include myself and the baker into he boat and take we on board the victory where the doctor recover the woman but she be very ill for three or four day on board the victory i see the body of the carpenter lie on the hearth before the galley fire : some woman be try to recover he but he be quite dead ` the captain of the royal george who could not swim be pick up and save by one of the seaman the lieutenant of the watch i believe be drown the number of person who lose they life i can not state with any degree of accuracy because of there be so many jew woman and other person on board who do not belong to the ship the complement of the ship be nominally 1000 man but she be not full some be ashore sixty marine have go ashore that morning ` the government allow 5_l _ each to the seaman who be on board and not drown for the loss of they thing i see the list and there be only seventy-five a vast number of the best man be in the hold stowing-away the rum-cask : they must all have perish and so must many of the man who be sling the cask in the sloop two of the three brother belong to the sloop perish and the other be save i have no doubt that the man catch hold of each other forty or fifty together and drown one another those who could not swim catch hold of those who could and there be also little doubt that as many get into the launch as could cram into she hope to save themselves in that way and go down in she altogether ` in a few day after the royal george sink body would come up thirty or forty nearly at a time a body would rise and come up so suddenly as to frighten any one the waterman there be no doubt make a good thing of it : they take from the body of the man they buckle money and watch and then make fast a rope to they heel and tow they to land ' charle that be all i have copy as the remain part of the narrative be too full of nautical term for we to understand and as it only relate to the state of the weather the condition of the vessel and the perverseness of the lieutenant it be of no particular advantage to we in the explanation of the wreck for we already know the why and wherefore of the disastrous event but mr ingram do not precisely state the number of person lose be it not ascertain soon after mr wilton yes i believe the number of person who perish on this sadly memorable occasion be upward of 800 out of whom 200 be woman george and be the take out the water-cock the original cause of the sinking of the ` royal george ' mr wilton no doubt it be because to effect this the vessel be hove on one side and while in that situation a sudden squall throw she broadside into the water and the lower deck port not have be lash down she fill and sink in about three minute dora dear I how very sudden what a awful scene it must have be so many poor creature hurry with scarcely a moment 's warning or time to cry for mercy into the presence of they creator be the body all wash ashore oh what a mourning and lamentation there must have be at spithead when the fatal truth be bear to they sorrowing friend mr wilton they be not _ all _ wash ashore dora for the good old admiral kempenfeldt be never find vast portion of the wreck have be recover and many of she store but they be comparatively worthless when we think of the widow and orphan leave to pine in poverty and wretchedness emma cowper have write some touching-line on this awful calamity with which we shall wind up the subject : -- ` toll for the brave the brave that be no more all sink beneath the wave fast by they native shore ` eight hundred of the brave whose courage well be try have make the vessel heel and lay she on she side ' a land breeze shake the shroud and she be overset down go the royal george with all she crew complete ` toll for the brave brave kempenfeldt be go he last sea-fight be fight : he work of glory do ` it be not in the battle no tempest give the shock she spring no fatal leak she run upon no rock ` he sword be in its sheath he finger hold the pen when kempenfeldt go down with twice four hundred man ` weigh the vessel up once dread by we foe and mingle with we cup the tear that england owe ` she timber yet be sound and she may float again full charge with england 's thunder and plough the distant main ` but kempenfeldt be go he victory be o'er and he and he eight hundred shall plough the main no more mrs wilton i fear we be prolong this evening 's discussion beyond the customary bound but i should not be satisfy to quit the channel without a peep at rocky eddystone george mamma be very anxious to see the lighthouse and so be i it appear to I a most wonderful building standing as it do surround by foam wave and in constant danger from wind and storm who know anything about it emma i do the eddystone lighthouse be build on a rock in the channel about fifteen mile south-south-west from the citadel of plymouth it be as george remark expose to wind and wave for the heavy swell from the bay of biscay and the atlantic ocean send the wave break over the rock with prodigious fury the first lighthouse erect on these rock be the work of a gentleman name winstanley it stand four year when he be so confident of its stability that he determine to encounter a storm in the building himself he pay for he temerity with he life and find how vain it be to build house of brick and stone to resist the mighty water which can only be control by the power of the most high god three year afterwards another lighthouse be build which sustain the attack of the sea for the space of forty-six year but strangely enough be destroy by fire in August 1755 the fire break out in the lantern and burning downward drive the man who in vain attempt to extinguish it from chamber to chamber until at last to avoid the fall of the timber and the red hot bolt they take refuge in a cave on the east side of the rock where they be find at low water in a state little short of stupefaction and convey to plymouth the present lighthouse be erect by mr smeaton on a improve plan : no expense be spare to render it durable and ornamental the last stone be place on the 25th of August 1759 and the first night the light be exhibit a very great storm happen which actually shake the building but it stand -- and it still stand -- a glorious monument of human enterprise perseverance and skill grandy we have do so much to-night and have be so much interested that i may venture to offer a apology for not have prepare _ my _ portion it be now time for supper and i think you have hear as much to-night as you can well remember shall i ring the bell my dear mrs wilton reply in the affirmative and john quickly appear with the tray some nice baked apple soon smoke on the table with cake of grandy 's own make intended expressly for the child and which give universal satisfaction the meeting disperse about half-past ten and all feel the wiser for they evening 's amusement chapter iii there live and work a soul in all thing -- and that soul be god for a few minute we will quit the research and take a peep into mr wilton 's drawing-room there be a bright blaze fire the crimson curtain be closely draw pussy be curl up in a circle on the soft rug and grandy with she perpetual knitting be still in the old leather chair but where be all the other i fancy i hear my reader ' inquiry look again who sit at the table write so busily and every instant turn over the leaf of a large book it be george emma have go with she papa and mamma to the colosseum but george be oblige to remain a prisoner at home have be much inconvenience by a severe cold he be now work diligently to create a surprise for he sister on she return and anxiety to please she give such impetus to he exertion that he accomplish more than he even venture to anticipate grandy persevere in she knitting : she silently commend she darling for he thoughtful affection and occasionally pause to cast a glance of deep earnest love not unmixed with a degree of pride on the beam countenance of she favorite grandchild george complete he task and cause he work apparatus to vanish before ten o'clock then twine he arm around the beloved grandmother 's neck he quietly whisper all the secret in she ear and await she approval she suggest that he preserve it until the next evening and then astonish the assembly by read he extensive note the result of the last two hour ' labor george be delighted and amuse himself with imagine emma 's astonishment when he make he grand display and with he mind vigorously engage in picture the pleasure of the surprise he retire to rest we young friend emma and george be too sensible of the value of time to waste it in idleness or trifling pursuit consequently whenever you call at mr wilton 's you might be sure to find they occupy with some work profitable either to themselves or they fellow-creature and mr wilton in she daily instruction have so combined practice with theory that she pupil almost unconsciously imitate she in the path of industry and perseverance no longer feeling -lrb- as heretofore -rrb- the sad effect of procrastination but whatsoever they hand find to do they do it with they might continually engage with no care to harass no trouble to distress they they hour and day fly on the wing of hope -- laden only with fond recollection of the past glowing with the bright reality of the present and waft the perfume of a glorious future crown with the everlasting garland of love joy and peace there be not much time lose in arrange they book and papers on the evening of this meeting but they be oblige to commence without wait mr barraud 's arrival for the clock have strike seven and they business admit of no delay they be soon seat which way be we to get out of the british channel be the first question mr wilton there be two convenient way for we to sail out of the channel : the one through the strait of dover into the german ocean the other past land 's end cornwall into the wide water of the north atlantic we will take the former direction and anchor off yarmouth while we examine into the wonder connect with this division of the mighty sea charle the german ocean be the eastern boundary of england and many of we most beautiful stream fall into its water i be not aware of the existence of any island in this ocean and the only fact i have to state concern it be that _ here _ the french first try they strength with the english by sea this happen in the reign of king john in the year 1213 and the account be as follow : -- ` the french have previously obtain possession of normandy and thereby become a maritime power which qualify they as they think to contend with the english : they intend therefore to seize the first opportunity of try they skill but the english be too sharp for they and come upon they when they be least expect five hundred sail be despatch by john to the relief of the earl of flander and on approach the port of daunne in flander they see it crowd with a immense forest of mast upon which they send out some light shallop to reconnoitre and bring tiding of the enemy 's condition the report be that the ship have not hand to defend they both soldier and sailor have go on shore for plunder upon this the english press forward and capture the large ship without difficulty while the smaller one they burn after the crew have escape have thus master the ship outside the harbor the english advanced to attack those within it and here the full rage of battle commence the port be so narrow that number and skill be unavail while the dispersed french perceive the token of conflict come run from every quarter to assist they party the english upon this after grapple with the nearest ship throw a number of they force on land these arrange themselves on both side of the harbor a furious battle commence on land and water at the same instant in this desperate _ mêlée _ the english be victorious : three hundred prize laden with corn wine oil and other provision be send to england : one hundred other ship that could not be carry off be destroy and the french king philip ii -lrb- surnamed augustus -rrb- during the temporary retreat of the english perceive the impossibility of save the rest of he fleet in the event of a fresh attack set it on fire that it might not fall into the enemy 's hand thus the _ first _ great naval victory of the english destroy the _ first _ fleet that have be possess by france grandy my opinion be no doubt at variance with the world but it do seem to I that many of these warfare by sea and land be the most unjust wanton sacrifice of life and property record in the annals of history i know that there be time and occasion when it be necessary to do battle with foreign power in self-defence or to relieve the oppressed and defenceless of other nation such be the glorious object of the battle of the nile : but many many battle be fight with ambition for they guide star and high hope of honor and reward in this life to urge on the combatant while they zeal in the performance of the work of destruction be dignified with the title of ` patriotism ' we read continually of _ great victory _ that relate by charle be designate a ' _ great naval victory _ ' and throughout it breathe nothing but cruelty and unwarranted oppression it do not appear that the stratagem use to win a battle be ever take into consideration : it be evidently of no consequence _ how _ it be win so long as it _ be _ win and battle be more frequently decide by resort to means which be dishonorable to say the least of they than by fair and open trial of strength the discomfiture of the french in this instance be most assuredly owe to the _ cunning _ exercise by they enemy and not as state to they superiority of skill or power : they be not permit to try either but be attack when unprepared mercilessly rob and slaughter and this be _ a victory _ a victory over people who be not allow the chance of defend themselves ` tis true the french have be tyrannize over the people of normandy but a bad example ought to be avoid not imitate as in this case retaliation be no part of a christian 's duty and be not require at the hand of the english what right have any nation deliberately and for no other purpose than gain to invade the territory of another to burn they house to destroy they inhabitant and to plunder they of all they possession be this a fulfil of the law be this we duty to we neighbor surely not and yet such be the principal feature in a _ great victory _ from which the conqueror return to be honor of all man -- for which bonfire blaze gun be fire city be illuminate and every voice be raise to shout victory victory such victory my dear child be abomination in the sight of god he bid we live in love and charity with all man he son say ` by this i know that ye be my disciple because ye have love one toward another ' and st paul further desire we to ` love one another with pure heart fervently ' add ` for love be the fulfil of the law ' much more might be say on this subject but i will detain the meeting no longer than merely to repeat a few verse from a poem of southey 's write on the battle of blenheim which as they coincide with my opinion afford I much satisfaction because they testify that i do not differ in sentiment from all mankind : -- ` with fire and sword the country round be waste far and wide and many a childle mother then and new-born infant die but thing like these you know must be at every _ famous victory _ ` they say it be a shocking sight after the field be win for many thousand body here lay rot in the sun but thing like that you know must be at _ every famous victory _ ' ` great praise the duke of marlbro ' win and we good prince eugene why 'twa a very wicked thing say little wilhelmine nay nay my little girl quoth he it be a _ famous victory _ ` and everybody praise the duke who such a fight do win but what good come of it at last quoth little wilhelmine why that i can not tell say he but 'twa a _ famous victory _ ' george if i be a admiral i would never fight for gain and i would not allow any of the man under my command to be cruel to the poor people in they power if you have the opportunity my son say mr wilton i fear that like many other you would be unable to resist the temptation to show you authority over the vanquish for great and wise man have often find themselves unequal to the task of schooling they heart to listen to the dictate of humanity when surround by the turmoil and excitement of a battle but now charle i must set you right with respect to the island and inform you that there be two well know island in the german ocean -- the isle of thanet and sheppey isle i refer you to mr wilton for they description mr wilton the isle of thanet form the north-east angle of the county of kent : from north to south it be five mile and rather more than ten from east to west it contain many beautiful watering place -- margate ramsgate and broadstair on the sea st lawrence birchington and st peter 's inland the whole of the district be in a very high state of cultivation and remarkable for its fertility the first market-garden in england be plant in the isle of thanet there be a little place call fishness not far from broadstair which derive its name from the follow circumstance : -- on the 9th of July 1574 a monstrous fish shoot himself on shore where for want of water he die the next day before which time he roaring be hear above a mile : he length be twenty-two yard the nether jaw open twelve foot one of he eye be more than a cart and six horse could draw a man stand upright in the place from whence he eye be take he tongue be fifteen foot long he liver two cart-load and a man might creep into he nostril ' all this and a great deal more be assert by kilburne in he ` survey of kent ' and stowe in he annals under the same date in addition to the above inform we that this ` whale of the sea ' come on shore under the cliff at six o'clock at night ` where for want of water beating himself on the sand it die about the same hour next morning ' charle the size and other particulars seem probable enough with the exception of the eye which certainly must be a exaggeration _ one _ such a eye would be large enough for any animal be he as monstrous as the wonderful mammoth of antediluvian day do not you think madam that the account be a little preposterous mr wilton i think it be very likely my dear because there be so few person to write description of these wonderful creature that those who undertake the task be seldom content with the bare truth no matter how extraordinary but generally increase the astonishment of they reader by almost incredible account which they be quite aware would never be contradict we live in a more inquire age and do not so readily give credence to all we hear without ascertain the probability of such description and exaggerated account be now merely regard as ` traveller ' wonder ' and only partially believe about seven mile south of the isle of thanet lie deal and immediately opposite deal be that part of the sea call the ` downs ' which have long be a place of rendezvous for shipping where as many as 400 sail have be anchor at one time the southern boundary of the downs be form by the goodwin sand so often fatal to mariner they be originally a island belong to earl goodwin when a sudden and mighty inundation of the sea overwhelm with light sand ` where-with ' as a old writer have it ` it not only remayneth cover ever since but be become withall a most dreadful gulfe and shippe swallower ' we will now bestow a little consideration on sheppey isle grandy i should like you to be aware before quit this luxuriant isle of thanet that it be here the precious truth of the gospel be first set forth in england : it be suppose on very just grounds too that the apostle paul be the preacher who in the middle of the first century spread the doctrine of christianity far and wide and from rome travel to the isle of the far west in which be include this lovely little spot where he be receive by the noble of the land instead of be persecute as at rome he be eagerly follow and the peaceful precept he endeavor to inculcate be willingly obey after st paul come augustine who in 597 land in the isle of thanet be welcome by the king of kent ethelbert then hold he court at canterbury he the second apostle come to convert the people who be again sink into barbarism and idolatry he come in the name of the most high and he mission be successful ethelbert at once appoint st augustine a suitable residence at canterbury and give he every facility of effect he object by permit he to hold free converse with he subject thus you see canterbury thence become the ` nursing mother ' of religion throughout the land the greatest ornament in the isle of thanet be its church at minster build on the site of a convent found by the princess domneva granddaughter of ethelbald king of kent now we will travel on to sheppey mr wilton we shall not be detain there long with my description it be a little island lie north of chatham and separate from the isle of grain by the river medway both these isle may be consider as situate at the mouth of the thame the principal place in sheppey be sheerness george now dear mamma i suppose we have do with the german ocean mr wilton so far as i be concerned my dear but i have a notion that you be in possession of some wonderful story which will astonish we all be it so my boy those sparkling eye and flush cheek betray you secret i be not deceive permit I then to request in the name of the assemble member that you will favor we with the contents of the paper in you hand nay dear mamma say george you expectation be raise too high my paper only contain a account of a yarmouth boatman but it interested I : and yarmouth be a seaport on the shore of the german ocean i think it would be a agreeable termination to this part of we voyage and i take the trouble to put it into a moderate compass for the occasion george then unfold two or three sheet of closely write paper while he enjoy the amaze look of he sister and so pleased be he at she expression of astonishment that he be unable to resist the impulse of throw he arm around she neck and kiss she affectionately you be surprised dear emma say he i only care to please _ you _ when i write it but now i will try to please _ all _ he then in a clear distinct tone of voice read the following : -- #narrative of brock the swimmer and yarmouth boatman # amongst the son of labor there be none more deserving of they hard earnings than that class of person denominate beachman on the shore of this kingdom to those unacquainted with maritime affair it may be as well to observe that these man be breed to the sea from they earliest infancy be employ in the summer month very frequently as regular sailor or fisherman and during the autumn winter and spring when gale be most frequent on we coast in go off in boat to vessel in distress in all weather to the imminent risk of they life fish up lose anchor and cable and look out for waif -lrb- ie anything abandon or wreck -rrb- which the wind and wave may have cast in they way in we seaport these person be usually divide into company between whom the greatest rivalry exist in regard to the beauty and swiftness of they boat and they dexterity in manage they : this too often lead to feat of the greatest daring which the widow and the orphan have long to deplore to one of these company know by the name of ` layton ' whose rendezvous and ` look-out ' be close to yarmouth jetty brock belong and in pursuit of he call the follow event be record by a acquaintance of brock 's about 1 pm on the 6th of October 1835 a vessel be observe at sea from this station with a signal fly for a pilot bearing east distant about twelve mile : in a space of time incredible to those who have not witness the launching of a large boat on a like occasion the yawl ` increase ' eighteen ton burden belong to layton ' gang with ten man and a london branch pilot be under weigh steer for the object of they enterprise about 4 o'clock she come up with the vessel which prove to be a spanish brig paquette de bilboa laden with a general cargo and bind from hamburg to cadiz leaky and both pump at work after a great deal of chaffering in regard to the amount of salvage and some little altercation with part of the boat 's crew as to which of they should stay with the vessel j layton j woolsey and george darling boatman be finally choose to assist in pump and pilot she into yarmouth harbor : the remainder of the crew of the yawl be then send away the brig at this time be about five mile to the eastward of the newarp float light off winterton on the norfolk coast the weather look squally on pass the light in they homeward course a signal be make for they to go alongside and they be request to take on shore a sick man and the poor fellow be comfortably place upon some jacket and spare coat they again shove off and set all sail : they have a fresh breeze from the wsw ` there be little better ' say brock ` than a pint of liquor in the boat which the spaniard have give we and the bottle have pass once round each man take a mouthful till about half of it be consume : we all have a bit of biscuit each and while we be make we light meal we talk of we earnings and calculate that by 10 o'clock we should be at yarmouth ` without the slightest notice of its approach a terrific squall from the northward take the yawl 's sail flat aback and the ballast which we have train to windward be thus suddenly change to leeward she be upset in a instant ` we crew and passenger be nine man -- 'twa terrible to listen to the cry of the poor fellow some of whom could swim and other who could not mix with the hissing of the water and the howling of the storm i hear shriek for mercy and some that have no meaning but what arise from fear i strike out to get clear of the crowd and in a few minute there be no noise for most of the man have sink and on turn round i see the boat still keep from go down by the wind have get under the sail i then swim back to she and assist a old man to get hold of one of she spar the boat 's side be about three foot under water and for a few minute i stand upon she but i find she be gradually settle down and when up to my chest i again leave she and swim away and now for the first time begin to think of my own awful condition my companion be all drown at least i suppose so how long it be up to this period from the boat 's capsizing i can not exactly say in such case there be _ no time _ but now i reflect that it be half-past six pm just before the accident occur that the nearest land at the time be six mile distant and that it be dead low water and the flood tide _ set off the shore _ make to the southward therefore should i ever reach the land it would take I at least fifteen mile set up with the flood before the ebb would assist I ' while brock be make these calculation a rush horse collar cover with old net float close to he he lay hold of it and get he knife out he strip off the net-work and put he left arm through be support until he have cut the waist band of he _ petticoat _ trousers which then fall off : he striped frock waistcoat and neckcloth be also similarly get rid of but he dare not try to free himself of he oiled trousers drawer or shirt fear that he leg might become entangled in the attempt he therefore return he knife into the pocket of he trousers and put the collar over he head which although it assist in keep he above water retard he swimming and after a few moment ' think what be best to be do he determine to abandon it he now to he great surprise perceive one of he messmate swim ahead of he but he do not hail he the roaring of the hurricane be past the cry of drown man be no longer hear the moonbeam be cast they silvery light over the smooth surface of the deep calm and silent as the grave over which he float and into which he see this last of he companion descend without a struggle or a cry as he approach within twenty yard of he yes he behold the last of he brave crew die beside he and now he be alone in the cold silence of night more awful than the strife of the element which have precede perhaps at this time something might warn he that he too would soon be mingle with the dead but if such thought do intrude they be but for a moment and again he mental energy join with he lion heart and bodily prowess cast away all fear and he reckon the remotest possible chance of deliverance apply the means ` courage and hope both teach he the practice ' up to this time winterton light have serve instead of a land-mark to direct he course but the tide have now carry he out of sight of it and in its stead ' a bright star stand over where ' he hope of safety rest with he eye steadfastly fix upon it he continue swim on calculate the time when the tide would turn but he trial be not yet past as if to prove the strength of human fortitude the sky become suddenly overclouded and ` darkness be upon the face of the deep ' he no longer know he course and he confess that for a moment he be afraid yet he feel that ` fear be but the betray of the succor which reason offereth ' and that which rouse _ he _ to further exertion would have seal the fate of almost any other human be a sudden short crack peal of thunder burst in stunning loudness just over he head and the fork and flash lightning at brief interval throw its vivid fire around he this too in its turn pass away and leave the sea once more calm and unruffled : the moon -lrb- nearly full -rrb- again throw a more brilliant light upon the water which the storm have go over without wake from they slumber he next effort be to free himself from he heavy lace boot which greatly encumber he and in which he succeed by the aid of he knife he now see lowestoft 's high lighthouse and could occasionally discern the top of the cliff beyond garlestone on the suffolk coast the swell of the sea drive he over the cross sand ridge and he then get sight of a buoy which although it tell he he exact position ` take he rather aback ' as he have hope he be nearer the shore it prove to be the chequered buoy st nichola ' gate off yarmouth and _ opposite he own door _ but distant from the land _ four mile _ and now again he hold counsel with himself and the energy of he mind seem almost superhuman he have be five hour in the water and here be something to hold on by he could have even get upon the buoy and some vessel _ might come near _ to pick he up and the question be could he yet hold out four mile ` but ' say he ' i know the night air would soon finish I and have i stay but a few minute upon it and then _ altered _ my mind how do i know that my limb would again resume they office ' he find the tide be break it do not run so strong so he abandon the buoy and steer for the land towards which with the wind from the eastward he find he be now fast approach the last trial of he fortitude be now at hand for which he be totally unprepared and which he consider -lrb- have the superstition of a sailor -rrb- the most difficult of any he have to combat soon after he leave the buoy he hear just above he head a sort of whiff sound which he imagination conjure into the prelude to the ` rush of a mighty wind ' and close to he ear there follow a smart splash in the water and a sudden shriek that go through he -- such as be hear ` when the lone sea-bird wake its wildest cry ' the fact be a large gray gull mistake he for a corpse have make a dash at he and its loud discordant scream in a moment bring a countless number of these formidable bird together all prepare to contest for a share of the spoil these large and powerful foe he have now to scare from they intended prey and by shout and splash with he hand and foot in a few minute they disappear he now catch sight of a vessel at anchor but a great way off and to get within hail of she he must swim over carton sand -lrb- the grave of thousand -rrb- the breaker at this time show they angry white crest as he approach the wind suddenly change the consequence of which be that the swell of the sea meet he here be he own description : -- ' i get a great deal of water down my throat which greatly weaken I and i feel certain that should this continue it would soon be all over and i pray that the wind might change or that god would take away my sens before i feel what it be to drown in less time than i be tell you i have drive over the sand into smooth water the _ wind and swell come again from the eastward _ and my strength return to I as fresh as in the begin ' he now feel certain that he could reach the shore but he consider it would be better to get within hail of the brig some distance to the southward of he and the most difficult task of the two as the ebb tide be now run which although it carry he towards the land set to the northward and to gain the object of he choice would require much greater exertion here again be brock 's reflection : -- ` if i gain the shore could i get out of the surf which at this time be heavy on the beach and supposing i succeed in this point should i be able to walk climb the cliff and get to a house if not there be little chance of life remain long in I : but if i could make myself hear on board the brig then i should secure immediate assistance i get within two hundred yard of she the nearest possible approach and summon all my strength i sing out as bravely as if i have be on shore ' ` the seaman 's cry be hear along the deep ' he be answer from the deck a boat be instantly lower and at half-past 1 be have swim _ seven hour _ in a October night he be safe on board the brig betsey of sunderland coal laden at anchor in corton road fourteen mile from the spot where the boat be capsize the captain 's name be christian once safe on board ` nature cry enough : ' he faint and continue insensible for some time all that humanity could suggest be do for he by christian and he crew : they have no spirit on board but they have bottled ale which they make warm and by place brock before a good fire rub he dry and put he in hot blanket he be at length with great difficulty enable to get a little of the ale down he throat but it cause excruciating pain as he throat be in a state of high inflammation from breathing -lrb- as a swimmer do -rrb- so long the saline particle of sea and air and it be now swollen very much and as he say he fear he should be suffocate he however after a little time fall into a sleep which refresh and strengthen he but he awake to intense bodily suffering round he neck and chest he be perfectly flay the sole of he foot hand and other part be also equally excoriate in this state at about 9 be the brig get under weigh with the tide he be put on shore at lowestoft in suffolk and immediately despatch a messenger to yarmouth with the sad tiding of the fate of the yawl and the rest of she crew be safely house under the roof of a relative with good nursing and medical assistance in five day from the time of the accident with a firm step he walk back to yarmouth to confirm the wonderful rumor circulate respect he and to receive the congratulation of he friend the knife which he consider as the great means of he be save be preserve with great care and in all probability will be show a century hence by the descendant of this man it be a common horn-handle knife have one blade about five inch long a piece of silver be now rivet on and cover one side on which be the follow inscription : -- ' brown emerson smith bray budd fenn rushmere boult : -- brock aid by this knife be save after be 7-1\/2 hour in the sea _ October _ 6 1835 ' ` it be a curious thing ' observe brock when relate he story ` that i have be without a knife for some time and only purchase this two day before it become so useful to I and have have to make some boat 's thole it be as sharp as a razor i ought to be a good-living chap ' continue he ` for three time i have be save by swim what i do on this night i know i could not have do of myself but god strengthen I i never ask for anything but it be give I ' this man have great faith and he have also other good trait in he character a large subscription be make for the widow and child of brock 's unfortunate companion and a fund be establish for they relief the surplus be offer to he this be he answer : ' i be much oblige to you gentleman but thank god i can still get my own living as well as ever and i could not spend the money that be give to the fatherless and widow ' in contemplate the feat of this extraordinary man it must appear to every one that he bodily prowess gigantic as it be appear as dust in the balance compare with the power of he mind to think and to judge rightly under some of the most appalling circumstance that ever surround mortal man to reject the delusive for the arduous to resolve and to execute form such a combination of the best and rarest attribute of we nature that where be we to look for they in the same man brock at the time of this disastrous affair be thirty-one year of age a fine stout athletic man and as upright in he life and conversation as he be in he very handsome person george read all this so clearly and distinctly that he really merit the praise bestow upon he : even grandy generally too partial do not award he more than he deserve for it be a great work for a boy of he age my dear boy say mr wilton i be quite delighted to find you have be so industrious as it prove most satisfactorily that you be resolve to overcome all obstacle of weariness or difficulty in order to accomplish the great end -- the attainment of useful knowledge i be much _ very much _ please with you my dear boy the color mount to the cheek of the happy child and in those few moment of heartfelt joy he be amply repay for the previous evening 's toil where sail we next inquire mr wilton emma the north sea be the track dear mamma i be sorry mr barraud have not come as he have be to scotland might have help we considerably however dora be prepare with some particulars and we need not be idle because of the absence of one member no indeed exclaim mr wilton for i have a few word to say on that subject so sail on dora and ` i 'll give thee a wind ' and i another add charle for i have actually be along the coast that be wash by the blue wave of the north sea and can say a _ few word _ after we honor member in the chair dora the north sea wash the shore of scotland denmark and norway there be a great many island in this sea many more than i can enumerate near scotland there be several little unimportant place of trifling interest of which i should be glad to gain some information as at present i know nothing more than that they be there be inhabit and tolerably fertile charle i believe i can enlighten you to a certain extent dora at least so far that you may acknowledge that there be interesting place in the north sea near scotland ten league or thirty geographical mile north of the ancient castle of dunglass -lrb- once the head-quarter of oliver cromwell -rrb- lie the bell rock : you can see it in the map just off the mouth of the tay and close to the northern side of the great estuary call the firth of forth up to the commencement of the present century this rock be justly consider one of the most formidable danger that the navigator of the north sea have to encounter its head merge under the surface during greater part of the tide at no time make much show above the water there be nothing for it therefore but to keep well clear of the mischief or as seaman express themselves to give the rock a wide berth ship accordingly bind for the forth in they constant terror of this ugly reef not content with give it ten or even twenty mile of elbow room must need edge off a little more to the south so as to hug the shore in such a way that when the wind chop round to the northward as it often do these over-cautious navigator become embay in a deep bight to the westward of fast castle if the breeze freshen before they have time to work out they pay dearly for they apprehension of the bell rock by drive upon ledge fully as sharp and far more extensive and inevitable the consequence be that from three to four vessel or sometimes half a dozen use to be wreck each winter captain basil hall in speaking of this place say ` perhaps there be few more exciting spectacles than a vessel strand on a lee-shore and especially such a shore which be fringe with reef extend far out and offer no spot for shelter the hapless ship lie dismasted bilged and beat about by the wave with the despairing crew cling to the wreck or to the shroud and utter cry totally inaudible in the roar of the sea while at each successive dash of the breaker the number of the survivor be thin till at length they all disappear the gallant bark then go to piece and the coast for a league on either side be strew with broken plank mast box and ruin portion of the goodly cargo with which a few hour before she be securely freight and dancing merrily over the water ' i be happy to add in conclusion that this fatal bell rock the direct and indirect cause of so many loss have be convert into one of the greatest source of security that navigation be capable of receive by means of scientific skill aid by well-managed perseverance with the example of the eddystone to copy from a lighthouse one hundred and twenty foot high have be raise upon this formidable reef by mr robert stevenson the skilful engineer of the ` northern light ' so that the mariner instead of do all he can to avoid the spot once so much dread now eagerly run for it and count himself happy when he get sight of the revolving star on the top which from its be variously color he can distinguish from any other light in that quarter he be then enable to steer directly for he port in perfect security though the night be never so dark mr wilton remark how much one man by the right use of the talent he possess might benefit he fellow-creature when he be interrupt by the entrance of mr barraud a welcome rise to every lip and mr barraud apologize for be so late add that he have be detain by a friend who be about to start for scotland and wish to have a hour 's conversation with he before he departure how singular exclaimed mr wilton we have be regret you absence particularly this evening because we be navigate the north sea where you have be so often toss to and fro and we think it quite possible you might have meet with some amusing or instructive incident in you travels along the coast which would agreeably relieve the tedium of we voyage now i see no reason why you should not accompany you friend to scotland and charm we with a soul-stirring narrative of real life oh i perceive the state of affair clearly say mr barraud the young folk be get weary of the monotony of a sea voyage and desire to step ashore again no no we be not tired anxiously exclaim the little group but say charle it make a voyage so much more pleasant when we drop anchor now and then to look around on the beauty of other land and more profitable also if we learn something of the custom law and peculiarity of the inhabitant of those land mr barraud very true charle and to gratify you i will relate a story write by colonel maxwell the well-known author of many pleasing and instructive work which will serve the purpose better than any other i can think of just now -- besides to heighten its interest it be all true #jock of jedburgh # during a tedious passage to the north i remark among the steerage passenger a man who seem to keep himself apart from the rest he wear the uniform of the foot artillery and sport a corporal 's stripe in the course of the afternoon i step before the funnel and enter into conversation with he learn that he have be invalide and send home from canada have pass the board in london obtain a pension of a shilling a-day and be return to a border village where he have be bear to ascertain whether any of he family be live from whom he have be separate nineteen year he casually admit that during this long interval he have hold no communication with he relation and i set he down accordingly as some wild scapegrace who have steal from a home whose happiness he folly have compromise too often he show I he discharge -- the character be excellent -- but it only go to prove how much man 's conduct will depend upon the circumstance under which they act he have be nineteen year a soldier -- a man ` under authority ' -- one obedient to another 's will subservient to strict discipline with scarcely a free agency himself and yet during that long probation he have be a useful member of the body politic sustain a fair reputation and as he admit himself be a contented and happy man he return home he own master and older by twenty year alas it be a fatal free agency for he for time have not bring wisdom the steward tell I that he have run riot while he means allow it have miss he passage twice and have on the precede evening come on board when not a shilling remain to waste in drunken dissipation i desire that the poor man should be supply with some little comfort during the voyage and when we land at berwick i give he a trifling sum to assist he to reach he native village where he have obtain vague intelligence that some aged member of he family might still be find a few evening afterwards i be sit in the parlor of one of the many little inn i visit while ramble on the bank of the tweed when the waitress inform I that ' a sodger be speerin ' after the colonel ' he be direct to attend the presence and my fellow-voyager the artilleryman enter the chamber and make he military salaam ' i think you be now at jedburgh ' i observe ' i go there sir ' he reply ` but there have not be any of my family for many a year reside in the place i meet a old packman on the road and he tell I there be some person in this village of my name i come here to make inquiry and hearing that you honor be in the house i make bold enough to ask for you ' ` have you walk over ' i inquire ` yes sir ' he reply '' tis a long walk ' say i ` go down and get some supper before you commence inquiry ' the soldier bow and leave the room and presently the host enter to give I direction for a route among the cheviot which i contemplated take the follow day i mention the soldier 's errand ` sure enough ' return the host ` there be a auld decent couple of the name here what be the soldier call ' ` william ' i reply for by that name he discharge and pension bill be fill up ` i 'll slip across the street to the auld folk ' say boniface ` and ask they a few question ' the episode of humble life that follow be afterwards thus describe to I by mine host he find the ancient couple seat at the fire the old man read a chapter in the bible as be he custom always before he and he aged partner retire for the night to rest the landlord explain the object of the soldier 's visit and inquire if any of they child answer the

to the virgin mary : they be now ruin and a square building erect for the religieux station on these isle have be put to better use and convert into a lighthouse off these island occur that dreadful calamity the wreck of the forfarshire steamer of which i will give you a brief account : -- #wreck of the forfarshire # it appear that shortly after she leave the humber she boiler begin to leak but not to such a extent as to excite any apprehension and she continue on she voyage the weather however become very tempestuous and on the morning of the fatal day she pass the fame on she way northwards in a very high sea which render it necessary for the crew to keep the pump constantly at work at this time they become aware that the boiler be become more and more leaky as they proceed at length when she have advance as far as st abb 's head the wind have increase to a hurricane from nne the engineer report the appalling fact that the machinery would work no longer dismay seize all on board nothing now remain but to set the sail fore and aft and let she drift before the wind under these circumstance she be carry southwards till about a quarter to four o'clock on Friday morning when the foam become distinctly visible breaking upon the fearful rock ahead captain humble vainly attempt to avert the appalling catastrophe by run she between the island and the mainland she would not answer she helm and be impel to and fro by a furious sea in a few minute more she strike with she bow foremost on the rock the scene on board become heart-rending a moment after the first shock another tremendous wave strike she on the quarter by which she be buoy for a moment high off the rock fall as this wave recede she come down upon the sharp edge with a force so tremendous as to break she fairly in two piece about ` midship when dreadful to relate the whole of the after part of the ship contain the principal cabin fill with passenger sink backwards be sweep into the deep sea and thus be every soul on that part of the vessel instantaneously engulf in one vast and terrible grave of water happily the portion of the wreck which have settle on the rock remain firmly fix and afford a place of refuge to the unfortunate survivor at daylight they be discover from the longstone and grace darling and she father launch a boat and succeed amidst the dash of water and fearful cry of the perish people in remove the few remain sufferer from they perilous position to the lighthouse the heroism of this brave girl who unhesitatingly risk she own life to save other be justly appreciate and

in a churchyard upon the mainland in sight of that wild rock on which she earn so great celebrity a beautiful and elegant monument be erect to she memory which will trumpet forth she praise to many yet unborn grandy a curious circumstance occur on these shore some year ago and be relate to my dear husband by a old man at aberdeen on whose veracity he could rely : -- three or four boy one of they the son of a goldsmith in dundee go out in a boat towards the mouth of the tay but rowing farther than be prudent they be carry out to sea they friend find they do not return make every search for they and be at length compel with sorrowful heart to conclude that they have perish one night a farmer -lrb- father of the old man who relate the story -rrb- be very much disturb by a dream he awake he wife and tell she he have dream that a boat with some boy have land in a little cove a few mile from he house and the poor boy be in a state of extreme exhaustion he wife say it be but a dream and advise he to go asleep he do so but again awake have have the same dream he could rest no longer but resolve to go down to the shore he wife now begin to think there be a providence in it the farmer dress himself go down to the cove and there true enough to he horror and amazement he find the boat with four boy in it two be dead already and the other so exhaust that they could not move the farmer get some assistance and have they convey to he own home when he nourish the survivor until they be quite recover from they he learn that they have be carry out to sea and notwithstanding they utmost exertion the contrary wind have prevent they return and they be drift along the coast until the boat ground at the place where they be find they have be out four day without provision of any kind except some sugar-candy which one boy have in he pocket this they share amongst they while it have last but two sink on the third day and probably a few hour might have terminate the existence of the remain two have they not be providentially discover by the farmer as soon as they be in a condition to be remove they be take to dundee about fifty mile from the place where they be find and the grateful parent earnestly beseech the generous farmer to accept a reward but he magnanimously refuse the goldsmith however whose son be save have a silver boat make with the name of the party and a latin inscription engrave thereon record the event this be present to the farmer and be still in the possession of he descendant and no doubt will be long preserved as a heir-loom in the family of the kind-hearted scotchman dora i have no idea there be so many interesting story concern the shore of scotland and in my ignorance i should have travel to the colder region of norway for information and amusement ay say charle but we have say nothing of denmark yet and to get into the baltic sea we must sail for many mile along the shore of that curious country it consist of the peninsula of jutland formerly call cimbrium and several island in the baltic the boundary of denmark be the skagerac sea on the north the kingdom of hanover on the south the baltic with part of sweden to the east and the north sea on the west i here wish to know if the north sea and the german ocean be name use to designate all that portion of the ocean which lie to the east of the british isle for i have see the different name place in different map to signify the same water and have be a little puzzle to ascertain they boundary i be glad you have ask that question charle say mr wilton because i now remember that for the convenience of we illustration we make a division but in reality the north sea and the german ocean be the same and ought perhaps to have be mention thus -- german ocean _ or _ north sea charle jutland include holstein be about 280 mile long and 80 mile broad the island of various dimension be zealand funen langland laland falster mona femeren alsen & c copenhagen the capital of

brahe take most of he astronomical observation there be many academy and public school in denmark which reflect great honor on the danish government there be fine wood and forest in denmark indeed the whole country may be regard as a forest which supply england with mast and other large timber it be for the most part a flat country mr wilton the island west of jutland which you observe viz : nordstrand fera sylt rom fanoe and other suffer greatly from the fury of the ocean towards the north of jutland be a extensive creek of the sea lymfiord which penetrate from the cattegat within two or three mile of the german ocean it be navigable full of fish and contain many island mr wilton to get into the baltic we must go through the sleeve or skagerac through the cattegat pass on we way the little isle of hertzholm lassoe anholt and haselov then take care to keep kullen 's lighthouse in view enter the sound near elsinore sail on past rugen isle and anchor at carlscrona in the baltic george the baltic the baltic i be so anxious to hear all about that sea all _ i _ know be that there be three very large gulf connect with it the gulf of bothnium the gulf of finland and the gulf of riga mr wilton the two latter wash the shore of a part of russium not generally much notice in geographical work i mean the two division of the russian territory know by the name of revel and livonia the water of the gulf of finland also extend to the greatest town in this country of ice and snow st petersburgh found by peter the great in 1703 and seat on a island in the middle of the river neva near the bottom of the gulf and which from the singularity in its building street people and custom be well worth a visit the inconvenience cause by travel in such a extreme climate doubtless prevent this part of europe from be better know to other nation george be it so very very cold then papa mr wilton when we thermometer stand at 20 ° we all exclaim how bitterly cold everything around be frozen hard and unless we take violent exercise and be well wrap up we feel extremely uncomfortable now in this part of russium the thermometer be often _ below _ zero many degree and traveller be they never so well clothe be frequently find freeze in they carriage george they dress be rather clumsy-looking garment be they not and principally make of fur mr wilton i have a amusing description of the preparation for a journey in the immediate neighborhood of the gulf of finland which will satisfy you inquire mind and afford we all please information ` on the evening of the 20th of February all the juvenile portion of the family be consign to rest at a earlier hour than usual and by six o'clock the next morning little eye be wide awake and little limb in full motion by the flicker candle 's light in everybody 's way as long as they be not wanted and nowhere to be find when they be at length the little flock be all assemble and have be well line inside by a migratory kind of breakfast the outer process begin this be conduct somewhat on the same principle as the building of a house the foundation be fill with rather rubbishy material over which a firm structure be rear first come a large cotton handkerchief then a pelisse three year too short then a fade comfortable of papa 's and then a old cashmere of mamma 's which latter be with difficulty force under the vanish arm and tie firmly behind now each tiny hand be carefully seal with as many pair of glove as could be gather together for the occasion one hand -lrb- for the nursemaid be not very particular -rrb- be not seldom more richly endowed in this respect than its fellow the same process be apply to the little foot which swell to misshapen stump beneath a accumulation of under-sock and over-sock under-shoe and over-shoe and be finally swallow up in huge worsted stocking which embrace all the drawer short petticoat end of handkerchief comfortable and shawl they can reach and be generally garter in some incomprehensible fashion round the waist but mark this be only the _ foundation _ now come the thickly-wadded winter pelisse of silk or merino with band or ligature which instantly bury themselves in the depths of the surround hillock till within the case of clothes before you which stand like a roll-pudding tie up ready for the boiler no one would suspect the slender skip sprite that you little finger can lift lastly all this be envelop in the little jaunty silk cloak which fasten readily enough round the neck on ordinary occasion but now refuse to meet by the breadth of a hand and be make secure by a worsted boa of every bright color be this all no -- wait -- i have forget the pretty clustering lock head and rosy dimpled face and in truth they be so lose in the mountain of wool and wad around as to be fairly overlook here a handkerchief be bind round the forehead and another down each cheek just skirt the nose and allow a small triangular space for sight and respiration talking have better not be attempt while the head be roof in by a wadded hat a misshapen machine with soft crown and bangled peak which can not be hurt and never look in order over which be suspend as many veil green white and black as mamma 's cast-off store can furnish through which the brightest little pair of eye in the world faintly twinkle like star through a mist and now one touch upset the whole mass and a man servant coolly lift it up in he arm like a bale of goods and carry it off to the sledge ` these be the preparation now for the journey -- it be a lovely morning as we start with we little monstrosity ourselves in a commodious covered sledge various satellite of the family in a second follow up by rougher vehicle cover with bright worsted rug and drive by the different grade of servant wherein sit the muffle and closely-draped lady 's maid and housemaid of the establishment not to forget the seigneur himself who wrap to the ear sit in solitude drive a high-mettled animal upon a sledge so small as to be entirely conceal by he person so that to all appearance he seem to be glide away only attach to the horse by the rein in he well-guarded hand the way lead through noble wood of scotch and spruce fir sometimes catch sight of a lofty mansion of stone or pass a low thatched building of wood with numberless little sash window where some of the noble still reside and which be the remnant of more simple time and now the sun rise clear o'er trackless field of snow and we solitary procession jingle merrily on while yield to the lull sound of the bell we little breathing bundle sink motionless and warm into we lap and retrieve in happy slumber the early _ escapade _ of the day there be no such a warming-pan on a cold winter 's journey as a lovely soft child after drive thirty werst we stop at the half-way house of a acquaintance for here the willing hospitality of some brother-noble be often substitute for the miserable road-side accommodation this be one of the wooden house so common in this part of russium and infinitely more please within than without divide with partition like the tray of a work-box fit up with every accommodation on a small scale a retreat which some unambitious pair might prefer to the palace we have quit after a few hour ' rest we start again with the same horse which here perform journey of sixty werst in the day with the utmost ease and when evening be far advance we little traveller push aside they many-colored veil and peep at the lamp with astonished eye as we clatter up the steep hill which lead to we residence in the town of reval ' emma well george what think you of that you be so partial to cold weather and be so desirous to travel in a sledge do not you think you would like to dwell in russium and go about always like a roll-pudding george to travel in a sledge i should certainly like but i would prefer my sledge in lapland where the beautiful reindeer fleet as the wind scamper over snow and ice and convey you to you friend almost as expeditiously as a railroad but the wrap up would not suit I at all for i like to have the free use of my limb more particularly in cold weather and for these various reason i do not wish to dwell in russium but should be delighted to visit it and should not even object to remain there a season how much be a werst papa mr wilton a russian werst be nearly two third of a english mile mr barraud there be people of almost every nation living in the government of reval the chief town of which be a port on the gulf of finland of the same name within the last few year the inhabitant of this place have be make a grow acquaintance with the finlander on the opposite shore at a place call helsingforst which be only approachable between a number of rocky island the town of helsingforst be clean and handsome with good shop contain cheap commodity which be a source of great attraction to the esthonian -lrb- or native of reval -rrb- and other who reside in reval consequently in the fine weather party be make about once a fortnight for a trip to helsingforst : these trip be both pleasurable and profitable the voyage occupy six hour in a little steamboat and when land the voyager procure every requisite at a magnificent hotel in the town for moderate charge they then go shop buy umbrella india-rubber galosh and all description of wear apparel which they contrive to smuggle over notwithstanding the vigilance of the custom-house officer at reval grandy i have read that the fisherman on the shore of the baltic be remarkably superstitious and careful not to desecrate any of they saint ' day they never use they net between all saint ' and st martin 's as they would be certain not to take any fish throughout the year on ash Wednesday the woman neither sew nor knit for fear of bring misfortune upon the cattle they contrive so as not to use fire on st lawrence 's day : by take this precaution they think themselves secure against fire for the rest of the year the esthonian do not hunt on st mark 's or st catherine 's day on penalty of be unsuccessful all the rest of the year it be reckon a good sign to sneeze on christmas day most of they be so prejudice against Friday that they never settle any important business or conclude a bargain on this day in some place they do not even dress they child they object to visit on thursday for it be a sign they will have troublesome guest all the week thus they be slave to superstition and must consequently be a complain unhappy people now dora my dear proceed dora in the baltic north of the gulf of riga lie the isle of dagen belong to russium and contain some fine estate of the esthonian nobility the dress of the female peasantry in this island be so remarkable that they deserve a pass notice the head-dress be a circular plait of hair braid with a red cloth roll which fasten behind and hang down in long end tip with fringe the dress be merely a linen shift high to the throat half-way down the leg crimped from top to bottom the linen be soak in water with as much strong starch as it can hold crimped with long lath of wood and then put into the oven to dry whence it issue stiff and hard as a board the belt be the chief curiosity be make of broad black leather stud with massive brass head with a fringe of brass chain high-heeled shoe and red stocking complete the attire and altogether make a fanciful picture of a pretty maiden bandit emma but such garment must surely be very cold dora the dress i have describe be worn in the summer for they have a warm season for a short period during the year of course when the cold set in they hide they face and figure in fur in the same fashion as they neighbor george how very uncomfortable to be dress so stiffly in warm weather and then they can surely never sit in such garment for to rumple they would spoil they i suppose mr wilton it be _ the fashion _ in dagen my dear and there as elsewhere many inconvenience be submit to from a anxiety to vie with other folk in the style of dress and from a fear of be consider _ old-fashioned _ i be sure _ we _ english must not find fault with the dress of other country for some of _ we _ fashion be truly ridiculous yes mamma say emma but they do not strike we as be ridiculous because we be accustom to they and this must be the case with other nation : they be use to they peculiar dress and have no idea of the astonishment of stranger when view the novel attire which to the wearer possess nothing remarkable to astonish or attract mr barraud near dagen the navigation of the baltic be very dangerous and many year ago the island be principally occupy by man who wickedly subsist on the misfortune of other a slight sketch of one will sufficiently inform you of the general character of these man ` baron ungern sternberg whose house be situate on a high part of the island become notorious for he long course of iniquity he live in undisputed authority never miss a opportunity of display he false light to mislead the poor mariner no notice be take of these cruel practice for some time for sternberg be powerful in wealth and influence until the disappearance of a ship 's captain who be find dead in he room the existence of a immense quantity of goods under he house and other concur circumstance lead to he apprehension he be try condemn to siberium and he name strike off the roll of the nobility he family however stand as high now as it ever do for he descendant be not disgraced and they still possess all the daring courage enterprise and sparkling wit of they pirate ancestor although it be but just to say they have not inherit he crime the sensation cause by the dread of this man reach even to the shore of england and the street of london be placard beware of ungern sternberg the sea robber as a warn to sailor this of course be before he seizure for when he be take he accomplice could not longer continue they vile occupation ' charle i be anxious to know if it be from the shore of the baltic the turk procure the golden-colored amber of which they make the mouth-piece for they pipe mr wilton yes charle the amber-gathering be carry on extensively there and be the wealth of half the inhabitant the amber be send to turkey and greece and there manufacture into those splendid mouth-piece which it be the pride of these smoke-loving people to possess some of these be excessively gorgeous and proportionably valuable i have hear of _ one _ be worth the enormous sum of 100_l _ george part of sweden be entirely separate by the gulf of bothnium what sort of ship have they papa to cross the water in that cold country mr wilton they do not often cross the water in ship but transact nearly all they business with the opposite shore during the four month when the water of this sea which have no tide be firmly frozen and when they can travel across in sledge comfortably defend from the inclemency of the weather the baltic be full of low coast and shoal galley of a flat construction be find more serviceable than ship of war and great attention be pay to they equipment by sweden as well as russium we have neglect to mention the island of the baltic there be the isle of oesal remarkable for its quarry of beautiful marble its inhabitant like those of dagen isle be chiefly esthonian : gothland and oeland be both fertile and productive in the gulf of bothnium be the aland isle which derive they name from the largest forty mile in length and fifteen in breadth contain about 9000 inhabitant who speak the swedish language these isle form almost a barrier of real granite rock stretch to the opposite shore in the gulf of finland lie the isle of cronstadt formerly call retusavus it have a excellent haven strongly fortify which be the chief station of the russian fleet charle be not the chief fleet of russium that of the baltic mr wilton yes it consist of about thirty-six ship of the line but the maritime power of russium be trifling mr wilton as in leave the baltic we quit the shore of sweden we shall have no other opportunity to view stockholm the capital it occupy a singular situation between a creek or inlet of the baltic sea and the lake maeler it stand on seven small rocky island and the scenery be truly singular and romantic this city be found by earl birger regent of the kingdom about the middle of the thirteenth century and in the seventeenth century the royal residence be transfer hither from upsal sweden be formerly under the danish yoke but gustavus yasa deliver it when he introduce the reform religion in 1527 he reign of thirty-seven year be great and glorious in the annals of sweden we will now proceed on we course : shall we go still further north into the white sea or be you tire of the cold and prefer journey to the south and embark on the black sea charle oh the white sea first for the distance be much less and we shall sooner get there but it must be a overland journey mr wilton yes for the bielse more or white sea be reckon with the mediterranean and the baltic as one of europe 's principal inland sea the largest gulf connect with this sea be the gulf of archangel and the gulf of candalax the water of the latter wash the shore of lapland and be fill with numerous small island archangel be a port on the white sea and here the russian build most of they man-of-war : before the reign of peter the great it be the only port from which russium communicate with other country of europe mr wilton with a few remark on lapland we will quit this part of we quarter of the globe lapland can boast of but few town the people lead wander life and reside greater part of the year in hut bury in the snow occasionally they have warm weather that be for the space of three or four week in the year when the sun have immense power so that a clergyman reside at enonteki inform dr clarke that he be able to light he pipe at midnight with a common burning-glass and that from he church the sun be visible above the horizon at midnight during the few week of summer but the delight of this long day scarcely compensate for the almost uninterrupted night which overshadow they with its dark mantle for the remainder of the year one continual winter when scarcely for three hour during the day can the inhabitant dispense with the use of candle the climate although so extremely frigid be nevertheless wholesome and the people be a hardy race in lapland the aurora boreali be see to perfection the appearance it exhibit at time be beyond description magnificent : it serve to illuminate they dark sky in the long night of winter and although they can not benefit by it so continually as the inhabitant of greenland and iceland yet they never behold the arch of the glorious northern light spread abroad in the starry heaven but they bless god for the phenomenon which they can not comprehend but know full well how to appreciate here in this wintry region george might enjoy himself agreeably to he wish for the laplander travel in sledge draw by the swift reindeer but i fear he would find it difficult to keep he seat as the sledge be but of narrow dimension and easily upset while the animal require a great deal of management to guide he properly what think you george would you not be like frank berkeley or paul preston who fancy it must be so easy and delightful to ride in a pulk or sledge and find instead that from inexperience they journey be one continue chapter of accident george i dare say i should fare as badly at first but i would not be discourage by _ one _ failure mr wilton that be right my boy perseverance and determination be a extra pair of leg to a traveller in he journey through life charle there appear to be no island in the white sea mr wilton there be island but they be mostly barren uninhabited rock archangel a port on this sea be famous for the manufacture of linen sheet now quit we these dreary region for the bright and enliven southern clime and if all party be agreeable we will cast we anchor where we may behold the height of caucasus and picture to ourselves the situation of still more interesting elevation viz ararat lebanon and hermon mountain mention in the sacred writings and certainly great point of attraction to christian traveller in asiatic turkey charle there be several gulf but i do not know of any island in the black sea there be a peninsula attach to russium which contain the town of kafa aknetchet sevastopol and eupatorium : it lie between the sea of asof and the gulf of perecop the principal gulf be the gulf of baba the gulf of samson the gulf of varna and the gulf of foro mr barraud the peninsula you mention charle be the crimea which possess a most delicious climate although lie contiguous to the putrid sea which bound it on the north there be a island in the euxine -- the island leuce or isle of achille also call the isle of serpent it be assert by the ancient to have be present to achille by he mother theti in the gulf of perecop there be also another island call taman which contain spring of naphtha mr wilton the principal port on the black sea be odessa it rank next in russium after the two capital of the empire but be not a desirable residence be subject to hurricane and other evil of which _ dust _ be undoubtedly the greatest a learn french writer -lrb- 6 -rrb- say : ` dust here be a real calamity a fiend-like persecutor that allow you not a moment 's rest it spread out in sea and billow that rise with the least breath of wind and envelop you with increase fury until you be stifle and blind and incapable of a single movement ' the same writer describe a curious phenomenon he witness in odessa : ` after a very hot day in 1840 the air gradually darken about four in the afternoon until it be impossible to see twenty pace before one the oppressive feel of the atmosphere the dead calm and the portentous color of the sky fill every one with deep consternation and seem to betoken some fearful catastrophe the thermometer attain the height of 104 ° fahrenheit the obscurity be then complete presently the most furious tempest imagination can conceive burst forth and when the darkness clear off there be see over the sea what look like a waterspout of prodigious depth and breadth suspend at a height of several foot above the water and move slowly away until it disperse at last at a distance of many mile from the shore the eclipse and the waterspout be nothing else than _ dust _ and that day odessa be sweep cleaner than it will probably ever be again ' -lrb- footnote 6 : xavier hommaire de hell -rrb- mr wilton such a description be quite sufficient to drive the weary traveller to seek shelter and i think we have have enough of other place for to-night let we take we own at the supper-table and refresh ourselves after the voyage for we have reason to congratulate each other on the success of we plan hitherto there have be no halt for lack of a finger-post and i hope we shall be as well prepare at future meeting and be enable to accomplish as much as we have this evening grandy i have be silent for the last hour principally because i do not feel very well this evening but i can not refrain from speak a word or two before we disperse a good and wise man say -- ` full often too we wayward intellect the more we learn of nature overlook she author more ' my dear child let not this be say of you but look upward to the source of light and life and pray that all knowledge may lead you on to seek he who be the author and giver of all good thing then will wisdom heavenly wisdom illumine you mind then will peace the peace of god which passeth all understand fill you heart and ` reveal truth undiscerned but by that holy light ' chapter iv o'er the stormy wide and billowy deep where the whale the shark and the sword-fish sleep and amidst the plashing and feathery foam where the stormy-petrel find a home george be to open this meeting by recite some line write by mr howitt which be very clever and will most appropriately introduce we subject so say mr wilton proceed to arrange the member in they various place and seat herself she turn to she son who by virtue of he office be allow to remain near grandy 's chair until the great work be accomplish george be hesitate but a encouraging smile from this kind mother inspire he with confidence and he commence without further ceremony : -- -lrb- illustration : iceberg -rrb- ` the earth be large ' say one of twain ` the earth be large and wide but it be fill with misery and death on every side ' say the other ` deep as it be wide be the sea within all clime and it be fuller of misery and of death a thousand time the land have peaceful flock and herd and sweet bird singing round but a myriad monstrous hideous thing within the sea be find -- thing all misshapen slimy cold writhe and strong and thin and waterspout and whirlpool wild that draw the fair ship in i have hear of the diver to the depths of the ocean force to go to bring up the pearl and the twisted shell from the fathomless cave below i have hear of the thing in those dismal gulf like fiend that hemm would he round -- i would not lead a diver 's life for every pearl that be find and i have hear how the sea-snake huge and dark in the arctic flood doth roll he have coil would he tail like a cable strong all round and round the pole : and they say when he stir in the sea below the ice-rocks split asunder -- the mountain huge of the ribbed ice -- with a deafening crack like thunder there be many a isle man wot not of where the air be heavy with groan and the bottom o ' th ' sea the wisest say be cover with dead man 's bone i 'll tell thee what : there be many a ship in the wild north ocean frore that have lie in the ice a thousand year and will lie a thousand more and the man -- each one be freeze there in the place where he do stand the oar he pull would the rope he throw be freeze in he hand the sun shine there but it warm they not they body be wintry cold : they be wrapp would in ice that grow and grow solid and white and old and there be many a haunt desert rock where seldom ship doth go -- where unburied man with fleshless limb be move to and fro : they people the cliff they people the cave -- a ghastly company -- never sail would there in a ship myself but i know that such there be and oh the hot and horrid track of the ocean of the line there be million of the negro man under that burning brine the ocean sea doth moan and moan like a uneasy sprite and the wave be white with a fiendish fire that burneth all the night ` tis a frightful thing to sail along though a pleasant wind may blow when we think what a host of misery lie down in the sea below didst ever hear of a little boat and in she there be three they have nothing to eat and nothing to drink adrift on the desert sea for seven day they bear they pain then two man on the other do fix they longing hungry eye -- and that one be they brother and he they kill and eat and drink -- oh I 'twa a horrid thing for the dead should lie in a churchyard green where the pleasant flower do spring and think ` st thou but for mortal sin such frightful thing would be in the land of the new jerusalem there will be no more sea ' mr wilton well do george very nicely repeat indeed : you be a most promising member of we little society and we will drink you health in some of grandy 's elder-wine to-night at supper and not forget the honor to be add thereto now be it determine how we be to proceed whether we take the sea of asia or enter on the broad wave of the various ocean which wash many of the shore of europe charle the sea first sir i have the list of those for consideration belong to this most interesting division of the globe : the caspian between turkey persium and tartary the whang-haus or yellow sea in china the sea of japan the sea of ochotsh or lama the chinese sea the bay of bengal the persian gulf and the arabian gulf or red sea : these be the largest but there be number of small sea some of they so entirely inland that they should more properly be call lake of these the largest be the sea of aral the bay and gulf around asia be so numerous that you would be tire of hear they name north be the bay of carskoe and obskaium : south tonquin siam cambay and cutch east macao and petchelee west balkan kindelnisk and krasnaus vodi the latter in the caspian george be those all charle why from you preface i think you would be at least ten minute enumerate the bay of asia charle be i to name _ all _ i could do it in less time than ten minute but i should incur too great a liability for my trouble as i should be expect to describe the situation of all and that would be beyond my capability dora the caspian fall to my share : it be usually call by the persian ` derrieh hustakhan ' -lrb- sea of astrachan -rrb- it be likewise call the ` derrieh khizzar ' the absence of all shipping save now and then a solitary russian craft the scarcity of sea-weed and the want of the refreshing salt scent of the ocean together with the general appearance of the coast suggest the idea of a immense lake number of that large fish call ` sturgeon ' be take from the water of the caspian and there be quite a colony of fisherman engage in this occupation on the persian coast and during the season they catch thousand of these useful fish no part of a sturgeon be waste : the roe be take out salt and stow away in cask this be know by the name of ` caviare ' and be esteem a great luxury from the sound or air-bladder isinglass be make simply by be hang in the sun for a time and the fish itself be dry and export to various part of the world astracan be the chief seat of caspian commerce mr wilton and here the traveller find collect into a focus all the picturesque item that have strike he elsewhere alongside of a tartar dwelling stretch a great building blacken by time and by its architecture and carving carry you back to the middle age a european shop display its fashionable haberdashery opposite a caravanserai the magnificent cathedral overshadow a pretty mosque with its fountain a moorish balcony contain a group of young european lady who set you think of paris whilst a graceful white shadow glide mysteriously under the gallery of a old palace all contrast be here meet together and so it happen that in pass from one quarter to another you think you have make but a short promenade and you have pick up a stock of observation and reminiscence belong to all time and place the russian ought to be proud of this town for unlike other in this country it be not of yesterday 's formation and be the only place throughout the empire where the traveller be not plague with the cold monotonous regularity which meet he at every other city in russium the caspian sea cover a extent of 120000 square mile and be the largest salt lake know mr barraud near a place call semnoon not many mile from asterabad there formerly stand a city of guebre name dzedjin with which a droll legend be connect : -- ` when semnoon be build the water with which it be supply flow from the city of the guebre who one day turn the stream and cut off the supplies sin and lam -lrb- two prophet -rrb- see the town about to perish for want of water repair to dzedjin and entreat the chief of that place to allow the stream to return to its old channel this they at first refuse but finally make a agreement that on the payment of a sum equal to a thousand tomaun or 500_l _ the water should be allow to flow into the city as long as life remain in the head of a fly which be to be cut off and throw into a basin of water this be do but to the great astonishment of the guebre the head retain life during thirteen day which so exasperate they against sin and lam whom they perceive to be man of god that they send a armed party to semnoon to make they prisoner ` meanwhile sin and lam have receive intelligence of they design and flee the first village they halt at be call shadderron where have rest awhile they continue they flight strictly enjoin the inhabitant not to tell they pursuer the direction which they have take shortly afterwards the guebre arrive and inquire where they have go the villager do not mention the direction in word but treacherously indicate it by turn they head over they right shoulder in which position they become immovably fix and since then all they descendant have be bear with a twist in the neck towards the right shoulder ' here the boy have some difficulty in repress they laughter for charle place he head in the position of the faithless shadderron and look so mischievously at george that he be oblige to cover he eye or he would have stop the story by a boisterous shout of merriment mr barraud continue : ` the fugitive next arrive at a place call giorvenon on quit which they leave the same injunction as before on the arrival of the pursuer however the people point out the direction of they flight by stretch they chin straightforward a awful peal of thunder mark the divine displeasure and the inhabitant of giorvenon now find themselves unable to bring they head back to they proper position and the curse likewise descend to they posterity who have since be remarkable for long project chin after a long chase the guebre overtake the prophet at the foot of a steep hill up which they gallop into a small plain where to the astonishment and disappointment of they pursuer the earth open and close over they it be now evening and the guebre place a small heap of stone over the spot where sin and lam have disappear retire for the night early the next morning the guebre repair thither with the intention of digging out the prophet but to they confusion they find the whole plain cover with similar heap of stone so that all they endeavor to find the original pile be completely baffle and they return to dzedjin disappointed there be now a small mosque say to cover the exact spot where sin and lam sink into the ground which be call seracheh to which people resort to pray and make vow and close by be a almost perpendicular rock whence -lrb- the inhabitant aver -rrb- may be see the mark of the foot of the horse ride by the guebre ' this story amuse the child much and they would gladly have listen to mr barraud while he relate some other extraordinary tradition but he reply to they request silence these wish every place say he throughout this wild country have a legend : be i to tell you _ all _ there would be no time for business i merely select this because it be concern a town situate on the shore of the caspian sea and give you a tolerable idea of the superstition of its inhabitant mr wilton the caspian extend about 700 mile in length and 200 in breadth the northern shore of this sea be low and swampy often overgrown with reed but in many other part the coast be precipitous with such deep water that a line of 450 fathom will not reach the bottom the best haven in the caspian be that of baku that of derbent be rocky and that of sensilus not commodious though one of the chief port of trade dora the whang-haus or yellow sea on the coast of china contain several island -- tebu-sou lowang tsougm vun-taichan fouma and stanton 's island by the strait of corea we can enter the sea of japan sail along by the great japan island the principal of which be niphon kinsin and sikokf and pass the jesso isle go through the channel of tartary and enter the sea of ochotsk or lama mr wilton a very good route dora but rather too expeditious to be advantageous these island and sea be connect with many interesting fact and why pass the island of sagalien without a glance i be sure could you have see one of the people you attention would have be sufficiently arrest to stay you rapid flight o'er land and sea the sagalien be similar in many respects to the tartar tribe they dress be a loose robe of skin or quilted nankeen with a girdle they tattoo they upper lip blue they hut or cabin of timber be thatch with grass with a fire-place in the center the native name of this large island be tehoka between japan and mantchoorium be the great peninsula of corea remarkable for the coldness of its climate although in the latitude of italy we be tell that in the northern part snow fall in so large quantity as to render it necessary to dig passage under it in order to go from one house to another it be suppose that the surface of this country be so extremely mountainous be the cause of this curious climate there be number of pony here not more than three foot high george oh what sweet creature how very much i would like to have one actually not larger than a dog : how very pretty they must be emma around the three great island of japan i observe countless number of little one -- be they in any way connect with japan mr wilton yes my dear they all belong to the kingdom of japan emma and what sort of people be the japanese mr wilton very similar in appearance to they neighbor the chinese with a yellow complexion and small oblique eye : there be this difference however they hair be thick and bushy while the hair of the chinese be cultivate in a long tail a japanese be certainly rather ludicrous in both manners and appearance he head half-shave the hair which be leave accumulate on the crown of he head he body wrap -lrb- when travel -rrb- in a enormous covering of oil paper and a large fan in he hand he present a extraordinary figure these people be very particular concern point of etiquette and have many book write on the proper mode of take a draught of water how to give and receive present and all the other minutiae of behavior grandy the japanese have curious notion with regard to the life eternal they believe that the soul of the virtuous have a place assign to they immediately under heaven while those of the wicked wander in the air until they expiate they offence charle i be very glad _ that _ be not my creed for i should not at all enjoy life with the continual idea of wicked spirit hover in the air around I they might as reasonably believe in ghost mr wilton in the indian and china sea and in many other part of the great tropical belt the periodical wind call ` monsoon ' be find the south-west monsoon prevail from April to October between the equator and the tropic of cancer : and it reach from the east coast of africa to the coast of indium china and the philippine island its influence extend sometimes into the pacific ocean as far as the marcian isle or to longitude about 145º east and it reach as far north as the japan island the north-east monsoon prevail from October to may throughout nearly the same space that the south-west monsoon prevail in during the former season but the monsoon be subject to great obstruction by land and in contract place such as malacca strait they be change into variable wind they limit be not everywhere the same nor do they always shift exactly at the same period but they be generally calculate upon about the time i have mention emma mamma be not trade-winds something like monsoon mr wilton so far similar that they be confine to a certain region and be tolerably regular in they operation the trade-wind blow more or less from the eastern half of the compass to the western they chief region lie between the tropics from 23-1\/2 º north to 23-1\/2 º south latitude although in some part of the world they extend farther but it be only in the open part of the pacific and atlantic ocean that the true trade-wind blow these wind shift many degree of latitude in the course of the year but skilful navigator usually know where to catch they and make they serviceable in help to blow they richly laden vessel ` o'er the glad water of the bright blue sea ' george do you know the cause of these regular wind papa you say learn man try to discover _ why _ such thing be so and generally find out _ cause _ from they effect mr wilton exactly so my boy and learn _ woman _ do the same : as a instance i will quote the learn mr somerville on this very subject and give you a excellent reply to you question ` the heat of the sun occasion the trade-wind by rarefy the air at the equator which cause the cooler and more dense part of the atmosphere to rush along the surface of the earth to the equator while that which be heat be carry along the higher stratum to the pole form two current in the direction of the meridian but the rotatory velocity of the air correspond to its geographical situation decrease towards the pole in approach the equator it must therefore revolve more slowly than the corresponding part of the earth and the body of the surface of the earth must strike against it with the excess of they velocity and by its reaction they will meet with a resistance contrary to they motion of rotation so that the wind will appear to a person suppose himself to be at rest to blow in a contrary direction to the earth 's rotation or from east to west which be the direction of the trade-wind ' george may i read that to-morrow papa i do not quite understand it and if you have the book i could read it over and over until i find out the meaning mr wilton you will find it in mr somerville 's ` mechanism of the heaven ' if you come to my study to-morrow morning before i leave home i will assist you in the solution of the difficulty mr barraud in a account of cabul i have read a fine description of the commencement of a monsoon : -- ` the approach be announce by vast mass of cloud that rise from the indian ocean advance towards the north-east gathering and thicken as they approach the land after some threatening day the sky assume a troubled appearance in the evening and the monsoon set in generally during the night it be attend by such a violent thunder-storm as can scarcely be imagine by those who have only witness the phenomenon in a temperate climate it generally begin with violent blast of wind which be succeed by flood of rain for some hour lightning be see without intermission : sometimes it only illuminate the sky and show the cloud near the horizon at other it discover the distant hill and again leave all in darkness when in a instant it reappear in vivid and successive flash and exhibit the nearest object in all the brightness of day during all this time the distant thunder never cease to roll and be only silence by some nearer peal which burst on the ear with such a sudden and tremendous crash as can scarcely fail to strike the most insensible heart with awe at length the thunder cease and nothing be hear but the continue pour of the rain and the rush of the rise stream ' charle i would much rather live in we temperate climate than between the tropics for everything connect with the element be so outrageously violent that i should be continually in a state of alarm and in constant dread of a hurricane a tornado a earthquake or some such awful visitation ' grandy why should you fear my dear boy who or what can harm you if you follow that which be good be not the arm of the lord mighty to save and be it not stretch forth all the day long to defend he own child have he not promise to be a stronghold whereunto the faithful may always resort and to be a house of defense for he people cast thy fear from thee charle rely on god 's gracious promise and pray for faith to believe in he omnipotence dora the sea of ochotsk this sea be nearly land-locked be in this respect as well as in size and general situation not unlike hudson 's bay the water be shallow not exceed -lrb- about fifty mile from land -rrb- fifty fathom and rarely give even in the center above four time the depth just mention there be three gulf belong to this sea the gulf of penjinsk the gulf of gijiginsk and the gulf of tanish but not many island of consideration mr wilton although asia can not vie with europe in the advantage of inland sea yet in addition to a share of the mediterranean it possess the red sea and gulf of persium the bay of bengal and nankin and other gulf already mention which diversify the coast much more than those of either africa or america and have doubtless contribute greatly to the early civilization of this celebrated division of the globe i wish each of you young folk to describe the follow sea as i mention they name dora tell I all you have learn respect the red sea dora the red sea or arabian gulf of antiquity constitute the grand natural division between asia and africa but its advantage have be chiefly feel by the latter which be entirely destitute of inland sea egypt and abyssinia two of the most civilized country in that division have derive great benefit from that celebrated sea which from the strait of babelmandel to suez extend about 21 ° or 1470 british mile terminate not in two equal branch as delineate in old map but in a extensive western branch while the eastern ascend little beyond the parallel of mount sinai grandy the gulf of suez be the scene of the most stupendous miracle record in exodus -- the passage of the israelite -- when god clave in sunder the water of the sea and cause they to rise perpendicularly so as to form a wall unto the israelite on they right hand and on they leave this be not to be read _ figuratively _ but _ literally _ for in exodus xv 8 it be say they ' _ stand as a heap _ ' and be ' _ congeal _ ' or suspend as though turn into ice : -- ` and with the blast of thy nostril the water be gather together : the flood stand _ upright as a heap _ the _ depths _ be _ congeal _ in the heart of the sea ' mr wilton emma i call upon _ you _ for the account of the persian gulf but you seem so intent on the book before you that i feel a little curious to know the subject of you meditation emma you shall hear papa although perhaps you may laugh at I afterwards i be think that it seem rather absurd for people who be constantly voyage to the east indy to go such a immense way round africa when by cut a passage through the isthmus of suez they could arrive at the desire haven in half the time what be the width of the isthmus papa would such a thing be practicable or be i very foolish mr wilton not at all my dear as i will readily prove the width be about seventy-five mile and there _ have _ be a communication between the mediterranean and the red sea strabo the historian assert that a canal be build by sesostri king of egypt and in February 1799 napoleon then general of the french republic accompany by some gentleman skilled in such matter proceed from cairo to suez with the view of discover the vestige of this ancient canal they be successful : they find trace of it for several league together with portion of the old great wall of sesostri which guard the eastern frontier of egypt and protect the canal from the sand of the desert it be a short time since in contemplation to renew this communication by the same means as those use by sesostri viz by form a canal for the advantage of commerce & c which advantage be well explain by mr edward clarkson in a article on steam navigation thus : ` the distance from the mediterranean to the red sea by the suez navigable canal would be from eighty to ninety mile the time consume by a steamboat in this transit might be average at five hour what be the time now consume in the transit through egypt by the voyager from england to bombay and what be the nature of the transit passenger package and letter after be land at alexandrium be now convey by the mahmoudie canal forty mile to atfeh on the nile this consume twelve hour and be perform by a track-boat attend by numerous inconvenience the passenger goods and letter be land at atfeh they be there reshipp and carry by steamboat from atfeh up the nile to boulac a distance of 120 mile this water transit consume eighteen hour at boulac which be the port of cairo the passenger goods and letter be again unshipped and have a land transit of two mile before they arrive at cairo at that capital a stoppage of twelve hour which be consider indispensable to traveller occur a fourth transit then take place to suez from cairo across the desert this be perform by van with two and four horse donkey-chairs -lrb- two donkey carry a species of litter between they for lady and child -rrb- and be often attend owe to the scarcity of good horse with great inconvenience the distance of this land transit be eighty-four mile and consume thirty-six hour the whole distance by the present line be thus 246 mile by the project line it be 80 : the transit by the present line consume _ four day _ the transit by the propose line would not consume more than _ five hour ' _ ` instead of a land and river and desert transit with all the obstruction and inconvenience of track-boat native steamer donkey-chair and van shipping and unshipping there will be no _ land transit _ and the whole passage may be make by sea from london to bombay without stoppage instead of four day be consume in the egyptian transit five hour will only be requisite moreover the 2_l _ 12 expense cause by the present transit in egypt and charge to each person will in future be save by every passenger ' mr barraud i propose a vote of thanks to emma for introduce the subject as by so do we have gain a great deal of information mr wilton there you see emma you be not laugh at but we all thank you for reveal you thought now to the persian gulf if you have any particulars emma the persian gulf be another note inland sea about half the length of the red sea and be the grand receptacle of those celebrated river the euphrate and the tigri the small bay within this gulf be katiff bay assillum bay erzoog bay there be various island and large pearl bank here and on the euphrate not many mile from these shore stand chaldaea the inhabitant be the benus khale arab descendant of the founder of the ` great babylon ' george oh papa i have a discovery : here be a island nobody have notice -- its name be dahalac mr wilton that be certainly a omission for dahalac be a large island sixty mile in circumference it contain goat which have long silky hair and furnish gum-lac the produce of a particular kind of shrub to this island vessel repair for fresh water which however be very bad be keep in 370 dirty cistern mr barraud this district be especially interesting to christian for here be situate the mount celebrate in scripture in the center of armenia you may observe mount ararat a detach elevation with two summit the highest cover with perpetual snow on this mountain rest the ark when god send he vengeance over all the earth and destroy every living thing mount lebanon be in syrium and not far distant stand mount sinaus a enormous mass of granite rock with a greek convent at its base call the convent of st catharine : here be the law deliver to mose inscribe on two table of stone by the most high god mr wilton the whole coast of oman in south arabium which on the north be wash by the water of the persian gulf and on the south by the sea of oman abound with fish and as the native have but few canoe they generally substitute a single inflated skin or sometimes two across which they place a flat board on this contrivance the fisherman seat himself and either cast he small hand-net or play he hook and line some capital sport must arise occasionally when the shark which be here very numerous and large gorge the bait for whenever this occur unless the angler cut he line -lrb- and that as the shark be more value by they than any other fish he be often unwilling to do -rrb- nothing can prevent he rude machine from follow they track and the fisherman be sometimes in consequence carry out a great distance to sea it require considerable dexterity to secure these monster for when they be haul up near to the skin they struggle a good deal and if they happen to jerk the fisherman from he seat the infuriate monster dash at once at he many accident arise in this manner but if they succeed in get he quickly alongside they soon despatch he by a few blow on the snout -lrb- 7 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : vide lieutenant wellst 's travels in arabium -rrb- mr wilton there be many little circumstance of interest connect with the persian gulf in several part fresh spring rise in the middle of the salt water particularly near the island of baharein the whole shore of this gulf be line with island and _ on _ its shore be several independent arab who almost all live in the same manner they subsist by maritime trade and by the peril and other fishery they food consist of date fish and dhoura bread they arm be musket with matchlock sabre and buckler these tribe among whom the houle be the most powerful all speak the arabic language and be enemy to the persian with whom they form no alliance they house be so wretched that a enemy would think it lose labor to destroy they as they generally have but little to lose on land if a persian army approach all the inhabitant of the town and village go on board they little vessel and take refuge in some island in the persian gulf until the enemy retire emma where be the baharein isle mamma mr wilton near the arabian shore they be remarkable for the pearl fishery which be carry on in they neighborhood during the month of June July and August a fishery which in the sixteenth century be estimate at 500000 ducat -lrb- 8 -rrb- the name baharein signify two sea -lrb- footnote 8 : a ducat be of the value of nine shilling and threepence sterling -rrb- mr wilton well charle what can you tell we about the little sea of aral charle not much i be afraid sir the sea of aral or eagle be situate about 100 mile east of the caspian and be nearly 200 mile in length and 70 in breadth it be surround with sandy desert and have be little explore its water be not so salt as the caspian but there be many small saline lake in its vicinity there be a remarkable detach sea in siberium or asiatic russium which we have not notice call baikal sea it extend from the 51 ° to the 55 ° of north latitude this sea be 350 mile in length and only 50 in breadth the water be fresh and transparent yet of a green or sea tinge commonly freeze in the latter end of December and clear of ice in may at particular period it be subject to violent and unaccountable storm whence as terror be the parent of superstition probably spring the russian name of svetoie morè or the holy sea there be many seal here and abundance of fish particularly a kind of herr call omuli mr wilton very good charle now my son try you best memory on the eastern sea george i be glad you have give I that sea to describe for i have be much amuse with the curious name of the island print on the map in these water a little group not far from ` tchusan ' be call ` the bear and cub ' another ` lowang ' or ` buffalo 's nose ' another ` chutta-than ' or ` shovel-nosed shark ' near the japan isle there be a little cluster call ` ass ' ear ' this sea be call by the chinese tong-haus and in it be the large island formosa and loo-choo but i know nothing of they mr wilton i will aid you there george because you have do well to remember all those difficult name formosa be a fine fertile island belong to the chinese where ox be use for equestrian purpose for want of horse or ass the loo-choo island constitute a little civilized kingdom tributary to china there be thirty-six of they the capital be kinch these isle be discover by the chinese many hundred year ago they product be sulphur copper tin shell and mother-of-pearl the inhabitant vie with the japanese in the manufacture of lacquered ware loo-choo itself be one of the most delightful place in the world with a temperate climate and great fertility all animal creation here be of a diminutive size but all excellent in they kind the people be amiable and virtuous though unhappily worshipper of confucius mr wilton the china sea fall to dora 's share : be you prepared my dear dora i think so sir it lie south-west of china and connect with it be the gulf of siam and tonquin in the former be the island hasting and tantalem : the latter wash the coast of cochin china a coast that suffer more from the encroachment of the sea than any other know : in five year the sea gain 190 foot from east to west the low country be expose to a uncomfortable degree of heat during part of the year and the rain be so plentiful that boat be navigable over the field and hedge and the child go out in small bark to fish for the mouse which cling to the branch of the tree emma poor little mouse i dare say they would rather be plaything for child than be drown charle they need no fishing-tackle for they sport i suppose they catch they in they hand do you know dora dora i believe they do -- now what come next oh hainan it lie in the china sea its capital be kiang-tchou in the southern part this island be mountainous but towards the north it be more level and productive of rice in the center there be mine of gold and on the shore be find small blue fish which the chinese value more than we do those know as gold and silver fish the blue fish will not survive long after they be catch and two day ' confinement to a glass bowl suffice to end they life mr barraud the gulf of tonquin and the adjacent sea be remarkable for dreadful whirlwind call ` typhon ' after calm weather they be announce by a small black cloud in the north-east part of the horizon which gradually brighten until it become white and brilliant this alarming appearance often precede the hurricane twelve hour charle pray what be the cause of this dreadful ` typhon ' mr barraud they seem to arise from the mutual opposition of the north-wind come down from the mountain of the continent and the south-wind proceeding from the ocean nothing can exceed they fury they be accompany by dreadful thunder lightning and heavy rain after five or six hour a calm succeed but the hurricane soon return in the opposite direction with additional fury and continue for a equal interval george papa there be sea of all color for i have actually find a blue sea here it be between loo-choo and china what droll people the chinese be they have such odd name for they place mr wilton yes they call china tchou-koo or the ` center of the world ' for in they overweening pride they consider other country as mere strip surround they territory and they name and title be very grand at a distance of six hundred pace from the shore of the ` yang-tse-kiang ' be the wonderful island of chin-shan or ` golden mountain ' this island be cover with garden and pleasure-houses art and nature have unite they effort to give it the most enchanting aspect it be in the field of this isle that the shrub grow produce the cotton of which the article know by the name of nankeen be make the fiber be not white like other cotton but of a delicate orange color which it preserve after it be spin and weave mr barraud there be many noble lake in china particularly in the province of howquang which name signify ` country of lake ' and i remember reading of a traveller who often observe on one near the imperial canal thousand of small boat and raft construct for a singular species of fishery ` on each boat or raft be ten or a dozen bird which at a signal from the owner plunge into the water and it be astonishing to see the enormous size of the fish with which they return grasp within they bill ' they appear to be so well train that it do not require either ring or cord about they throat to prevent they from swallow any portion of they prey except what the master be please to return to they for encouragement and food the boat use by these fisherman be of a remarkably light make and be often carry to the lake together with the fishing-bird by the fisherman themselves charle what preposterous thing people do in other country how strange to train bird to catch fish why charle we have fishing-bird in england exclaim george the only difference between they be that _ we _ bird fish for themselves while the chinese bird fish for they master i have often see the kingfisher pounce upon they prey and i have hear of heron and stork live on fish catch by themselves mr wilton quite true george and this prove that many ` traveller 's wonder ' cease to be wonderful when we examine into the circumstance and particulars or compare they relation with the commonplace occurrence of everyday life now for the bay of bengal which contain the fine island of andaman nicobar and ceylon for the particulars of these island i beg to refer the member to mr wilton mr wilton we will describe they accord to they merit and by so do the last will be first ceylon be consider the finest and richest island in the world : we read that the stone be ruby and sapphire that amonium scent the marsh and cinnamon the forest and that the most common plant furnish precious perfume its length be about 250 mile its breadth 150 its principal production be gold silver and other metal excellent fruit of all kind delicious spice ivory cotton silk musk and many variety of precious stone the chief town be candy situate on a mountain in the middle of the island trincomalé and columbo be its other great town i forget to tell you that elephant of the most handsome and valuable kind run here in herd as the wild boar do in the forest of europe while the brilliant peacock and bird of paradise occupy the place of we rook and swallow the andainan -- the inhabitant be probably cannibal they antipathy to stranger be singularly strong they possess all the characteristic of the negro but scarcely know how to build a boat or manage a rope however they have acquire a little more civilization since the foundation of a english establishment on the great andaman for the reception of criminal send from bengal the nicobar isle be inhabit by a harmless inoffensive race of people and here as also in andaman be find the edible bird 's - nest so much esteem in china mr barraud these nest form a extensive article of commerce : they be build by a little bird call the jaimalani black as jet and very much like a martin but considerably smaller the nest be make of a slimy gelatinous substance find on the shore of the sea-weed call _ agal-agal _ and of a soft greenish sizy matter often see on rock in the shade when the water ooze from above the best be find in damp cave very difficult of access they be sell at a high price and consider a great luxury consequently only consume by the great people of china chiefly by the emperor and he court mr wilton george look as if he do not relish the idea of feast on bird 's - nest i believe the chinese monopolize these delicacy entirely and they be quite welcome so to do as they be not esteem elsewhere : so do not look so scornful george the inhabitant of the celestial empire would not offer _ you _ a bird 's - nest for you supper if you pay they a visit they cost i have hear they weight in silver emma can you tell I in what sea to look for the maldive emma yes dear papa maldive and laccadive be both in the arabian sea the first be small island or rock just above the water the dutch trade with the native for cowrie little shell use as money on some part of the coast of africa and indium ship from indium sometimes resort thither to procure shark ' fin for those epicure the chinese who consider they a excellent seasoning for soup the laccadive be about five degree further north and be in themselves larger island but not so numerous as the maldive bombay which be the central point of communication between indium and europe be on the arabian sea have we not devoted sufficient time to asia mamma mr wilton i scarcely think so my dear we could find subject for conversation which would profitably occupy the hour of many meeting in this delightful quarter of the world remember here be we first parent place when in innocence and happiness they be create by almighty god here in the garden of eden they dwell enjoy the light of he countenance here they fall in guilt and misery and be banish from the presence of they offended god here be the prophecy fulfil for here be bear we bless savior by he be the great and wondrous work of redemption accomplish he offer himself a sacrifice for the sin of the whole world he give we the everlasting gospel and he have become we mediator with god : by he we gain access to the father by he blood only can we be cleanse by he merit only can we hope for salvation and only through he grace assist we can we perform that which be right and well-pleasing in the eye of we heavenly father : then believe in he trust in he rejoice in he christ will be we all in all _ here _ and all in all _ hereafter _ there be many lake and small inland sea in asia memorable as have be the scene of we bless savior 's labor trial and triumph not the most insignificant on the list be the lake of genesareth sometimes call the sea of galilee or sea of tiberia for near here be situate nazareth the great city of jesus christ about six mile to the south stand the hill of tabor which a venerable tradition assign as the scene of christ 's

I gaily on my course or i fear i should have be ill prepare to supply the deficiency to-night if the member approve the follow plan we will act upon it i propose that we start from england cross the north atlantic ocean enter baffin 's bay by davi 's strait and follow the coast work we way round to the other water in america mr wilton i see not the slightest objection to the plan and we will call at all the island which lie in we way begin with madeira this name be a corruption of madera -lrb- 10 -rrb- so call by its first discoverer on account of the uncommon luxuriance of its foliage it be a exquisitely beautiful island with every variety of climate in various part : the soil be volcanic though there have be no eruption within the memory of man madeira belong to the portuguese and lie north of the canary madeira be about sixty mile long and forty broad : its chief town be funchal -lrb- footnote 10 : madera signify wooded -rrb- the canary isle formerly call fortunate isle belong to spain the three largest be grand canary teneriffe and ferro these island be famous for wine and those pretty little singing bird call canary teneriffe the second in size be remarkable for a volcanic mountain call the peak charle be we not go out of we way sir to look at these island baffin 's bay be much more to the north mr wilton you be right charle but on voyage of discovery we be permit to wander hither and thither at will so long as it be for the advantage of all party george but ship of war papa may not go out of the way : they be oblige to be very orderly be they not mr wilton so long as the wind will allow they they keep on they course together but adverse wind will send they far asunder at time as in the case of the destruction of the spanish armada ` he blow with he wind and they be scatter ' be the motto inscribe on the medal queen elizabeth cause to be strike in commemoration of that great victory mr barraud england can never forget the destruction of the spanish armada for it be the immediate cause of the acquisition of so many colony to england the signal success which attend sir franci drake and other induce they again to sally forth with sanguine hope of extend the kingdom of they sovereign this be providential at least that be my view of it : all this be wisely arrange that england might by obtain dependency strive to enlighten moralize and spiritualize the people who acknowledge the same temporal sovereign with herself that in due time they might also acknowledge the same spiritual sovereign george i should like to go on board a man-of-war and see all the arrangement because so many man on board one ship must need close packing i should think mr wilton you shall be gratify my boy put on you coat and hat : we will go on board one of she majesty 's ship before the gentleman have dine emma papa be only joking george you may sit still i can guess what you be go to say papa ` be not we voyage imaginary and should we not be consistent ' be i right mr wilton very nearly my dear you be very sharp to-night : the extra duty have quicken you discernment charle i enjoy this imaginary travel very much but i must confess if everything connect with it be to be consistent i shall not be at all satisfy with my supper no no exclaim the other child supper be to be real because we get really hungry but papa add george can you tell I any of the way of a man-of-war mr wilton yes my dear i will fulfil my promise and initiate you in some of the mystery which be enact at dinner-time on board of one of these wonderful vessel as the hour of noon approach the cook of the mess may be see come up the fore and main hatchway with they mess-kid in they hand the hoop of which be keep as bright as silver and the woodwork as neat and as clean as the pail of the most tidy dairymaid the grog also be now mix in a large tub under the half-deck by the quarter-master of the watch below assist by other lead and responsible man among the ship 's company closely superintend of course by the mate of the hold to see that no liquor be abstracted and also by the purser 's steward who regulate the exact quantity of spirit and of water to be measure out the seaman whose next turn it be to take the wheel or heave the lead or who have to mount the mast-head to look out as well as the marine who be to be plant as sentry at noon be allow to take both they dinner and they grog beforehand these person be call ` seven-bell-man ' from the hour at which they have they allowance serve to they long before twelve o'clock all these and various other minor preparation have be so completely make that there be generally a remarkable stillness over the whole ship just before the important moment of noon arrive the boatswain stand near the break of the forecastle with he bright silver call or whistle in he hand which ever and anon he place just at the tip of he lip to blow out any crumb which threaten to interfere with its melody or to give a faint ' too-weet too-weet ' as a preparatory note to fix the attention of the boatswain 's mate who be like they chief provide with call station themselves at interval along the main-deck ready to give due accompaniment to they leader 's tune the boatswain keep he eye on the group of observer and well know when the ` sun be up ' by the stir which take place amongst the astronomer or by notice the master work out he latitude with a pencil on the ebony bar of he quadrant or on the edge of the hammock railing -- though if he be one of you modern neat-handed navigator he carry he look-book for this purpose in one way or other the latitude be compute as soon as the master be satisfy the sun have reach he highest altitude in the heaven he then walk aft to the officer of the watch and report twelve o'clock communicate also the degree and minute of the latitude observe the lieutenant proceed to the captain wherever he may be and report that it be twelve and that so-and-so be the latitude the same formal round of report be go through even if the captain be on deck and have hear every word speak by the master or even if he have himself assist in make the observation the captain now say to the officer of the watch ` make it twelve ' the officer call out to the mate of the watch ` make it twelve ' the mate ready prime sing out to the quarter-master ` strike eight bell ' and lastly the hard-a-weather old quarter-master step down the ladder grunt out to the sentry at the cabin door ` turn the glass and strike the bell ' by this time the boatswain 's call have be in he mouth for several minute he elbow in the air and he finger on the stop ready to send forth the glad tiding of a hearty meal not less ready or less eager be the group of listener seat at they snow-white deal table below or the crowd surround the copper with they mess-kid act the part of drum to they impatient knuckle at the first stroke of the bell which at this particular hour be always sound with peculiar vivacity the officer of the watch exclaim to the boatswain ` pipe to dinner ' these word follow by a glorious burst of shrill sound ` long draw out ' be hail with a murmur of delight by many a hungry tar and many a jolly marine the merry note be nearly drown the next instant in the rattle of tub and kettle the voice of the ship 's cook and he mate bawl out the number of the mess as well as by the sound of foot tramp along the deck and down the ladder with the steam ample store of provision such as set up and brace the seaman 's frame and give it vigor for any amount of physical action then come the ` joyous grog ' that nautical nectar so dear to the lip of every true-hearted sailor with which he wash down she majesty 's junk as he roughly but good-humoredly style the government allowance of beef and while he quaff off he portion or he whack as he call it he envy no man alive and laugh to scorn those party philanthropist who describe he life as one of unhappy servitude the real truth be there be no set of man in the world in they condition of life who be better take care of than the sailor and marine of the navy or who upon the whole be more content and happy there george what think you of all that george why that they must be a merry set of fellow and i should like to be a ` middy ' amongst they emma oh george do not wish to be a sailor : remember frederic hamilton -- the next island we come in sight of be cape yerd island near africa they be discover in 1446 by the portuguese they present proprietor they be remarkably fertile st jago be the largest and be the residence of the portuguese viceroy charle may we now steer north and call at the azore or western isle we shall then be half-way between europe and america mr wilton we shall be very willing to accompany you if you will entertain we when there charle that might be do at a moderate expense for they be delightful island with a fine climate a spacious harbor good anchorage and all essential -- but they be subject to earthquake therefore it be not advisable to prolong we visit one remarkable circumstance i have almost forget be that no noxious animal can exist or be ever to be find on these island mr wilton the azore be also call the land of falcon because when discover there be so many of these bird find tame on the island they be 800 mile from the shore of portugal and belong to that kingdom nature appear everywhere smile the plain wave with golden harvest delicious fruit adorn the side of the hill and the towering summit be cover with evergreen but as charle observe they be volcanic and many new island have be raise from the bottom of the sea by volcanic action in the year 1720 one of these phenomenon take place on approach which next day a english captain observe : -- ` we make a island of fire and smoke the ash fall on we deck like hail and snow the fire and smoke roar like thunder ' the inhabitant of the azore be a innocent honest race who prefer peace to conquest and distinction in industry rather than in arm emma my course be now tolerably plain but while we be so near newfoundland we may as well look in upon the people this large island shut up the northern entrance into the gulf of st lawrence be for the most part barren and unfruitful and cover with perpetual fog mr barraud these fog be no doubt produce by the current that flow from the antille and remain for a time between the great bank and the coast before they escape into the atlantic ocean charle sir i do not understand how the current can cause a fog mr barraud it be because these stream come from tropical region be warmer than the water surround the bank of newfoundland and necessarily warmer than the atmosphere consequently they cause a vapor to arise which obscure the island with a moist and dense air newfoundland be for a long time consider the inhospitable residence of fisherman but of late it have double its population and industry and the activity of the british nation have add another fine colony to the civilized world mr wilton newfoundland be the nearest to great britain of any of we north american possession it be rather larger than england and wale its chief town be st john 's it be discover in 1497 by john cabot the fishery here be the chief wealth of the island and consist principally of codfish herring and salmon the great bank of newfoundland which appear to be a solid rock be 600 mile long and in some place 200 broad charle newfoundland be famous for dog but i find the most numerous there be not like those we call newfoundland dog which be large handsome animal for _ they _ be comparatively rare the most abundant be creature with lank body thin leg and tail and a thin taper snout they be very intelligent though and would beat the chinese bird in catch fish for mr juke a gentleman who have be to newfoundland say of one of these dog : -- ` he sit on a project rock beneath a fish-flake or stage where the fish be lay to dry watch the water which have a depth of six or eight foot and the bottom of which be white with fish-bone on throw a piece of cod-fish into the water three or four heavy clumsy-looking fish call in newfoundland sculpin with great head and mouth and many spine about they generally about a foot long would swim in to catch it these he would watch attentively and the moment one turn he broadside to he he dart down like a fish-hawk and seldom come up without the fish in he mouth as he catch they he carry they regularly to a place a few yard off where he lay they down and he owner tell we that in the summer he would sometimes make a pile of fifty or sixty a day just at that place he never attempt to eat they but seem to be fishing purely for he own amusement i watch he for about two hour and when the fish do not come i observe he once or twice put he right foot in the water and paddle it about this foot be white and my friend say he do it to toll or entice the fish ' cunning dog be he not george george yes he would make he master 's fortune if the fish he catch be worth sell emma to get into baffin 's bay we must go through davi 's strait so call from they discoverer john davi who sail through they in 1585 and follow the coast on the north side we shall pass south-east bay and coburg bay in 1818 captain ross complete the circumnavigation of this oblong bay the middle of it seem everywhere occupy with impenetrable ice between which and the land be the only passage for ship mr wilton that portion of the bay you have just describe wash the shore of greenland and the arctic region greenland be consider as a peninsula attach to america wretchedly barren for no tree grow there but god who make man of the dust also promise to supply he want and most wonderfully be this exemplify with regard to greenland to provide the inhabitant with the means of warming and nourish they body god cause the sea to drive vast quantity of wood from distant shore and with thankfulness the poor greenlander regularly gather these providential supplies from they own coast some part of greenland be nothing more than huge mass of rock intermingle with immense block of ice thus form at once the image of chaos and winter george be it not near greenland the ship go to catch whale mr barraud yes and as you have mention the subject we may as well stop and inquire into the particulars of this fishing george i remember read that there be three sort of whale -- the finback the right whale and the sperm whale but i should like to hear how they be catch mr barraud a man be station at the mast-head to look out and as soon as he perceive a whale he shout ` there she blow ' immediately all hand be on the move to prepare the boat : this take but a short time and the chase commence i will now give you a american account of such a chase ` the moment of intense excitement now arrive we pull as if for life or death not a word be speak and scarcely a sound be hear from we oar one of the man spring to he foot and grasp a harpoon a few more stroke of the oar and we be hard upon the whale the harpooner with unerring aim let fly he iron and bury they to the socket in he huge carcass stern all thunder the mate stern all echo the crew but it be too late we bow be high and dry on the whale 's head infuriate with the pain produce by the harpoon and doubtless much astonished to find he head so roughly use he roll half over lash the sea with he fluke -lrb- tail -rrb- and in he struggle dash in two of the upper plank boat stove boat stove be the general cry silence thunder the mate as he spring to the bow and exchange place with the harpooner all safe my hearty stern hard stern stern before he get he fluke to bear upon we stern all shout we and in a moment more we be out of danger the whale now turn fluke and dash off to windward with the speed of a locomotive tow we after he at a tremendous rate we occasionally slack line in order to give he plenty of play a stiff breeze have spring up cause a rough chop sea and we leak badly in the bow-plank but notwithstanding the roughness of the sea we go with incredible swiftness hoorah burst from every lip we exultingly take off we hat and give three hearty cheer but while we be skim along so gallantly the whale suddenly turn and pitch the boat on she beam-end every one who could grasp a thwart hang on to it and we be all fortunate enough to keep we seat for as much as a ship 's length the boat fly through the water on she gunwale foam and whiz as she dash onward it be a matter of doubt as to which side would turn uppermost until we slack out the line when she right to have a boat with all she iron lance gear and oar pile on one 's head in such a sea be rather a startling prospect to the best swimmer meantime the whale rise to the surface to spout the change in he course enable another boat to come up and we lay on we oar in order that mr d -- -lrb- the other mate -rrb- might lance he -- he strike he in a vital part the first dart as be evident from the whale 's furious die struggle but in order to make sure we haul up and lance the back of he head foam and breach he plunge from wave to wave fling high in the air torrent of blood and spray the sea around be literally a sea of blood at one moment he head be poise in the air the next he bury himself in the gory sea carry down in he vast wake a whirlpool of foam and slime but this respite be short he rise again rush furiously upon he enemy but a slight prick of a lance drive he back with mingled fury and terror whichever way he turn the barb iron goad he to desperation now and again intensity of agony would cause he to lash the water with he huge fluke till the very ocean appear to heave and tremble at he power toss struggle dashing over and over in he agony he spout up the last of he heart 's blood half a hour before he be free as the wave sport in all the pride of gigantic strength and unrivalled power he now lay a lifeless mass he head towards the sun he tremendous body heave to the swell and he destroyer proudly cheer over they victory ' emma it seem very cruel to catch these poor creature mr wilton they be tortured as little as possible but they be so strong that it require immense skill and bravery to contend with they they usefulness justify the act for i know not what we should do without some of the comfort produce from these monster of the deep emma what part do the oil come from mr barraud first from the blubber which be the outer cover or as whaler call it the ` blanket-piece ' this be strip off by means of a ingenious contrivance cut into piece and the oil boil out secondly from the head which be call the ` case ' and sometimes contain from ten to fifteen barrel of oil and spermaceti a sperm whale frequently yield as much as 120 barrel of oil forty-five barrel be consider a medium size george i hope when we go to jamaica we shall see some whale mr wilton no doubt we shall i have often see they rolling and spout in the wide atlantic : and you will also see the fly fish skimming in the hollow of the wave : they be very pretty grandy yes they be poor unfortunate for though possess the qualification of a bird as well as a fish they be so persecute by enemy in both element that whether take they temporary flight through the air or glide through the water they double faculty prove insufficient to defend or secure they from pursuit charle what creature war against these innocent fish madam grandy while in the air the man-of-war bird pounce upon they and they be chase in the water by the bonito and albacore : thus constantly persecute they do not become very numerous charle icy peak in greenland be a enormous mass of ice near the mouth of a river : it diffuse such a brilliancy through the air that it be distinctly perceive at a distance of more than ten league icicle and a immense vault give this edifice of crystal a most magic appearance emma shall we now continue we voyage through lancaster sound mr wilton i have be consider whether it would not be better to finish with these northern latitudes before we proceed on we voyage in that case we will test the hospitality of the people of spitzbergen iceland nova zemblum ferroe isle and sundry other in this part of the atlantic and frozen ocean and then descend to warmer climate mr wilton a very good plan if we do not get block up by the ice in these dreadful sea by-the-by there be a account of such a calamity happen to a vessel some year ago -- in the year 1775 captain warren master of the ` greenland ' a whale-ship be cruise about in the frozen ocean when at a little distance he observe a vessel captain warren be strike with the strange manner in which she sail be disposed and with the dismantle aspect of she rigging he leap into he boat with several seaman and row towards she on approach he observe that she hull be miserably weather-beaten and not a soul appear on deck which be cover with snow to a considerable depth he then hail she crew but no answer be return previous to step on board a open port-hole near the main-chain catch he eye and on look into it he perceive a man recline back in a chair with write material on a table before he but the feebleness of the light make everything very indistinct the party go upon deck and have remove the hatchway descend to the cabin they first come to the apartment which captain warren view through the port-hole a terror seize he as he enter it : its inmate retain he former position and seem to be insensible to stranger he be find to be a corpse and a green damp mould have cover he cheek and forehead and veil he open eyeball he have a pen in he hand and a log-book lay before he the last sentence in its unfinished page run thus : -- ` nov 14th 1762 ` we have now be enclose in the ice seventeen day the fire go out yesterday and we master have be try ever since to kindle it again without success he wife die this morning there be no relief ' captain warren and he seaman hurry from the spot without utter a word on enter the principal cabin the first object that attract they attention be the dead body of a female recline on a bed in a attitude of deep interest and attention she countenance retain the freshness of life : but a contraction of the limb show that she form be inanimate seat on the floor be the corpse of a apparently young man hold a steel in one hand and a flint in the other as if in the act of striking fire upon some tinder which lay beside he in the fore-part of the vessel several sailor be find lie dead in they berth and the body of a boy crouch at the bottom of the gangway stair neither provision nor fuel could be discover anywhere but captain warren be prevent by the superstitious prejudice of he seaman from examine the vessel as minutely as he wish to have do he therefore carry away the log-book and immediately steer to the southward impressed with the awful example he have just witness of the danger of navigate the polar sea in high northern latitudes on return to england and inquire and compare account he find that this vessel have be block up by the ice for upward of thirteen year yes -- ` there lay the vessel in a realm of frost not wreck nor strand yet forever lose she keel embed in the solid mass she glistening sail appear would expand glass ' -lrb- illustration : the geyser -rrb- grandy a most awful situation to be place in surround on all side by impenetrable ice which closeth up the water as with a breast-plate mr wilton iceland be first in point of distance it be situate south east of greenland in the north atlantic ocean and consider a appendage to america although it be know seven century before the time of columbus it be truly a land of prodigy : where the subterranean fire of the abyss burst through a frozen soil where boil spring shoot up they fountain amidst eternal snow and where the powerful genius of liberty and the no less powerful genius of poetry have give brilliant proof of the energy of the human mind at the farthest confines of animated nature charle there be twelve volcano in iceland the most celebrated of which be mount heclum situate in the southern part of the island : its elevation be about 4800 foot above the level of the sea george and there be hot spring too in this island but they have not all the same degree of heat mamma do you know anything of they mr wilton those spring whose tepid water issue as gently as a ordinary spring be call langer or bath other that throw up boiling water with great noise be denominate caldron in icelandic ` hverer ' the most remarkable be the geyser which be find near skalholdt in the middle of a plain where there be about forty spring of a smaller size it rise from a aperture nineteen foot in diameter spring at interval to the height of fifty or even ninety foot in these hot spring which formerly serve to baptize they pagan ancestor the icelander boil they vegetable meat egg and other article of food but it be necessary to cover the pot suspend in these steam water in order to prevent the volcanic odor from impart a taste to they contents iceland be not so barren as you might imagine from its extreme cold for gardening be cultivate throughout the island : but there be no large tree mr wilton the present house of the icelander differ little from those use by they ancestor who first colonize the island and be no doubt the best fit for the climate they be only one story high the stone wall have all the interstice stuff with moss and be about six foot in thickness in the better sort of house the window be glaze in the other secure by a thin skin stretch over the frame they have no chimney or grate

be in general the bone of a whale or a horse 's skull but much be say and do in these rude hut which would astonish you emma be the icelander civilized people : i mean at all refine mr wilton every icelander know how to read write and calculate which be more than we can say of the english they be a grave honest benevolent people but not remarkable for they industry they favorite amusement when assemble together consist in read history or poetry in singing or play at chess in which game they take great delight pride themselves on they skill they be refine enough to admire poetry and music : i think i need say no more we will now visit spitzbergen emma spitzbergen be a group of three large island and a number of lesser one near the north pole the mountain crown with perpetual snow and flank with glacier reflect to a considerable distance a light equal to that of a full moon the icy sea wash its shore and abound with whale who love to roll they enormous body among the marine forest of the sea in the vicinity be find the polar bear which pursue everything animated with life devour every animal he encounter and then roar with delight seat himself enthrone on the victorious trophy of mutilate carcass and bone charle the only tree grow in spitzbergen be the dwarf willow which rise to the vast height of two inch tower with great pride above the moss lichen and a few other cumbent plant george what a ridiculous little shrub we might just as well dignify mustard and cress with the title of tree to whom do this _ very fertile _ island belong mr wilton to the russian and it certainly be not a enviable possession for the climate be most wretched from the 30th of October until the 10th of February the sun be invisible it be as one long dreary night and bitterly cold the inhabitant sit by dull fire during this season immerse in fur and endeavor to doze through the tedious gloom they be chiefly of russian extraction and many of they native of archangel mr wilton other animal be find in these region besides the bear and whale : for we read of fox reindeer walrus and seal be occasionally catch by the people and many island about here -lrb- for the frozen sea be full of island principally compose of turf hill -rrb- be the dreary abode of bear and reindeer emma the ferroe isle belong to denmark be seventeen in number they produce agate jasper and beautiful zeolite and export feather eider-down cap stocking tallow and salted mutton charle i do not think that can be very nice : i wonder who buy it emma it always find purchaser : therefore some folk be not so fastidious as mr charle dorn george mamma let we go back past norway and see what be all these little island on the coast mr wilton as you please george but most of the island be barren uninhabited spot those worthy of notice be karen bommel sartar hittern at the entrance of the gulf of drontheim the victen or victor isle and the luffoden isle : the latter be the most numerous and extensive and note for the whirlpool maelstrom which have draw so many fine ship into its abyss and from which even the bellow struggle of the great whale will not suffice to redeem he if once he get within the vortex george what cause this whirlpool mr barraud when two current of a more or less contrary direction and of equal force meet in a narrow passage they both turn as it be upon a center until they unite or one of the two escape this be what be term a whirlpool or eddy there be three celebrated whirlpool notice in geography -- the maelstrom the euripus near the island of eubaea and charybdi in the strait of sicily charle bergen one of the principal town of norway stand on the north sea : it be seat in the center of a valley form a semicircle round a small gulf of the sea on the land side it be defend by mountain and on the other by several fortification this city be chiefly construct of wood and have be many time destroy by fire so dreadful be the last conflagration in 1771 that it be say the flame be visible in the isle of shetland or at least the red lurid glare of they in the sky mr wilton there be silver mine in norway but the iron mine be the most profitable we have to thank norway for the magnet of such inestimable value to the navigator george papa who find out the use of the magnet mr wilton flavio gioium be the author of the great discovery of the property of the magnet about the year 1302 he be a citizen of amalfus a town in naple emma be there not a destructive little animal native of norway call a lem mr barraud it be call the lemming or norwegian mouse it come from the ridge of kolen and sometimes spread desolation like the locust these animal appear in vast number proceed from the mountain towards the sea devour every product of the soil and after consume everything eatable in they course they at last devour each other these singular creature be of a reddish color and about five inch in length emma we may now return to we station in lancaster sound pass croker 's bay and enter barrow 's strait which wash the shore of north devon george in the new archipelago north of barrow 's strait be the georgian isle they be numerous and the principal be cornwallis bathurst and melville the latter be the largest be 240 mile long and 100 mile in breadth mr barraud here be another dreary land where no tree or shrub refresh the eye the climate be too cold for any person to live there and from its vicinity to the magnetic meridian the compass become useless remain in whatever position it be place by the hand emma prince regent 's inlet will lead we into bothnium gulf thence through fury and heclum strait -lrb- 11 -rrb- which be between the peninsula of melville and cockburn island we can enter fox channel pass through frozen strait and launch on the great water of hudson 's bay -lrb- footnote 11 : so name because these two vessel be here freeze up from October 20th 1822 to August 8th 1823 -rrb- mr wilton we enter hudson 's bay on the north close by southampton a large island inhabit chiefly by esquimaux nothing can exceed the frightful aspect of the environs of this bay to whichsoever side we direct we view we perceive nothing but land incapable of receive any sort of cultivation and precipitous rock that rise to the very cloud and yawn into deep ravine and narrow valley into which the sun never penetrate and which be render inaccessible by mass of ice and snow that seem never to melt the sea in this bay be open only from the commencement of July to the end of September and even then the navigator very often encounter iceberg which expose he to considerable embarrassment at the very time he imagine himself at a distance from these float rock a sudden squall or a tide or current strong enough to carry away the vessel and render it unmanageable all at once hurry he amongst a infinite number of mass of ice which appear to cover the whole bay mr wilton sixty year after the intrepid navigator hudson have first penetrate the gulf that bear he name the british government assign to a company of trader to those part -lrb- by the title of the hudson 's bay company -rrb- the chartered possession of extensive tract south and east of hudson 's bay to export the production of the surrounding country george be there any whale in hudson 's bay mr wilton no all attempt at the whale fishery have be unsuccessful : indeed there be very few fish of any sort here but in the lake around there be plenty such as pike sturgeon and trout and they bank be inhabit by aquatic bird among which be observe several species of swan goose and duck emma jame 's bay be directly in the south of hudson 's bay and extend a hundred league within the country i believe it be near here that the company 's most important establishment be situate such as fort albany fort moose and the factory of east main this bay contain many island mr wilton what bay must we pass to get to hudson 's strait emma mosquito bay be the only one i can perceive but there be mansfield isle and cape digg to make before we reach the strait and in the strait there be several bay the principal of which be north bay and ungava or south bay mr wilton quite correct emma the strait be discover by hudson in he voyage of 1610 the eastern coast of hudson 's bay form part of the peninsula of labrador will any member vouchsafe some information concern this country charle all that we know of labrador be that it be a mass of mountain and rock intersect with numerous lake and river and inhabit by esquimaux mr wilton once more in the atlantic the great highway and thoroughfare of civilized nation where sail we next emma through the strait of belle-isle into the gulf of st lawrence mr barraud this gulf abound with fish in a remarkable degree the bear here combine together in numerous herd to catch the salmon near the cataract in the river where great number be stop in they ascent and be exceedingly relish by that animal some of they plunge into the water and pursue they prey while other more idle watch they from the bank there be only two island of note in this gulf -- the island of anticostus 90 mile long and 20 broad cover with rock and want the convenience of a harbor and prince edward 's island pleasant fertile spot the gulf of st lawrence wash the shore of nova scotium and cape breton island mr wilton nova scotium be about 350 mile long and 250 broad : its chief town be halifax this island with regard to fishing be scarcely inferior to newfoundland which place be connect with the government of nova scotium mr wilton cape breton or sydney isle lie north-east of nova scotium from which it be separate by a strait only a mile broad its length be 100 mile its breadth 60 a remarkable bed of coal run horizontally at from 6 to 8 foot only below the surface through a large portion of the island : a fire be once accidentally kindle in one of the pit which _ be _ now continually burn cape breton have be term the key to canada and be the principal protection through the fine harbor of louisburg of all the fishery in the neighborhood emma the next important bay in we southward course be bay of fundy delaware bay and chesapeake bay : then we come in sight of the bahama mr wilton which island must stand aside while we examine the bermuda which be half-way between nova scotium and the antille they be so call by juan bermuda who discover they in the year 1557 but do not land upon they : they be of various size the largest be about twelve mile the cedar-tree grow there form the chief riches of the inhabitant and they estimate a man 's income by the number of tree he possess st george be the capital and the island belong to the english they be sometimes call ` somer isle ' from the circumstance of sir john somer be shipwreck on the rock by which they be surround previous to this occurrence henry may a englishman be cast ashore on one of the largest and as the island abound with cedar he contrived with the assistance of the material he obtain from the wreck to build a small vessel in which he return to england and be the first person who give any account of the group george now for the bahama they be 300 in number but only twelve be large nassau be the capital they be the first land discover by columbus in the year 1492 mr wilton and be once a nest of pirate but the english expel they and establish a colony in 1720 mr barraud speaking of pirate have you ever hear the plan adopt by the portuguese for the suppression of piracy no one have hear it and mr barraud proceed the portuguese in they early intercourse with the indian have a summary punishment and accompany it with a terrible example to deter other from the commission of the crime whenever they take a pirate ship they instantly hang every man carry away the sail rudder and everything that be valuable in the ship and leave she to be buffet about by the wind and wave with the carcass of the criminal dangle from the yard a horrid object of terror to all who might chance to fall in with she charle almost as dreadful a vessel to fall in with as the phantom ship in coleridge 's ` ancient mariner ' i always feel uncomfortable when i read that poem and yet i admire it very much mr wilton it be replete with such truthful description that you be involuntarily bear on the wing of imagination until all seem reality and you identify yourself with the ancient mariner mr wilton i anticipate we shall all be ancient mariner before we conclude we voyage but we must not be idle one lead on emma we will follow emma i have no more bay yet and it be mamma 's province to describe the island mr wilton well and good : here be the antille i shall not hasten over _ they _ for they be _ we _ isle whither we hope shortly to sail in reality therefore it be highly necessary that we should be well inform concern they locality they form a arch between the two continent of america and extend from the gulf of florida to that of venezuelum they be divide into the greater and the less cuba jamaica st domingo and porto rico be call the great antille all the other the less antille cuba be the largest and most important : it command the windward passage as well as the entrance into the gulf of mexico and florida and be for that reason sometimes call the key of the west indy it be more than 700 mile in length and its medium breadth 70 mile havannah be the capital jamaica be a delightful island endear to I by many fond recollection it be mountainous extremely fertile and abound with spring -lrb- as

st domingo the bone of christopher columbus and he brother lewi be deposit in two leaden coffin in the cathedral of this city porto rico be 100 mile long and 40 broad it be beautifully diversify with wood valley and plain and extremely fertile grandy the antille be lovely island and some of the happiest moment of my life have be pass in admire the wonderful work of we creator as show to such advantage in the bright land of the west beautiful be the morning in jamaica when the sun appear through a cloudless and serene atmosphere illumine with he ray the summit of the mountain and gild the leaf of the plantain and orange-tree the plant be spread over with gossamer of fine and transparent silk or gemm with dew-drop and the vivid hue of industrious insect reflect unnumbered tint from the ray of the sun the aspect of the richly cultivate valley be different but not less please the whole of nature teem with the most varied production the view around be splendid the lofty mountain adorn with thick foliage the hill from they summit to they very border fringe with plant of never fading verdure the appearance of the valley be remarkable : to form a imperfect idea of it we must group together the stately palm-tree the cocoa-nut and tamarind tree the clustering mango and orange-tree the wave plume of the feathery bamboo and many other too numerous to mention on these plain too you will find the bushy oleander many variety of jerusalem thorn and african rise the bright scarlet of the cordium bower of jessamine vine of grenadillum and the silver and silky leaf of the portlandium field of sugar-cane house of the planter hut of the negro almost hide by the patch of cultivate ground attach to they and the distant coast with ship add to the beauty of the west indian landscape mr wilton that be the bright side of the scene my dear mother and lest we should form wrong impression we will let the young folk hear how all this beauty be sometimes mar by hurricane and earthquake one specimen will be sufficient and i will describe a hurricane in order that you may have some slight notion of the many _ delight _ attendant on a residence in the west indy -- a hurricane be generally precede by a awful stillness of the element the air become close and heavy the sun be red and the star at night seem unusually large frequent change take place in the thermometer which rise sometimes from 80 ° to 90 ° darkness extend over the earth the higher region gleam with lightning the impending storm be first observe on the sea foam mountain rise suddenly from its clear and motionless surface the wind rage with unrestrained fury its noise may be compare to distant thunder the rain descend in torrent shrub and lofty tree be bear down by the mountain stream the river overflow they bank and submerge the plain terror and consternation seem to pervade the whole of animated nature : land bird be drive into the ocean and those whose element be the sea seek for refuge in the wood the frighted beast of the field herd together or roam in vain for a place of shelter all the element be throw into confusion and nature appear to be hasten to she ancient chaos scene of desolation be disclose by the next morning 's sun uproot tree branch shiver from they trunk and even the ruin of house scatter over the land the planter have sometimes be scarcely able to distinguish the place of he former possession by these dreadful hurricane fertile valley may in a few hour be change into dreary waste cover with the remains of domestic animal and the fowl of heaven charle i do not envy you the prospect of a abode in the antille friend george but i shall be heartily glad to see you safe back again grandy every country have a evil ` tis right it should be so or we should like this fair world and its enjoyment so well that we should not care to ` go up higher ' there be many evil ` tis true but there be also so much good to counter-balance the evil that we should raise we heart with thankfulness and open we lip with praise to sing the goodness of we god emma my child where roam we next emma we can not quit the gulf of mexico yet dear grandy until we have examine its environs we enter it through the gulf of florida which be situate between florida and cuba the gulf of mexico almost intersect the two continent and be in fact a extensive sea it wash the shore of mexico and yucatan and contain many comparatively small bay mr barraud this gulf may be consider as a mediterranean sea which open a maritime commerce with all the fertile country by which it be encircle the island scatter in it be inferior only to those in the indian archipelago in number in magnitude and in value mr wilton mexico be a very rich city the shop literally overflow with gold silver and jewel the cathedral in some respects surpass all the church in the world the balustrade which surround the altar be compose of massive silver a lamp of the same metal be of so vast a size that three man go into it when it have to be clean and it be enrich with lion 's head and other ornament of pure gold the statue of the virgin and the saint be make of solid silver richly gilded and ornamented with precious stone yucatan be celebrate for beautiful ruin adorn with the most striking impose and elegant decoration but who be the architect or when build be at present a mystery for when discover by the spaniard in the fifteenth century it be inhabit by a fierce tribe of indian who be perfectly ignorant of art and science therefore these magnificent erection must have be the work of civilized man before yucatan be possess by the indian many attempt be make by the spaniard to obtain a footing in this country but to no purpose at length they hit upon the expedient of send priest among the people five be find willing to go : they be introduce as man of peace by the mexican be amicably receive and allow to settle in the country they conduct soon gain they the love and esteem of the fierce indian and they bring they child to be teach and be baptize with they whole family every day strengthen they attachment to the padre : they build they house to live in and a temple for worship and at last without any compulsion the chief acknowledge the authority of the king of castile but this allegiance be of short duration some spanish soldier go over and carry fire and sword into the heart of they country and soon obliterate the impression make by the good padre the indian again wage war with civilized man and the priest flee for they life many year after the spaniard be the conqueror and succeed in plant they standard in yucatan in the year 1537 it be now inhabit by spaniard and indian : there be a appearance of civilization surround many of these desolate place village and town have be form and land cultivate in every direction emma through the bay of hondura we enter the caribbean sea and it be the last sea on this side of the equator mr barraud the caribbean sea be generally speak still and quiet and in fine weather the water be so transparent that the mariner can discern fish and coral at fifty fathom below the surface the ship seem to float in the air and the spectator be often seize with vertigo while he behold through the crystalline fluid submarine grove and beautiful shell glitter among tuft of fucus and sea-weed fresh-water spring issue from the sea on both side of the channel between yucatan and cuba they rush with so much violence out of the deep that it be dangerous for small vessel to approach they boat have be dash to piece by the force of the surge ship on the coast sail here sometimes for a supply of fresh water which the seaman draw from the bottom of the ocean emma what extraordinary thing we meet with in we travels may we before cross the equator visit the lake mamma mr wilton i be quite agreeable who wish to go to the lake charle i do and will start directly i have prepare the necessary document oh here they be lake superior michigan and huron be consider as form one large inland sea divide the united state from canada there be several island in these lake particularly in lake superior which island the savage believe to be the residence of the great spirit it be strange that these lake be never freeze over although the entrance be frequently obstruct with ice emma lake superior be more than 500 league in circumference its clear water feed by forty river be contain in extensive stratum of rock and they surge nearly equal those of the atlantic ocean lake huron be connect with superior by the strait of st mary lake michigan communicate with huron by a long strait and the country around its bank belong exclusively to the united state charle lake erie be my favorite because it communicate with the river niagara and with those celebrated cataract of which so much have be write george for the same reason then you should patronize lake ontario it be 170 mile long and 60 mile broad at its widest part and empty itself through the romantic ` lake of a thousand isle ' into the st lawrence emma lake winnipeg be the next nearest it be more than sixty league in length by thirty or forty broad its bank be shaded by the sugar-maple and poplar and it be surround by fertile plain which produce the rice of canada the great slave lake be quite north and the last of any consequence it be more than a hundred league in length and sprinkle with island cover with tree resemble the mulberry mackenzie find they load with ice in the middle of June mrs wilton there be nothing in other part of the globe which resemble the prodigious chain of lake in north america they may properly be term inland sea of fresh water and even those of second and third class in magnitude be of larger circuit than the greatest lake in the old continent they all unite to form one uninterrupted current of water extend above 600 league in length the country around be intersect with river lake and marsh to a greater extent than any other part of the world : but few mountain rise above this savage icy plain one be tempt to inquire why do such superb stream waste they fertilize water upon these frozen desert we only know they manifest the power and we must not doubt the wisdom of they creator mr wilton now emma return to we former situation in the bay of hondura what of that bay emma only this papa that it wash the shore of yucatan which have already be describe and run into the caribbean sea mamma will help I here mr wilton the coast of hondura be discover by columbus in he last voyage but its verdant beauty -lrb- for it be a lovely place -rrb- could not win he to the shore without landing he continue on to the isthmus of darien in search of that passage to indium which be the aim of all he hope but which it be destine he should never see emma the caribbean sea contain the caribbee island which be also distinguish by the name of windward and leeward isle the only one we should have to pass near in sail out of this sea be tobago mr wilton but emma be you go to leave this coast without a visit to panama emma my only reason for so do dear papa be because i know nothing about it except that it be situate close to the isthmus of darien and its chief town be porto bello mr wilton panama be itself a isthmus and be most luxuriant in vegetable production and could challenge competition with any part of the world in the vigor and variety of its wood there be know to be grow there no less than ninety-seven different quality of wood it be famed as most woody place be for snake and poisonous reptile : the country people will scarcely move abroad after nightfall for fear of they and always carry a charm about they person to prevent injury from they bite this charm be a alligator 's tooth stuff with herb compound and mutter over by some old woman mr barraud i have hear that toad at porto bello be so numerous that it be the popular prejudice that the drop of rain be change into toad and even the more learn maintain that the egg of this animal be raise with the vapor from the adjoining swamp and be convey to the city by the succeed rain be there hatch they be large and frightful many of they six inch in breadth and after a night of rain the street be almost cover so that it be impossible to walk any distance without crush dozen of they the city be so badly situate and the climate so unhealthy that few person can exist there and it be justly term by the spaniard ` la sepultura de los europeanos ' charle the people of porto bello be not particularly dainty i be sure i should starve there for i could not consent to eat they food what do you think of shovel-nosed shark be sell in the market and guana -- which you know be lizard -- be consider a special treat and then worse than all the country folk mostly feed upon monkey how should you fare amongst they george could you make a dinner off a roasted monkey george i do not think i should enjoy it but if i be very hungry i might not be particular : however i must own i should even then prefer beef or mutton to lizard and monkey mr wilton panama be notwithstanding they want of taste a rich country rich in gold silver and other mine commerce be gain ground there and in the present day the people be more anxious to make they fortune than to display they magnificence formerly no family in panama eat off anything but plate almost every domestic utensil be of the same material and the woman wear a profusion of chain pearl and other ornament but time be alter there as elsewhere most of the gold have pass through the melting-pot to the old world mr barraud true but they have still enough leave to make very grand display on gala day and on these occasion the dress of the woman be peculiarly splendid a loose chemise of beautiful cambric with innumerable and immense frill richly work with lace be with a petticoat of the same fasten at the waist by several massive chased-gold button round the neck be several gold

case in gold be place together with a massive gold bodkin to great advantage in beautiful hair plait in two tail down the back the foot be barely introduce into a little slipper turn up very much at the toe and also richly ornament the whole appearance be elegant and become mr wilton the pearl thus tastefully dispose around the person of a fair panamenian be procure among the island of the coast by diving the occupation be very laborious and success most uncertain but the pursuit be a favorite one and the diver be very expert they generally proceed in company of several canoe together each contain six or seven man who dive in succession arm with a sharp knife rather for the purpose of detach the oyster from the rock to which they adhere than for defense against danger before descend they repeatedly cross themselves -lrb- for you must understand nearly all central america be inhabit by roman catholic -rrb- and generally bring up four oyster one under each arm and two in the hand the usual time of stop under water be from fifty seconds to two and a half minute much have be say of the danger of these fishery both from the shark and another enemy call the ` manta ' which crush its victim but the shark be ever a coward and no match for a expert diver with a knife and accident rarely occur emma oh how much information i should have lose have i go sailing on by myself i think i have better resign my station at the wheel to some member who be better able to steer who will have it mr barraud keep it emma unless you be weary and we will direct you course occasionally i be sure you have prove yourself so indefatigable on all occasion that we vessel can not be in better hand emma before proceed any further i wish to read the enclosed account i receive it with two or three other papers from we friend dora a few minute before we assemble she know we should be explain the atlantic to-night and beg i would introduce this at the meeting #the seaboy 's grave # ` there be a poor little middy on board so delicate and fragile that the sea be clearly no fit profession for he but he or he friend think otherwise and as he have a spirit for which he frame be no match he soon give token of decay this boy be a great favorite with everybody the sailor smile whenever he pass as they would have do to a child the officer pat he and coddle he up with all sort of good thing and he messmate in a style which do not altogether please he but which he could not well resist as it be mean most kindly nickname he dolly poor fellow he be long remembered afterwards i forget what he particular complaint be but he gradually sink and at last go out just as a taper might have do expose to such gust of wind as blow in that tempestuous region he die in the morning but it be not until the evening that he be prepare for a seaman 's grave ' i remember in the course of the day go to the side of the boy 's hammock and on lay my hand upon he breast be astonish to find it still warm so much so that i almost imagine i could feel the heart beat this of course be a vain fancy but i be greatly attach to my little companion be then not much taller myself and i be soothe and gratify in a childish way by discover that my friend though many hour dead have not yet acquire the usual revolting chilliness ` something occur during the day to prevent the funeral take place at the usual hour and the ceremony be defer until long after sunset the evening be extremely dark and it be blow a treble-reefed topsail breeze we have just send down the top-gallant yard and have make all snug for a boisterous winter 's night as it become necessary to have light to see what be do several signal lantern be place on the break of the quarter-deck and other along the hammock railing on the lee-gangway the whole ship 's company and officer be assemble some on the boom other in the boat while the main-rigging be crowd half-way up to the cat-harpings overhead the mainsail illuminate as high as the yard by the lamp be bulge forwards under the gale which be rise every minute and strain so violently at the main-sheet that there be some doubt whether it might not be necessary to interrupt the funeral in order to take sail off the ship the lower-deck port lay completely under water and several time the muzzle of the main-deck gun be plunge into the sea so that the end of the grate on which the remains of poor dolly be lay once or twice nearly touch the top of the wave as they foam and hiss past the rain fall fast on the bare head of the crew drop also on the officer during all the ceremony from the foot of the mainsail and wet the leaf of the prayer-book the wind sigh over we amongst the wet shroud with a note so mournful that there could not have be a more appropriate dirge ` the ship pitch violently strain and crack from end to end so that what with the noise of the sea the rattle of the rope and the whistling of the wind hardly one word of the service could be distinguish the man however understand by a motion of the captain 's hand when the time come and the body of we dear little brother be commit to the deep ` so violent a squall be sweeping past the ship at this moment that no sound be hear of the usual splash which make the sailor -lrb- naturally superstitious -rrb- allege that they young favorite never touch the water at all but be at once carry off in the gale to he final resting-place ' george oh how very melancholy it seem much more dismal to be bury in the sea than on the land : ` for the dead should lie in the churchyard green where the pleasant flower do spring ' emma i shall be grateful to captain hall if he pathetic description of the funeral of ` dolly ' check you desire to become a sailor george for i can not bear to think of it we be now to sail along the coast of south america and the first gulf in the north of this coast be the gulf of maracaybo coro trieste and parium by the island of trinidad where -- charle stop stop emma out of four gulf there must be something to be have worth fishing for be there not mr barraud you may fish for melancholy in the gulf of trieste charle if you be so disposed for it be a dreadful place here in the midst of furious wave enormous rock raise they isolate head and scarcely even with a fair wind can ship overcome the strength of the stream charle we will not angle in _ that _ gulf but i have fish up a island in maracaybo or venezuelum gulf it be call curacoa and be arid and sterile there be very little water and only one well in the island and the water be sell at a high price its capital be williamstadt one of the neatest city in the west indy mr wilton the entrance to the gulf of parium on the north side be call dragon 's mouth on the south serpent 's mouth this gulf separate trinidad from south america trinidad be about 70 mile from east to west and nearly 50 from north to south the most remarkable phenomenon there be a bituminous lake situate on the western coast near the village of la brea it be nearly three mile in extent of a circular form and about 80 foot above the level of the sea small island cover with plant and shrub be occasionally observe on this lake but it be subject to frequent change and the verdant isle often disappear trinidad be important on account of its fertility its extent and its position emma the next bay in we course be the bay of oyapok mr wilton and the next country in we course be guiana wash by the atlantic this country be subject to annual inundation all the river overflow they bank forest tree shrub and parasitical plant seem to float on the water and the sea tinge with yellow clay add its billow to the fresh-water stream quadruped be force to take refuge on the highest tree : large lizard agouti

country in the world be so famous for its enormous gulf mr wilton yes we must make a division for another meeting to-night we will sail down to cape horn and sojourn there until the 21st of this month we could not choose a more favorable time than march for we visit emma very well then we will merely mention some of these bay viz : -- pinzon maripanus gurupy turiassu cuma paraiba all saint camanu

travel in seven league boot : but they be really large people many of they seven foot high and such man see through a traveller 's microscope would be magnify to huge giant charle now here we be in the land of fire and yet it be very cold emma you be surely not go to name all these little bay emma do not be alarm charle : i will not so far tax you patience but we must see terra del fuego it be divide into three large island -- south desolation clarence island and king charle 's southland besides which there be hundred of smaller isle habit and uninhabited mr wilton have reach the southern extremity of the american continent we may take a excursion to some of the neighbor island for although they be not all subject to america still they be nearer to it than to any other country to the south of patagonium there be a number of cold barren and mountainous island volcano which can not melt brighten and illumine the perpetual snow in these dismal region here it be that the sailor observe fire on the southern shore of the strait for which reason the land on that side be call terra del fuego george mamma i wish to know why march be a favorable month for visit cape horn mr wilton because midsummer take place in February and be the best time of the year July be the worst month for then the sun do not rise until nine o'clock and it set at three give eighteen hour night and then also snow and rain gale and high wind be in abundance charle will you favor we with some account of the island charle staten be a detach island which may be consider as form part of the archipelago of

better clear the deck and pipe to supper george one question more dear papa can any one tell the depth of the atlantic mr wilton the depth be extremely various and in many place wholly beyond the power of man to fathom the greatest depth that have ever be reach be effect by captain scoresby in the sea near greenland in the year 1817 and be 7200 foot many part of the atlantic be think to be three time this depth how much be that my boy george 21600 foot papa mr wilton well do now go and discuss mamma 's _ reality _ and try and remember as much as possible of we imaginary wanderings that they may prove of _ real _ utility to you in you journey through life chapter vi the water of the vast ocean when it have rage with all its fury becalm itself again this be the course of the world -- and likewise still to forget _ kalmuck song _ there be no disappointment on the twenty-first but there be evidently some cause of uneasiness for there be a great deal of whisper between george and he sister and a great many significant glance at papa which plainly indicate that some important disclosure be about to be make but muffin and tea appear and disappear and still not a word george fidget and emma look uneasy which mr wilton observe he say : i apprehend there will be no business do to-night unless i set these anxious little folk at rest by inform the present company of the event which have transpire since we last meeting i believe you be aware that it be my intention shortly to visit jamaica during the past week i have be bring affair to a crisis and it be now finally arrange that should nothing intervene to the prevention of we plan we sail for that island on or about the thirtieth of next month this of course will preclude the possibility of meet many more time but i think we may promise ourselves one farewell debate i regret we separation principally on account of we little society for it have be the means of pass we evening not only agreeably but profitably should we life be spare i trust we shall again assemble under the same roof and again enjoy the advantage of each other 's research this news spread a gloom over the little party for they could not contemplate a separation from they kind friend without feeling of deep regret and there be more tear than smile in they usually bright eye grandy look from one young face to another : all wear the same expression thoughtful sorrowful and silent they sit around the table where they have enjoy so many happy hour and she too feel that although it be delightful to possess the affection of friend yet too often that affection be the cause of much anxiety and deep endure sorrow a separation of 5000 mile be not a trifling cause of grief but it be a pity to tinge the next month of they existence with unavailing melancholy : it have be better that it have remain a secret than to have cause such unhappiness to cloud they serene and cheerful day and mr wilton endeavor to make they view the matter in a brighter light at all event she say we must not render each other miserable because we be call upon to exercise this self-denial it be wrong to waste in unavailing regret the time we have still to be together and be gloomy and sad for a whole month no that can not possibly improve we affair and will only unfit we for the performance of we duty and increase we misery come wipe away those glisten tear my child or they will freeze on you cheek for if i mistake not we be suppose to be somewhere about the sixtieth parallel of south latitude and the thermometer somewhat below zero come see who will find the situation first george try what you can do the child commence they search and before george exclaimed south shetland dear mamma every eye although still dim with tear be eagerly in quest of the desire parallel mr wilton right george i fear it will not be prudent to venture any further south as we may encounter some ice-island for there be several in this vicinity but i should like to hear if any of you can tell I why deception isle -lrb- one of the south shetland group -rrb- be so call dora it be so call from its very exact resemblance to a ship in full sail and have deceive many navigator this island be inhabit only by penguin sea-leopards pintador and various kind of petrel it be volcanic apparently compose of alternate layer of ash and ice as if the snow of each winter during a series of year have be prevent from melting in the follow summer by the ejection of cinder and ash from some part where volcanic action be still in progress and that such be the case seem probable from the fact of there be at least one hundred and fifty hole from which steam issue with a loud hissing noise and which be or be visible from the top of one of the hill immediately above the small cone where lieutenant kendall 's ship be secure to whom i be indebted for this information mr wilton the only habitable island near here be the sandwich isle -lrb- not captain cook 's -rrb- and georgium but they be neither large numerous nor important : we will therefore round the cape and enter the pacific ocean dora accord to emma 's chart we be to follow the coast call at as many of the island as be worthy of notice but previously here be the bay to be enumerate and such a number of they i could scarcely have imagine it possible for any shore to be so indented emma i need not read all the name as with you map you can each read for yourself but the follow be the largest : gulf of trinidad gulf of penas gulf of ancud by the island of chiloe and conception bay on the coast of chili mr wilton here be a part for I to play i perceive the native of the coast of the gulf of pena be descendant of the araucanian a warlike people who observe the great advantage the european possess from the use of gunpowder try in vain to learn its composition they see negro among the spaniard and because they color be suppose to resemble that of gunpowder they imagine they have discover the long-wished-for secret a poor negro be catch by they and burnt alive in the full belief that gunpowder would be obtain from he ash george poor man what ignorant people they must be be we to stop at the island of chiloe mr barraud most certainly as you will agree when you hear what i have to say it lie near the south coast of chili : its length be 120 mile average breadth 40 mile it be mountainous and cover with cedar which be export in great quantity to peru and chili the climate be healthy but damp as it rain ten month out of the year money be here almost unknown and traffic be conduct by barter or payment in indigo tea salt or cayenne pepper all these article be much value particularly the indigo for dye woollens for the weave of which there be a loom in every house accord to captain blankley the golden age would seem to be revive in this part of the world ` murder ' say he ` robbery or person be in debt be never hear of : drunkenness be only known or see when european vessel be in port : not a private dwelling in the town or country have a lock on the door and the prison be in disuse ' the inhabitant be cheerful and passionately fond of music and dancing emma i think we have better remain at chiloe : it must be a delightful place to live in where all the inhabitant be so upright and honest mr wilton yes my dear but business must be attend to before pleasure and we be bind for chili chili be a independent state and include the country of those same ignorant araucanian who notwithstanding they attribute ignorance have prove themselves equal in some respects to european for _ they _ have try in vain to subdue this warlike race of man the shore of chili be mostly high steep and rocky the whole country be extremely rich in metal : silver be there find nearer the surface than in any other country nearly all the river wash down gold and there be copper lead and even _ coal _ mine the chilian be good potter and make light strong earthenware jar which ring like metal chili be _ specially _ subject to earthquake shock be feel in some part almost daily and the country be continually desolate by they mr wilton the little island of mocha on this coast be once celebrate as a resort of buccaneer and thickly people but it be find desert by captain strong in 1690 and appear to have remain uninhabited since emma the most memorable island near we course be juan fernandez 110 mile from the coast i ought rather to have say island for there be two the largest be discover by a spaniard in 1563 and have be so much praise by early navigator that it have be think a earthly paradise its chief advantage arise from its be a good resting-place for ship this island be call mas-a-terra because nearest the continent there be many spanish settler there who have erect a battery and build a town the smaller island be generally call mas-a-fuero because further from the continent mr wilton juan fernandez have lately be take on lease from the chilian government by a enterprising american who have take thither about 150 family of tahitian with the intention of cultivate the land rear cattle and so improve the port of cumberland bay that it may become the resort of whaler and other vessel navigate the pacific ocean charle oh for the imagination of daniel de foe to conjure up the delightful picture of he robinson crusoe the poet cowper have do much towards hand the event down to posterity in he touching account of the feeling of the poor outcast when he find himself on the desolate shore george oh you mean alexander selkirk 's soliloquy i think i can remember some of the verse : -- ' i be out of humanity 's reach i must finish my journey alone never hear the sweet music of speech i start at the sound of my own the beast that roam over the plain my form with indifference bee they be so unaccustomed to man they tameness be shocking to I ' ` religion i what treasure untold reside in that heavenly word more precious than silver or gold or all that this earth can afford but the sound of the church-going bell these valley and rock never hear ne'er sigh would at the sound of a knell or smil would when a sabbath appear would ` ye wind that have make I you sport convey to this desolate shore some cordial endearing report of a land i shall visit no more my friend -- do they now and then send a wish or a think after I oh tell I i yet have a friend though a friend i be never to see ' emma a life of solitude must be very dreadful : we can not conceive such a existence while surround by we dear friend and all the luxury of civilized life how long be alexander selkirk on the island charle four year and four month i believe dora in sailing along the coast of peru we must pass close to lima its capital which be a magnificent city like other spanish city of america it be lay out in quadra or square of house and through the center of nearly all the street run a stream of water three foot wide which carry away a good portion of the refuse of the city mr barraud the lady of lima be celebrate for beauty and fineness of figure they wear a very remarkable walk dress peculiar to this city and truxillo it consist of two part one call the _ saya _ the other the _ manto _ the first be a elastic dress fitting close to the figure down to the ankle the other be a entire envelope disclose scarcely more than one eye to the most scrutinize observer a rich color handkerchief or a silk band and tassel be frequently tie around the waist and hang nearly to the ground in front mr wilton the population of peru consist principally of indian spaniard and negro the first be represent by traveller as in the lowest stage of civilization without any desire for the comfort of civilized life immerse in sloth and apathy from which they can rarely be rouse except when they have a opportunity of indulge to excess in ardent spirit of which they be excessively fond they be dirty in the extreme seldom take off they clothes even to sleep and still more rarely use water they habitation be miserable hovel destitute of every convenience and disgustingly filthy mr wilton the peruvian have at one time a curious contrivance for cross they river they do not know how to make a bridge of wood or stone but necessity the parent of invention supply that defect they form cable of great strength by twist together some of the pliable withe or osier with which they country abound six of these cable they stretch across the stream parallel to one another and make they fast on each side these they bind firmly together by inter-weave smaller rope so close as to form a compact piece of net-work which be cover with branch of tree and earth they pass along it with tolerable security proper person be appoint to attend to each bridge to keep it in repair and to assist passenger george almost as clever a contrivance as the bridge of the present day although neither so strong nor durable they be a persevere people emma the gulf of guayaquil be so call from a river of this name which be famous for its shift sand-bank on which as the water recede alligator be leave in great number the bay of choco be on the same coast -lrb- columbium -rrb- and be the scene of continual storm the greatest riches in wash gold be deposit in the province of choco the largest piece find there weigh twenty-five pound but this country so rich in gold be at the same time scourge with continual famine grandy prove that gold be only valuable as the means of procure the necessaries of life and enable its possessor to benefit he fellow-creature ` whoso seeth he brother have need and shutteth up he compassion how dwelleth the love of god in he ' the people here value not the gold for it be unable to buy they freedom from the awful scourge dora emma the bay of choco be on the coast of granada which although it be a district of columbium be large enough to be regard with some attention particularly as it be actually one of the three great division of columbium charle nearly in the same latitude just over the equator be the galapago they be pretty island : the cactus and aloe cover the side of the rock flamingo and turtle-dove fill the air and the beach be cover with enormous turtle but no trace whatever indicate the residence of man and i believe no man have ever land on these lonely shore mr wilton columbium abound in stupendous natural wonder amongst the rest be the natural bridge of iconongo not far from bogota the fall of tequendama the loftiest cataract and the silla de caracas the loftiest cliff yet discover the climate be hot and unhealthy and the country subject to earthquake it be inhabit by indian spaniard and negro the carib be the ruling indian tribe they be tall of a reddish copper-color with dark intelligent eye and a grave expression of feature they raise the flesh of they leg and thigh in long stripe and shave most of the hair from they head but do not flatten the forehead as be customary with the other tribe along the orinoco columbium be a country of great natural riches but suffer to lie for the most part waste for the people be naturally indolent and captain hall remark that the columbian who can eat beef and plantain and smoke cigar as he swing in he hammock be possess of almost everything he habit qualify he to enjoy or which he ambition prompt he to attain mr barraud along this coast many of the inhabitant subsist as fisherman and the indian of cartago have a singular method of catch wild-fowl which may here be notice : -- they leave calabash continually float on the water that the bird may be accustom to the sight of they when they wish to catch any of these wild-fowl they go into the water with they head cover each with a calabash in which they make two hole for see through they then swim towards the bird throw a handful of maize on the water from time to time the grain of which scatter on the surface the bird approach to feed on the maize and at the moment the swimmer seize they by the foot pull they under water and wring they neck before they can make the least movement or by they noise spread a alarm among the flock many family be support in this way by dispose of the bird thus catch at a low price in the market emma the next bay be panama in which be the gulf of st michael and gulf of parita there be several island here but the largest be rey isle the gulf of dolce run into costa rica and so do the gulf of nicoya : and the little bay about here must not detain we mrs wilton san josé be the capital of costa rica there be no fine building in this city and the church be inferior to many erect by the spaniard in the smallest village nevertheless the whole place exhibit a business like appearance much more so than most city in this lethargic part of the world in costa rica be a volcanic mountain cartago -lrb- now quiet -rrb- from the top of which the traveller can view the atlantic and pacific ocean at one glance in a right line over the top of the mountain neither be more than twenty mile distant and from the great height from which they be see they appear to be almost at the traveller 's foot it be the only point in the world which command a view of the two ocean grandy i remember a touching description of a funeral in san josé which will not be out of place here : -- ` while mr stephen -lrb- the author of several delightful book -rrb- be stand in a corridor of he friend 's house a man pass with a child in he arm he be its father and with a smile on he face be carry it to its grave he be follow by two boy play on violin and other be laugh around the child be dress in white with a wreath of rose around its head and as it lay in its father 's arm it do not seem dead but sleep the grave be not quite ready and the boy sit on the heap of dirt throw out and play they violin until it be finish the father then lay the child carefully in its final resting-place with its head to the rise sun fold its little hand across its breast and close its finger around a small wooden crucifix and it seem as they think it be happy at escape the trouble of a uncertain world there be no tear shed on the contrary all be cheerful and though it appear heartless it be not because the father do not love he child but because he and all he friend have be teach to believe and be firm in the conviction that take away so young it be transfer immediately to a better world the father sprinkle a handful of dirt over its face the grave-digger take he shovel in a few moment the little grave be fill up and precede by the boy play on they violin they depart ' mr wilton there be a spirit of thankfulness evince in that father 's conduct which require great faith i fear none of we would be find to possess as much under such a trial for the spirit be unhappily at most time under the dominion of the flesh george be not papagayo bay close to the lake of nicaragua emma it be only divide from the ocean by a portion of the district of nicaragua it be a great lake ninety five mile long and thirty broad and be navigable for ship of the largest class dora it be cover with beautiful and

a smooth unbroken cone to the height of nearly 1000 foot the water of this lake descend by the river st john towards the atlantic but there be no outlet into the pacific ocean george i should like to know why the pacific be so call -lrb- illustration : the earthquake -rrb- charle i can tell you george in the year 1520 when magellan be on he way to the spice island -lrb- the molucca you know -rrb- he and the crew suffer dreadful privation : they be nearly four month at sea without discover land they stock of provision be almost exhaust the water become putrid and in consequence the poor man be attack with that horrible disease the scurvy the only source of consolation under these trouble be the uninterrupted fair weather they enjoy and the favorable wind which waft they gently onward so that magellan be induce to call the ocean pacific : hence the origin of its name george thank you charle how pleasant it be to get all the information we require without the trouble of search in great dusty book now emma will it please you to travel onward emma what george have you too catch the mania that you be in such a hurry to get to californium george not to go gold-hunting indeed but the rocky mountain be up in the north and i have a story about they emma well to oblige you and ourselves too we will proceed the gulf of fonseca and conchagua be deep indentation about the middle of the coast of guatemalum to which country costa rica belong mr wilton the city of guatemalum be found in 1776 it be situate on table-land 5000 foot above the sea and enjoy a delicious climate -- literally a perpetual spring beautiful church and building adorn this city but the house be build only one story high in order more effectually to resist the action of earthquake for you must know this city have close to it two burn mountain -- fuego and agua which prove the volcanic nature of the earth among all the phenomenon of nature few appear to be attend with such horrible consequence as earthquake thousand who in one moment be full of busy life be the next swallow up as if they have never exist or crush to death by fragment of fall building in _ six minute _ by the great earthquake of lisbon in 1755 sixty thousand soul be launch into eternity and though none in this city have equal in destructiveness the great one at lisbon yet guatemalum have be several time nearly destroy by earthquake combine with the eruption of the neighbor volcano mr barraud the inhabitant be mostly of spanish origin consequently mostly roman catholic and a recent traveller say that from the moment of he arrival he be strike with the devout appearance of the city of guatemalum at matins and vespers the church be all open and the people particularly the woman go regularly to prayer every house have its figure of the virgin the savior or some tutelary saint and on the door be billet of paper with prayer you will be surprise to hear that nearly all the lady in central america smoke the married lady smoke _ puro _ or all tobacco the unmarried lady smoke _ cigar _ or tobacco wrap in paper or straw dora what a odd indulgence for a lady in england lady never smoke although i must say i have often see poor woman with pipe in they mouth and think what a dirty habit it be mrs wilton it be the custom of the country and be you a spanish lady dora i have no doubt you would enjoy a cigar as much as any of the señoritas we shall next see the shore of mexico what gulf must we pass to accomplish this emma only the gulf of tehuantepec which be worth notice mr wilton mexico have be travel over already so we will pass on to the gulf of californium george but be there not a place call new mexico dora yes but not near the coast : however i will tell you all i know about it it be mostly inhabit by christian indian of whom there be no fewer than thirty village they be of various tribe but all train to industrial habit and be in every respect a worthy set of people they clothing be the

seek i do not mind the trouble : so here it be : -- #story of boone and the bear # a young man name boone son of the mighty american hunter make a settle amongst the rocky mountain and when he hut be erect he use to leave it for day out on hunting expedition one night after return from one of these enterprise he retire to rest on he solitary pallet the heat be intense and as usual in these country during summer he have leave he door wide open it be about midnight when he be awaken by the noise of something tumble in the room : he rise in a moment and hear a short and heavy breathing he ask who it be for the darkness be such that he could not see two yard before he no answer be give except a kind of half smother grunt he advance -- and put out he hand he seize the shaggy coat of a bear surprise render he motionless and the animal give he a blow on the chest with he terrible paw throw he down outside the door boone could have escape but madden with the pain of he fall he only think of vengeance -- and seize he knife and tomahawk which be fortunately within he reach he dart furiously at the beast deal blow at random great as be he strength he tomahawk could not penetrate through the thick coat of the animal which have encircle the body of he assailant with he paw be press he in one of those deadly embrace which could only have be resist by a giant like boone -lrb- who be six foot nine inch in height and proportionably strong -rrb- fortunately the black bear unlike the grizzly very seldom use he claw and tooth in fight content himself with smother he victim boone disentangle he left arm and with he knife deal a furious blow upon the snout of the animal which smart with pain release he hold the snout be the only vulnerable part in a old black bear even at forty yard the ball of a rifle will flatten against he skull and if in any other part of the body it will scarcely produce any serious effect boone aware of this and not daring to risk another hug dart away from the cabin the bear now quite angry follow and overtake he near the fence fortunately the cloud be clear away and the moon throw light sufficient to enable the hunter to strike with a more certain aim : he find also on the ground one of the rail make of the blue ash very heavy and ten foot in length he drop he knife and tomahawk and seize the rail he renew the fight with caution for it have now become a struggle for life or death have it be a bull or a panther they would have have they bone shiver to piece by the tremendous blow which boone deal upon he adversary with all the strength of despair but bruin be by nature a admirable fencer and in spite of he unwieldy shape there be not in the world a animal whose motion be more rapid in a close encounter once or twice he be knock down by

fear some treachery make haste to paddle away without regard the distress of they comrade all of these however appear to be capable of take care of themselves except a infant of about a year old whose struggle be observe by one of the mate he jump overboard and save it the weather be very raw and chilly : the captain have the child dry and warm by the fire then wrap it in a blanket give it a piece of sugar and return it to its parent who be exceedingly pleased and grateful and as soon as all have recover from the effect of they immersion they business -lrb- which be trade for skin of various

refinement of life that the news-paper lately establish in the town set forth the follow article for sale : -- ` lady ' shoe from paris ice and eau de cologne ' grandy it be a great cause for thankfulness that religion be spread she benign influence over these volcanic isle the woman who truly speak be the most callous and obdurate have exhibit bright and numerous proof of that change of heart which be the single end and aim of pure christianity kekupuhe who in cook 's day be one of the wife of the king of hawaius evince the sincerity of she conversion which take place in 1828 by learn to read when she be more than eighty year of age and by indite hymn in honor of the god of she old age george i can not understand why they kill captain cook and i have never read the account of he first visit to the sandwich island : have you charle charle yes and a very interesting account it be on the first appearance of the english ship the chief and priest take they for float island imagine that they long-expected guardian spirit ` etuah orono ' be arrive hence captain cook be receive with honor approach to adoration as they imagine he to be they ` orono ' the king be absent at the time of he arrival but the chief priest and he son receive the captain scarcely be the ship anchor when a priest go on board and decorate cook with a red cloth such as adorn they deity offer he a pig in the manner of a sacrifice and pronounce a long harangue they chant hymn before he and priest bear wand precede he on he landing while the in habitant prostrate themselves on the ground as he walk from the beach to the village george but if they hold he in such reverence how be it they kill he mr wilton he own imprudence bring about he melancholy end some time after he arrival it appear that one of he smaller boat be steal by some of the native for the sake of the nail in she and be break up the very night it be steal captain cook angry at lose he boat attempt to get the king on board he ship to confine he there until the boat should be restore this cause a tumult and in the tumult captain cook be slay there certainly be no malice in the case -- not the slightest intention of injure he and he body be treat in the same manner as those of they own chief the bone be assign to different ery -lrb- chief -rrb- who either from affection or from a idea of good luck attend they desire to preserve they long after captain cook 's death the native believe he would re-appear and perhaps punish they for they breach of hospitality mr barraud they be a most interesting people and to prove to you how they have advance in civilization i will give you two instance of they mode of living and take they meal forty year ago the rev mr stewart be then on a mission visit a chief and when he enter the apartment one of he queen be seat on the ground _ à la turc _ with a large wooden tray in she lap upon this a monstrous cuttle-fish have just be place fresh from the sea and in all its life and vigor the queen have take it up with both hand and bring its body to she mouth and by a single application of she tooth the black blood with which it be fill gush over she face and neck while the long sucking arm of the fish in the convulsive paroxysm of the operation be twist and writhe about she head like the snaky hair of a medusa occupy as both hand be she could only give she visitor a nod mr stewart remark ` it be the first time i have see she majesty and i soon take my departure leave she as i find she in the full enjoyment of she luxurious luncheon ' now -- observe the contrast in 1841 sir george simpson and friend visit a chief they be receive in a immense apartment : several white person be there to meet they : all the rule of etiquette be observe on go to table the chief be all handsomely attire they clothes fitting to a hair 's breadth for they have import a tailor from england to make they the dining-room be handsomely furnish and light with elegant lamp the dinner be excellent with fine pastry and preserve from every country and the glass and plate on the table would have be admire even in a london mansion the chief especially the host be man of excellent address and add sir george simpson ` we soon forget that we be sip we coffee in a country which be deem uncivilized and among individual who be class with savage there be but few incongruity in the course of the evening 's entertainment such as could at all mar the effect except that one of the chief frequently inquire with much solicitude whether or not we think he whisker handsome ' in conclusion he say ` after chat a good deal and smoking a few cigar we take we leave highly gratified with the hospitality and courtesy of the governor and he friend ' dora it must have be a work of time to convert these people for they belief in the power of they idol be so strong and have be preserve through so many generation grandy the work be of god my dear and he make it to prosper civilization once introduce the way to christianity be pave and the chief with they wife set the example the mission be soon full of hope for the future the great woman of the island when convert themselves endeavor to propagate the truth of the gospel and amongst they one of the most justly celebrated christian be kapiolani she wish to undeceive the native concern they false god and know in what veneration pelus the goddess of the volcano be hold she determine to climb the mountain descend into the crater and by thus brave the volcanic deity in they very home convince the inhabitant that god be god alone and that the false and subordinate deity exist only in the fancy of they ignorant adorer thus determine and accompany by a missionary she with part of she family and a number of follower both of she own vassal and those of other chief ascend pelus at the edge of the first precipice that bound the sunken plain many of she follower and companion lose courage and turn back : at the second the rest earnestly entreat she to desist from she dangerous enterprise and forbear to tempt the powerful god of the fire but she proceed and on the very verge of the crater cause a hut to be construct for herself and people here she be assail anew by they entreaty to return home and they assurance that if she persist in violate the dwelling of the goddess she would draw on herself and those with she certain destruction she answer be noble : -- ' i will descend into the crater ' say she ` and if i do not return safe then continue you to worship pelus but if i come back unhurt you must learn to adore the god who create pelus ' she accordingly go down the steep and difficult side of the crater accompany by a missionary and by some whom love or duty induce to follow she arrive at the bottom she thrust a stick into the liquid lava and stir the ash of the burning lake the charm of superstition be at that moment break those who have expect to see the goddess arm with flame and sulphurous smoke burst forth and destroy the daring heroine who thus brave she in she very sanctuary be awe-struck when they see the fire remain innocuous and the flame roll harmless as though none be present they acknowledge the greatness of the god of kapiolanus and from that time few indeed have be the offering and little the reverence pay to the fire of peli charle what delightful anecdote concern my island but i have one reserve for the conclusion which illustrate the truth of the assertion that the woman of the sandwich island be superior to the man in many exercise require skill and also in they power of endurance the latter quality may i believe be fairly adjudge to the woman of all country ' a man and he wife both christian be passenger in a schooner which founder at a considerable distance from the land all the native on board promptly take refuge in the sea and the man in question who have just celebrate divine service in the ill-fated vessel call he fellow -lrb- some of they be convert as well as himself -rrb- around he to offer up another tribute of praise and supplication from the deep exhort they with a combination of courage and humility rarely equal to worship god in that universal temple under whose restless pavement he and most of he hearer be destine to find they grave it be do : they call on god from the midst of the wave and then each struggle to save the life they value the man and he wife have each succeed in procure the support of a covered bucket by way of a buoy and away they strike with the rest for kahoolawe finding themselves next morning alone in the ocean after a whole afternoon and night of privation and toil to aggravate they misfortune the wife 's bucket go to piece soon after daylight so that she have to make the best of she way without assistance or relief and in the course of the second afternoon the man become too weak to proceed till he wife to a certain extent restore he strength by shampoon he in the water they have now kahoolawe in full view after have be about four-and-twenty hour on they dreary voyage in spite however of the cheer sight the man again fall into such a state of exhaustion that the woman take he bucket for herself give he at the same time the hair of she head as a towing-line and when even this exertion prove too much for he the faithful creature after try in vain to rouse he to prayer take he arm round she neck hold they together with one hand and make with the other for the shore when a very trifling distance remain to be accomplish she discover that he be dead and drop he corpse she reach the land before night have swam upward of twenty-five mile during a exposure of thirty hour the only means of rest from she fatigue be by float on the top of the water mr wilton very good charle but if we note of all the other island in polynesium be as extensive as those of the sandwich isle i fear we shall not cross the equator before midnight emma i can soon quiet you fear dear papa for the description of the remain isle in north polynesium rest with the elder member and of course they be at liberty to abridge they if they please mr wilton in that case i will undertake to run over the ladrone sometimes call the marianne isle there be twenty of they but only five be inhabit and they lie in the south extremity of the cluster they be so close together and so broken and irregular in they form and position as to appear like fragment disjointed from each other at remote period by some sudden convulsion of nature the coast consist for the most part of dark brown rock honey-combed in many place by the action of the wave the island be fertile abound in hog cattle horse mule and many other agreeable thing while in order that like other country in this sublunary world they may lay claim to a portion of disagreeable they be infested with mosquito and endless variety of loathsome insect and the fish that be find around the coast be not fit for food so much for the country -- now for the native : -- they be tall robust and active the man wear scarcely any cover and the woman only a petticoat of mat both sex stain they tooth black and many of they tattoo they body the ladrone island be originally discover by magellan who call they ` las islas de las ladrones ' or the island of thief because the indian steal everything make of iron within they reach at the latter end of the seventeenth century they obtain the name of marianne from the queen of spain who send missionary thither to propagate the christian religion guajan be the largest island of the group near the ladrone lie the famous pyramidal rock call ` lot 's wife ' a sea neither break nor interrupted for a immense space in all direction here dash with sublime violence on the solid mass which rise almost perpendicularly to a height of 350 foot on the south-east side be a deep cavern where the wave resound with a prodigious noise mr barraud the philippine isle fall to my share they be correctly speak in the eastern archipelago luzon the most northerly be the largest : it be a long narrow island and like all the other abound in volcano gold iron and copper have be find in the mountain and rock salt be so abundant in some part as to be a article of export these island be exceedingly mountainous and fertile but from the large swamp be very unhealthy there be no beast of prey but numerous herd of cattle the inhabitant however be too indolent to profit by these gift of nature they be actually too idle to make they cow 's milk into butter and throughout the island use hog 's lard instead because they will not be at the trouble of keep and milk the cow rice be the chief support of the population sugar coffee and many other delightful thing grow here and cotton shrub thrive well manilla be the only port of trade in the philippine : it be a fortified city inhabit by people from all part of the world this city be enter by six gate the street have carriage way and footpath and be light at night the house be solidly construct but on account of earthquake seldom more than one story above the ground floor most of the house be furnish with balcony and verandah the place of glass in the window be supply by thin semus transparent piece of shell which though more opaque repel heat better in the year 1762 manilla be take by the english but ransom by spain for 1000 000_l _ sterling there who can compete with my island in value mr wilton quantity must compensate for the loss of quality here be the caroline or new philippine -- forty-six group of they comprise several hundred island a few of they be high rise in peak but by far the greater number be merely volcanic formation they be discover in 1686 by a spaniard who name they after charle ii of spain there be no hog on these island and the inhabitant subsist chiefly on fish they be repute to be the most expert sailor and fisherman in polynesium and notwithstanding the tremendous sea by which they be surround they have a considerable trading intercourse with the ladrone and many other island george papa it be you turn again -- pelew isle mr wilton they be chiefly know from the account of captain wilson who be wreck on they in 1783 he describe the inhabitant as hospitable friendly and humane and they be a gay and comparatively innocent people but they do not appear to have any form of religion although they conceive that the soul survive the body these island be cover with close wood ebony grow in the forest bread-fruit and cocoa-nut tree be in abundance cattle goat poultry & c have be send there and thrive well the pelew have a considerable trade with china now it seem to I that we have better cross the equator with all expedition for there be so many island up here we can not possibly go to all and i think we have notice the most important dora south polynesia then papua or new guinea be my portion and it happen to lie near the pelew isle it be suppose to be the first part of australium discover by european and be the favorite residence of the superb and singular bird of paradise of which there be ten or twelve kind there be three kind reckon the most gorgeous : viz the king which have two detach feather parallel to the tail end in a elegant curl with a tuft : the magnificent which have also two detach feather of the same length with the body very slender and end in a tuft : the golden throat which have three long and straight feather proceed from each side of the head these bird be consider the best but they be all array in brilliant color and all superbly magnificent they be catch chiefly in the aroo isle either by means of bird-lime or shoot with blunt arrow after be dry with smoke and sulphur they be sell for nut or piece of iron and carry to bunda emma the new hebride be in my course but the friendly isle be allot to I mrs wilton nevertheless the new hebride claim a few word they be discover in 1506 and so name by captain cook they be considerably hilly and well clothe with timber the valley be extremely abundant produce fig nutmeg and orange besides the fruit common to the rest of polynesium the inhabitant present the most ugly specimen extant of the papuan race the man wear no cover and the woman who be use as mere beast of burden wear only a petticoat make from the plantain leaf they canoe be more rudely construct than in most of the other island and on the whole these people seem to be among the most degrade of the islander of the pacific emma i should not like to live with such people therefore we will pass on to my _ friendly _ island they be low and encircle by dangerous coral reef the soil be almost throughout exceedingly rich produce with very little care the banana bread-fruit and yam the population may amount to about 90000 but the native though favorably mention by captain cook appear to be as treacherous savage and superstitious as any in the worst part of polynesium the wesleyan missionary establish themselves in these island in 1821 and be report to have meet with considerable success the lead island be that which be call tongataboo or the ` consecrated island ' the name be properly two word ` tonga taboo ' signify ` sacred island ' the reason of which appellative will appear when i tell you that the priest of this island whose name be diatonga be reverenced and resort to by all the surround island earthquake be very frequent here but the island display a spectacle of the most abundant fertility the foundation of this group be coral rock and there be scarcely any other kind of stone to be find tongataboo have a large and excellent harbor which admit of be well fortified grandy you wisely pass the feejee emma and i will explain why i say _ wisely _ they have the reputation of be cannibal but they be industrious and at time kindly and they island be tolerably fertile a missionary ship be nearly lose here in broad daylight and calm weather by come in contact with a reef of which no previous warning be present george my child you be next what have you select for you display george the society island grandy they consist of six large and several smaller island the principal be call otaheite or more properly tahitus which be often style the ` queen of the pacific ' the whole circumference of this royal isle be 180 mile on all side river be see descend in beautiful cascade and the entire land be clothe from the water 's edge to its topmost height with continual verdure which for luxuriance and picturesque effect be certainly unparalleled charle excuse I interrupt you george but how do you contrive to remember all those long word mr wilton i have hear of honorable member be take to task for ignorance but never for possess superior ability and i suggest that the learn member be allow to proceed with he account without further interruption george there charle you be call to ` order ' and i hope you will not commit yourself again by try to break the thread of my narrative charle i be full of contrition pray proceed and i trust you will find no great difficulty in join you _ thread _ again if you be dispose to retaliate i give you free permission to criticize I to any extent when my turn come george never fear but i will watch for a opportunity the society islander be light-hearted merry and fond of social enjoyment but at the same time indolent deceitful thievish and addict to the excessive use of ardent spirit the highest ambition of a otaheitan be to have a splendid ` morai ' or family tomb the funeral especially those of the chief have a solemn and affect character song be sing the mourner with shark ' tooth draw blood from they body which as it flow mingle with they tear a apron or _ maro _ of red feather be the badge of royal dignity and great deference be pay to the chief these people manufacture handsome cloth and mat but the commerce consist of pearl-shell sugar cocoa-nut oil and arrow-root in exchange for european manufacture be carry on chiefly by foreigner as the native have no vessel larger than they double canoe otaheite be a fine place but not so important a commercial station as oahu in the sandwich island there charle i be at the end of my thread grandy and very well you have spin it george but as you have not inform we on the subject of the religion of these islander i presume it be unknown to you they believe in a sort of deity that he reside in the palace of heaven with a number of other divinity who be all designate ` child of the night ' the form of christian worship be enforce here as rigidly as in the sandwich island but civilization be considerably less advanced although i be happy to add in conclusion that the people be undergo a remarkable change and christianity be certainly gain ground for the idol be be destroy and the labor of the zealous missionary be now sanction by the highest authority we will make no more remark on the society island for they have form the subject of more writings perhaps than many a kingdom of europe and the otaheitan be positively better know to we than the inhabitant of sardinium or corsica george thanks dear grandy for wind up my subject so beautifully now friend charle perhaps you will spin _ you _ yarn charle most willingly but it will be a short one as i have very little material pitcairn 's island stand alone near the eastern extremity of polynesium it be chiefly interesting on account of its have be the refuge of the mutinous crew of captain bligh 's ship the ` bounty ' the mutineer after have turn they captain and a few of the crew out in a open boat try to make a settlement in the society island but fail they accompany by some otaheitan fix themselves in this isolate spot they land here in 1790 fifteen man and twelve woman nine of the man be mutineer all the other be otaheitan captain beachey visit the island in 1825 and find about sixty person on it the descendant of captain bligh 's man pitcairn 's isle be a little spot not more than seven mile in circumference with a abrupt rocky coast i believe the reason there be so few person on the island be account for by the dismal fate of the original settler the sailor have marry otaheitan woman whose brother in one night murder they only one escape whose name be adam on the follow night the otaheitan widow of the english inflict dreadful vengeance by murder all they brother who have commit the first frightful deed they child grow up under the foster care of adam who officiate as a sort of patriarch the present population comprise about eighty individual who form a interesting link between the european and polynesian race mr wilton in a bermuda paper of August 1848 there be a interesting letter from a school-master name nobb which be so replete with information that i will read it all to you as it be not so remarkable for its length as its interest : -- more than twenty year ago i leave england for the express purpose of visit pitcairn 's island and to remain there if i could render my talent available to the inhabitant the proprietor of a small vessel of but eighteen ton ' burthen hearing I express my anxiety to obtain a passage to pitcairn 's island remark it be a spot he have long desire to visit and if i would assist he in fitting out he vessel he would go with I i accept he proposal advance he what money i could command and embark from callao de lima with no other person than the owner of the little cutter and in six week arrive here -lrb- pitcairn 's island -rrb- in safety ` five month after my arrival john adams depart this life after he decease the superintendence of the spiritual affair of the island and the education of the child devolve on I chiefly and from that time to the present -lrb- with the exception of ten month during which period i be banish from the island by brute force and recall by letter of penitential apology -rrb- i have be with they and have live to see the labor of my hand prosper for there be not a person on the island between the age of six year and twenty-five who have not receive or be not receive a tolerable education ` there be one untoward but prominent object on the horizon of paternal affection and which though imperceptibly yet rapidly approach we increase colony and that be the imperious necessity of a separation for so very limited be the available portion of the island that some family who number ten or twelve person have not five acre of arable land to divide among they ` animal food be a luxury obtain with difficulty once or twice in the week and though we have by dint of very hard labor be enable to obtain cloth and other indispensable necessaries from whale-ship in exchange for potato yet this resource be begin to fail we not from scarcity of visitor but from inability on we part to supply they ` this be the exact state of affair at present : how much it will be aggravate ten year from this may be imagine but can not be fully realize even by ourselves whether the british government will again interest itself in we behalf be doubtful if it do not despite the most assiduous industry a scanty allowance of potato and salt must be the result and the tibuta and maro will be the unchanging food and raiment of the rise generation ' george what a pity the coral insect have not be at work there and enlarged these poor people ' island then they could have all remain together and bring up they family as it be some _ must _ migrate charle you be very ingenious can not you contrive a plan for overcome these difficulty charle much as i should glory in benefit mankind i could not by any effort or sacrifice ameliorate the condition of these poor people although i would willingly do anything in my power to testify my sorrow for they wretched destitution dora i fear none of we can accord they more than we sympathy so we must need journey on to the marquesa which be discover by the spaniard in 1595 there be thirteen the largest nukahiva be about seventy mile in circumference and be the only one generally frequent by ship the coast scenery be neither picturesque nor invite its principal feature be black naked cliff or barren hill but in the interior be grassy plain and forest fill with bird of elegant plumage the inhabitant with regard to personal beauty be superior to most of the polynesian tribe some of the woman be almost as fair as a european in civilization however they be far behind the sandwich islander they have steadily resist all attempt to convert they to christianity and have practice cannibalism within a very recent period the tattooing of the marquesan be remarkable for its regularity and good taste charle you call they marquesan dora i think they be kannak dora so they denominate themselves : but i have more to tell you yet they be all excellent swimmer man woman and child they throw themselves fearlessly into the water several time a day and although in a state of perspiration they suffer no harm they be also dexterous climber of tree make the ascent like monkey with the hand and foot only but they treatment of they sick be in the highest degree cruel and unnatural instead of give assistance every one shun the invalid and if he be think to be at all in the way he be take to some distant spot whither it be think sufficient to carry he food at interval it be also they custom to prepare the die man 's coffin before he eye and what be still more incredible when they see he about to render up he last sigh they place a bit of moistened ` tapa ' -lrb- 17 -rrb- in he mouth whilst the finger of some _ friend _ be employ in close the lip and nostril -lrb- footnote 17 : tapa be a species of stuff make from the inner bark of the mulberry-tree -rrb- grandy all this appear very unfeeling to we my dear but cruelty be not the intention of the poor kannak they believe that the soul escape with the parting breath and they desire be to secure the spirit within the body until the body waste when accord to they doctrine it animate another body which during the process of decomposition in the old one have be create in a far distant island where all the good thing of this life be find in abundance and the soul fly thither as soon as its old habitation be destroy emma poor people what a lamentable state of ignorance how i pity they be there any more miserable people to be visit here charles well here be the low island to the south of the marquesan but i have not the pleasure of a acquaintance with the people therefore i can not say if they be happy or miserable gambium crescent and clermont isle be the principal gambium contain upward of a thousand inhabitant crescent isle be not very fertile and occupy by a few native who have erect little hut they and procure a scanty subsistence mr barraud those island be discover by the ship ` duff ' when on a missionary voyage in the year 1797 we shall have to retrace we step to come to the large island in we chart but easter island be so near it may be as well to call although we may gain nothing by the visit for it be a sterile spot inhabit by demi-savage who worship small wooden deity they tattoo themselves so as to have the appearance of wear breeches most of they go naked some few wear a _ maro _ which be make either of fine indian cloth of a reddish color of a wild kind of parsley or of a species of sea-weed george there be more small island before we go to new zealand or australium and i have a account of one -- viz new caledonium lie south-west of the new hebride it be rather a large island rocky for the most part and there not be much food for animal very few be find there one however must be mention it be a spider call a ` nookee ' which spin a thread so strong as to offer a sensible resistance before break this animal -lrb- for i have discover that a spider be not a insect -rrb- constitute part of the people 's food the inhabitant be cannibal from _ taste _ they eat with a air of luxurious pleasure the muscular part of the human body and a slice of a child be esteem a great dainty horrible wretch they wear no clothes the woman just have a girdle of fibrous bark and the man sometimes encircle they head with a fillet of sew net-work or leave and the hair of the vampire bat they house be in the form of beehive and the door-post be of carve plank dora new zealand almost the antipode of england lie in the south pacific and consist of two large island the extreme point of which be call north and south cape near north cape be norfolk island where the english at one time have a flourishing colony now remove to van dieman 's land we must all help to work we ship round these larger island for no individual can be responsible for the entire management mr wilton i will set the example new zealand be discover by tasman in 1642 but its extent and character be ascertain by cook in he voyage of 1774 it be now a regularly established colony belong to the british crown there be a bishop several clergyman of the church of england and many other missionary resident there it be a fertile group but contain several active volcano in the north island or new ulster be various cavity which appear to be extinct crater and in they vicinity numerous hot spring be to be meet with some of they as they rise to boiling point the native use for cooking grandy the new zealander belong to the malay family : they be a fine handsome race and possess fewer of the vice of the savage than almost any other savage people the missionary have be eminently successful in the conversion of the native to christianity the first establishment form there be commence in the bay of island at a village call rangiona in 1814 the person be send out by the church missionary society and have never relax in they endeavor to promote the laudable work of convert the heathen native from the error of they superstition although they have have numerous difficulty to overcome they go out in the strength of the lord resolve to do nothing in strife or vain-glory but all in lowliness of mind esteem other better than themselves : and they succeed notwithstanding the numerous hindrance for the work be of god and he give they power to do all thing without murmur in order to attain the salvation of the soul of they fellow-creature mr barraud the bay of island be quite in the north and have be for the last thirty year the favorite resort of whale-ship upward of thirty vessel have be anchor there at the same time and at this bay the chief intercourse between european vessel and new zealand have principally take place numerous island be sprinkle over the space and several creek or entrance of river penetrate the surrounding country it be on the north and west side of this bay that the principal territory of shunghee the new zealand chief who visit this country be situate and in these spot the horrid rite of this superior race of savage have also be witness mr wilton it be remarkable that when new zealand be first discover there be no animal whatever on the island except a few species of lizard which quadruped the inhabitant hold in great veneration and terror even the rat and dog be introduce by european and the rat be at present the principal species of _ game _ a good many parrot parroquet wild duck pigeon of large size and fine flavor inhabit the forest and poultry be find to thrive very well though not yet rear to any great extent indeed if we except they prisoner of war -lrb- for the new zealander _ be _ cannibal -rrb- almost the only animal food hitherto use by they have be fish which abound around they coast george they must be right glad that european have visit they charle i understand that when pig be first introduce into new zealand the native not know what animal they be nor what be they use mount two and forthwith ride they to death they have see some horse on board captain cook 's vessel and suppose the pig to be for the same purpose mr wilton the new zealander be a fine race but not exempt from vice they do not regard lie or steal as crime and be remarkable for they propensity to make use of these qualification on every available occasion captain cook relate a instance which will give you a tolerable idea of the native character : -- he have be purchase a great quantity of fish from the native he say ` while we be on the traffic they show a great inclination to pick my pocket and to take away the fish with one hand which they have just give I with the other this evil one of the chief undertake to remove and with fury in he eye make a show of keep the people at a proper distance i applaud he conduct but at the same time keep so good a look-out as to detect _ he _ pick my pocket of a handkerchief which i suffer he to put in he bosom before i seem to know anything of the matter and then tell he what i have lose he seem quite ignorant and innocent until i take it from he then he put it off with a laugh act he part with so much address that it be hardly possible to be angry with he so we remain good friend and he accompany I on board to dinner ' emma but they be better now be they not mr wilton very slightly in these point my dear and still less so as regard they superstition generation to come may be free from these vice but at present they be too deeply root to be discard altogether they have some curious and simple notion peculiar to themselves and some extraordinary legend concern natural object of earth sea and sky they account for the appearance of the face in the moon thus : -- they say ' a native girl name rona go with a calabash to fetch water the moon hide she pale beam behind dark and sweeping cloud the maid vex at this uncourteous behavior pronounce a curse on the celestial orb but as a punishment for so do she stumble and fall the moon descend -- raise the maid from the ground and take she to reside on high in she realm of silvery light ' mr barraud a curious idea : they have many such i remember a anecdote of a chief who lose a son for whom he grieve greatly but one day a european meet he and observe he be very merry : he accost he and inquire the cause of so sudden a discontinuance of he grief the chief reply he have pass a bush some few day previously when he late son who have insert himself into the body of a little tikan bird whistle to he and bid he dry up he tear as he feel perfectly satisfy with the quarter he then occupy ` shall i grieve at he happiness ' add the old man dora there be a sweet simplicity about that little story which prepossess I in favor of these new zealander although they be once such horrible cannibal do they not tattoo very much mr wilton the art of tattooing have be bring to such perfection here that it actually excite admiration it be look upon as answer the same purpose as clothes when a chief throw off he mat he seem as proud of display the beautiful ornament figure on he skin as a civilized dandy do of he fashionable attire mr earle speak of a man name aranghie a professor of the art of tattooing thus : -- ` he be consider by he countryman a perfect master in the art and man of the highest rank and importance be in the habit of travel long journey in order to put they skin under he skilful hand indeed so highly be he work esteem that i have see many of he drawing exhibit even after death a neighbor of mine very lately kill a chief who have be tattoo by aranghie and appreciate the artist 's work so highly he skin the chieftain 's thigh and cover he cartouch box with it -- i be astonish to see with what boldness and precision aranghie draw he design upon the skin and what beautiful ornament he produce : no rule and compass could be more exact than the line and circle he form so unrivalled be he in he profession that a highly finish face of a chief from the hand of this artist be as greatly prize in new zealand as a head from the pencil of sir thoma lawrence be amongst we such respect be pay to this man by the native that mr earle express the gratification he feel on see the fine art hold in such estimation by the savage mr barraud i do not doubt but the new zealander be still cannibal in heart for so late as 1832 when mr earle be there he unfortunately have ocular proof of the fact he have be reside with they some month when a chief claim one of he -lrb- mr earle 's -rrb- servant state she be a runaway slave he tie she to a tree and shoot she through the heart and he man prepare a oven and cook she mr earle hear of it and hasten to the spot he catch they in the act of prepare some of the poor girl 's flesh and endeavor in vain to prevent the horrible feast but to no purpose for they assemble at night and devour every morsel except the head which he see a hungry dog run off with to the wood the poor girl be only sixteen year of age pretty and well-behaved and she murderer be one of the aristocracy of new zealand and as mr earle observe a remarkably polite savage charle we must bid adieu to these interesting savage and pass on to the last but certainly not the least of the pacific island -- viz australium mr wilton as all land be surround by water and continent differ from island merely in point of size and as australium or new holland be in extent as large as europe and ten time larger than either borneo or new guinea it be certainly more proportionate with continent than with island and it seem reasonable to class australium with the former rather than with the latter mr wilton with australium we close we investigation to use a nautical expression it be compare with europe and asia almost a iron-bound coast it possess only two large indentation -- the gulf of carpentarium on the north and spencer 's gulf on the south shark 's bay on the west and hervey 's bay on the east be the next in size mr wilton new holland be discover by paulmyer de gonville that navigator sail from honfleur for the east indy about the middle of 1503 and experience a violent storm off the cape of good hope during which he lose he reckoning and be drive into a unknown sea after sailing for some time he observe bird fly from the south and direct he course towards that quarter he soon fall in with land this be think to have be new holland or australium mr barraud it be remarkable how extremely ignorant the australian be : they be certainly the lowest in intellect of the human creation the tribe on the western shore of spencer 's bay be positively ignorant of any method of obtain fire : they say that it originally come down from the north like the vestal virgin the woman keep it constantly light and carry it about with they in firestick when they travel : should it happen to go out they procure a fresh supply from a neighbor encampment then they manners be so atrociously savage they mode of courtship be one which i fancy would not become popular among english lady if a chief or any other individual be in love with a damsel of a different tribe he endeavor to waylay she and if she be surprise in any quiet place the ambush lover rush upon she beat she about the head with he ` waddie ' till she become senseless when he drag she in triumph to he hut and thenceforth she be he lawful wife grandy after that you will readily credit the story i be go to tell you a mr meredith go over with he goods to kangaroo island whence he journey across the bay to yankalilly where he build a hut place in it a glass window or two and make it look snug as he be a young man of about twenty-one or twenty-two he warm generous spirit have lead he into difficulty and the friend of he brief sunshine fly from he in he distress he contract a disgust for the world he live some time amongst these people acquire they language and seem to be beloved by they all but volume might be fill with account of they treachery and the sequel will sufficiently prove the malignity of these wretched people he have adopt one of they son and be endeavor to instruct he in a few point of education he have also take a native woman to assist he in household matter one day he go out in he boat and he favorite boy go with he when in the boat the boy complain of hunger and mr meredith give he a biscuit the boy commence eat it when mr meredith -lrb- who be a religious man -rrb- observe that he have not thank the great god for the food -- a practice which he invariably endeavor to inculcate the boy appear unwilling to do so : mr meredith insist and on he refusal he box he ear the boy thereupon leap out of the boat and swim ashore say he should repent it in the evening mr meredith put he boat ashore and go to he hut have he supper and be prepare for bed and take up a prayer-book as be he custom be read the prayer before the fire with he back to the door when some native look through the window see they advantage and open the door silently the woman he attendant then enter with a axe belong to he in she hand and several man follow she she approach the unsuspecting youth and while he soul be devoutly engage in prayer she raise the fatal axe and with one blow sever he skull and the man with they club beat he body into a shapeless mass emma poor mr meredith what a frightful murder mr wilton the australian think nothing of it for they glory in the most atrocious deed i fear it will be long before they will be civilized but let we look at they country of which in some respects but little can be say for it be not remarkable for its fertility and in many part exceedingly barren but few animal range there and in the south-west the native subsist during the winter chiefly on opossum kangaroo and bandicoot in the summer upon root with occasionally a few fish dora port adelaide appear to be a neat town its harbor be a deep creek or inlet of the sea run out of gulf st vincent : it contain two spacious wharf alongside of which vessel from great britain singapore manilla china mauritius sydney hobart town and new zealand be continually discharge they cargo mr wilton there be many lake in australium but none of they very large lake alexandrium be the largest but it be very shallow and lake st george the second in size which in 1828 be a sheet of water 17 mile long by 7 broad be say by a old native female to have be a forest within she memory and in 1836 it be dry up to a grassy plain emma do not van dieman 's land belong to new holland mamma mr wilton yes my dear and the part nearest to it be new south wale from which it be separate by bass 's strait which be 100 mile broad and contain a great many small island van dieman 's land be discover by tasman in 1644 and name by he in honor of the dutch governor-general of the east indy : but it be now more appropriately call tasmanium this island contain several mountain of considerable elevation the highest be ascertain to be 3964 foot in height hobart town be the capital the population of tasmanium have of late year much increase for owe to its eligibility the tide of emigration have be strong for many year three or four vessel have annually sail from great britain laden with emigrant possess of more or less capital and they have in most case prosper equal to they expectation george be there not more coral reef about australium than in any other part of the ocean mr wilton it be generally suppose so but in ask that question do you know what coral reef be george yes papa they be the work of insect who build they for they habitation but it be very wonderful grandy it be wonderful my dear and there be many other marvellous production of the most high god so infinitely beyond the power of man to produce that in meditate on they the mind be lose in wonder and surprise ` the most powerful acutest and holiest mind ' say a learn divine ` will eternally be unable fully to find out god or perfectly to comprehend he ' may these wonder then increase we reverence and humble we before the mighty creator of all thing mr wilton captain hall examine some coral reef during the different stage of one tide and give the follow description as the result : -- ` when the tide have leave it for some time it become dry and appear to be a compact rock exceedingly hard and rugged but as the tide rise and the wave begin to wash over it the coral worm protrude themselves from hole that be before invisible these animal be of a great variety of shape and size and in such prodigious number that in a short time the whole surface of the rock appear to be alive and in motion the most common worm be in the form of a star with arm from four to six inch long which be move about with a rapid motion in all direction probably to catch food other be so sluggish that they may be mistake for piece of rock and be generally of a dark color from four to five inch long and two or three round when the coral be break about high-water mark it be a solid hard stone but if any part of it be detach at a spot where the tide reach every day it be find to be full of worm of different length and color some be as fine as a thread and several foot long of a bright yellow and sometimes of a blue color other resemble snail and some be not unlike lobster in shape but soft and not above two inch long ' dora we must be content to see these in imagination but sometimes i feel disposed to regret that we be not _ really _ afloat in the ` research ' and at other time i congratulate myself that the voyage be only imaginary for in polynesium particularly we have meet with so many ignorant savage people it be well for we that we can if we choose steer clear of they i suppose it would not be possible in all europe to find a country where such unreasonable thing be do from religious superstition grandy my dear dora you be very much mistaken europe have be and still be in many part a slave to superstition and although not savage there be many vice and iniquitous deed commit in civilized europe which no temptation would induce the savage of polynesium to commit but to assure you mind that horrible crime be perpetrate from zeal in the doctrine of they religion i will give you a instance connect with sweden in olden time the story be tell by a slave girl name kumba thus : -- ` my mother be amongst the slave of queen gunnild : she be the most faithful of she servant poor and heavy be she lot yet do she wish to live my father be a free-born person who think little of forsake the woman who love he and the child she have nurse for he i remember a night -- that night have stretch itself over my whole life flame arise from a pile : they ascend high into heaven it be the corpse of the queen which be burn my mother be amongst those who tend the pile : she with many other be cast alive into the flame the queen it be say need she attendance in another world i stand amongst the people still a child and hear my mother 's cry and see she burn fatherless and motherless i go thence into the world alone and wander in the wood without know whither there come people who seize I and carry I back to the court of king atle they say that i wish to run away and i be conduct to the presence of the king i answer haughtily to he question and he cause I to be whip till the blood come : in punishment as he say of my disobedience ' be not that barbarous enough for a savage land dora dora oh yes madam that be very shocking poor unhappy kumba what a life of wretchedness be hers mr wilton grandy 's story must conclude we conversation to-night at the next meeting we will endeavor to explore the coast of africa and visit the island of the indian ocean carry away the book boy : i be sure you must all be hungry and tired too for we have be over a immense space of water right gaily we bark 's glide over the ocean bright nature we have view in majestic array but we own native shore we greet with emotion for the heart of a briton exult in she sway chapter vii they journey at night in the pale moonlight ` mid sunshine and storm on they sail would baffle wind and still calm cause we friend no alarm for faith ever fearless prevail would it be of no use emma : i can not do it girl be certainly a most persevering race of being and you deserve to be at the top of the class for if you determine to accomplish anything i believe not even mr stanley 's knock at the door or what would be more to you dora leslie 's loving kiss would make you swerve from you purpose ah well you be quite welcome to the work and if you be not tired i know _ i _ be and these very _ important _ article may remain unpacked for the trouble i shall take i wonder you be so particular about they : what signify how they be put in if you can but shut the box it can be of no consequence and yet you have be on you knee for the last two hour arrange and place until i be positively weary with watch you george george where be you boast patience you fellow traveller in you anticipated voyage only see what a trifling exertion make you weary and complain now suppose i act accord to you sage proposition and merely fill the trunk we can then both jump on the lid and _ make _ it shut -- what think you would be the effect george well my most patient sister i think it very probable that my microscope would be smash to atom and all you little knick knack reduce to a similar condition but surely there be no necessity for such violent means to secure the lid : let I see i have no doubt it will shut quite easily there you see it will not shut say emma as george in vain endeavor by moderate pressure to bring the lid to its proper place now the thing _ must _ be arrange differently and if you will only help I this once we shall have do before dora or mr stanley or any one else knock at the door : come be my own good brother and lay all these parcel carefully on the floor while i find place for they emma look so irresistibly kind and coax that george once more good humoredly set to work and presently the carpet be strew with package apparently sufficient to fill three such trunk but which emma be determine should be snugly pack into one the article might almost be arrange alphabetically there be such a miscellaneous collection but the variety in they size and shape render it actually a puzzle to dispose they so as to allow space for all without the hazard of any portion be crushed perseverance overcome difficulty say emma as she carefully deposit the last paper and turn the key in the lock hurrah shout george now we have do it well really i do not think it possible : only imagine the number of parcel in that one trunk emma what a treat it will be when we get to jamaica to unpack it all again oh dear how i wish we be there miss emma you be want say hannah enter the room mistress can not find the book that come to-day and she want to pack they up ah it be nothing but _ pack up _ now all day and every room be in confusion say george wearily well i be glad we share be at a end for _ this _ day for i be heartily tire of the business and shall be thoroughly glad when there be nothing more leave to _ pack up _ oh master george how impatient you be exclaim hannah but come you have no time to be grumble now only look at you dirty finger and dinner will be ready in five minute : why you will scarcely be wash before the bell ring and the anxious maid bustle out of the room with she weary charge the mention of mr stanley 's name require a explanation on the previous evening when mr wilton return from he office he bring with he a letter which he put into george 's hand after tea desire he to read it aloud it be from mr stanley and george almost shout for joy when he read that he dear dear friend be then at liverpool and hope to be with they the next day to dinner what a grand muster we shall have to-night george say mr wilton while they be wait the arrival of they expect guest why we shall not find sufficient subject for so many speaker shall we oh yes papa emma and i have be too busy _ pack up _ to prepare much besides mr stanley be sure to have a great deal to tell : he have be away so long and see strange country all the while but there he be i see he pass the window and away run george to embrace he beloved friend what bright eye and rosy cheek exclaim mr stanley kiss he pet my boy have indeed grow since i be here : why you will soon reach my shoulder i suppose when next i come i must inquire for mr wilton junior but where be sister emma and mamma and papa and dear kind grandy oh they be all in the dining-room reply george : we be only wait for you sir into the dining-room they go accordingly and the welcome guest be soon engage equally with the rest of the party in discuss a hearty meal and the various event that have take place during he absence the hour fly like moment and the arrival of the other member quite astonished george who have no idea it be so near seven o'clock he be in high glee as he assist charle in place the chair and book but when mr stanley take he hand request _ permission _ to sit by he side the proud and happy boy look doubtingly into he face not thoroughly comprehend the drift of the request i be anxious to have the service of a experienced pilot through the stormy sea say mr stanley and if you be by my side george to direct I i think i can manage to steer clear of difficulty now you be joke return george : why you have positively be to these very country and yet apply to _ I _ for direction but i understand the reason you intend to make observation on subject _ not _ geographical and i expect you will be keep a sharp look-out on _ my _ observation to discover what progress i have make lately mr stanley i perceive already that there be a decide improvement my boy and i candidly aver that i expect to be edify by these juvenile discovery now to business -- weigh anchor and start who be pilot charle i have charge of the ` research ' for the present but i be not a experienced navigator and if i happen to run you on a shoal i hope all hand will help to get the vessel clear off mr barraud we will make due allowance for you youth and inexperience charle now give you order charle the first voyage we be to navigate the indian ocean call on as many robinson cruso as we can find in the various little island : we second voyage be to explore the whole coast of africa we ship be last at anchor off the coast of new holland and we next stoppage will be at the molucca the name signify ` royal island ' and be give by the arab in the day of they maritime prosperity the principal be celebe gililo and ceram dora emma and george have patronize those isle and will set forth they various qualification dora celebe be the largest of the molucca and be a ragged irregular-looking island in shape similar to a star-fish the inhabitant be render active industrious and robust by a austere education at all hour of the day the mother rub they child with oil or water and thus assist nature in form they constitution at the age of five or six the male child of person of rank be put in charge of a friend that they courage may not be weaken by the caress of relative and habit of reciprocal tenderness they do not return to they family until they attain the age at which the law declare they fit to marry celebe be first discover by the portuguese in 1512 but the dutch expel they in 1660 and it now belong to they unlike most of the other island it abound in extensive grassy plain free from forest which be look upon as the common property of the tribe who dwell thereon and be carefully guard from the intrusion of alien the people be mohammedan george gililo be celebe in miniature being of the same singular shape and produce similar fruit i have little more of its advantage to set forth but near here be a portion of the ocean call molucca sea which possess a strange peculiarity it be the periodical appearance of a current of opaque white water like milk which from June to August or September cover the surface of the basin in which the banda island be situate during the night it be somewhat luminous which make the spectator confound it with the horizon it be dangerous for vessel for the sea seem to undergo a inward boiling agitation wherever it pass during its prevalence the fish disappear this white water be suppose to come from the shore of new guinea and the gulf of carpentarium mr stanley you be slightly wrong george in state this curious sea to be near gililo gililo be _ on _ the equator and the molucca sea be at least 5 ° _ below _ the equator and directly south of ceram emma ceram produce quantity of sago and contain large forest of those tree : they be extremely profitable for one tree will sometimes yield as much as five or six hundred pound of sago the original inhabitant be call alfoor and as some of the race still exist i will introduce they the only dress of the man be a girdle encircle the loin they fix bunch of palm leave to they head shoulder and knee and wear square buckler which they ornament with considerable taste the eyesight of these people be uncommonly acute and they swiftness be such as to enable they to chase the wild hog with success rat and serpent form part of they food this island be equally fertile with the other molucca and produce spice of all kind but particularly clove and nutmeg there be happily more christian now to be find in ceram than there be a few year since : nevertheless the majority be still mohammedan and barbarous in they habit mr barraud yes very little improvement have take place in the manners of the alfoor the young man even to this day adhere to the savage practice of propitiate they intended wife by present they with the head of five or six of they enemy in order to seize they victim by surprise they lie in ambush in the wood cover themselves with moss and hold branch of tree in they hand which they shake in a manner so natural that they have the appearance of real tree : they then allow the enemy to pass assassinate he by come up behind he and cut off he head carry it away as a trophy these murderer be receive by the people of the village with all the honor of a barbarous triumph mr stanley these identical alfoor have a singular method of evince they respect for friend or visitor : as a instance : one of the king -lrb- for the nation have _ three _ to share the government -rrb- invite a dutch missionary to a entertainment when mr montarne arrive he be receive with great demonstration of joy and treat by the king with the most splendid repast that the resource of the country could afford when the meal be over the king order a number of man arm with sword to step forward they perform a war-dance and after a few feat of this sort commence a serious fight : they sword clash blood flow and some of they body be lay dead on the ground the peaceful minister of religion shock at the horrid spectacle entreat the king to put a stop to it ` it be nothing ' be the reply : ` they be my slave it be only the death of a few dog happy shall i be if this mark of my high respect convince you of my eager desire to please you ' grandy astonishing that people with any belief in a superior power should hold life in such low estimation and simply for amusement deprive a fellow-creature of that which they utmost stretch of power can not restore oh may god in he mercy soon enlighten these wretched alfoor and write in plain character on the table of they heart -- ` thou shalt do no murder ' charle we now come to java one of the finest and most flourishing colony in the world it be about 600 mile in length and 90 mile average breadth almost entirely volcanic therefore metal and precious stone be not to be expect iron be not to be find in java indeed it be extremely rare in the whole archipelago consequently it bear a high price and the art of the blacksmith be hold in a sort of reverence the term for a son of the anvil signify ` learn ' the inhabitant of this island trace they origin to a monkey which they call ` woo-woo ' they be for the most part mohammedan but not strict as they will not hesitate to drink wine at the religious festival mr wilton the javanese be remarkable for they veracity and love of music : they ear be so delicate that they readily learn to play the most difficult and complex air on any instrument they be remarkable also for they superstition and people they forest cave and mountain with numerous invisible being of they own creation i will quote two instance of whimsical superstition which take place in java about thirty year ago the skull of a buffalo be conduct from one end of the island to the other this skull be to be keep in constant motion for a dreadful fate be to await the individual who detain it in he possession or allow it to rest after travel many hundred mile it reach samarang where the dutch governor cause it to be throw into the sea no person could tell how this originate but no person refuse to obey while the skull be on _ terra firma _ again in 1814 a smooth road fifty or sixty mile long and twenty foot broad lead to the top of a inland mountain call sumbong be suddenly form cross no river but pass in a undeviating line through private property of all description the population of whole district be employ in the labor and all because a old woman dream that a divine personage be to descend on the mountain oh how very ridiculous exclaimed charle such silly people deserve to be impose upon for not use the faculty they possess to greater advantage grandy when once superstition usurp the throne of reason charle it be a difficult task to displace she there be so many please fallacy connect with she sway over the naturally indolent mind of man that reason be altogether banish and superstition 's authority know no bound mr stanley java produce in great abundance the _ hirundo esculenta _ a species of swallow whose nest be use as a article of luxurious food among the chinese this nest have the shape of a common swallow 's nest and the appearance of ill-connected isinglass the bird always build in the cave of the rock at a distance from any human dwelling along the sea-shore these nest be particularly abundant the cavern there be more frequent the finest be those obtain before the nest have be contaminate by young bird some of the cavern be very difficult of access and dangerous to climb so that none can collect the nest but person accustom to the trade from they youth george oh yes i remember all the particulars of that business we be tell at one of we meeting but i do not care to taste they : it be both nasty and cruel to eat bird 's - nest charle sumatra be next to borneo the largest island in the eastern sea it be situate in the midst of the torrid zone be upward of 1000 mile long nearly 200 in breadth and be divide from java by the strait of sunda the sumatran be a well-made people with yellow complexion sometimes incline to white they have some of the custom of the south sea islander amongst other those barbarous practice of flatten the nose and compress the head of child newly-born whilst the skull be yet soft or _ cartilaginous _ they likewise pull out the ear of infant to make they stand at a angle from the head they file blacken and otherwise disfigure the tooth and the great man sometimes set theirs in gold by case the under row with a plate of that metal george be sumatra a gold country why say mr wilton smile have you never hear of the gold of mount ophir well that be the name of the highest mountain in sumatra george then there be gold in sumatra and i suppose it be wash down by the river be there any other metal there mr wilton gold be the most abundant but saltpetre and naphtha be among the product quantity of rice be grow here and a singular method be adopt for separate the grain from the ear the bunch of paddy be spread on mat and the sumatran rub out the grain under they foot support themselves for the more easy performance of this labor by hold with they hand a bamboo place horizontally over they head -lrb- illustration : a water spout -rrb- charle i should hope they wash the rice after this process : although as rice be so dry they doubtless consider it unnecessary : i find sumatra be a foggy island and contain only one important kingdom -- viz acheen mr barraud fog be not its worst calamity : thunder-storm and water-spout off the coast be very frequent george what produce water-spout mr barraud dr franklin suppose that water-spout and whirlwind proceed from the same cause a fluid move from all part horizontally towards a center must at that center either mount or descend if a hole be open in the bottom of a tub fill with water the water will flow from all side to the center and there descend in a whirl but air flow in or near the surface of land or water from all side towards a center must at that center ascend because the land or water will hinder its descent mr wilton as charle state acheen with regard to business transaction be the only place of note in the island of sumatra the inhabitant have no coin but make they payment in gold dust which they keep in divide parcel contain in piece of bladder and these be weigh by the person who take they in payment they have some odd form about they for instance in _ marriage _ and _ burial _ the bride be bargain for with the parent and if settle satisfactorily the young couple partake together of two different sort of rice and the ceremony be conclude by the father of the lady throw a piece of cloth over they when a man of rank die he body be keep in a coffin for several month the soft part dissolve during that interval be convey in a fluid state by a bamboo tube from the bottom of the coffin into the earth emma how very disgusting and how very unwholesome for the relative of the decease in such a hot country too i wonder the inhabitant do not all die from infection mr stanley these practice do vastly increase the mortality but old custom be not easily abolish do you sail as far north as the bay of bengal charle charle no sir all that portion of the ocean have be navigate : we next island be borneo mr stanley but i suppose there would be no objection to my put in a word on the burman empire which probably you be not _ much _ acquaint with part of it be in the same longitude as the north of sumatra and i merely wish to mention some peculiarity connect with the burmese the government be entirely despotic and the sovereign almost deify when anything belong to he be mention the epithet ` golden ' be invariably attach to it when he be say to have hear anything ` it have reach the golden ear : ' the perfume of rose be describe as grateful to the ` golden nose ' the sovereign be sole proprietor of all the elephant in he dominion and the privilege to keep or ride on one be only grant to man of the first rank no honor here be hereditary all officer and dignity depend on the crown the ` tsaloë ' or chain be the badge of nobility and superiority of rank be signify by the number of cord or division george be it true that they be a proud consequential people mr stanley yes quite true man of rank have they barge tug by war-boat common waterman not be admit into the same boat with they a singularly absurd custom take place in this country in certain form of political homage show to a white elephant -- a preternatural animal keep for the purpose -- superbly lodge near the royal palace sumptuously dress and feed provide with functionary like a second sovereign hold next in rank to the king and superior to the queen and make the recipient of present and other token of respect from foreign ambassador charle well that _ be _ a odd superstition i be much oblige to you for go out of the track to tell we these strange ` saying and doings ' of the burmese be we now to resume we station mr wilton you be pilot charle we rely on you guidance go where you please : we be not to control you movement charle then like sir jame brooke i will go to borneo but i do not expect to be make a rajah for my trouble : indeed i scarcely know if i should like to live there although it be the largest island in the world and be very fertile and contain diamond mine and vast quantity of gold mr stanley by-the-by that remind I of the fact that the petty prince of mattan in borneo be in possession of one of the largest diamond in the world it be obtain a hundred year ago from the mine of landak and be worth 269378_l _ emma which be the other large diamond mr wilton the great russian diamond which be value at 304200_l _ and the great pitt diamond value at 149605_l _ but we be depart from we subject borneo be next to new holland the largest island in the world it be 900 mile long and 700 broad dora when do sir jame brooke go to borneo and what be he object in go mr wilton in August 1839 he anchor off borneo and he object be purely philanthropic he go to spread abroad the glorious truth of christianity -- to arouse the slumbering energy of these interesting people -- to increase trade -- to suppress piracy -- and to gain information for the profit of he own native land such be he principal motive particulars of he success of the benefit he have confer on thousand of he fellow-creature and of he travels and adventure may be see in he own publish journal to more advantage than i can possibly set they before you mr barraud since sir jame brooke 's visit the dido and several other vessel of war have cruise in the asiatic archipelago all tend to suppress piracy and encourage native trade and commerce the island of labuan off the north-west of borneo have be cede to england and sir jame brooke appoint agent for the british government -- a appointment which confer on he additional power and influence besides which the sultan have nominate he rajah of sarawak thus in the course of a few year have a complete revolution be work in one of the finest portion of we globe and a new and better system of thing be establish all through the enlighten and philanthropic energy of a single individual charle borneo be the chief of the sunda group be extremely fertile produce all sort of tropical fruit and various spice and drug much of the interior be cover by immense forest inhabit by wild animal and aboriginal tribe of human being almost as wild it be in borneo that the largest of the monkey tribe the ponga equal the human race in stature be to be find also the ourang-outang or simium satyrus which come nearer to man in he look manners and gait some writer assert that these animal light fire at which they broil they fish and rice but these account be not verify by recent observer wild bee be so numerous here that they wax form a very extensive article of export mr wilton borneo be call by the native pulo kalamantan borneo be the name of a city the residence of a powerful prince in 1520 when magellan go there : hence the spaniard conclude that the whole island belong to this prince and they call it all borneo there be a great many tribe of indian in this large island and the sea-coast be inhabit by malayan of whom sir jame brooke speak in the higher term as regard honesty cleanliness & c they understand the art of cut polishing and set they diamond gold and silver filigree work they excel in and they be otherwise ingenious but can scarcely be consider industrious dora south-west of sumatra in latitude 12 ° south longitude 97 ° east be the coco or keel island which be entirely coralline in they formation very fertile with a salubrious climate in 1830 captain ross and alexander hare esq undertake to cultivate these island and render they productive they succeed and they now form a fine settlement charle i shall feel greatly oblige if mr stanley will take the helm and steer we across the indian ocean for there be such hundred i might almost say thousand of island that i feel convinced i shall run you all ashore where none of you be dispose to go mr stanley come then i will relieve you for a while because it would be most unpleasantly awkward for the lady to be cast ashore on a desert island and equally so on a inhabit one if they possess no letter of introduction to the native in cross the indian ocean we must sail by a great many island but i do not think it will be prudent to go ashore until we arrive at the isle of bourbon and there we can pass a few day very comfortably before we sail for madagascar emma oh yes bourbon be quite a civilized island it belong to the french do it not mamma mr wilton yes my dear but the discovery be not theirs mascarenha a portuguese navigator claim the credit he discover it in 1545 and it bear he name until the french take possession of it in the next century when they first occupy it the side of the mountain be cover with forest which reach even to the shore the whole of the lower land have since be clear but the center of this island be still cover with its primitive vegetation which afford forty-one different species of wood serviceable for art and manufacture the coast abound with fish and large turtle and furnish also coral and ambergris bourbon contain a college and numerous school sixteen church two hospital two establishment for the relief of the poor and two prison mr barraud why be we to take no notice of the fine colony of mauritius or isle of france it be quite as large as bourbon : moreover it be a british possession mr stanley i see no just cause or impediment why we should not land there let we see what be its size charle its circumference be about 140 mile port loui be its principal town and be say to contain 30000 inhabitant it have a excellent harbor capable of contain 50 large vessel and it be well protect by nature from the violence of the weather and from the attack of enemy by strong fortification george now to madagascar i be longing to go there for i know nothing about either country or people mr wilton madagascar be a large and beautiful island with mountain valley lake and stream diversify its whole extent it be between 800 and 900 mile long and between 200 and 300 broad the metal dig here be gold silver copper steel and iron and a great variety of precious stone be find in the river and brook of madagascar civet be plentiful and be take from the civet cat and the native obtain musk from the crocodile and call it tartave tananarievo the capital stand on the summit of a lofty hill and command a extensive prospect of the surrounding country the principal house be of wood and the palace of the king be about the center of the town enclose in a high palisading of strong pole george if the palace be so homely what can the poor folk ' house be like mr wilton oh they be of wood too but mere hut they have no chimney and the door and window afford the only means of escape for the smoke arise from the fire which be kindle on the floor of the house the soot collect on the inner side of the roof of they dwelling where it be never disturb by the people who consider it a badge of honorable ancestry to have large quantity of soot hanging in long black shred from the roof of they dwelling emma what a dirty badge be they dirty people mr stanley they be not exactly dirty but very slothful and when not compel to exert themselves in husbandry or war they pass they time in sleep they have little thought for the morrow and in fact seem to be a thoroughly contented happy race and so they ought to be in one sense for they be surround by every comfort and even luxury which the hand of nature can produce they characteristic feature be simplicity and they regard the example of they forefather as authority for every action dora they be christian i believe mr wilton i wish i could say they be my dear dora some christian there certainly be in madagascar but the majority be rule by superstition they acknowledge one only true god the creator of heaven and earth and the supreme ruler of the universe and they call he ` ungharry ' or ` zanhare ' which signify the ` highest god ' or ` god above ' they believe he to possess infinite power but they consider he too great a be to condescend to attend to the concern of mortal : they therefore suppose that four inferior spirit be appoint to whom be delegate the affair of the world these be denominate the lord of the north south east and west the east be suppose to be the dispenser of plague and misery to mankind by the command of the great god the other three be employ in the dispensation of benefit besides this they have faith in a _ world _ of spirit and believe that every family have its guardian angel which be generally suppose to be the soul of a particular ancestor and strangely enough although they believe in the immortality of the soul they deny that there can be a future punishment or that the soul can suffer evil after its separation from the body but they assert that bad man will be punish in this world by a complication of misfortune and that the good will be reward by health constancy of friend increase of fortune and obedience of child grandy there be at one period great hope concern madagascar missionary go out and be cordially welcome by the authority although the people from ignorance be hostile but poor creature white man have never visit they shore but to carry away they child and friend to sell they for slave in different part of the world and of course they be very suspicious so much so that when the missionary first endeavor to establish school in madagascar the parent refuse to allow they child to attend allege that the white man want they for no other purpose than to eat they for they attribute all they sorrow to the cannibalism of the white people believe that the slave they capture be catch as wild animal would be only for food they carry they antipathy so far that rather than permit they little one to enter the school they hide they in rice hole where they be often suffocate king radama reign at that time and be a convert himself he naturally desire the conversion of he people he reason with they and prohibit the secretion of the unfortunate child and after a time by god 's blessing the people become aware of the advantage of the school and many be convert from the error of they way and die rejoice in god they savior but radama die also and there arise a sovereign who know not god enemy creep into the fold and endeavor to destroy the good work of the pious missionary they partially succeed and in 1837 these worthy man be oblige to quit madagascar and have never since be able to revisit it with any prospect of success we can not understand why this great work should be allow to fall to the ground but god in he wisdom appear to have withhold he blessing for a season and we must in patience await the issue george the malagass be never cannibal be they mr wilton no they ordinary food consist of the natural produce of the soil principally rice dress in the simplest manner and seasoned with pepper and they usually drink hot water or broth from the boil meat wine of which they make several kind be reserve for the entertainment of they friend on occasion of festivity or ceremony they usual dinner hour be ten in the morning and that of supper four in the afternoon mr stanley although not cannibal they superstition prompt they to many act of cruelty for instance one half of the infant population be murder by the misfortune of be bear on a unlucky day and to prove the truth of the dogma they be deliberately kill one mode of perpetrate this unnatural deed be by take the infant to a retired spot in the neighborhood of the village digging a grave sufficiently large to receive it pour in a quantity of water slightly warm put a piece of cloth upon the infant 's mouth place it in the grave fill this up with earth and leave the helpless child thus bury alive a memorial of they own affect degradation and the relentless barbarism of they gloomy superstition and a painful illustration of the truth of god 's word which declare that ` the dark place of the earth be full of the habitation of cruelty ' mr wilton we can not enlighten these people without help from on high and they circumstance be too melancholy to dwell on let we continue we voyage and pray for they conversion who can inform I how many bay there be around this great island george i can papa there be fourteen on my map and the bay of antongil up in the north-east be the largest mr wilton so it be george and near it lie the island of st mary which once form the principal retreat of the pirate who in the 17th century infested the indian ocean it be a delightful island abound in every necessary of life now i have a droll story to tell you and that will conclude we remark on madagascar #translation of a malagassy fable accounting for the enmity between the crocodile and the dog # a serpent and a young crocodile dwelt in the same part of the country the serpent fix itself in a tree by the water-side and underneath the same tree the young crocodile watch for prey after a time a dog come to drink the crocodile pursue he down come the serpent to stop the crocodile what have you to do with I say the crocodile -- why you be seek to eat everybody that pass this way reply the serpent -- be quiet -- say the crocodile lest i give you a blow with my tail and cut you in two -- and pray what be you ask the serpent : i suppose you be think that because i have neither hand nor foot i can do nothing but perhaps you have not look at _ my _ tail how sharp it be -- cease you noise reply the crocodile or i 'll just break you in two the serpent then become excessively angry strike the crocodile with he tail and wound he loin so as nearly to break he body all the fish be astonished and address the crocodile say how be this -- you that can conquer people and cattle however large and anything else the crocodile ashamed dive out of sight while the serpent resume he place on the tree the crocodile however hope to repay he keep watch for prey after a time there come a goose to the water the crocodile pursued and get hold of he when down come the serpent to stop he as before where be you go cry the crocodile -- let that goose alone say the serpent lest i kill you the crocodile reply contemptuously and the serpent enrage exclaim well this time see if you be not the worse for it and then he strike the crocodile and wound he on the face and make he scream again so he be conquer _ that _ time and the goose get off then all the little fish come again and say to the crocodile how be it that you be beat by that foolish serpent you be wise and powerful and that little fellow cony and beat you completely ashamed again the crocodile hide himself in the water and begin to think by what means he might conquer this serpent upon the tree after think a long time the crocodile determine on bore a hole through the root of the tree and for a whole week he keep on boring presently a dog come to drink afterwards a goose also a man but the crocodile keep at he work the serpent exult in have intimidate he adversary and say ` there be nothing so strong then as i be the crocodile hear he and labor with all he might to finish boring at the root one branch of which remain to cut the crocodile then watch at the water-side a good while when down come the dog to drink : the crocodile pursue he the serpent as before come to oppose he call out let that dog alone there lest you get the worst of it -- you say the crocodile do not fear god yonder dog deceive we and that be the reason i pursue they : as to people i never touch they unless they be guilty of witchcraft i only eat the small thing -- so just let _ I _ alone when the serpent hear that he reply there _ be _ no god for if there be i should have have both hand and foot : there be no god at all but i will have you carcass to-day then the dog and the serpent together make a attack on the crocodile the crocodile get weaker and dive in the water when all the little fish come again and express they astonishment as before that he should be conquer by that little serpent wait a little say the crocodile and you will see i be not conquer by he the serpent get up the tree as usual the crocodile watch -- bore the hole completely -- then look up and see the serpent sound asleep on a branch overhang the water then cut what remain of the root the tree break and fall into the water the serpent fall with it then all the fish acknowledge that the crocodile be superior for he have get the serpent into the water and make he dive in it and keep he under water half-an-hour the serpent however survive it and repent of what he have do oh that i have never oppose you only let I go and i will never attack you again -- ah say the crocodile but as often as i pursue the dog i be pursue by you so you must suffer in you turn thus the crocodile make he heartily repent before he let he go then say the serpent if ever i touch you again may i be conquer after that the crocodile let he go he be glad to get off but he have be beat and take a oath not to renew the attack when the crocodile go to look out for prey the crocodile however owe the dog a grudge because he have attack he and so lay all he family under a curse to devour the dog whenever opportunity offer unless you do that say he may you die without posterity for yonder dog take part with the serpent against I mr stanley well george be you like the serpent have you have enough of the water george oh no i shall be very sorry when the voyage be over mr stanley you have be on the ocean a weary while have you like sir jame ross reach either of the pole george no sir but we have be very near the north pole have we not charle charle yes in the arctic ocean we have be as high as 80 ° parallel of north latitude to spitzbergen and in the antarctic as high as the 66 ° parallel of south latitude to the new south shetland isle mr stanley well do you will not then start any objection on the score of cold to accompany I to kerguelan 's land oh dear no exclaim the boy we do not mind the cold mr stanley kerguelan 's land be discover in 1772 by monsieur de kerguelan a french navigator who take it for a continent and so report it to he government he be send back the following year to make critical examination three year after this captain cook fall in with the island and not find it of any importance call it isle of desolation but despite its name it be not a bad place by any mean it be a safe and commodious harbor and abundance of fresh water however consider its latitude it be exceedingly bare of vegetation and there be only one plant which claim attention that be the famous cabbage discover by captain cook for 130 day he crew enjoy the luxury of fresh vegetable which be serve out with they salt beef and pork and prevent sickness among they george be there any animal on the island mr barraud number of bird penguin albatross gull duck cormorant & c and the island be the resort of seal and sea-elephant charle it can not be a very pretty place mr stanley here be a idea of it the whole island appear to be deeply indented by bay and inlet the surface intersect by numerous small lake and water-course these become swollen by the heavy rain which alternate with the frost and snow accompany by violent gust of wind rush down the side of the mountain and along the ravine in countless impetuous torrent form in many place beautiful foam cascade wear away the rock and strew the valley below with vast fragment charle that be _ grand _ but decidedly not _ comfortable _ grandy sailor need great power of endurance to undergo such hardship as they must continually encounter on these voyage of discovery how grateful we ought to feel towards the brave man who hazard life property everything to extend we knowledge for how many happy hour be we indebted to they research how often have we peruse with delight the voyage the discovery the exciting description of enterprising sailor and all perhaps without reflect that the very adventure which have so much amuse we may have be the ruin of all they hope and the destroyer of all they happiness in this world while you be sip you wine preparatory to we last voyage i will tell you a true #story of a sailor as relate by himself # four year ago i leave the port of boston the master of a fine ship bind for china i be worth ten thousand dollar and be the husband of a young and handsome wife whom i marry but six month before when i leave she i promise to return to she in less than a twelvemonth i take all my money with I save enough to support my wife in my absence for the purpose of trading when in china on my own account for a long time we be favor with prosperous wind but when in the china sea a terrible storm come upon we so that in a short time i see the vessel must be lose for we be drift on the rock of a unknown shore i order the man to provide each for himself in the best possible manner and forget the ship as it be a impossibility to save she we strike : a sea lay I upon the rock senseless and the next would have carry I back to a watery grave have not one of the sailor drag I further up the rock there be only four of we alive and when morning come we find that we be on a small uninhabited island with nothing to eat but the wild fruit common to that portion of the earth and there we remain sixty day before we could make ourselves know to any ship we be at length take to canton and there i have to beg for my money be at the bottom of the sea and i have not take the precaution to have it insure it be nearly a year before i have a opportunity of come home and then i _ a captain _ be oblige to ship as a common sailor it be two year from the time i leave america that i land in boston i be walk in a hurry manner up one of its street when i meet my brother-in-law he could not speak nor move but he grasp my hand and tear gush from he eye ` be my wife alive ' i ask he say nothing then i wish that i have perish with my ship for i think my wife be dead but he very soon say ` she be alive ' then it be my turn to cry for joy he cling to I and say ` you funeral sermon have be preach for we have think you dead for a long time ' he say that my wife be live in we little cottage in the interior of the state it be then three o'clock in the afternoon and i take a train of car that would carry I within twenty-five mile of my wife upon leave the car i hire a boy though it be night to drive I home it be about two o'clock in the morning when that sweet little cottage of mine appear in sight it be a warm moonlight night and i remember how like a heaven it look to I i get out of the carriage and go to the window of the room where the servant girl sleep and gently knock she open the window and ask ` who be there ' ` sarah do you not know I ' say i she scream with fright for she think I a ghost but i tell she to unfasten the door and let I in for i wish to see my wife she let I in and give I a light and i go up stair to my wife 's room she lay sleep quietly upon she bosom lay she child whom i have never see she be as beautiful as when i leave she but i could see a mournful expression upon she face perhaps she be dream of I i gaze for a long time i do not make any noise for i dare not wake she at length i imprint a soft kiss upon the cheek of my little child while do it a tear drop from my eye and fall upon she cheek she eye open as clearly as though she have not be sleep i see that she begin to be frightened and i say ` mary it be you husband ' and she clasp I about my neck and faint but i will not describe that scene she be now the happy wife of a poor man i be endeavor to accumulate a little property and then i will leave the sea forever mr wilton a vote of thanks for grandy that little narrative have agreeably refresh we mind while the wine and cake have have the like effect on we body now voyage the last george oh papa that sound so strangely i can not bear the last of anything and now particularly it remind we how soon we happy evening meeting will be at a end and naught left but the bare recollection of they mr wilton well my dear i will not distress you by repeat the obnoxious word we will start anew and sail round the coast of africa we be a goodly party and i dare venture to say shall not lack for amusement during the voyage mr stanley then we be not to go so far south as victorium land and see all the wonderful thing sir jame ross saw mr wilton no : we have be in the cold long enough and i be rejoice that we have no more enormous iceberg to encounter -- no more still ice-fields stretch away in every direction or clashing and grind under the influence of mighty storm -- no more mountain case in eternal ice but we have really bid adieu to the wintry desolation of those frozen region that ` lie dark and wild beat with perpetual storm ' mr stanley i be glad to get into a more genial climate and i perceive we next voyage commence in the mediterranean that be if it be the intention of we young discoverer to call at the bay on the north of africa dora it be we intention sir and the first gulf call malillih be on the coast of morocco mr wilton have kindly undertake the land survey mr wilton morocco be now only the remains of a state although at one period when the moor be in the zenith of they power it be a splendid country still however the inhabitant entertain the loftiest idea of themselves and they native land and half-naked creature as they be they style the european ` agein ' or barbarian and hold they in contempt grandy but the moor although mohammedan be not destitute of virtue and as a peculiarly good trait in they character a moor never abandon himself to despair neither suffering nor loss can extort from he a single murmur to every event he submit as decree by the will of god and habitually hope for better time we might learn something even from the moor mr stanley ay but we must keep at a distance if we wish the lady of we party to learn for the moor would altogether object to teach they as woman be there regard merely as tool -- creature without soul they would not admire we lady either for they idea of female loveliness be most singular beauty and corpulence be synonymous a perfect moorish beauty be a load for a camel and a woman of moderate pretension to beauty require a slave on each side to support she in consequence of this depraved taste for unwieldy bulk the moorish lady take great pain to acquire it early in life and for this purpose the young girl be compel by they mother to devour a great quantity of kous-kous and to drink a large portion of camel 's milk every morning it be no matter whether the girl have a appetite or not the kous-kous and milk _ must _ be swallow and obedience be frequently enforce by blow dora how very disagreeable i scarcely know which be the worst stage of the affair the cause or the effect emma i should say the _ cause _ for the fat come by degree and can not inconvenience they so much as swallow quantity of food and drink when they require it not mr wilton they have other quaint notion among the point of etiquette which prevail at the court of morocco the follow be mention : -- the word _ death _ be never utter in presence of the sultan when it be unavoidable to mention the death of any person it be express by such word as ` he have fulfil he destiny ' on which the monarch gravely remark ` god be merciful to he ' another point of whimsical superstition be that the number _ five _ and _ fifteen _ must not be mention in presence of the sovereign george i should be continually say forbid word if i be there so we will go on if you please pilot emma i have the bay they be boujanyah and storah on the coast of algier this state be inferior to morocco both in extent and fertility but the city have a grand harbor be itself very populous and contain some splendid ruin dora i have the gulf they be tunis hammamet and khab on the coast of tuni which be once the seat of carthaginian power but like the other state be now reduce to a tithe of its former greatness although it be still one of the finest city in africa it have a good harbor and fortification the manufacture be silk velvet cloth and red bonnet which be worn by the people mr wilton there be yet another barbary state to pass : who have a word for tripolus charle i have madam tripolus be the most easterly and the most wretched of the barbary state it extend straggle along a great extent of coast where may be see the enormous gulf of sidra or sert call by the native ` djou al kabit ' or gulf of sulphur and the gulf of bombah tripolus receive its name from once contain three city of considerable importance which be now little else than ruin mr wilton the ` research ' have not tarry long on that coast at any rate we must now suppose ourselves _ author _ instead of _ traveller _ and without thinking of impossibility straightway carry we ship overland across the isthmus of suez and launch quietly on the water of the red sea mr barraud it be scarcely fair to pass egypt without a recognition : the egyptian would sympathize with we in we partiality for the _ ancient element _ they be special lover of two thing -- garden and water even stagnant water if sweet they consider a luxury run water however dirty they hold to be extremely luxurious when during the inundation the canal of cairo be full all the house on its bank be occupy by person who sit in they leisure hour smoking by its muddy water but the height of they enjoyment consist in sit by a fountain -- this they esteem equal to paradise mr wilton in the red sea there be eleven gulf of moderate dimension and some small bay : we will not wait to examine they as they be not important but how be we to sail out of this sea george will you undertake to pilot we george i know no other way out than through the strait of babelmandeb by abyssinium of which country i should like to have a description mr wilton the country consist of a succession of hill and valley the former for the most part well-wooded and the latter fertile with the climate mild upon the whole for so tropical a latitude for the people and custom i must refer you to some other more intelligent member mr stanley the present bishop of jerusalem -lrb- 18 -rrb- go to abyssinia some year ago and he have sketch a few interesting particulars concern the people ` as soon as a child be bear it be immediately teach to drink lukewarm butter with a little honey after the age of six or seven year the child be consider servant the boy be shepherd till the age of fourteen or fifteen and reside with they parent but if they parent be poor they leave they by they own choice at the age of eight or nine year in order to get they livelihood by keep cattle elsewhere the girl be occupy in manage the little affair of the house and begin to fetch water which be always at a distance as soon as they can walk steadily at the age of eight or nine year they begin to fetch wood from the mountain there be some father who send they child into convent to have they instruct but there be many who will not do this lest they child should become monk : on this account many boy desert they parent in order to seek instruction for themselves some enter the house of a priest as servant during the day and they receive instruction at night other go after the lesson be over to get food by beg there be also many person in easy circumstance who support those child who seek for instruction without the help of they parent nearly all the great man send they child into convent to learn reading and to repeat the psalm from memory this be all the instruction they receive the daughter of the higher class learn nothing but spin and manage the affair of the house there be however a _ few _ lady who can read ' -lrb- footnote 18 : right rev samuel gobat -rrb- mr barraud they seem early accustom to habit of industry but in other respects the training of the child be not very rigid : almost the only crime they punish they for be steal mr stanley 's author bishop gobat say he see a mother usually of a very meek temper and who would not see a man cause suffer to the smallest reptile burn the skin off both the hand and lip of she daughter only nine year of age for have dip she finger into a jar of honey emma oh how extremely cruel they surely be not christian grandy they be -- and differ very little from the roman catholic of more civilized country some of the point of variation in they doctrine be as follow : -- they believe in no separate purgatory but that almost all man go to hell at they death and that from time to time the archangel michael descend into that place of torment in order to deliver man 's soul and to introduce they to paradise sometimes for the sake of the prayer and meritorious work of they relative and they priest they have a great number of tale in support of this doctrine the one they most frequently make use of be the story of a man who have do nothing but evil when on earth except that he have always observe the _ fast _ on Wednesday and Friday when he die he descend into hell to a dark place but have always two light surround he by the assistance of which he could go to the gate which separate hell from paradise the archangel michael then go to receive he say that the two lamp which have save he be the _ fast _ which he have observe on wednesday and friday mr stanley that be one of the fallacy of the romish church but i be not surprise that popery acquire such power over the ignorant for it assail the mind through every sense through the sight by its pageantry the hearing by its splendid music the smell by the delicious odor of the incense and thus gratify and soothe its votary by the application of form destitute of power but enough of this if we venture on such a subject we be continually remind that to speak evil of other sect be malicious and that we can not disapprove of a man 's doctrine without have a uncharitable feeling towards the individual _ i _ most strenuously deny the truth of that assertion for i reckon many amongst my dearest connection whose friendship i value extremely but whose religious tenet i utterly repudiate but i fear this be incomprehensible to the youngster we will return to business the coast of africa from the red sea to the river juba which be as far as the equator be inhabit by a tribe call somaulus who be reckon to be descendant from the aborigine of the country and be early subject to the law of the koran by the arab merchant trade with they they be a mild people of pastoral habit and confine entirely to the coast the whole of the interior of this portion be occupy by a untamable tribe of savage call gallum perhaps the most uncultivated and ferocious people in existence emma we shall cross the equator before we enter another bay then in the parallel of 3 ° south lie the bay of formosa on the coast of zanguebar and 4 ° nearer south be the little island of zanzibar i be a stranger here mr wilton zanzibar be a most valuable possession of the imaun of muscat on account of its abundant produce of grain and sugar the climate be particularly fatal to european so that the crew of vessel trade there be never allow to sleep on shore but there be perhaps no place where refreshment be so cheap as in this island : fowl may be have for two shilling the dozen sugar twopence and rice one penny a pound and a large bullock be sell for one sovereign charle no great advantage to get food cheap in a country so unhealthy that you lack the appetite to eat it mr barraud no we will not go there to victual _ we _ ship here be the seychelle isle almost in the latitude of formosa bay suppose we '' bout ship ' and look in upon they there appear to be fifteen and navigator say they be compose of granite rock they chief inhabitant be french roman catholic who have very little of either religion or morality but spend the greater portion of they time in dancing and gamble all the black resident on these isle be unhappy slave although they owner live in luxurious indolence george they be such small island and some of they so close that if i live there i would build bridge to go from one island to another mr barraud the inhabitant do that without a bridge they have numerous canoe build and fit with much skill and neatness in these they pay they visit and at the close of a party a stranger would be surprise at hear the announcement -- ` madame le jeune 's _ canoe _ be wait ' instead of madame le jeune 's _ carriage _ stop the way ' but that be the fashion in the seychelle isle torch be at hand the lady and gentleman be light to the water where some stout negro almost in a state of nudity await to transport they to they own island dora that may be very delightful when you be accustom to it but i should prefer a carriage there be no more indentation until we enter mozambique channel where we shall find pemba bay and sofalum bay mr wilton pemba bay be on the coast of mozambique which belong to the portuguese the harbor of mozambique be form by a deep inlet of the sea at the entrance be three small islet which together with reef and shoal render the anchorage perfectly safe in the worst weather the city stand on a island of the same name form of coral very low and narrow and scarcely one mile and a half in length the street in the city be narrow although the house be mostly lofty and well construct but the place in itself be fast sink into insignificance and its finest building fall rapidly into decay mozambique like many other city of the world be now reduce from its ancient wealth and vice-regal splendor to the almost forget seat of desolation and poverty mr wilton between this island and sofalum bay be the slave town quillimane it be in a commodious situation and one of the finest country in the world but be continually in a state of turmoil from the different tribe strive by mutual conflict to obtain prisoner for sale to the portuguese who wickedly excite the war and fatten and grow wealthy on the blood and wretchedness they produce grandy the port of sofalum its castle its town in short everything relate to it be most interesting for in olden time this be the ophir of king solomon whence he fleet return laden with gold algum-tree and precious stone george then the ophir of sumatra be not the real ophir but only name after the place in africa because it be rich in gold mr wilton exactly so george i do not then explain it as i wish you to feel sufficient interest in the subject to inquire into the truth yourself dora delagoa bay this coast be a continued tract of land and sand-hill from fifty to five or six hundred foot high with a few straggle black rock mr wilton the inhabitant of this coast be a harmless race but have they own little peculiarity and one of the greatest luxury in life in the opinion of a delagoan be smoke the ` hubble-bubble ' a long hollow reed or cane end in two branch the lower one immerse in a horn of water and the upper one cap by a piece of earthenware form a bowl be hold in the hand they cover its top with the exception of a small aperture through which by a peculiar action of the mouth they draw the smoke through the water below they fill the mouth and after have keep it there some time they eject it with violence from the ear and nostril it make they giddy half stifle they and produce a violent cough accompany by profuse perspiration and yet these people consider it highly strengthen and beneficial charle be not caffrarium near here mr stanley yes : but you must go a few mile inland to see they for the caffre have a extraordinary dislike to water and will never trust themselves on it but from extreme necessity mr barraud the caffre -lrb- kaffir -rrb- be worth look at for they be a fine handsome race of man nearly black with very good and please feature they dress male and female be compose principally of softened hide but the woman be so fond of ornament as often to wear fifty necklace at one time they hut be construct in the form of a beehive and be perfectly water-tight and warm in time of peace the man tend the cattle the woman cultivate the land the elephant rhinoceros buffalo hippopotamus lion and various other be hunt in caffrarium with great spirit by the native of a divine be whom they call ` uhlanger ' or ` supreme ' they have some idea but as to a state of future reward or punishment they be altogether in ignorance sorcery and witchcraft in various form most extensively prevail and be the cause of much cruelty grandy to hundred of the caffre however the preaching of the everlasting gospel have be productive of much temporal and eternal benefit and a interesting illustration of this occur in some of the missionary record which also exemplify the character of the unconverted caffre #story of the little caffre # a little girl about eight year of age be recline on the ground in the cool of the day when four wolf rush upon the place one of they seize the child by the head a second by the shoulder and the other two by she leg the people of the kraal with all possible speed fly to she help and succeed in release she but apparently too late they try for a few day to help she with they medicine but find all hope fail and as from the heat and fly she have now become loathsome they give she she choice either to be put to death by the youth of the place or go to the wood to die or be farther devour as might happen the little girl choose the wood in this forlorn condition she determine to cast herself on the mercy of the missionary and although she have never be at the station she believe from what she have hear that could she reach the place she should receive that protection and help which she unnatural relative refuse to give with this resolution she set out and although she have to travel several mile through deep glen she succeed in reach the station a awful picture of deformity and suffer all but in a state of nudity cover with large wound to the number of fourteen among the most ghastly of which be that of the head and face where the wolf have endeavor to grasp the whole head have tear the mouth open to the ear strip the head of the upper part of its cover and make a ghastly wound of eight inch through the mercy of god she recover and be scarcely at all deform but she refuse ever to return to the cruel people who force she into the wood to die she become a christian and the rev mr shaw who relate the incident say that one day as he be walk a little distance from he house he hear some one engage in fervent prayer he listen it be the voice of a child and go towards the place he behold in a secluded spot among the weed the young caffre girl who have be rescue from the jaw of death earnestly pour out she soul to the god of she mercy when she think no eye saw and no ear hear she but god mr wilton how encouraging for the missionary to find that the seed have be sow on good ground and be bring to bear the fruit of righteousness through the blessing of the almighty god dora algoa bay be on the coast of that portion of cape colony know by the name of albany it be discover by bartholomew dia he sailor become discontented with they long voyage hesitate to proceed any further and he to satisfy they scruple land with the chief officer and several seaman on a island in this bay hope by the touching solemnity of religion to soften a decision so discourage to he adventurous hope he cause the sacrament to be administer at the foot of a

never before trodden be the symbol of christianity first display in the southern ocean mr wilton graham 's town be the emporium of these eastern frontier district of cape colony and its main street present a scene of incessant commercial activity while almost every article whether of utility or of ornament may be as readily obtain as in most of the provincial town of the mother country there be several good inn where visitor may command and receive every reasonable comfort and attention religious service be well attend and numerous school establish in which the child be make encouraging progress the flower and fruit of most part of europe flourish here and the climate be unexceptionable there be a great many missionary in graham 's town and on the whole it may be safely aver that the general intelligence of the inhabitant be not a whit inferior to that of the middle and lower class of any country in the unite kingdom emma camtoo or st franci bay be a few mile further along the coast and plestenburg mossel vacca and st sebastian 's bay be among those in the south of cape colony cow bay or bahium da vacca be in latitude 34 ° south longitude 22 ° east and be so call on account of the vast number of sea-cow which use to frequent it in former time the chief value of these animal be in they ivory tusk which be harder than those of the elephant and not so liable to turn yellow be much more esteem by dentist they hide be also valuable for harness leather and the skin of the young one make handsome covering for trunk st sebastian 's bay be at the mouth of breede river and be say to possess good holding ground it be seldom visit except by vessel intend to enter the river and as that be not we intention we will pass it and go on until we come to false bay near the cape of good hope mr wilton false bay be rather a _ sound _ than a _ bay _ it contain within its capacious bosom several fine and safe inlet among which simon 's bay be the most important for there be the naval arsenal and _ dépôt _ : but the proximity of the metropolis and its more convenient bay distant only twenty-one mile divert the whole of the trade from this excellent and perfectly land-locked harbor mr wilton the cape of good hope be a crown colony its affair be administer by a governor and a lieutenant-governor the first have he residence at cape town the second at graham 's town with much truth we may describe the inhabitant of cape colony at large as a serious and religious people in the town and village the strictest attention be pay to a close and regular attendance on public worship and in the country district where church be ` few and far between ' and the opportunity difficult the private altar be every morning and evening duly serve by the head of each family the lord 's supper be administer four time a year at every town and village when the greater part of the population make a point of resorting thither with all the member of they family though the distance to be traverse for the purpose often exceed 200 mile mr barraud cape town be situate on the shore of table bay which be the chief harbor of the cape of good hope and be exceedingly commodious and close by rise a mountain of the same name to the height of 3582 foot by a declivity so gradual that it have be ascend on horseback i do not wish to detract from the general goodness of the inhabitant of cape town but i must say they be a eager money-getting race on the arrival of a ship from england a auction be generally hold and the various article exhibit damage and sound under the shade of some tree in the center of the town where a englishman would be amuse to see one of the first merchant shuffling round with a handful of tea and tell the audience that it be just upon the rise and recommend that he be allow to send home a pound or two mr stanley when i be there a few month since i be much strike with the appearance of the street they be broad and handsome but a wide _ ditch _ which the townsfolk dignify with the name of a canal run through the center there be generally but little water in this ditch but million of restless mosquito which populate the whole town and -lrb- i speak from experience -rrb- be a perfect torture the house be mostly plaster have a stone-like and cleanly appearance with they green venetian blind and plantation of acacia and other eastern tree wave gracefully in front of they the climate be salubrious and provision of all kind abundant and cheap i be within a very few mile of constantium so famous for its wine unfortunately i have no time to visit it but a description give by a gentleman -lrb- 19 -rrb- who be there much about the same time will perhaps answer we purpose better than my account he say : -- ` the approach to constantium be as romantic and beautiful as it be possible to conceive from the mixture of the english shrub and flower with those of southern africa here we pass by a long hedge of monthly rose all in full flower over we head wave the fine foliage of the banana and plantain there be a long vineyard load with grape and the african negro employ therein now we pass a avenue of english oak and this bring we to a fine large octagonal building in the dutch style which be the residence of the proprietor of lower constantium ' mr leigh next describe the interior of the wine vault as ' a long building 100 yard or more on either side enormous butt with polished oak rib keep in the cleanest style ' as i can not offer you a glass of wine from these celebrated butt i will not detain the party any longer -lrb- footnote 19 : mr leigh surgeon of the australian company 's ship south australia -rrb- charle the finest bay in the world fall to my share it be saldana bay which be capable of contain at safe anchorage the whole british fleet during all season of the year mr wilton but dame nature always capricious in she favor have deny fertility to the adjacent soil and the supply of water be limit in consequence of which it be seldom resort to except by foreign whaler fishing on the coast almost the same may be say of st helena bay and for the same reason how many more bay in cape colony emma only one papa and that be donkin 's bay we must then sail along the hottentot coast until we arrive at walwisch bay george papa be not the boschman dwelling somewhere near here mr wilton why they be a wander people and can scarcely be say to hold any definite territory of they own but they be to be find north of cape colony and be thus designate from the place of they residence which be in the bush or wood they be a dirty wild savage people and make a boast of the most inhuman action to get glory from they companion they neither cultivate the ground nor tend cattle but be dependent on the chase for animal food mr stanley many superstition and tradition be entertain by these rude people among they there be one relate by sir je alexander as follow : -- #a transformation # it be believe in the land that some of the bosch people can change themselves into wolf and lion when they like once on a time a certain namaqua be travel in company with a bosch woman carry a child on she back they have proceed some distance on the journey when a troop of wild horse appear and the man say to the woman ' i be hungry and i know you can turn yourself into a lion : do so now and catch we a wild horse that we may eat ' the woman answer ` you 'll be afraid ' ` no no ' say the man ' i be afraid of die of hunger but i be not afraid of you ' whilst he be yet speak hair begin to appear at the back of the woman 's neck she nail begin to assume the appearance of claw and she feature alter she set down the child the man alarm at the change climb a tree close by the woman glare at he fearfully and go to one side she throw off she skin petticoat when a perfect lion rush out into the plain it bound and creep among the bush towards the wild horse and spring on one of they it fall and the lion lap its blood the lion then come back to where the child be cry and the man call from the tree ` enough enough do not hurt I put off you lion 's shape i will never ask to see you thus again ' the lion look at he and growl ' i will remain here till i die ' say the man ` if you do not become a woman again ' the mane and tail then begin to disappear the lion go towards the bush where the skin petticoat lay it be slip on and the woman again in she proper shape take up the child the man descend partook of the horse 's flesh but never again ask the woman to catch game for he george this be very droll : but i think they must be very ignorant people to believe such absurdity emma i have walwisch bay there be a broad sandy beach around it and sand-hill heap up in various form inland and the general aspect of thing here be very wild and arabian-like the climate be healthy and good it be hot in the beginning of the year but from may until August it be cool and pleasant mr wilton about three mile from walwisch bay or bay of whale be a hottentot village contain nearly 300 inhabitant who be a friendly harmless people but very indolent and filthy both sex dress alike in the skin of animal sew together with the sinew of the same animal in the form of a blanket which they throw over they shoulder with the hair-side next to they body the woman be only distinguish by the profusion of they ornament these consist of shell bone and mineral of different kind and be wear about the neck and wrist they be all expert hunter and fisher they devour they fish raw and the small one without even divest they of they entrails what they can not eat they pickle with salt procure at the head of the bay george what nasty disgusting people to eat raw fish mr wilton in appease the craving of hunger they be in fact horribly disgust be actually more fond of the entrails of cattle and sheep than of any other part and when a animal be kill these people positively devour its entrails raw even before they be cold while they will refuse to partake of the carcass cook or otherwise dora now we pass on to great and little fish bay which be on the coast of that wretched slave country benguelum grandy ah poor africa be curse with evil unknown to the rest of the human race in any section of the globe -- reptile of the most deadly venom beast of unparalleled ferocity desert of sand and moral desert a thousand time more appalling but she greatest curse of all be the white man 's cupidity tear asunder the tenderest tie of human nature and plunge village and family into mourning and despair the hyena the tiger the crocodile be creature exist by the will of god the man-stealer be a sin-created monster the depredation of the former be the effect of hunger those of the latter avarice -- the meanest passion that can enter the human breast mr wilton it be now sixty year since great britain commence offensive warfare against the african slave-trade but grieve be i to say that little good have result from it for the slave-trade be still carry on as extensively as ever we ship which be continually on the look-out to recapture the slave-vessel scarcely ever take more than fifteen in the course of twelve month and the cost of maintain this force to we country be 600000_l _ annually this money in my humble opinion might be more advantageously lay out -- mean in reference to this degraded and demoralized quarter of the world africa it might be expend in plant industry knowledge and security in fact in civilize the wretched people and surely that would more effectually check the slave-trade than the occasional capture of one or two cargo for the african slave-trade be not the _ cause _ but the _ effect _ of african ignorance as any wretched creature there will seize and sell he more wretched neighbor for the paltry sum of a dollar mr wilton this civilization will take year to effect for deep-rooted evil can not be destroy in a day among a ignorant and prejudiced people emma we be at fish bay dora will _ you _ continue dora yes : fish bay be one of the finest place in the world for fishing with a ` seine ' by which thousand of barrel of excellent fish be catch in the course of the year george what sort of a town be benguela dora small : it consist of not more than 200 house mostly one story high everything good to eat can be procure here but there be no good water except in the rainy season mr stanley then we have better make all sail and get away for it would be sad work to be becalm with -- ` water water everywhere and not a drop to drink ' while we be in these latitudes we may as well visit the two island which look so tempting after a long voyage on the great atlantic come boy : st helena for charle -- ascension for george charle st helena be discover by those pioneer of navigation the portuguese on saint helen 's day the 21st of may 1501 it be 1200 mile from the continent in latitude 5 ° south longitude 15 ° west it be a beautiful island inhabit by about 300 english family whose ancestor take possession of it in 1600 the portuguese stock it well with cattle and fruit and the english now benefit by they forethought ` st helena ' say a clever writer -lrb- 20 -rrb- ` be the dark monument of the most conspicuous man that have arise within the period of certain history ' of course that mean napoleon bonaparte i have do -lrb- footnote 20 : captain morrell -rrb- george ascension isle lie between africa and brazil : it be discover in 1508 it be about 39 mile in circumference and of nearly a circular form it have water only in one spot call the green mountain from the rich verdure with which it be cover the natural production be not numerous guinea-fowl have be introduce and be now quite wild ten head of cattle be likewise import which have also take to the wood and be hunt by the garrison as require this island be at one period overrun with enormous rat to destroy which somebody with good intent import a cargo of cat which be now become as great a plague as they predecessor keep the sportsman constantly on the alert to destroy they mr stanley well do george i be glad to hear you not only remember the information but try to retain the phraseology of the geographer that be the right method to improve you memory do not halt at the trouble it cost you for you will be abundantly repay in the end dora we have only one more bay on this side of the equator to notice among the numerous bay on the western coast of africa first in rank stand kabenda bay near congo it be a very fine harbor and be so agreeable a situation that it be denominate the ` paradise of the coast ' the sea be always smooth and debarkation easy the town of kabenda stand amidst delightful scenery compose of lofty cliff verdant hill and deep luxuriant vale it be resort to principally by slaver who trade thither for slave ivory and wood the poor inhabitant strange to say notwithstanding they oppression have a great respect for white man and believe that they know everything or in they dialect ' _ sabe ebery ting _ ' mr barraud there be a fact worthy the attention of traveller connect with the kingdom of loango which you will perceive lie immediately north of congo it contain amongst its inhabitant number of black jew scatter throughout the country they be despise by the negro who do not even deign to eat with they they be occupy in trade and keep the sabbath so strictly that they do not even converse on that day they have a separate burying-ground very far from any habitation the tomb be construct with masonry and ornament with hebrew inscription the singularity of which excite the laughter of the negro who discern in these hieroglyphic only serpent lizard and other reptile mr wilton cross the line be no longer a novelty to such experienced voyager as we be and i think dora may carry we on to we next station without further remark dora the gulf of guinea mr wilton plenty of sea-room _ there _ dora but i hope we be to keep along the coast for with the exception of fernando po and st thoma 's i know of no place where i should feel disposed to go ashore mrs wilton we be on a coast expedition although for the _ furtherance of science _ we occasionally sail out of the direct track and as in this instance the mention of you inclination to visit these two island imply some knowledge of they situation we expect you will furnish the meeting with the requisite information mr wilton you mamma be very sharp upon I george take warning by my case and do not interfere with the pilot george ha capital now papa ferdinand po mr wilton we sojourn there will be very brief not because the island be deficient in fertility but simply because the society of the native would be intolerable to civilized nose they be the filthiest people in the whole world word can not convey a idea of they disgusting nature they have long hair mat together with red clay and palm oil this composition have a most outrageous smell and with it they smear they face and body they be generally speak a stout athletic well make race of people and particularly harmless in they disposition though from they appearance you would not imagine that to be the case as each individual be always arm with a spear about eight foot in length make of hard wood and barb at each end which add to they fierce color and smell would daunt the courage of a more enlighten savage st thoma 's should have be first as it be nearer the equator it be one of the four guinea island prince 's island and anaboa will make up the number i know very little of it except that it help to furnish the portuguese shipping with provision and fresh water now i have satisfy the demand of the meeting and will promise not to interfere again charle i shall be rejoice at you interference sir if it always have the effect of bring out you store and now i be pilot for a short time i beg to state that i shall not require any apology should you interrupt _ I _ in the discharge of my duty but be thankful for the same fernando po it be in the bight of biafra the coast of which bight be thus describe by dr bayle : -- ` this coast be forbid in its aspect dangerous to approach repulsive when examine and disgust when know ' there : that be not a very invite account : have we not better sail on who cry forward forward all exclaim mr stanley and charle be about to proceed when george interrupt he to inquire if the chimpanzee be not a native of these part mr stanley yes my boy it be find not very far from the equator george be it not the largest ape in guinea mr stanley right again i will tell you all i know about the gentleman its height be four foot and there be no appearance of a tail monsieur de grandpié give a account of one which he have the opportunity of observe during a voyage this animal have learn to heat the oven and be particularly careful that no coal should escape to set fire to the vessel it perfectly understand when the oven be sufficiently heated and never fail to apprise the baker of the circumstance while he in he turn so entirely confide in it that he hasten with he bread as soon as the animal go to fetch he and be never once lead into a error when they turn the capstan it endeavor to assist with all its power like a sailor when the sail be loosen it mount the yard of its own accord it belace the shroud as well as any sailor and observe how the end of the rope be fasten to prevent its hang it do the same to the rope of which it have possession it be as clever as many of the man and much more nimble and be treat by the sailor as one of they own crew this animal die on the passage owe to the brutal treatment of the second mate it bear he cruel usage with the greatest resignation raise its hand in a suppliant manner to implore a remission of the stripe he inflict from that moment it refuse to eat and die of hunger and suffering on the fifth day almost as much regret as one of the crew would have be the chimpanzee generally walk upright support by the branch of a tree after the manner of a walking-stick the negro dread it and with much reason for it be powerful and use its power with great harshness whenever they meet i believe you may see a chimpanzee in the zoological garden in the regent 's park we will go some day on speculation george now charle ` forward ' charle the bight of benin wash the coast of dahomey and other country know also by the name of the slave coast dahomey include the subjugate district extend at least 150 mile into the interior the principal town be abomey lie about three degree east longitude mr wilton whidah on this coast must be notice as it be so connect with dahomey it be once a independent kingdom but in the year 1727 be conquer by guadja irudo king of dahomey its capital contain about 20000 inhabitant in whidah the religion be pagan but for some unaccountable reason they worship they divinity under the form of a particular species of snake call _ daboa _ which be not sufficiently large to be terrible to man and be otherwise tamable and inoffensive these _ daboa _ be take care of in the most pious manner and well feed on rat mouse or bird in they _ fetish _ house or temple where the people assemble to pay they adoration and where those also who be sick or lame apply for assistance grandy they creed be a odd mixture they believe in two being equal in power the one do good the other evil and they pray to the demon to allow they to remain unmolested by the magician who be constantly endeavor to injure they mr stanley in dahomey the tiger be a object of religious regard but the people wisely deem it the safest mode of worship to perform they act of devotion to he skin only and it be stuff for that purpose the government of this country be entirely despotic the sovereign may cut off as many head as he like and dispose of he subject ' property as he think fit without be accountable to any earthly tribunal he have from three to four thousand wife a proportion of whom train to arm under female officer constitute he body-guard charle what a royal regiment all queen why the sight of they would strike terror into a english army i should throw down my weapon directly mr stanley but they enemy be not so gallant and hesitate not to fight this female army who very often gain the advantage by be so well disciplined mr barraud in dahomey at a particular period of the year a grand annual festival be hold and amidst feasting and rejoicing deed be do from which the civilized mind recoil with horror number of human victim be sacrifice in solemn form they be generally prisoner of war set aside for the purpose but as seventy be the required number should there not be so many prisoner the king make it up from he own subject they body be throw to wild beast while they head be use to decorate the wall of the royal palace still more barbarous be the notion of enjoy the gratification of trample on the head of they enemy and in order to do this the king of dahomey have the passage lead to he bedchamber pave with the skull of he enemy emma o cruel murderous people sail on charle and leave they far behind be not the next coast ashantee charle yes ashantee be at present the most powerful state in all western africa and in fact rule over a considerable portion of it the native be remarkable for oratory and will discourse fluently on a give subject for hour a taste for music be also extensively cultivate and they taste be evidence by the native band at cape coast castle which play admirably by ear several of the most popular english tune the ashantee and the native of the country contiguous to this coast build they house of mud and stick which composition they call ' _ swish _ ' mr wilton they be a more civilized set than the people of dahomey and the dane have furnish we with a portrait of one of they king whose name be opocco here be the account : -- ` the monarch be seat on a throne of massive gold under the shade of a artificial tree with golden leave he body extremely lean and inordinately tall be smear over with tallow mix up with gold dust a european hat bind with broad gold lace cover he head he loin be encircle with a sash of golden cloth from he neck down to he foot cornelian agate lazulite be crowd in the form of bracelet and chain and he foot rest on a golden basin the grandee of the realm lay prostrate on the ground with they head cover with dust a hundred complainer and accuse person be in a similar posture behind they twenty executioner with draw sabre in they hand wait the royal signal which generally terminate each cause by the decapitation of one or other of the party ' the danish envoy be introduce and pass a number of bloody head recently separate from the body approach the throne the magnificent flaming prince address he with the follow most gracious question : -- ' i would willingly detain thee for some month in my dominion to give thee a idea of my greatness hast thou ever see anything to be compare with it ` no lord and king ' reply the obsequious envoy ` thou hast no equal in the world ' ` thou art right ' say opocco ` god in heaven do not much surpass I ' the king drink some english beer from a bottle and then hand it to the dane the latter take a little and excuse himself by say that the liquor would intoxicate he ` it be not the beer that confound thee ' say opocco ` it be the brightness of my countenance which throw the universe into a state of inebriety ' this same king conquer the brave prince oorsoock chief of the akim who slew himself he cause the head of the vanquish prince to be bring to he deck it with golden bracelet and in presence of he general direct to he the follow speech : -- ` behold he lay in the dust this great monarch who have no equal in the universe except god and I he be certainly the third oh my brother oorsoock why wouldst thou not acknowledge thyself my inferior but thou hopedst to find a opportunity of kill I thou thoughtest that there ought not to be more than _ one _ great man in the world thy sentiment be not to be blame it be one in which all mighty king ought to participate ' grandy what fearful arrogance and presumption it sufficiently testify they direful state of ignorance which ignorance i trust to hear will soon be effectually remove for there be now missionary establishment on this coast which since the year 1834 have be progress at first the minister be much dispirited owing to the evil effect of the climate on the european constitution for after a year or two they be cut off by death and in order to continue the mission other pious man and they wife be oblige to be send out again these die but yet the work prosper and now bless be god the few whose life have be spare be enable to report that many native have turn unto the lord they god every sabbath morning public worship be celebrate in the chapel at cape coast town when the beautiful liturgy of we church be read and the decorum which be observe by the native who read the response appear in striking opposition to the wild irrational service which they formerly offer at the temple of they fetish mr wilton the unconverted believe in a supreme be but they have a curious tradition respect the creation which have prevail among they from the earliest period of they history they believe that in the beginning of the world god have create three white and three black man with a equal number of woman of each color resolve in order that they might be leave without cause of complaint to allow they to fix they own destiny by give they the choice of good and evil a large box or calabash be place upon the ground together with a seal paper or letter the black man have the first choice and take the calabash expect that it contain all that be desirable but upon open it they find only a piece of gold some iron and several other metal of which they do not know the use the white man open the paper and it tell they everything all this be suppose to have happen in africa in which country it be believe god leave the black with the choice which they avarice have prompt they to make under the care of inferior or subordinate deity but conduct the whites to the water-side where he communicate with they every night and teach they to build a small vessel which carry they to another country from whence after a long period they return with various kind of merchandise to barter with the black whose perverse choice of gold in preference to the knowledge of letter have doom they to inferiority mr stanley affair would have be better order for the black have they allow the lady to have a voice in the selection but they never have a good opinion of the fair sex and they be no wiser at the present day as many of they custom sufficiently testify -- a peculiar provision be make in ashantee with reference to the female sex one of the king 's sister be constitute the governess of the empire or queen over the female and all be say to be place under she control and direction : but whatever may be the nature and object of the training to which she subject they it be certain that it be not intend to make the wife the rational companion and confidential friend of she husband for if a ashantee wife be detect in listen to a conversation of she husband she curiosity be sure to cost she a ear and if she betray a secret with which she have by any means become acquaint she incensed husband punish she by cut off she upper lip the sight of woman who have suffer such infliction be common even in the present day ' mr barraud these be the cruelty of a barbarous people but they be not horrify at deed of blood indeed such be the union of barbarism and magnificence in this african country that on a court day there be invariably in immediate attendance upon the king the royal chief executioner a man of gigantic size bear a massive gold hatchet and have exhibit before he the execution stool clot with human blood and partly cover with a caul of fat mr wilton that be do no doubt from policy to inure he courtier to scene of horror in hope of render they callous to human suffering and courageous in the field of battle ah well we have hear enough of _ they _ : let we now visit some other country dora liberium be the next station and much more desirable for the climate be better than most other part of the coast the soil fruitful and the inland population quiet and inoffensive and more inclined to industry than they neighbor grandy there be a thriving missionary establishment at liberium which i hope will before long exert its benign influence over the bowchee people who be located some few mile distant they be a miserable race entirely devoid of feel the gentle appeal of nature be unknown to they parental tenderness dwell not in they bosom for they will sell they child as slave to the greatest stranger in the world with no more remorse of conscience than if they have be common article of merchandise i will tell you a story of a bowchee mother : -- ' a travel slave-dealer pass through the place have purchase several of they child of both sex from the inhabitant and amongst other a old woman have a only daughter whom she part with for a necklace of bead the unhappy girl who be about thirteen or fourteen year of age on be drag away from the threshold of she parent 's hut cling distractedly around the knee of she unfeeling mother and look up wistfully in she face burst into a flood of tear exclaim with passionate vehemence : -- o mother do not sell I what will become of I what will become of yourself in you old age if you send I from you who will fetch you corn and milk who will pity you when you die have i be unkind to you o mother do not sell you only daughter i will take you in my arm when you be feeble and carry you under the shade of tree i will repay the kindness you show I in my infant year when you be weary i will fan you to sleep and whilst you be sleep i will drive away fly from you i will attend on you when you be in pain and when you die i will shed river of sorrow over you grave o mother dear mother do not push I away from you do not sell you only daughter to be the slave of a stranger she tear be useless -- she remonstrance vain the unnatural parent shake the bead in the face of she only child thrust she from she embrace and the slave-dealer drive the agonize girl from the place of she nativity ' emma oh how very shocking poor girl how dreadful to have such cruel relentless parent oh dear i hope the work of the missionary will be bless and that god will soften the hard heart of those savage and mercenary people charle between liberium and sierra leone be sherboro ' bay and yawry bay sierra leone or ` mountain of the lioness ' be so unhealthy that we should not live long if we go there mr wilton you be right charle it be establish as a colony in 1787 for the express purpose of labor to civilize the african all the cargo of the recaptured slaver be take there and every comfort and convenience afford to the unfortunate negro but it be so extremely unhealthy that european can scarcely carry out they plan and death mow they down in the midst of they usefulness charle then i may conclude that all member be desirous of proceed between sierra leone and cape verd the bay be immaterial but from cape verd sailing north we pass four tolerable-sized indentation -- tindal greyhound cintra and garnet bay then a brisk wind will speedily waft we to the point from whence we start viz the strait of gibraltar mr wilton we have nearly come to a conclusion then and without any of the misfortune incidental to traveller we have go over the vast extent of water which encompass we globe and be for some month engage in examine the wonder of the ocean without meet any of the monster of the deep such as kraken sea-serpent & c nevertheless i be not so skeptical as to disbelieve all i have not the opportunity of view with my own bodily eye i do think that the sea contain monster such as mr howitt describe : -- ` thing all misshapen slimy cold writhe and strong and thin ' which it would be dangerous to observe too near and i shall feel we have gain a advantage by these little meeting if they lead you young folk to reflect on the probability of different traveller ' assertion before you either receive or reject they mr wilton we have sail all round the coast of africa but would there be any danger in go to the lake of africa mr wilton none that i be aware of and as there be only three of any magnitude there we shall not be long on the excursion i will visit two myself and report discovery lake ludea be in tuni and be scarcely worth the expense of a journey thither lake maravus be in the south near mozambique and be rather larger but not a agreeable situation mr stanley will you be good enough to conduct the lady to the bank of lake tchad mr stanley i should be sorry to take the lady to such a country but i will venture alone and like you collect the necessary information if that will suit the purpose emma oh yes sir that will do quite as well mr stanley lake tchad be the largest inland sea in africa its circumference about 300 mile its situation in the country of bornou it contain sweet fresh and still water be surround by many lake both fresh and salt and have several river run into it although it have no outlet which be the cause of its occasionally overflow the surrounding country bornou be not a pleasant place it swarm with innumerable creep horror and savage animal the latter often enter the village and carry off the unfortunate slave while at work simplicity good-nature and ugliness be the peculiar characteristic of the people and although the man be not warrior nor the woman favor by nature they be certainly a kind inoffensive race angornou be the largest and most populous town of bornou it be situate a few mile from lake tchad and contain 30000 inhabitant major denham give a very good account of a interview with the sultan of bornou he write : -- ` the sultan receive we in a open space in front of the royal residence : we be keep at a considerable distance while he people approach to within about 100 yard pass first on horseback and after dismount and prostrate themselves before he they take they place on the ground in front but with they back to the royal person which be the custom of the country the sultan be seat in a sort of cage of cane or wood near the door of he garden on a seat which at the distance appear to be cover with silk or satin and through the railing look upon the assembly before he who form a semicircle in front of he nothing could be more absurd and grotesque than the figure who form this court large stomach and large head be indispensable for those who serve the court of bornou and those who unfortunately possess not the former by nature make up the deficiency with wad a little to we left or nearly in front of the sultan be a extempore declaimer shout forth praise of he master with he pedigree and near he one who bear the long wooden frum-frum on which he ever and anon blow a blast loud and unmusical ' the major say the appearance of these courtier be ridiculous in the extreme squat down in they place or totter under the weight and magnitude of they turban and they stomach while they thin leg that appear underneath but ill accord with the bulk of the other part i see george laughing at the picture i have draw of these curious little man but you would not dare to laugh in the presence of the mighty sultan of bornou he would immediately exclaim ` off with he head ' if you so far outrage the rule of bornouan etiquette i will now give you a description of a wedding in this african country and we will then bid the people a long farewell the bridegroom 's friend to the number of 200 or 300 sally forth dress in they best clothes to meet the bride behold she mount on a bullock whose back be cover with blue and white cloth she be follow by four female slave laden with straw basket wooden bowl and earthen pot after they appear two other bullock carry the remainder of the _ fair _ bride 's dowry she be attend by she mother and five or six young lady who act as bridesmaid accord to they mode of salutation we must gallop up to they repeatedly see the lady cover they face and scream they thanks and as it be extremely indelicate to gaze upon the bride we must cast we eye on the ground wheel we horse round and gallop back again you will ask ` be that all and where be the bridegroom ' ah poor fellow he have be parade the street all the day with a crowd after he dress in all the finery he could buy or borrow while the people blow horn beat drum and cry ` may you live forever ' ` god prosper you ' ` gray hair to you ' there be no further ceremony the bride be hand over to she husband in the evening by she mother and henceforth they be man and wife george oh what very odd thing be do in strange land i be so sorry we examination be over and i wish we could begin they all again what religion be the people of bornou mr stanley they be mohammedan and very superstitious trust greatly to they medicine man grandy i have really enjoy these meeting as much as the young folk for i think there be no study more delightful nor more useful than that which make we acquaint with the world and its inhabitant as we business have be mostly on the water i consider that we ought not to close the subject without call to mind the period when ` the water prevail exceedingly upon the earth ' and ` all that be in the dry land die ' beware my dear child that you forget not the awful catastrophe from which the family of faithful noah alone escape nor that the cause of it be the iniquity of man george i never see a rainbow but i think of the deluge because you teach I the text concern god 's covenant dear grandy and the promise that the earth should no more be destroy by a flood : but i have often wonder what could be the size of the ark to contain so many live creature mr wilton i believe i can inform you somewhat on that head a scriptural cubit measure twenty-one inch and it have be calculate accord to the dimension give in the 6th chapter of genesis that the ark must have be of the enormous burden of 19530 ton charle enormous why we first-rate man-of-war be scarcely 3000 ton and yet how large they look how long be it in build mr wilton many author agree in state it to have be one hundred and twenty year in building mr stanley there be now no alternative -- we discussion _ must _ come to a end the last voyage have be highly interesting although perhaps not in the most delightful portion of the globe but i can not help express a sincere wish that you _ real _ voyage to the west indy may afford you as much enjoyment and edification and its termination be as happy and well-ordered as this _ imaginary _ voyage which have not only prove we all tolerable sailor and respectable navigator but also testify that the good ship ` research ' have truly merit she name and earn many laurel for herself and owner mr stanley then present george with a beautiful telescope as a reward for he perseverance in the acquirement of geographical knowledge he charge he to make a profitable use of it for the benefit of the captain on they voyage to jamaica and add he as he place the valuable gift in the hand of the delighted boy : keep a sharp look-out george and mind that you be the first to shout a sail a sail then you will see how the face of the weather-beaten sailor will brighten as they run to _ have a look at she _ then will the captain call for he speak trumpet and some such question as these will be put to the _ stranger _ where be you bind where do you come from be you all hearty on board the boatswain will then hang out the black board with the latitude and longitude mark on it the stranger will do the same if they agree all well and good they each sail on they separate course wish for fair wind and a prosperous voyage such as i sincerely hope may fall to the share of the member of we little society we must now leave we young friend as we can not accompany they across the atlantic for want of a vessel the research have behave so well in they late expedition she be still to be honor with they company and be a merchant ship she can not accommodate many passenger should my reader be anxious to hear of the safe arrival of they young friend in the land of spring i must beg to refer they to lloyd 's for particulars of research a 1 400 ton burden commander frederic hamilton the end end of project gutenberg 's the world of water by mr david osborne
