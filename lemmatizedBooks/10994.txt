mulberry-street 1831 the good resolution why be i so unhappy to-day say isabellum gardner as she open she eye on the morning of she fourteenth birth-day be it because the sun be not bright enough or the flower be not sweet enough she add as she look on the glorious sunshine that lay upon the rose-bush surround she window isabellum arise and dress herself and try to drive away she uncomfortable feeling by thinking of the pleasure of the afternoon when some of she young friend be to assemble to keep she birth-day but she could not do it and sad and restless she walk in she father 's garden and seat herself on a little bench beneath a shady tree everything around be pleasant the flower seem to send up they gratitude to heaven in sweetness and the little bird in song of joy all speak peace and love and isabellum could find nothing there like discontent or sorrow the cause of she present troubled feeling be to be find within isabellum gardner be in the habit of indulge in a fretful and peevish temper she be often hasty in she spirit to be angry forget that the wise solomon say anger resteth in the bosom of fool and that a greater than solomon have command she to forgive as she would be forgive she disrespect and ill-humor toward she parent have cause she many unhappy day and sleepless night and often have the day close on fault unrepented of and sin unforgiven it be but the afternoon before that she have speak in a high angry tone to she eldest sister mary and part in displeasure from she brother edward because he would not leave he study to go into the garden with she thus have the sun go down upon she wrath and we can not be surprise that when it rise in the morning she be unhappy isabellum have a generous temper and after she have be unkind or unjust she be frequently sorry and determine to be so no more but she regret be forget as soon as she be again tempt and at the age of thirteen she have gain no victory over the sinful habit of indulge in a angry temper isabellum have kind and indulgent parent -- parent who look with thankfulness upon the virtue and with sorrow upon the fault of they child and pray that the former might be strengthen and the latter correct mr gardner have long see with deep anxiety the grow defect in isabellum 's temper and it be now bring more painfully home to she feeling as she reflect how much a added year increase the responsibility of she child she have rise early and have be long engage in prayer to he who can alone regulate the unruly disposition will and passion of sinful man she pray for knowledge of she duty to she child and for strength to perform it : she pray for isabellum that god would convince she of the error of she way that he holy spirit might renew she in the spirit of she mind that she might become a child and follower of the lord jesus christ long and anxiously the pious mother continue she supplication at the throne of grace and after take she bible and read the bless assurance i can do all thing through christ strengthen I she go into the garden to meet isabellum she find she there sit as we have describe alone and sorrowful what be the matter isabellum say mr gardner in a kind tone : why be you so sad on the morning of you birth-day -lrb- illustration -rrb- i do not know mother reply isabellum i believe it be because nobody love I isabellum say mr gardner i be afraid nobody will love you long if you go on as you have do lately give way to angry feeling whenever anything oppose you wish and what be much worse you will offend you heavenly father if you thus continue to break he holy command i can not help be displeased mother when people show I that they do not like I and try to vex I seldom do any one vex we on purpose isabellum it be the bad state of we own heart that make we think we be not like and besides jesus christ have forbid we to be angry even when there be real fault he tell we to forgive other as he have forgive we and do you think you have obey he no mother but people must be angry when they be treat unfairly and the girl at school be often very unkind and unjust to I and i be sure i ought to show they that i do not like it such be not the gospel rule isabellum and that alone should be you guide there you be direct to love those who treat you unkindly to do good to those that hate you and to ` pray for those who despitefully use you ' the recollection of you own need of forgiveness from god ought to make you patient toward the fault of other very often mother when i try to do my best i be misunderstand and reprove and then i be sure even the best person would be displeased not if they be disciple of the lord jesus christ isabellum be he not holy and undefiled pure spotless and without sin and be he not persecute falsely accuse and scourge reviled and reject by man betray by one disciple and forsake by all the rest yet no word of evil passion be ever hear from he he open not he mouth nor would he suffer another to resent any of the insult offer to he ` the disciple be not above he master ' and if we profess to follow jesus christ we must learn to bear all thing and try ` to be perfect as we father in heaven be perfect ' forgiveness of injury be a high duty and patiently to bear injustice be one of the greatest christian excellence god alone can give we the right temper of mind but we must ourselves try to attain it perhaps you may recollect what peter say about suffer patiently for well-doing to be sure those to whom he be preach be suffer in a great cause but the conquest of we fault be a great cause to we and we may all apply he word to we own case he be preach to the christian at pontus who be endure persecution in the cause of christ -- ` for what glory be it if when ye be buffet for you fault ye shall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this be acceptable with god ' 1 pet ii 20 isabellum as usual acknowledge she error and say she would try to correct it do you know isabellum say mr gardner that you have promise I this a great many time before yes mother and do you know that by thus repeatedly break you promise you add to the sin already commit yes mother and do you know my child the reason why you can not keep you promise no mother i be sure i try to keep they but before i think i get angry we be all weak and sinful creature say mr gardner and without help from god we can do no good thing even the apostle paul find that when he would do good evil be present with he : so that the best person require aid from above to enable they to keep in the right path you must be convince of you own weakness isabellum before you will feel the need of this assistance and i should think you failure in you effort to regulate you temper would be enough of it this be the commencement of you new year on this day you begin another term of duty think of all you fault think particularly of that which now trouble you so much : then go to god and humbly confess to he you wickedness seek the influence of the holy spirit promise from this day to try and govern you temper and promise it in he presence ask god to help you to keep this resolution pray that you may be gentle kind and forgiving humble and willing to be reprove and that the beginning of you new year may be the beginning of a new life with you i now leave you to think of these thing and commit you to he who can alone make you perfect in every good work with the earnest prayer that he may cleanse and purify you heart and lead you into the path of life isabellum turn to she mother and large tear roll down she cheek as she say mother i feel the truth of what you say i feel that i have be a ungrateful child i have neglect my duty to you to my father sister brother and friend and i now see for the first time how greatly i have be offend god from he i will first seek forgiveness through the atonement of christ and before he i will make a solemn resolution to try from this day to subdue my sinful temper i say i will promise to try i dare not promise to do it : i fear i shall fall back many time and perhaps before this day close i shall have to repent of angry word and wicked feeling my young reader if any of you be conscious of have the same fault that isabellum determine to endeavor to correct make with she now a resolution to pray and strive against it and go to you heavenly father and ask he assistance plead earnestly in the name of christ for the gift of the holy spirit mr gardner hear with gratitude the determination of she child and leave she with a
