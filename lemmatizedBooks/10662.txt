man and this doth be human love for this to be the especial glory of love that it doth make unto all sweetness and greatness and doth be a fire burn all littleness so that do all in this world to have meet the beloved then do wantonness be dead and there to grow gladness and charity dancing in the year i mirdath the beautiful and i can not touch she face and i can not touch she hair and i kneel to empty shadow -- just memory of she grace and she voice sing in the wind and in the sob of dawn and among the flower at night and from the brook at sunrise and from the sea at sunset and i answer with vain calling it be the joy of the sunset that bring we to speech i be go a long way from my house walk lonely-wise and stop often that i view the pile upward of the battlements of evening and to feel the dear and strange gathering of the dusk come over all the world about I the last time that i pause i be truly lose in a solemn joy of the glory of the come night and maybe i laugh a little in my throat standing there alone in the midst of the dusk upon the world and lo my content be answer out of the tree that bound the country road upon my right and it be so as that some one have say : and thou also in glad understanding that i laugh again a little in my throat as though i have only a half-believing that any true human do answer my laugh but rather some sweet delusion or spirit that be tune to my mood but she speak and call I by my name and when i have go to the side of the road that i should see she somewhat and discover whether i know she i see that she be surely that lady who for she beauty be know through all of that sweet county of kent as lady mirdath the beautiful and a near neighbor to I for the estate of she guardian abound upon mine yet until that time i have never meet she for i have be so oft and long abroad and so much give to my study and my exercise when at home that i have no further knowledge of she than rumor give to I odd time and for the rest i be well content for as i have give hint my book hold I and likewise my exercise for i be always a athlete and never meet the man so quick or so strong as i do be save in some fiction of a tale or in the mouth of a boaster now i stand instantly with my hat in my hand and answer she gentle bantering so well as i might the while that i peered intent and wonder at she through the gloom for truly rumor have tell no tale to equal the beauty of this strange maid who now stand jest with so sweet a spirit and claim kinship of cousinhood with I as be truth now that i do wake to think and truly she make no ado but name I frank by my lad 's name and give laughter and right to I to name she mirdath and nothing less or more -- at that time and she bid I then to come up through the hedge and make use of a gap that be she own especial secret as she confess when she take odd leave with she maid to some country frolic drest as village maid but not to deceive many as i dare believe and i come up through the gap in the hedge and stand beside she and tall she have seem to I when i look up at she and tall she be in truth but indeed i be a great head taller and she invite I then to walk with she to the house that i meet she guardian and give word to my sorrow that i have so long neglect to make call upon they and truly she eye to shine with mischief and delight as she name I so for my amissness but indeed she grow sober in a moment and she set up she finger to I to hush as that she hear somewhat in the wood that lay all the way upon we right and indeed something i hear too for there be surely a rustling of the leaf and anon a dead twig crackt with a sound clear and sharp in the stillness and immediately there come three man run out of the wood at I and i call to they sharply to keep off or beware of harm and i put the maid to my back with my left hand and have my oak staff ready for my use but the three man give out no word of reply but run in at I and i see somewhat of the gleam of knife and at that i move very glad and brisk to the attack and behind I there go shrill and sweet the call of a silver whistle for the maid be whistle for she dog and maybe the call be also a signal to the men-servant of she house yet truly there be no use in help that be yet to come for the need do be then and instant and i nowise loath to use my strength before my sweet cousin and i step forward briskly as i have tell and the end of my staff i drive into the body of the left-ward man so that he drop like a dead man and i hit very sharply at the head of another and surely crackt it for he for he make instantly upon the earth but the third man i meet with my fist and neither have he any great need of a second blow but go instant to join he companion and the fight thus to have end before it be even proper begin and i laugh a little with a proper pride to know the bewilderment that i perceive in the way that the lady mirdath my cousin stand and regard I through the dusk of the hushed even but indeed there be no time leave to we before there come bound up three great boar-hound that have be loose to she whistle and she have some ado to keep the brute off I and i then to beat they off the man upon the earth lest they maul they as they lay and directly there be a noise of man shout and the light of lanthorn in the night and the footman of the house to come run with lanthorn and cudgel and know not whether to deal with I or not in the first moment even as the dog but when they see the man upon the ground and learn my name and see I proper they keep well they distance and have no lack of respect but indeed my sweet cousin to have the most of any only that she show no intent to keep distance of I but to have a new and deeper feeling of kinship than she at first have show and the men-servant ask what should be do with the foot-pad see that they be now recover but indeed i leave the matter along with some silver to the servant and very sound justice they deal out to the man for i hear they cry a good while after we have go away now when we be come up to the hall my cousin must take I in to she guardian sir alfr jarle a old man and venerable that i know a little in pass and because we estate abound and she praise I to my face yet quaintly-wise and the old man she guardian thank I most honourably and with a nice courtesy so that i be a welcome house-friend from that time onward and i stay all that evening and dine and afterward go out again into the home-grounds with the lady mirdath and she more friendly to I than ever any woman have be and seem to I as that she have know I always and truly i have the same feeling in my heart towards she for it be somehow as though we know each the way and turn of the other and have a constant delight to find this thing and that thing to be in common but no surprise save that so pleasant a truth have so natural a discovery and one thing there be that i perceive hold the lady mirdath all that dear fore-night and this be indeed the way that i have my pleasure so easy with the three foot-pad and she ask I plainly whether i be not truly very strong and when i laugh with young and natural pride she catch my arm suddenly to discover for herself how strong i might be and surely she loose it even the more sudden and with a little gasping of astonishment because it be so great and hard and afterward she walk by I very silent and seeming thoughtful but she go never any great way off from I and truly if the lady mirdath have a strange pleasure in my strength i have likewise a constant wonder and marvel in she beauty that have show but the more lovely in the candle-light at dinner but there be further delight to I in the day that come for i have happiness in the way that she have pleasure of the mystery of the evening and the glamour of night and the joy of dawn and all suchlike and one evening that i ever remember as we wander in the park-land she begin to say -- half unthinking -- that it be truly a elves-night and she stop herself immediately as though she think i should have no understanding but indeed i be upon mine own familiar ground of inward delight and i reply in a quiet and usual voice that the tower of sleep would grow that night and i feel in my bone that it be a night to find the giant 's tomb or the tree with the great painted head or -- and surely i stop very sudden for she grip I in that moment and she hand shake as she hold I but when i would ask she what ail she bid I very breathless to say on to say on and with a half understanding i tell she that i have but mean to speak of the moon garden that be a olden and happy fancy of mine and in verity when i say that the lady mirdath cry out something in a strange low voice and bring I to a halt that she might face I and she question I very earnest and i answer just so earnest as she for i be grow suddenly to a excitement in that i perceive she know also and in verity she tell I that she have knowledge but have think that she be alone in the world with she knowledge of that strange land of she dream and now to find that i also have travel in those dear strange dream land and truly the marvel of it -- the marvel of it as she to say time and oft and again as we walk she give out word that there be little wonder she have be urge to call to I that night as she see I pause upon the road though indeed she have learn of we cousin-ship before have see I go by on my horse pretty oft and inquire concern I and mayhap daintily irk that i have so little heed of lady mirdath the beautiful but indeed i have think of other matter yet have be human enough have i but meet she proper before i see she now you must not think that i be not utter stir by the wonder of this thing that we have both a dreamful knowledge of the same matter of which each have think none other know yet when i question more there be much that have be in my fancy that be foreign to she and likewise much that have be familiar to she that be of no meaning to I but though there be this that bring a little regret to we there would be time and again some new thing that one tell that the other know and could finish the tell of to the gladness and amazement of both and so shall you picture we wander and have constant speech so that hour by hour we grow gladly age in dear knowledge and sweet friendship of the other and truly how the time pass i know not but there come presently a hullabaloo and the shout of man 's voice and the baying of dog and the gleam of lanthorn so that i know not what to think until very sudden and with a sweet and strange little laughter the lady mirdath to perceive that we have miss the hour utter in we converse so that she guardian -lrb- make uneasy because of the three foot-pad -rrb- have order a search and we all that time a-wander together in happy forgetfulness and we turn homeward then and come towards the light but indeed the dog find we before we be come there and they have grow to know I now and leap about I bark very friendly and so in a minute the man have discover we and be go back to tell sir jarle that all be well and this be the way of we meeting and the grow of we acquaintance and the beginning of my great love for mirdath the beautiful now from that time onward evening by evening would i go a-wander along the quiet and country road that lead from my estate to the estate of sir jarle and always i go inward by the hedge-gap and oft i should find the lady mirdath walking in that part of the wood but always with she great boar-hound about she for i have beg that she do this thing for she sweet safety and she to seem wishful to pleasure I but truly to be just so oft utter perverse in diverse matter and to strive to plague I as though she would discover how much i would endure and how far she might go to anger I and truly well i remember how that one night come to the hedge-gap i see two country-maid come thence out from the wood of sir jarle ' but they be naught to I and i would have go upward through the gap as ever only that as they pass I they curtsey somewhat over-graceful for rough wench and i have a sudden thought and come up to they to see they more anigh and truly i think the taller be surely the lady mirdath but indeed i could not be sure for when i ask who she do be she only to simper and to curtsey again and so be i very natural all in doubt but yet sufficient in wonder -lrb- have some knowledge of the lady mirdath -rrb- to follow the wench the which i do and they then very speedy and sedate as though i be some rack-rape that they do well to be fear of alone at night and so come at last to the village green where a great dance be a-foot with torch and a wander fiddler to set the tune and ale in plenty and the two to join the dance and dance very hearty but have only each the other for a partner and have a good care to avoid the torch and by this i be pretty sure that they be truly the lady mirdath and she maid and so i take chance when they have dance somewhat my way to step over to they and ask boldly for a dance but indeed the tall one answer simper that she be promise and immediately give she hand to a great hulk farmer-lout and go round the green with he and well punish she be for she waywardness for she have all she skill to save she pretty foot from he loutish stamping and very glad she be to meet the end of the dance and i know now for certainty that it be mirdath the beautiful despite she plan of disguise and the darkness and the wench 's dress and the foot-gear that mar she step so great and i walk across to she and name she whispering by name and give she plain word to be do of this unwisdom and i would take she home but she to turn from I and she stamp she foot and go again to the lout and when she have suffer another dance with he she bid he be she escort a part of the way the which he be nothing loath of and another lad that be mate to he go likewise and in a moment so soon as they be go away from the light of the torch the rough hind-lad make to set they arm about the waist of the two wench not wet who they have for companion and the lady mirdath be no longer able to endure and cry out in she sudden fear and disgust and strike the rough hind that embrace she so hard that he loose she a moment swearing great oath and directly he come back to she again and have she in a moment to kiss she and she loathe he to the very death beat he madly in the face with she hand but to no end only that i be close upon they and in that moment she scream my name aloud and i catch the poor lout and hit he once but not to harm he overmuch yet to give he a long memory of I and afterward i throw he into the side of the road but the second hind have hear my name loose from the tiring-maid and run for he life and indeed my strength be know all about that part and i catch mirdath the beautiful by she shoulder and shake she very soundly in my anger and afterward i send the maid onward and she have no word from she mistress to stay go forward a little and in this fashion we come at last to the hedge-gap with the lady mirdath very hushed but yet walk anigh to I as that she have some secret pleasure of my nearness and i lead she through the gap and so homeward to the hall and there bid she good-night at a side door that she hold the key of and truly she bid I good-night in a utter quiet voice and be almost as that she have no haste to be go from I that night yet when i meet she on the morrow she be full of a constant impudence to I so that have she alone to myself when the dusk be come i ask she why she would never be do of she waywardness because that i ache to have companionship of she and instead she deny my need and at that she be at once very gentle and full of a sweet and winsome understanding and surely know that i wish to be rest for she bring out she harp and play I dear olden melody of we childhood-day all that evening and so have my love for she the more intent and glad and she see I that night to the hedge-gap have she three great boar-hound with she to company she home again but indeed i follow she afterwards very silent until i see she safe into the hall for i would not have she alone in the night though she believe that i be then far away on the country road and as she walk with she dog one or another would run back to I to nose against I friendly-wise but i send they off again very quiet and she have no knowledge of aught for she to go sing a love-song quietly all the way home but whether she love I i could not tell though she have a nice affection for I now on the follow evening i go somewhat early to the gap and lo who should be stand in the gap talk to the lady mirdath but a very clever-drest man that have a look of the court about he and he when i approach make no way for I through the gap but stand firm and eye I very insolent so that i put out my hand and lift he from my way and lo the lady mirdath turn a bitterness of speech upon I that give I a utter pain and astonishment so that i be assure in a moment that she have no true love for I or she have never strive so to put I to shame before the stranger and name I uncouth and brutal to a smaller man and indeed you shall perceive how i be in my heart in that moment and i see that there be some seeming of justice in what the lady mirdath say but yet might the man have show a better spirit and moreover mirdath the beautiful have no true call to shame I she true friend and cousin before this stranger yet do i not stop to argue but bow very low to the lady mirdath and afterward i bow a little to the man and make apology for indeed he be neither great nor strong-made and i have be better man to have show courtesy to he at least in the first and so have do justice to my own respect i turn and go on and leave they to they happiness now i walk then maybe twenty good mile before i come to my own home for there be no rest in I all that night or ever because that i be grow deadly in love of mirdath the beautiful and all my spirit and heart and body of I pained with the dreadful loss that i be come so sudden upon and for a great week i have my walk in another direction but in the end of that week i must take my walk along the olden way that i might chance to have but a sight of my lady and truly i have all sight that ever man do need to put he in dread pain and jealousy for truly as i come in view of the gap there be the lady mirdath walk just without the border of the great wood and beside she there walk the clever-drest man of the court and she suffer he arm around she so that i know they be lover for the lady mirdath have no brother nor any youthful man kin yet when mirdath see I upon the road she shame in a moment to be so catch for she put she lover 's arm from about she and bow to I a little changed of color in the face and i bow very low -- be but a young man myself -- and so pass on with my heart very dead in I and as i go i see that she lover come again to she and have he arm once more about she and so maybe they look after I as i go very stiff and desperate but indeed i look not back on they as you may think and for a great month then i go not near to the gap for my love rage in I and i be hurt in my pride and truly neither have a true justice be deal to I by the lady mirdath yet in that month my love be a leaven in I and make slowly a sweetness and a tenderness and a understanding that be not in I before and truly love and pain do shape the character of man and in the end of that time i see a little way into life with a understanding heart and begin presently to take my walk again past the gap but truly mirdath the beautiful be never to my sight though one evening i think she might be not a great way off for one of she great boar-hound come out of the wood and down into the road to nose against I very friendly as a dog oft doth with I yet though i wait a good time after the dog have leave I i have no sight of mirdath and so pass on again with my heart heavy in I but without bitterness because of the understanding that be begin to grow in my heart now there pass two weary and lonely week in which i grow sick to have knowledge of the beautiful maid and truly in the end of that time i make a sudden resolve that i would go in through the gap and come to the home-grounds about the hall and so maybe have some sight of she and this resolve i have one evening and i go out immediately and come to the gap and go in through the gap and so by a long walk to the garden about the hall and truly when i be come there i see a good light of lanthorn and torch and a great company of people dance and all drest in quaint dress so that i know they have a festival for some cause and there come suddenly a horrid dread into my heart that this might be the marriage-dance of the lady mirdath but indeed this be foolishness for i have surely hear of the marriage if there have be any and truly in a moment i remember that she be come one-and-twenty year of age on that day and to the end of she ward-ship and this surely to be festival in honor of the same and a very bright and pretty matter it be to watch save that i be so heavy in the heart with loneliness and longing for the company be great and gay and the light plentiful and set all about from the tree and in leaf-made arbor about the great lawn and a great table spread with eat matter and silver and crystal and great lamp of bronze and silver go all a-down one end of the lawn and the dance constant upon the other part and surely the lady mirdath to step out of the dance very lovely drest yet seem to mine eye a little pale in the loom of the light and she to wander to a seat to rest and indeed in a moment there to be a dozen youth of the great family of the country-side in attendance about she making talk and laughter and each eager for she favor and she very lovely in the midst of they but yet as i do think lack of somewhat and a little pale-seeming as i have tell and she glance to go odd-wise beyond the groupt man about she so that i understand in a moment that she lover be not there and she to be a-lack in the heart for he yet why he be not there i could not suppose save that he might have be call back to the court and surely as i watch the other young man about she i burn with a fierce and miserable jealousy of they so that i could near have stept forth and pluck she out from among they and have she to walk with I in the wood as in the olden day when she also have seem near to love but truly what use to this for it be not they who hold she heart as i see plain for i watch she with a eager and lonesome heart and know that it be one small man of the court that be lover to she as i have tell and i go away again then and come not near to the gap for three great month because that i could not bear the pain of my loss but in the end of that time my very pain to urge I to go and to be worse than the pain of not go so that i find myself one evening in the gap peer very eager and shake across the sward that lay between the gap and the wood for this same place to be as a holy ground to I for there be it that first i see mirdath the beautiful and surely lose my heart to she in that one night and a great time i stay there in the gap wait and watch hopelessly and lo sudden there come something against I touch my thigh very soft and when i look down it be one of the boar-hound so that my heart leap near frightened for truly my lady be come somewhere nigh as i do think and as i wait very hushed and watchful yet with a utter beating heart surely i hear a faint and low singing among the tree so utter sad and lo it be mirdath singing a broken love song and a-wander there in the dark alone save for she great dog and i hark with strange pain in I that she do be so in pain and i ache to bring she ease yet move not but be very still there in the gap save that my be be all in turmoil and presently as i hark there come a slim white figure out from among the tree and the figure cry out something and come to a quick pause as i could see in the half-dark and lo in that moment there come a sudden and unreasoned hope into I and i come up out of the gap and be come to mirdath in a moment call very low and passionate and eager : mirdath mirdath mirdath and this way i come to she and she great dog that be with I to bind beside I in think mayhap that it be some game and when i come to the lady mirdath i hold out my hand to she not know what i do but only the tell of my heart that need she so utter and crave to ease she of she pain and lo she put out she arm to I and come into mine arm with a little run and there she bode weep strangely but yet with rest upon she even as rest be come sudden and wondrous upon I and sudden she move in mine arm and slipt she hand to I very dear and hold she lip up to I like some sweet child that i kiss she but indeed she be also a true woman and in honest and dear love of I and this to be the way of we betrothal and simple and wordless it be yet sufficient only that there be no sufficiency in love now presently she loose herself out of mine arm and we walk homeward through the wood very quiet and hold hand as child do and i then in a while to ask she about the man of the court and she laugh very sweet into the silence of the wood but give I no answer save that i wait until we be come to the hall and when we be come there she take I into the great hall and make a very dainty and impudent bow mock I and so make I know to another lady who sit there upon she task of embroider which she do very demure and as that she have also a dainty mischief lurk in she and truly the lady mirdath never to be do of naughty laughter that make she dearly breathless with delight and to sway a little and set the tremble of pretty sound in she throat and surely she must pull down two great pistol from a arm-rack that i fight a duel to the death with the lady of the embroidering who hold she face down over she work and shake likewise with the wickedness of she laughter that she could not hide and in the end the lady of the embroider look up sudden into my face and i then to see somewhat of the mischief in a moment for she have the face of the man of the court suit that have be lover to mirdath and the lady mirdath then to explain to I how that mistress alison -lrb- which be she name -rrb- be a dear and bosom friend and she it be that have be drest in the court suit to play a prank for a wager with a certain young man who would be lover to she a he might and i then to come along and so speedy to offence that truly i never see she face plain because that i be so utter jealous and so the lady mirdath have be more justly in anger than i suppose because that i have put hand upon she friend as i have tell and this to be all of it save that they have plan to punish I and have meet every evening at the gap to play at lover perchance i should pass so that i should have greater cause for my jealousy and truly they to have a good revenge upon I for i have suffer very great a long while because of it yet as you do mind when i come upon they the lady mirdath have a half-regret that be very natural because even then she be in love of I as i of she and because of this she draw away as you shall remember be -- as she confess -- suddenly and strangely troubled and to want I but afterwards as much set again to my punishment because that i bow so cold and go away and indeed well i might yet truly all be safe end now and i utter thankful and with a mad delight in the heart so that i catch up mirdath and we dance very slow and stately around the great hall the while that mistress alison whistle we a tune with she mouth which she could very clever as many another thing i wot and each day and all day after this gladness mirdath and i could never be apart but must go a-wander always together here and there in a unending joy of we togetherness and in a thousand thing be we at one in delight for we have both of we that nature which doth love the blue of eternity which gather beyond the wing of the sunset and the invisible sound of the starlight fall upon the world and the quiet of gray evening when the tower of sleep be build unto the mystery of the dusk and the solemn green of strange pasture in the moonlight and the speech of the sycamore unto the beech and the slow way of the sea when it doth mood and the soft rustling of the night cloud and likewise have we eye to see the dancer of the sunset cast she mighty robe so strange and ear to know that there shake a silent thunder over the face of dawn and much else that we know and see and understand together in we utter joy now there happen to we about this time a certain adventure that come near to cause the death of mirdath the beautiful for one day as we wander as ever like two child in we contentment i make remark to mirdath that there go only two of the great boar-hound with we and she then tell I that the third be to the kennel be sick yet scarce have she tell I so much ere she cry out something and pointed and lo i see that the third hound come towards we at a run yet very strange-seeming in he go and in a moment mirdath cry out that the hound be mad and truly i see then that the brute slavered as he come run and in a moment he be upon we and make never a sound but leap at I in one instant of time all before i have any thought of such intent but surely my beautiful one have a dreadful love for I for she cast herself at the dog to save I call to the other hound and she be bite in a moment by the brute as she strive to hold he off from I but i to have he instant by the neck and the body and brake he so that he die at once and i cast he to the earth and give help to mirdath that i draw the poison from the wound and this i do so well as i might despite that she would have I stop and afterwards i take she into mine arm and run very fierce all the long and weary way to the hall and with hot skewer i burn the wound so that when the doctor come he to say i have save she by my care if indeed she to be save but truly she have save I in any wise as you shall think so that i could never be do of honor to she and she very pale but yet to laugh at my fear and to say that she soon to have she health and the wound heal very speedy but indeed it be a long and bitter time before they be proper heal and she so well as ever yet in time so it be and a utter weight off my heart and when mirdath be grow full strong again we set we wedding day and well do i mind how she stand there in she bridal dress on that day so slender and lovely as may love have stand in the dawn of life and the beauty of she eye that have such sober sweetness in they despite the dear mischief of she nature and the way of she little foot and the loveliness of she hair and the dainty rogue-grace of she movement and she mouth a enticement as that a child and a woman smile out of the one face and this to be no more than but a hint of the loveliness of my beautiful one and so we be marry mirdath my beautiful one lay die and i have no power to hold death backward from such dread intent in another room i hear the little wail of the child and the wail of the child wake my wife back into this life so that she hand flutter white and desperately needful upon the coverlid i kneel beside my beautiful one and reach out and take she hand very gentle into mine but still they flutter so needful and she look at I dumbly but she eye beseech then i go out of the room and call gently to the nurse and the nurse bring in the child wrap very softly in a long white robe and i see the eye of my beautiful one grow clearer with a strange lovely light and i beckon to the nurse to bring the babe near my wife move she hand very weakly upon the coverlid and i know that she crave to touch she child and i sign to the nurse and take my child in mine arm and the nurse go out from the room and so we three be alone together then i sit very gentle upon the bed and i hold the babe near to my beautiful one so that the wee cheek of the babe touch the white cheek of my die wife but the weight of the child i keep off from she and presently i know that mirdath my wife strive dumbly to reach for the hand of the babe and i turn the child more towards she and slip the hand of the child into the weak hand of my beautiful one and i hold the babe above my wife with a utter care so that the eye of my die one look into the young eye of the child and presently in but a few moment of time though it have be someway a eternity my beautiful one close she eye and lay very quiet and i take away the child to the nurse who stand beyond the door and i close the door and come back to mine own that we have those last instant alone together and the hand of my wife lay very still and white but presently they begin to move softly and weakly search for somewhat and i put out my great hand to she and take she hand with a utter care and so a little time pass then she eye open quiet and gray and a little dazed seeming and she roll she head on the pillow and see I and the pain of forgetfulness go out of she eye and she look at I with a look that grow in strength unto a sweetness of tenderness and full understanding and i bent a little to she and she eye tell I to take she into mine arm for those last minute then i go very gentle upon the bed and lift she with a utter and tender care so that she lay suddenly strangely restful against my breast for love give I skill to hold she and love give my beautiful one a sweetness of ease in that little time that be leave to we and so we twain be together and love seem that it have make a truce with death in the air about we that we be undisturbed for there come a drowse of rest even upon my tense heart that have know nothing but a dreadful pain through the weary hour and i whisper my love silently to my beautiful one and she eye answer and the strangely beautiful and terrible moment pass by into the hush of eternity and suddenly mirdath my beautiful one speak -- whisper something and i stooped gently to hark and mine own speak again and lo it be to call I by the olden love name that have be mine through all the utter lovely month of we togetherness and i begin again to tell she of my love that should pass beyond death and lo in that one moment of time the light go out of she eye and my beautiful one lay dead in mine arm my beautiful one ii the last redoubt since mirdath my beautiful one die and leave I lonely in this world i have suffer a anguish and a utter and dreadful pain of longing such as truly no word shall ever tell for in truth i that have all the world through she sweet love and companionship and know all the joy and gladness of life have know such lonesome misery as doth stun I to think upon yet be i to my pen again for of late a wondrous hope have grow in I in that i have at night in my sleep wake into the future of this world and see strange thing and utter marvel and know once more the gladness of life for i have learn the promise of the future and have visit in my dream those place where in the womb of time she and i shall come together and part and again come together -- break asunder most drearly in pain and again reunite after strange age in a glad and mighty wonder and this be the utter strange story of that which i have see and which truly i must set out if the task be not too great so that in the set out thereof i may gain a little ease of the heart and likewise mayhap give ease of hope to some other poor human that doth suffer even as i have suffer so dreadful with longing for mine own that be dead and some shall read and say that this thing be not and some shall dispute with they but to they all i say naught save read and have read that which i set down then shall one and all have look towards eternity with I -- unto its very portal and so to my tell : to I in this last time of my vision of which i would tell it be not as if i _ dream _ but as it be that i _ wake _ there into the dark _ in the future of this world _ and the sun have die and for I thus newly wake into that future to look back upon this we present age be to look back into dream that my soul know to be of reality but which to those newly-seeing eye of mine appear but as a far vision strangely hallowed with peacefulness and light always it seem to I when i awaked into the future into the everlasting night that lap this world that i see near to I and girdle I all about a blur greyness and presently this the greyness would clear and fade from about I even as a dusky cloud and i would look out upon a world of darkness light here and there with strange sight and with my waking into that future i wake not to ignorance but to a full knowledge of those thing which light the night land even as a man wake from sleep each morning and know immediately he wake the name and knowledge of the time which have breed he and in which he live and the same while a knowledge i have as it be sub-conscious of this present -- this early life which now i live so utterly alone in my earliest knowledge of _ that _ place i be a youth seventeen year grow and my memory tell I that when first i wake or come as it might be say to myself in that future i stand in one of the embrasure of the last redoubt -- that great pyramid of gray metal which hold the last million of this world from the power of the slayer and so full be i of the knowledge of that place that scarce can i believe that none here know and because i have such difficulty it may be that i speak over familiarly of those thing of which i know and heed not to explain much that it be needful that i should explain to those who must read here in this we present day for there as i stand and look out i be less the man of year of _ this _ age than the youth of _ that _ with the natural knowledge of _ that _ life which i have gather by live all my seventeen year of life there though until that my first vision i -lrb- of this age -rrb- know not of that other and future existence yet wake to it so naturally as may a man wake here in he bed to the shine of the morning sun and know it by name and the meaning of aught else and yet as i stand there in the vast embrasure i have also a knowledge or memory of this present life of ours deep down within I but touch with a halo of dream and yet with a conscious longing for one know even there in a half memory as mirdath as i have say in my earliest memory i mind that i stand in a embrasure high up in the side of the pyramid and look outwards through a queer spy-glass to the north-west aye full of youth and with a adventurous and yet half-fearful heart and in my brain be as i have tell the knowledge that have come to I in all the year of my life in the redoubt and yet until that moment this _ man of this present time _ have no knowledge of that future existence and now i stand and have suddenly the knowledge of a life already spend in that strange land and deeper within I the misty knowing of this we present age and maybe also of some other to the north-west i look through the queer spy-glass and see a landscape that i have look upon and pore upon through all the year of that life so that i know how to name this thing and that thing and give the very distance of each and every one from the centre-point of the pyramid which be that which have neither length nor breadth and be make of polished metal in the room of mathematics where i go daily to my study to the north-west i look and in the wide field of my glass see plain the bright glare of the fire from the red pit shine upwards against the underside of the vast chin of the north-west watcher -- the watch thing of the north-west that which have watch from the beginning and until the opening of the gateway of eternity come into my thought as i look through the glass the word of aesworpth the _ ancient _ poet -lrb- though incredibly _ future _ to this we time -rrb- and suddenly they seem at fault for i look deep down into my be and see as dream be see the sunlight and splendor of _ this _ we present age and i be amaze and here i must make it clear to all that even as i wake from _ this _ age suddenly into _ that _ life so must i -- _ that _ youth there in the embrasure -- have awaken then to the knowledge of _ this _ far-back life of ours -- seem to he a vision of the very beginning of eternity in the dawn of the world oh i do but dread i make it not sufficient clear that i and he be both _ i _ -- the same soul he of that far date see vaguely the life that _ be _ -lrb- that i do now live in this present age -rrb- and i of this time behold the life that i yet shall live how utterly strange and yet i do not know that i speak holy truth to say that i in that future time have _ no _ knowledge of _ this _ life and age before that awaken for i wake to find that i be one who stand apart from the other youth in that i have a dim knowledge -- visionary as it be of the past which confound whilst yet it anger those who be the man of learning of that age though of this matter more anon but this i do know that from that time onward my knowledge and assuredness of the past be tenfold for this my memory of that life tell I and so to further my tell yet before i pass onward one other thing be there of which i shall speak -- in the moment in which i wake out of that youthfulness into the assure awaredness of _ this _ we age in that moment the hunger of this my love fly to I across the age so that what have be but a memory-dream grow to the pain of _ reality _ and i know suddenly that i _ lack _ and from that time onward i go listen as even now my life be spend and so it be that i -lrb- fresh-born in that future time -rrb- hunger strangely for my beautiful one with all the strength of that new life know that she have be mine and might live again even as i and so as i have say i hunger and find that i listen and now to go back from my digression it be as i have say i have amazement at perceive in memory the unknowable sunshine and splendor of this age break so clear through my hitherto most vague and hazy vision so that the ignorance of aesworpth be shout to I by the thing which now i _ know _ and from that time onward for a little space i be stun with all that i know and guess and feel and all of a long while the hunger grow for that one i have lose in the early day -- she who have sing to I in those faery day of light that _ have be _ in verity and the especial thought of that age look back with a keen regretful wonder into the gulf of forgetfulness but presently i turn from the haze and pain of my dream-memory once more to the inconceivable mystery of the night land which i view through the great embrasure for on none do it ever come with weariness to look out upon all the hideous mystery so that old and young watch from early year to death the black monstrosity of the night land which this we last refuge of humanity hold at bay to the right of the red pit there lay a long sinuous glare which i know as the vale of red fire and beyond that for many dreary mile the blackness of the night land across which come the coldness of the light from the plain of blue fire and then on the very border of the unknown land there lay a range of low volcano which light up far away in the outer darkness the black hill where shine the seven light which neither twinkle nor move nor falter through eternity and of which even the great spy-glass could make no understanding nor have any adventurer from the pyramid ever come back to tell we aught of they and here let I say that down in the great library of the redoubt be the history of all those with they discovery who have venture out into the monstrousness of the night land risk not the life only but the spirit of life and surely it be all so strange and wonderful to set out that i could almost despair with the contemplation of that which i must achieve for there be so much to tell and so few word give to man by which he may make clear that which lie beyond the sight and the present and general knowing of people how shall you ever know as i know in verity of the greatness and reality and terror of the thing that i would tell plain to all for we with we puny span of record life must have great history to tell but the few bare detail we know concern year that be but a few thousand in all and i must set out to you in the short page of this my life there a sufficiency of the life that have be and the life that be both within and without that mighty pyramid to make clear to those who may read the truth of that which i would tell and the history of that great redoubt deal not with odd thousand of year but with very million aye away back into what they of that age conceive to be the early day of the earth when the sun maybe still gloomed dully in the night sky of the world but of all that go before nothing save as myth and matter to be take most cautiously and believe not by man of sanity and prove wisdom and i how shall i make all this clear to you who may read the thing can not be and yet i must tell my history for to be silent before so much wonder would be to suffer of too full a heart and i must even ease my spirit by this my struggle to tell to all how it be with I and how it will be aye even to the memory which be the possession of that far future youth who be indeed i of he childhood 's day when he nurse of that age swing he and croon impossible lullaby of this mythical sun which accord to those future fairy-tale have once pass across the blackness that now lay above the pyramid such be the monstrous futureness of this which i have see through the body of that far-off youth and so back to my tell to my right which be to the north there stand very far away the house of silence upon a low hill and in that house be many light and no sound and so have it be through a uncountable eternity of year always those steady light and no whisper of sound -- not even such as we distance-microphone could have discover and the danger of this house be account the greatest danger of all those land and round by the house of silence wind the road where the silent one walk and concern this road which pass out of the unknown land nigh by the place of the ab-human where be always the green luminous mist nothing be know save that it be hold that of all the work about the mighty pyramid it be alone the one that be breed long age past of healthy human toil and labor and on this point alone have a thousand book and more be writ and all contrary and so to no end as be ever the way in such matter and as it be with the road where the silent one walk so it be with all those other monstrous thing whole library have there be make upon this and upon that and many a thousand million moulder into the forget dust of the earlier world i mind I now that presently i step upon the central travelling-roadway which span the one thousandth plateau of the great redoubt and this lay six mile and thirty fathom above the plain of the night land and be somewhat of a great mile or more across and so in a few minute i be at the south-eastern wall and look out through the great embrasure towards the three silver-fire hole that shine before the thing that nod away down far in the south-east southward of this but nearer there rise the vast bulk of the south-east watcher -- the watch thing of the south-east and to the right and to the left of the squat monster burn the torch maybe half-a-mile upon each side yet sufficient light they throw to show the lumbered-forward head of the never-sleeping brute to the east as i stand there in the quietness of the sleeping-time on the one thousandth plateau i hear a far dreadful sound down in the lightless east and presently again -- a strange dreadful laughter deep as a low thunder among the mountain and because this sound come odd while from the unknown land beyond the valley of the hound we have name that far and never-seen place the country whence come the great laughter and though i have hear the sound many and oft a time yet do i never hear it without a most strange thrilling of my heart and a sense of my littleness and of the utter terror which have beset the last million of the world yet because i have hear the laughter oft i pay not over-long attention to my thought upon it and when in a little it die away into that eastern darkness i turn my spy-glass upon the giant ' pit which lay to the south of the giant ' kiln and these same kiln be tend by the giant and the light of the kiln be red and fitful and throw waver shadow and light across the mouth of the pit so that i see giant crawl up out of the pit but not properly see by reason of the dance of the shadow and so because ever there be so much to behold i look away presently to that which be plainer to be examine to the back of the giant ' pit be a great black headland that stand vast between the valley of the hound -lrb- where live the monstrous night hound -rrb- and the giant and the light of the kiln strike the brow of this black headland so that constantly i see thing peer over the edge come forward a little into the light of the kiln and draw back swiftly into the shadow and thus it have be ever through the uncounted age so that the headland be know as the headland from which strange thing peer and thus be it mark in we map and chart of that grim world and so i could go on ever but that i fear to weary and yet whether i do weary or not i must tell of this country that i see even now as i set my thought down so plainly that my memory wander in a hushed and secret fashion along its starkness and amid its strange and dread habitant so that it be but by a effort i realize I that my body be not there in this very moment that i write and so to further telling : before I run the road where the silent one walk and i search it as many a time in my earlier youth have i with the spy-glass for my heart be always stir mightily by the sight of those silent one and presently alone in all the mile of that night-grey road i see one in the field of my glass -- a quiet cloaked figure move along shroud and look neither to right nor left and thus be it with these being ever it be tell about in the redoubt that they would harm no human if but the human do keep a fair distance from they but that it be wise never to come close upon one and this i can well believe and so search the road with my gaze i pass beyond this silent one and past the place where the road sweeping vastly to the south-east be light a space strangely by the light from the silver-fire hole and thus at last to where it sway to the south of the dark palace and thence southward still until it pass round to the westward beyond the mountain bulk of the watch thing in the south -- the hugest monster in all the visible night land my spy-glass show it to I with clearness -- a living hill of watchfulness know to we as the watcher of the south it brood there squat and tremendous hunch over the pale radiance of the glowing dome much i know have be writ concern this odd vast watcher for it have grow out of the blackness of the south unknown land a million year go and the steady grow nearness of it have be note and set out at length by the man they call monstruwacan so that it be possible to search in we library and learn of the very coming of this beast in the olden-time and while i mind I there be even then and always man name monstruwacan whose duty it be to take heed of the great force and to watch the monster and the beast that beset the great pyramid and measure and record and have so full a knowledge of these same that do one but sway a head in the darkness the same matter be set down with particularness in the record and so to tell more about the south watcher a million year go as i have tell come it out from the blackness of the south and grow steadily nearer through twenty thousand year but so slow that in no one year could a man perceive that it have move yet it have movement and have come thus far upon its road to the redoubt when the glowing dome rise out of the ground before it -- grow slowly and this have stay the way of the monster so that through a eternity it have look towards the pyramid across the pale glare of the dome and seem to have no power to advance nearer and because of this much have be writ to prove that there be other force than evil at work in the night land about the last redoubt and this i have always think to be wisely say and indeed there to be no doubt to the matter for there be many thing in the time of which i have knowledge which seem to make clear that even as the force of darkness be loose upon the end of man so be there other force out to do battle with the terror though in way most strange and unthought of by the human mind and of this i shall have more to tell anon and here before i go further with my tell let I set out some of that knowledge which yet remain so clear within my mind and heart of the come of these monstrosity and evil force no man could say much with verity for the evil of it begin before the history of the great redoubt be shaped aye even before the sun have lose all power to light though it must not be a thing of certainty that even at this far time the invisible black heaven hold no warmth for this world but of this i have no room to tell and must pass on to that of which i have a more certain knowledge the evil must surely have begin in the day of the darkening -lrb- which i might liken to a story which be believe doubtfully much as we of this day believe the story of the creation -rrb- a dim record there be of olden science -lrb- that be yet far off in we future -rrb- which disturb the unmeasurable outward power have allow to pass the barrier of life some of those monster and ab-human creature which be so wondrously cushion from we at this normal present and thus there have materialize and in other case develop grotesque and horrible creature which now beset the human of this world and where there be no power to take on material form there have be allow to certain dreadful force to have power to affect the life of the human spirit and this grow very dreadful and the world full of lawlessness and degeneracy there have band together the sound million and build the last redoubt there in the twilight of the world -- so it seem to we and yet to they -lrb- breed at last to the peace of usage -rrb- as it be the beginning and this i can make no clearer and none have right to expect it for my task be very great and beyond the power of human skill and when the human have build the great pyramid it have one thousand three hundred and twenty floor and the thickness of each floor be accord to the strength of its need and the whole height of this pyramid exceed seven mile by near a mile and above it be a tower from which the watchman look -lrb- these be call the monstruwacan -rrb- but where the redoubt be build i know not save that i believe in a mighty valley of which i may tell more in due time and when the pyramid be build the last million who be the builder thereof go within and make themselves a great house and city of this last redoubt and thus begin the second history of this world and how shall i set it all down in these little page for my task even as i see it be too great for the power of a single life and a single pen yet to it and later through hundred and thousand of year there grow up in the outer land beyond those which lay under the guard of the redoubt mighty and lose race of terrible creature half man and half beast and evil and dreadful and these make war upon the redoubt but be beat off from that grim metal mountain with a vast slaughter yet must there have be many such attack until the electric circle be put about the pyramid and light from the earth-current and the lowest half-mile of the pyramid be seal and so at last there be a peace and the beginning of that eternity of quiet watch for the day when the earth-current shall become exhaust and at while through the forget century have the creature be glut time and again upon such odd band of daring one as have adventure forth to explore through the mystery of the night land for of those who go scarce any do ever return for there be eye in all that dark and power and force abroad which have all knowledge or so we must fain believe and then so it would seem as that eternal night lengthen itself upon the world the power of terror grow and strengthen and fresh and greater monster develop and breed out of all space and outward dimension attract even as it might be infernal shark by that lonely and mighty hill of humanity face its end -- so near to the eternal and yet so far defer in the mind and to the sens of those human and thus have it be ever and all this but by the way and vague and ill tell and set out in despair to make a little clear the beginning of that state which be so strange to we conception and yet which have become a condition of naturalness to humanity in that stupendous future thus have the giant come father of bestial human and mother of monster and many and diverse be the creature which have some human semblance and intelligence mechanical and cunning so that certain of these lesser brute have machinery and underground way have need to secure to themselves warmth and air even as healthy human only that they be incredibly inure to hardship as they might be wolf set in comparison with tender child and surely do i make this thing clear and now to continue my tell concern the night land the watcher of the south be as i have set to make know a monster differ from those other watch thing of which i have speak and of which there be in all four one to the north-west and one to the south-east and of these i have tell and the other twain lay brooding one to the south-west and the other to the north-east and thus the four watcher keep ward through the darkness upon the pyramid and move not neither give they out any sound yet do we know they to be mountain of live watchfulness and hideous and steadfast intelligence and so in a while have listen to the sorrowful sound which come ever to we over the gray dune from the country of wail which lay to the south midway between the redoubt and the watcher of the south i pass upon one of the move roadway over to the south-western side of the pyramid and look from a narrow embrasure thence far down into the deep valley which be four mile deep and in which be the pit of the red smoke and the mouth of this pit be one full mile across and the smoke of the pit fill the valley at time so that it seem but as a glowing red circle amid dull thunderous cloud of redness yet the red smoke rise never much above the valley so that there be clear sight across to the country beyond and there along the further edge of that great depth be the tower each maybe a mile high gray and quiet but with a shimmer upon they beyond these south and west of they be the enormous bulk of the south-west watcher and from the ground rise what we name the eye beam -- a single ray of gray light which come up out of the ground and light the right eye of the monster and because of this light that eye have be mightily examine through unknown thousand of year and some hold that the eye look through the light steadfastly at the pyramid but other set out that the light blinded it and be the work of those other power which be abroad to do combat with the evil force but however this may be as i stand there in the embrasure and look at the thing through the spy-glass it seem to my soul that the brute look straightly at I unwinking and steadfast and fully of a knowledge that i spy upon it and this be how i feel to the north of this in the direction of the west i see the place where the silent one kill and this be so name because there maybe ten thousand year go certain human adventuring from the pyramid come off the road where the silent one walk and into that place and be immediately destroy and this be tell by one who escape though he die also very quickly for he heart be freeze and this i can not explain but so it be set out in the record far away beyond the place where the silent one kill in the very mouth of the western night be the place of the ab-human where be lose the road where the silent one walk in a dull green luminous mist and of this place nothing be know though much it hold the thought and attention of we thinker and imaginer for some say that there be a place of safety differ from the redoubt -lrb- as we of this day suppose heaven to differ from the earth -rrb- and that the road lead thence but be bar by the ab-human and this i can only set down here but with no thought to justify or uphold it later i travel over to the north-eastern wall of the redoubt and look thence with my spy-glass at the watcher of the north-east -- the crown watcher it be call in that within the air above its vast head there hang always a blue luminous ring which shed a strange light downward over the monster -- show a vast wrinkled brow -lrb- upon which a whole library have be writ -rrb- but put to the shadow all the lower face all save the ear which come out from the back of the head and bell towards the redoubt and have be say by some observer in the past to have be see to quiver but how that might be i know not for no man of we day have see such a thing and beyond the watch thing be the place where the silent one be never close by the great road which be bound upon the far side by the giant 's sea and upon the far side of that be a road which be always name the road by the quiet city for it pass along that place where burn forever the constant and never-moving light of a strange city but no glass have ever show life there neither have any light ever cease to burn and beyond that again be the black mist and here let I say that the valley of the hound end towards the light of the quiet city and so have i set out something of that land and of those creature and circumstance which beset we about wait until the day of doom when we earth-current should cease and leave we helpless to the watcher and the abundant terror and there i stand and look forth composedly as may one who have be bear to know of such matter and rear in the knowledge of they and anon i would look upward and see the gray metalled mountain go up measureless into the gloom of the everlasting night and from my foot the sheer downward sweep of the grim metal wall six full mile and more to the plain below and one thing -lrb- aye and i fear I many -rrb- have i miss to set out with particularness : there be as you do know all around the base of the pyramid which be five and one-quarter mile every way a great circle of light which be set up by the earth-current and burn within a transparent tube or have that appearance and it bound the pyramid for a clear mile upon every side and burn for ever and none of the monster have power ever to pass across because of what we do call the air clog that it do make as a invisible wall of safety and it do give out also a more subtile vibration that do affect the weak brain-element of the monster and the lower men-brute and some do hold that there go from it a further vibration of a greater subtileness that give a protect against the evil force and some quality it have truly thiswise for the evil power have no ability to cause harm to any within yet be there some danger against which it might not avail but these have no cunning to bring harm to any _ within _ the great redoubt who have wisdom to meddle with no dreadfulness and so be those last million guard until the earth-current should be use to its end and this circle be that which i have call the electric circle though with failure to explain but there it be call only the circle and thus have i with great effort make a little clear that grim land of night where presently my listen hear one call across the dark and how that this grow upon I i will set out forthwith iii the quiet call now oft have i hear tell not only in that great city which occupy the thousandth floor but in other of the one thousand three hundred and twenty city of the pyramid that there be somewhere out in the desolation of the night land a second place of refuge where have gather in another part of this dead world some last million of the human race to fight unto the end and this story i hear everywhere in my travels through the city of the great redoubt which travel begin when i come upon my seventeenth year and continue for three year and two hundred and twenty five day be even then but one day in each city as be the custom in the training of every child and truly it be a great journey and in it i meet with many whom to know be to love but whom never could i see again for life have not space enough and each must to he duty to the security and well-being of the redoubt yet for all that i have set down we travel much always but there be so many million and so few year and as i have say everywhere i go there be the same story of this other place of refuge and in such of the library of those city as i have time to search there be great number of work upon the existence of this other refuge and some far back in the year make assertion with confidence that such a place be in verity and indeed no doubt do there seem in those by-gone age but now these very record be read only by scholar who doubt even whilst they read and so be it ever but of the reality of this refuge i have never a sound doubt from the day of my hearing concern it from we master monstruwacan who with all he assistant occupy the tower of observation in the apex of the pyramid and here let I tell that he and i have always a affinity and close friendship one for the other though he be full grow and i but a youth yet so it be and thus when i have come to a age of twenty-one year of life he open to I a post within the tower of observation and this be a most wondrous good fortune to I for in all the vast redoubt to be appoint to the tower of observation be the most desire for thereby even as in these day doth astronomy be the natural curiosity of man ease somewhat even while thwart now let I tell here also lest it be think that i be unduly favor because of my friendship with the master monstruwacan that there be a sound justification for he choice in that to I have be give that strange gift of hearing which we call night-hearing though this be but a fanciful name and mean little yet the peculiar gift be rare and in all the million of the pyramid there be none with the gift to a great degree save only myself and i because of this gift could hear the invisible vibration of the aether so that without hark to the calling of we recording instrument i could take the message which come continually through the eternal darkness aye even better than they and now it may be the better understand how much be to be count that i have grow to listen for a voice that have not ring in mine ear for a eternity and yet which sing sweet and clear in my memory-dream so that it seem to I that mirdath the beautiful sleep within my soul and whisper to I out of all the age and then one day at the fifteenth hour when begin the sleep-time i have be ponder this love of mine that live with I still and marvel that my memory-dream hold the voice of a love that _ have be _ in so remote a age and ponder and dream thus as a young man may i could fancy this aeon-lost one be whisper beauty into my ear in verity so clear have my memory grow and so much have i pondered and lo as i stand there hark and commune with my thought i thrill suddenly as if i have be smite for out of all the everlasting night a whisper be thrilling and thrilling upon my more subtile hearing through four long year have i listen since that awakening in the embrasure when but a youth of seventeen and now out of the world-darkness and all the eternal year of that lose life which now i live in this present age of ours be the whisper come for i know it upon that instant and yet because i be so teach to wisdom i answer by no name but send the master-word through the night -- send it with my brain-element as i could and as all may much or little as may be if they be not clod and moreover i know that she who call quietly would have the power to hear without instrument if indeed it be she and if it be but one of the false calling of the evil force or more cunning monster or as be sometimes think concern these calling the house of silence meddle with we soul then would they have no power to say the master-word for this have be prove through all the everlasting and lo as i stand tremble and strive not to be tense which destroy the receptivity there come thrilling round and round my spiritual essence the throb of the master-word beating steadily in the night as doth that marvellous sound and then with all that be sweet in my spirit i call with my brain element : mirdath mirdath mirdath and at that instant the master monstruwacan enter that part of the tower of observation where i stand and see my face stand very quiet for though he have not the power of night-hearing he be wise and thoughtful and take much account of my gift more-over he have but come from the receive instrument and think vaguely to have catch the throb of the master-word though too faint to come proper through the instrument so that he search for I in that i who have the hearing might listen for it i be as i have say gifted in that wise and to he i tell something of my story and my thought and my memory and of that awakening and thus up to this present happen and he hearken with sympathy and a troubled and wonder heart for in that age a man might talk sanely upon that which in this age of ours would be account foolishness and maybe the breathing of insanity for there by the refinement of art of mentality and the result of strange experiment and the accomplishment of learn man be able to conceive of matter now close to we conception even as we of this day may haply give a calm ear to talk that in the day of we father would have be surely set to the count of lunacy and this be very clear and all the while that i tell my story i listen with my spirit but save for a sense of faint happy laughter that wrap about I i hear naught and nothing more all that day here let I put down that because of my memory and half memory i would time and again dispute with we learn man they be in doubt as to the verity of that olden story of the day of light and the existence of the sun though something of all this be set out as of _ truth _ in we oldest record but i remember tell they many tale that seem fairy-like to they and entrance they heart even whilst i anger they brain which refuse to take seriously and as verity that which they heart accept gladly even as we receive the wonder of poetry into we soul but the master monstruwacan would listen to aught i have to tell aye though i speak through hour and so it would be odd time that have talk long draw my story from my memory-dream i would come back again into the present of that future and lo all the monstruwacan would have leave they instrument and observation and recording and be gather about I and the master so sunken in interest that he not to have discover they neither have i notice be so full of the thing which have be but when the master come back to knowledge of that present he would rouse and chide and they all those lesser one would fly swiftly and guiltily to they various work and yet so i have think since each with a muddle and bewilder and thoughtful air upon he and hungry they be for more and ever wonder and set question about and so it be also with those other -- those learn one who be not of the tower of observation and who disbelieve even whilst they hunger listen would they though i talk from the first hour which be the dawn to the fifteenth hour which be the beginning of the night for the sleep-time be set thus after other usage and experiment and odd while i find that there be among they man of extraordinary learning who uphold my telling as tale of verity and so there be a faction but later there grow more to believe and whether they believe or not all be ready to listen so that i might have spend my day in talk only that i have my work to do but the master monstruwacan believe from the beginning and be wise always to understand so that i love he for this as for many another dear quality and so as may be conceive among all those million i be single out to be know for the story that i tell go downward through a thousand city and presently in the lowest tier of the underground field a hundred mile deep in the earth below the redoubt i find that the very ploughboys know something concern my telling and gather about I one time and another when the master monstruwacan and i have go down regard some matter that deal with the earth-current and we instrument and of the underground field -lrb- though in that age we call they no more than the field -rrb- i should set down a little for they be the mightiest work of this world so that even the last redoubt be but a small thing beside they a hundred mile deep lay the lowest of the underground field and be a hundred mile from side to side every way and above it there be three hundred and six field each one less in area than that beneath and in this wise they taper until the topmost field which lay direct beneath the lowermost floor of the great redoubt be but four mile every way and thus it will be see that these field lie one beneath the other form a mighty and incredible pyramid of country land in the deep earth a hundred mile from the base unto the topmost field and the whole be sheathed-in at the side with the gray metal of which the redoubt be build and each field be pillared and floor beneath the soil with this same compound of wonder and so be it secure and the monster could not dig into that mighty garden from without and all of that underground land be light where need by the earth-current and that same life-stream fructify the soil and give life and blood to the plant and to the tree and to every bush and natural thing and the making of those field have take maybe a million year and the dump thereof have be cast into the crack whence come the earth-current and which have bottom beyond all sounding and this underground country have its own wind and air-current so that to my memory it be in no way connect to the monstrous air-shaft of the pyramid but in this i may be mistake for it have not be give to I to know all that be to be know concern that vast redoubt nor by any one man could so much knowledge be achieve yet that there be wise and justly promote wind in that underground country i do know for healthful and sweet they be and in the corn-field there be the sweet rustle of grain and the glad silken laughter of poppy all beneath a warm and happy light and here do the million walk and take excursion and go orderly or not even as in these day and all this have i see and the talk of a thousand lover in the garden of that place come back to I and with it all the memory of my dear one and of a faint call that would seem to whisper about I at time but so faint and attenuate that even i who have the night-hearing could not catch its import and so go listen ever the more intently and oft time call now there be a law in the pyramid try and healthful which hold that no male should have freedom to adventure into the night land before the age of twenty-two _ and no female ever _ yet that after such age if a youth desire greatly to make the adventure he should receive three lecture upon the danger of which we have knowledge and a strict account of the mutilating and horrid deed do to those who have so adventured and if after this have pass over he he still desire and if he be account healthful and sane then should he be allow to make the adventure and it be account honor to the youth who should add to the knowledge of the pyramid but to all such as go forth into the danger of the night land there be set beneath the skin of the inner side of the left forearm a small capsule and when the wound have heal then might the youth make the adventure and the wherefore of this be that the spirit of the youth might be save if he be entrap for then upon the honor of he soul must he bite forth the capsule and immediately he spirit would have safety in death and by this shall you know somewhat the grim and horrid danger of the dark land and this i have set down because later i be to make huge adventure into those land and even at this time some thought of the same have come to I for always i go listen for that quiet calling and twice i send the master-word throbbing solemnly through the everlasting night yet this i do no more without certainty for the word must not be use lightly but often would i say with my brain-element mirdath mirdath -- send the name out into the darkness and sometimes would i seem to hear the faint thrilling of the aether around I as though one answer but weakly as it be with a weakened spirit or by instrument that lack of its earth-force and thus for a great while there be no certainty but only a strange anxiousness and no clear answer then one day as i stand by the instrument in the tower of observation at the thirteenth hour there come the thrilling of beaten aether all about I as it be that all the void be disturbed and i make the sign for silence so that the man move not in all the tower but bow over they breathing-bell that all disturbance might cease and again come the gentle thrilling and break out into a clear low calling in my brain and the calling be my name -- the old-earth name of this day and not the name of that age and the name smite I with a frightenedness of fresh awaken memory and immediately i send the master-word into the night and all the aether be full of movement and a silence come and later a beat afar off in the void of night which only i in all that great redoubt could hear until the heavier vibration be come and in a moment there be all about I the throbbing of the master-word beating in the night a sure answer yet before this i know that mirdath have call but now have surety and immediately i say mirdath make use of the instrument and there come a swift and beautiful answer for out of the dark there steal a old love-name that she only have ever use to I and presently i mind I of the man and sign to they that they should continue for the record must not be break and now i have the communication full established and by I stand the master monstruwacan quietly as any young monstruwacan wait with slip to make any note that be needful and keep a strict eye upon those other but not unkindly and so for a space of wonder i have speech with that girl out in the darkness of the world who have knowledge of my name and of the old-earth love-name and name herself mirdath and much i question she and presently to my sorrow for it seem that she name be not truly mirdath but naani neither have she known my name but that in the library of that place where she abide there have be a story of one name by my name and call by that sweet love-name which she have send out somewhat ruthless into the night and the girl 's name have be mirdath and when first she naanus have call there have come back to she a cry of mirdath mirdath and this have mind she so strangely of that olden story which have stay in she memory that she have answer as the maid in that book might have answer and thus do it seem that the utter romance of my memory-love have vanish and i stand strangely trouble for sorrow of a love of olden time yet even then i marvel that any book should have story so much like to mine not heed that the history of all love be writ with one pen yet even then in that hour of my strange and quaintly foolish pain there come a thing that set I thrilling though more afterwards when i come to think afresh upon it for the girl who speak to I through the night make some wonder that my voice be not deeper yet in quiet fashion and as one who say a thing scarce wott what they say but even to I then there come a sudden hope for in the olden day of this present age my voice have be very deep and i say to she that maybe the man in the book be say to have have a deep tone of speech but she seem puzzle say nay and at that i question she the more but only to the trouble of she memory and understanding and strange must it seem that we two should talk on so trivial a matter when there be so much else that we have need to exchange thought upon for be a man in this present day to have speech with those who may live within that red planet of mar within the sky scarce could the wonder of it exceed the wonder of a human voice come through that night unto the great redoubt out of all that lose darkness for indeed this must have be the breaking of maybe a million year of silence and already as i come to know later be the news pass downward from city to city through all the vast pyramid so that the hour-slip be full of the news and every city eager and excited and wait and i better know in that one moment than in all my life before for that previous calling have be but vaguely put about and then set to the count of a nature blow upon over-easily by spirit-wind of the half-memory of dream though it be indeed true as i have set down before this that my tale concern the early day of the world when the sun be visible and full of light have go down through all the city and have much comment and setting forth in the hour-slip and be a cause for speech and argument now concern the voice of this girl come to we through the darkness of the world i will set out that which she have to tell and this indeed but verify the telling of we most ancient record which have so long be treat over lightly : there be it would seem somewhere out in the lonesome dark of the outer land but at what distance none could ever discover a second redoubt that be a three-sided pyramid and moderate small be no more than a mile in height and scarce three quarter of a mile along the basis when this redoubt be first build it have be upon the far shore of a sea where now be no sea and it have be raise by those wander human who have grow weary of wander and weary of the danger of night attack by the tribe of half-human monster which begin to inhabit the earth even so early as the day when the half-gloom be upon the world and he that have make the plan upon which it be build be one who have see the great redoubt have live there in the beginning but escape because of a correction set upon he for he spirit of irresponsibility which have make he to cause disturbance among the orderly one in the lowest city of the great redoubt yet in time he too have come to be tame by the weight of fear of the ever-growing horde of monster and the force that be abroad and so he be a master-spirit planned and build the smaller redoubt be aid thereto by four million who also be weary of the harass of the monster but until then have be wanderer because of the restlessness of they blood and they have choose that place because there they have discover a sign of the earth-current in a great valley which lead to the shore for without the earth-current no refuge could have existence and whilst many build and guard and care for the great camp in which all live other work within a great shaft and in ten year have make this to a distance of many mile and therewith they tapt the earth-current but not a great stream yet a sufficiency as be believe and presently after many year they have build the pyramid and take up they refuge there and make they instrument and ordain monstruwacan so that they have speech daily with the great pyramid and thus for many long age and the earth-current then to begin to fail and though they labor through many thousand of year they come to no better resource and so it be they cease to have communication with the great redoubt for the current have a lack of power to work the instrument and the recording instrument cease to be sensible of we message and thereafter come a million year maybe of silence with ever the birthing and marry and die of those lonesome human and they grow less and some put this to the lack of the earth-current which dwindle slowly through the century of that eternity and once in a thousand year maybe one among they would be sensitive and abled to hear beyond ordinary and to these at time there would seem to come the thrilling of the aether so that such a one would go listen and sometimes seem to catch half message and so awaken a great interest in all the pyramid and there would be turn up of old record and many word and writings and attempt to send the master-word through the night in which doubtless sometimes they succeed for there be set down in the record of the great redoubt certain occasion on which there have come the call of the master-word which have be arrange and make holy between the two redoubt in the early day of that second life of this world yet now for a hundred thousand year there have be none sensitive and in that time the people of the pyramid have become no more than ten thousand and the earth-current be weak and powerless to put the joy of life into they so that they go listlessly but deem it not strange because of so many aeon of usage and then to the wonder of all the earth-current have put forth a new power so that young people cease to be old over-soon and there be happiness and a certain joy in the living and a strange birthing of child such as have not be through half a million year and then come a new thing naanus the daughter of the master monstruwacan of that redoubt have show to all that she be sensitive for she have perceive odd vibration afloat in the night and concern these she tell she father and presently because they blood move afresh in they body they have heart to discover the plan of the ancient instrument for the instrument have long rust and be forget and so they build they a new instrument to send forth a message for they have no memory at that time that the brain-element have power to do thus though mayhap they brain-element be weaken through so many age of starvation of the earth-current and could not have obey even have they master know all that we of the great redoubt know and when the instrument be finish to naanus be give the right to call first across the dark to discover whether indeed after that million year of silence they be yet company upon this earth or whether they be in truth lonely -- the last poor thousand of the human and a great and painful excitement come upon the people of the lesser pyramid for the loneliness of the world press upon they and it be to they as though we in this age call to a star across the abyss of space and because of the excitement and pain of the moment naanus call only vaguely with the instrument into the dark and lo in a moment as it seem there come all about she in the night the solemn throb of the master-word beating in the night and naani cry out that she be answer and as may be think many of the people weep and some pray and some be silent but other beseech she that she call again and quickly to have further speech with those of they kind and naani speak the master-word into the night and directly there come a call all about she : mirdath mirdath and the strange wonder of it make she silent a moment but when she would have make reply the instrument have cease to work and she could have no further speech at that time this as may be think occasion much distress and constant work they have between the instrument and the earth-current to discover the reason for this fail but could not for a great while and in that time oft do naani hear the call of mirdath thrilling about she and twice there come the solemn beat of the master-word in the night yet never have she the power to answer and all that while as i learn in time be she stir with a quaint ache at heart by the voice that call mirdath as it might be the spirit of love search for its mate for this be how she put it and thus it chance that the constant thrilling of this name about she wake she to memory of a book she have read in early year and but half understand for it be ancient and writ in a olden fashion and it set out the love of a man and a maid and the maid 's name be mirdath and so because she be full of this great awakening of those age of silence and the calling of that name she find the book again and read it many time and grow to a sound love of the beauty of that tale and presently when the instrument be make right she call into the night the name of that man within the book and so it come about that i have hope too much yet even now be i strangely unsure whether to cease from hope and one other thing there be which i would make clear many and oft a time have i hear a thrilling of sweet faint laughter about I and the stir of the aether by word too gentle to come clearly and these i make no doubt come from naanus use she brain-element unwittingly and in ignorance but very eager to answer my calling and have no knowledge that far off across the blackness of the world they thrill about I constantly and after naanus have make clear all that i have set out concern the lesser refuge she tell further how that food be not plentiful with they though until the reawaken of the earth-current they have go unknowing of this being of small appetite and caring little for aught but now waken and newly hungry they savor a lack of taste in all that they eat and this we could well conceive from we reasoning and theory but happily not from we knowledge and we say unto they that the soil have lose its life and the crop therefrom be not vital and a great while it would take for the earth within they pyramid to receive back the life-element and we tell they certain way by which they might bring a more speedy life to the soil and this they be eager to do be freshly alive after so long a time of half-life and now you must know that in all the great redoubt the story go downwards swiftly and be publish in all the hour-sheet with many comment and the library be full of those who would look up the olden record which for so long have be forget or take as we of this day would say with a pinch of salt and all the time i be pester with question so that have i not be determine i should scarce have be allow to sleep moreover so much be writ about I and my power to hear and diver story concern tale of love that i have be like to have grow maze to take note of it all yet some note i do take and much i find pleasant but some displeasing and for the rest i be not spoil as the say go for i have my work to do moreover i be always busy listen and have speech through the darkness though if any saw I so they would question and because of this i keep much to the tower of observation where be the master monstruwacan and a greater discipline and then begin a fresh matter though but a old enough trick for i speak now of the day that follow that re-opening of the talk between the pyramid oft would speech come to we out of the night and there would be tale of the sore need of the lesser redoubt and calling for help yet when i send the master-word abroad there would be no answering and so i fear that the monster and force of evil _ know _ yet at time the master-word would answer to we beat steadily in the night and when we question afresh we know that they in the lesser redoubt have catch the beat of the master-word and so make reply though it have not be they who have make the previous talk which we have seek to test by the word and then they would make contradiction of all that have be speak so cunningly so that we know the monster and force have seek to tempt some from the safety of the redoubt yet be this no new thing as i have make to hint save that it grow now to a greater persistence and there be a loathsome cunning in the use of this new knowledge to the making of wicked and false message by those evil thing of the night land and it tell to we as i have make remark how that those monster and force have a full awaredness of the speech between the pyramid yet could they have no power to say the master-word so have we some test leave and a way to sure knowledge of what make talk in the night and all that i have tell should bring to those of this age something of the yet unbegotten terror of that and a quiet and sound thankfulness to god that we suffer not as humanity shall yet suffer but for all this let it not be think that they of that age account it as suffer but as no more than the usual of human existence and by this may we know that we can meet all circumstance and use ourselves to they and live through they wisely if we be but prudent and consider means of invention and through all the night land there be a extraordinary awakening among the monster and force so that the instrument make constant note of greater power at work out there in the darkness and the monstruwacan be busy recording and keep a very strict watch and so be there at all that time a sense of difference and awakening and of wonder about and to come and from the country whence come the great laughter the laughter sound constant as it be a uncomfortable and heart-shaking voice-thunder rolling thence over the land out from the unknown east and the pit of the red smoke fill all the deep valley with redness so that the smoke rise above the edge and hide the basis of the tower upon the far side and the giant could be see plentiful around the kiln to the east and from the kiln great belch of fire though the meaning of it as of all else we could not say but only the cause and from the mountain of the voice which rise to the south-east of the south-east watcher and of which i have make no tell hitherto in this faulty setting-out i hear for the first time in that life the calling of the voice and though the record make mention of it yet not often be it hear and the calling be shrill and very peculiar and distressful and horrible as though a giant-woman hungering strangely shout unknown word across the night and this be how it seem to I and many think this to describe the sound and by all this may you perceive how that land be awaken and other trick there be to entice we into the night land and once a call come thrilling in the aether and tell to we that certain human have escape from the lesser redoubt and draw nigh to we but be faint for food and crave succor yet when we send the master-word into the night the creature without could make no reply which be a very happy thing for we soul for we have be all mightily exercise in we heart by this one message and now have proof that it be but a trap and constantly and at all hour i would have speech with naanus of the lesser redoubt for i have teach she how she might send she thought through the night with she brain-element but not to over-use this power for it exhaust the body and the power of the mind if it be abuse by exceed usage yet despite that i have teach she the use of she brain-element she send she message always without strength save when she have use of the instrument and this i set to the cause that she have not the health force needful but apart from this she have the night-hearing very keen though less than mine and so with many time of speech and constant telling of we doings and thought we draw near in the spirit to one another and have always a feeling in we heart that we have be give previous acquaintance and this as may be think thrill my heart very strangely iv the hushing of the voice -lrb- dearest thine own foot tread the world at night -- tread as moon-flakes step across a dark -- kiss the very dew to holier light thy voice a song past mountain which to hark frighten my soul with a utter lose delight -rrb- now one night towards the end of the sixteenth hour as i make ready to sleep there come all about I the thrilling of the aether as happen oft in those day but the thrilling have a strange power in it and in my soul the voice of naani sound plain all within and about I yet though i know it to be the voice of naani i answer not immediately save to send the sure question of the master-word into the night and directly i hear the answer the master-word beating steadily in the night and i question naanus why she have speech with I by the instrument at that time when all be sleep and the watch set among the monstruwacan for they in the little pyramid have they sleep-time to commence at the eleventh hour so that by this it be five hour advance towards the time of waking and naanus should have sleep nor have be abroad to the tower of observation apart from she father for i suppose that she speak by the instrument she voice sound very clear in my brain yet to this question she make no answer in kind but give a certain thing into my spirit which set I tremble for she say certain word that begin : dearest thine own foot tread the world at night -- and it well may be that she set I to tremble for as the word grow about I there waken a memory-dream how that i have make these same word to mirdath the beautiful in the long-gone eternity of this we age when she have die and leave I alone in all the world and i be weak a little with the tumult and force of my emotion but in a moment i call eagerly with my brain-element to naanus to give some explain of this thing that she have speak to the utter troubling of my heart yet once more she make no direct answer but speak the word again to I across all the dark of the world and it come to I suddenly that it be not naani that speak but mirdath the beautiful from out of all the everlasting night and i call : mirdath mirdath with my brain-element into the night and lo the far faint voice speak again to my spirit through all the darkness of eternity say again those word yet though the voice be the voice of mirdath the beautiful it be also the voice of naanus and i know in all my heart that this thing be in verity and that it have be give to I to be birthe once more into this world in the living-time of that only one with whom my spirit and essence have mate in all age through the everlasting and i call with my brain-element and all my strength to naanus but there come no answer neither sign of hearing though through hour i call and thus at last i come to a utter exhaustion but neither could be quiet nor sleep yet presently i sleep and when i wake my first memory be of the wondrous thing which have befall in the sleep-time for none in all this world could have know those word save it have be the spirit of mirdath my beautiful one look from above my shoulder in that utter-lost time as i make those word to she out of a ache and a broken heart and the voice have be the voice of mirdath and the voice of mirdath have be the voice of naanus and what shall any say to this save that which i have in my heart and immediately i call to naani once and again twice and in a little moment there come all about I the throbbing of the master-word beating solemnly in the night and i send the master-word to give assurance and immediately the voice of naanus a little weak as be it always when she have not the instrument but send the message with she brain-element and i answer she and question she eagerly concern she saying of the past time of sleep but she disclaim and make clear to I that she have no knowledge of have speak but have sleep through all that time of which i make to tell and indeed have dream a very strange dream and for a little while i be confuse and meditate not know what to think but come suddenly again to a knowledge that naanus 's far voice be thrill the aether all about and that she would tell to I she dream which have set strong upon she mind and she tell the dream to I and in the dream she have see a tall dark man build very big and dress in unfamiliar clothing and the man have be in a little room and very sorrowful and lonesome and in she dream she have go nigh to he and presently the man make to write that he might ease he by give expression to he sorrow and naanus have be able to read the word that he write though to she waking spirit the language in which they be writ be strange and unknown yet she could not remember what he have writ save but one short line and this she have mind of in that he have writ the word mirdath above and she speak of the strangeness of this thing that she should dream of this name but suppose that i have fix it upon she by my first calling and then do i with something of a tremble in my spirit ask naanus to tell I what she remember of the writing of that big sorrowful stranger and in a little moment she far voice say these word all about I : dearest thine own foot tread the world at night -- but no more have she memory of yet it be a sufficiency and i maybe with a mad strange triumph in my soul say unto she with my brain-element that which remain of those word and my spirit feel they strike upon the spirit of naanus and awake she memory as with the violence of a blow and for a little while she stumble dumb before so much newness and certainly and she spirit then to waken and she near weep with the fright and the sudden new wonder of this thing and immediately all about I there come she voice thrilling and the voice be the voice of mirdath and the voice of naanus and i hear the tear of she spirit make pure and wonderful the bewildered and grow gladness of she far voice and she ask I as one who have suddenly open the gate of memory whether she might be truly mirdath and i utter weak and shake strangely because of this splendor of fulfilment could make no instant answer and she ask again but use mine old love-name and with a sureness in she far voice and still i be so strangely dumb and the blood to thud peculiar in mine ear and this to pass and speech to come swift and this way to be that meeting of we spirit across all the everlasting night and you shall have for a memory-picture how that naani stand there in the world in that far eternity and with she spirit have speech with mine look back through the part-opened gate of she memory into the past of this we life and age yet more than this she see and more than be give to I in that age for she have memory now and sight of other instance and of other coming together which have some confusion and but half-meaning to I yet of this we present age and life we speak as of some yesterday but very hallowed now as may be conceive the wonder of this surety which have come into my life stir I fiercely to its completion for all my heart and spirit cry out to be with that one who be mirdath and now speak with the voice of naani yet how should this be win for none among all the learn man of that mighty pyramid know the position of the lesser redoubt neither could the record and history of the world give we that knowledge only that there be a general thought among the student and the monstruwacan that it lay between the north-west and the north-east but no man have any surety neither could any conceive of the distance from we of that refuge and count all this there be yet the incredible danger and peril of the night land and the hunger and desolation of the outer land which be sometimes name the unknown land and i speak much with naanus concern this matter of they position yet neither she nor she father the master monstruwacan of that refuge have any know either of we position only that the builder of the lesser redoubt have come out of the southward world in the beginning as they have knowledge of by the record also the father of naani set that ancient compass to bear for as he make explanation to we through the instrument so great a power of the earth-current must be ours that perchance it be we force which do affect the pointer from steadfastness for indeed the needle do swing in a arc as we hear that hold between the north and the south within the westward arc but this it have do ever with they and so be a very helpless guide save that maybe as we have think the force of the earth-current that be with we have in truth some power to pull the needle towards we and if this be so of verity we make a reckoning that set the lesser redoubt to the north and they do likewise and put we to the south yet be it all build upon the sand of guess-work and nothing to adventure the life and soul upon now we of curiosity though a million time have it be do in the past age set the compass before we have it from the great museum but as ever in that age it do spin if we but stir the needle and would stop nowhere with surety for the flow of the earth-current from the crack beneath the pyramid have a power to affect it away from the north and to set it wander and this may seem very strange to this present age yet to that it be most true to the seeming nature of thing and harder to believe that ever it do once point steadfastly to prove a guide of sureness and unfailing for be it know we know the position of the land by tradition come from that ancient time when in the half-gloom they have build the pyramid they have know the use of that ancient compass and with sight of the sun have name the position though we of that far future day have forget the very beginning of those name of direction and use they but because we father do a million year and more and likewise we do the same with the name of the day and the night and the week and the month and the year though of the visible marking of these there be nothing but only and always the everlasting night yet the same seeming very natural to that people now naani have heed to my constant question crave with a utter keen hunger that i might come to she but yet forbid it in that it be better to live and commune in the spirit than to risk my soul and mayhap die in the foolishness of try to find she in all the darkness of the dead world yet no heed have i take of she command have i but know of a surety the _ direction _ in which she might be discover and gain some knowledge of the space between for this might be name by thousand of mile or but by hundred though a great distance it be surely yet one other thing there be that have point in this place for when i send my speech out into the night use my brain-element i come to know that whether i have a knowledge of the north or no knowledge at the moment yet do i turn oft with a sure instinction to that direction and of this the master monstruwacan take very great note and have I to experiment many a time and way and so enclosed about with screen or with bandage across mine eye that i could not save by that inward know have any knowledge to point I the way yet would i turn northwards very frequent by a certain feeling and seem unable of speech if i be turn otherwise by force but when we ask naani whether she have a unusualness in this matter she could discover none and we could but take note curiously of that which affect my habit and which truly i set to the attract of she spirit for i have mind that she do be somewhere out that way in the darkness of the world but yet be this no more than to suppose as you perceive and the master monstruwacan write a study of this matter of the northwardness of my turn and it be set out in the hour-slip of the tower of observation and so it come to be copy by the hour-slip of the great city and make much comment and much call up to I through the home instrument so that with this and the speech that go about concern my power to hear i be much in talk and diversely pleased and oft anger by overmuch attention and importunity and now whilst i pondered this matter in all my spirit and be how that i should some way come to naanus there befall a very terrible thing and in this wise must i tell it : it be at the seventeenth hour when all the million of the mighty pyramid sleep that i be with the master monstruwacan in the tower of observation take my due turn and sudden i hear the thrilling of the aether all about I and the voice of naanus in my soul speak and i send the master-word into the darkness of the world and presently i hear the solemn answer beat steadfastly in the night and immediately i call to naanus with my brain-element to know what thing trouble she in she sleep and she voice come into my spirit weak and far and faint and so that scarce i could make to hear the word yet in a while i gather that all the people of the lesser redoubt be in very deadly trouble for that the earth-current have fail suddenly and mightily and they have call she from she sleep that she might listen whether we answer they calling by the instrument but indeed no call have come to we and they who have be of late so joyful be now grow old with sorrow in but a hour or two for they fear that the fresh come of the earth-current have be but the final flicker and outburst before the end and even in this short while of we speech do it seem to I that the voice of naanus grow further off from I and i feel like to have break my heart with the trouble of this thing and through all that remain of that sleep-time do i converse with naanus as might two lover who shall presently part forever and when the city awake the news go throughout they and all we million be in sorrow and trouble and thus be it for maybe a little month and in that time have the voice of naani grow so weak and far-off that even i that have the night-hearing could scarce make real its meaning and every word be to I a treasure and a touch upon my soul and my grief and trouble before this certain parting drive I that i could not eat neither have rest and this do the master monstruwacan take upon he to chide and correct for that if any be to help how should it be do if i that have the night-hearing and hear even now that the recording instrument be dumb come to ill-health and because of this and such wisdom as be mine i make to eat and order my life that i might have my full power yet be this beyond all my strength for presently i know that the people of the lesser pyramid be threaten by the monster that beset they and later i have knowledge from faint far word whisper in my brain that there have be a fight with a outside force that have harm many in they mind so that in madness they have open the gate and have run from the lesser pyramid out into the darkness of the land about they and there have they physical body fall to the monster of those land but of they soul who may know and this we set assuredly to the failure of the earth-current which have rob they of all force and power so that in those few week all life and joy of living have leave they and neither hunger nor thirst have they much nor any great desire to live but yet a new and mighty fear of death and this doth seem very strange and as may be think all this make the people of the great redoubt think newly of the earth-current that issue from the crack beneath the pyramid and of they latter end so that much be writ in the hour-slip concern this matter yet in the main to assure we that we ourselves might each be free from a disturbed heart though some go foolishly to the other event and speak of a speedy danger to we likewise as be ever the way but the truth of we own case lay maybe somewhere between and all the hour-slip be full also of imagining of the terror of those poor human out in the darkness of the world face that end which must come upon all even upon we mighty pyramid though as most would believe so far away in some future eternity that we have no cause to trouble and there be sad poem writ to the people of that lesser redoubt and foolish plan set about to rescue they but none to put they to effect and no way by which so great a thing might be do and doth but show how loosely people will speak out of a over-security yet to I there have come a certain knowledge that i must make the adventure though i achieve naught save mine own end yet it be better to cease quickly than that i should feel as now i do feel that same night in the eighteenth hour there be a great disturbance in the aether about the mighty pyramid and i be awaken suddenly by the master monstruwacan that i might use my gift of the night-hearing to hearken for the throbbing of the master-word which they have think to come vaguely through the instrument but no one of the monstruwacan be sensitive enough of soul to account truly whether this be so and lo as i sit up in the bed there come the sound of the master-word beating in the night about the pyramid and immediately there be a cry in the aether all about I : we be come we be come and mine inwards leap and sicken I a moment so shake be i with a sudden belief for the message seem some way to come to I from very near to the great redoubt as that they who send it be nigh to hand and forthwith i call the master-word into the night but no answer do there come for a while and then a faint thrilling of the aether about I and the weak pulse of the master-word in the night send by a far voice strangely distant and i know that the voice be the voice of naanus and i put a question through all the darkness of the dead world whether she be within the lesser redoubt and safe thus far and presently there come a faint disturbance about I and a small voice in my soul speak weakly and out of a infinite distance and i know that far away through the night naani speak feebly with she brain-element and that she abide within the lesser pyramid but that she too have hear that strange pulse of the master-word in the night and that message : we be come we be come and vastly have this thing disturb she wake she within she sleep so that she know not what to think save that we be devise some method to come to they but this i remove from doubt say that she must not build on vain hope for i would not have she doubly tortured by the vanity of such believe and thereafter have say such thing as i might though few they be to comfort she i bade she gently to sleep and turn therewith to the master monstruwacan who wait in quiet patience and have no knowledge of that which i have hear and send for he hearing be but the normal though he brain and heart be such as make I to love he and i tell the master monstruwacan many thing as i put my clothing about I how that there have indeed be the calling of the master-word but not by any of that lesser redoubt but that to my belief it have come from nigh about the great pyramid moreover it be send by no instrument as i wotted that he do guess but as it seem to I by the brain-element of many call in unison and all this do i set out to the master monstruwacan and with something uncertain of fear and trouble in my heart yet with a blind expectation as indeed who would not though no longer be i shake by that first thought of she nearness and i say to the master monstruwacan that we should go to the tower of observation and search the night land with the great spy-glass and we do this and lo presently we see a great number of man pass over the electric circle that go about the pyramid yet they come not _ to _ we but go outwards towards the blackness and the strange fire and hideous mystery of the night land and we cease from spy and look swiftly at one another and know in we heart that some have leave the mighty pyramid in the sleep-time then the master monstruwacan send word to the master watchman that he wardership have be outraged and that people leave the great pyramid in the sleep-time for this be against the law and none ever go out into the night land save the full watch be post to the great door and at a due time when all be wakeful for the opening of the door be make know to all the million of the great redoubt so that all might be aware and know that no foolishness be do without they wott moreover ere any have power to leave the pyramid they must pass the examination and be prepare and some of this have i set out already and so stern be the framing of the law that there be yet the metal peg upon the inner side of the great gate where have be stretch the skin of one who disobey and be flay and he hide set there to be a warning in the early day yet the tradition be remember for as i might say it we live very close about the place and memory have no room whereby she might escape now the master watchman when he hear that which the master monstruwacan have to tell go hastily with some of the central watch from the watch-dome to the great gate and he find the man of the sleep-time watch with the warder of the gate all bind and stopt in the mouth so that none could make outcry and he free they and learn that nigh five hundred young man from the upper city by the bigness of they chest have come upon they suddenly and bind they and escape into the night through the eye-gate in the top of the great gate and the master watchman be angry and demand why that none have call by the instrument of the watch house but lo some have make to call thus and find they unable to wake the recorder which lay in the central watch-dome for there have be tamper now after this they make certain new rule and law concern the order of watch and make test of the lesser instrument of the inward pyramid nightly upon the come of the sleep-time which be even in that strange age by tradition call the night as i have give hint though hitherto until the way of my story be know i have use a word for the sleep hour that be yet not of that time but somewhat a invention to make this history free from the confusion of night and day when in truth it be always night without upon the world yet after this shall i keep to mine use the luxury of the true name of that time and yet how strange be it that the truth should be of so little to we thinking and so to go forward with my tell for though all this care be now take it have no force until afterward and at this moment be those poor foolish youth out in all the danger of the night land and no way by which they might be succour or call back save that fear or wisdom should come to they quickly that they cease from so wild a attempt for it be to make rescue of those in that other unknown pyramid out in all the darkness of the world 's night that be they intent as we have speedy knowledge from those boon friend that have be in the secret of they plot which have seem to they great and heroic and be so in verity but that neither they who go nor they who stay have a true awaredness of the danger they have deal with be all naught but raw and crude youth yet doubtless with the makings of many fine and great man among they and because some have thus abet that which they know to be against the law which be frame to the well-being and safety of all there be certain flogging which might the better help they memory in the future as to the properness of they action and wisdom moreover they who return if any would be flog as seem proper after due examination and though the news of they beating might help all other to hesitation ere they do foolishly in like fashion yet be the principle of the flogging not on this base which would be both improper and unjust but only that the one in question be correct to the best advantage for he own well-being for it be not meet that any principle of correction should shape to the making of human signpost of pain for the benefit of other for in verity this be to make one pay the cost of many 's learning and each should owe to pay only so much as shall suffice for the teaching of he own body and spirit and if other profit thereby this be but accident however helpful and this be wisdom and denoteth now that a sound principle shall prevent practice from become monstrous yet now i must hasten that i set down how it fare with those five hundred youth that have make so sad a adventure of they life and unprepared soul and be beyond we aid to help they who might not so much as make any call to they to bid they to return for to do this would have be to tell to all the monster of the land that human be abroad from the mighty pyramid and this would have be to cause the monster to search the youth out to they destruction and maybe even to awaken the force to work they some dread spiritual harm which be the chief fear now presently through all the city of the great redoubt the news have go how that five hundred foolish youth have adventure out into the despair of the night land and the whole pyramid wake to life and the people of the south come to the northern side for the great gate lay in the north-west side and the youth have make from there not straightly outwards but towards the north and so be to be see from the north-east embrasure and from those within the north-west wall and thus in a while be they watch by all the mighty multitude of the great pyramid through million of spy-glass for each human have a spying-glass as may be think and some be a hundred year old and some maybe ten thousand and hand down through many generation and some but newly make and very strange but all those people have some instrument by which they might spy out upon the wonder of the night land for so have it be ever through all the eternity of darkness and a great diversion and wonder of life be it to behold the monster about they work and to know that they plot always to we destruction yet be ever foiled and never do all that great and terrible land grow stale upon the soul of any from birth until death and by this you shall know the constant wonder of it and that _ sense of enemy in the night about we _ which ever fill the heart and spirit of all beholder so that never be the embrasure utterly empty yet many behold not the land from the embrasure but sit about the view-table which be set properly in certain place throughout the city and so behold the night land without undue craning or poising of spy-glass though less plain-seen and these same table be some form of that which we of this age name camera obscura but make very great and with invention and low to the floor so that ten thousand people might sit about they in the raise gallery and have comfortable sight yet this attract not the young people save they be lover and then in truth be they comfortable seat for quietness and gentle whispering yet now as may be suppose with all the people of the mighty pyramid grow eager to look towards one part of the night land the embrasure be hide in the crowd and such as could gain no view therethrough throng about the view-table and so be it in all the hour of leisure so that woman have scarce patience to attend they child but must hasten to watch again that lonesome band of foolish youth make so blind and unshaped a trial to come upon that unknown lesser redoubt somewhere out in all the night of the world and in this wise pass three day and night yet both in the sleep-time and the time of wake do great multitude cease not to watch so that many go hungry for sleep as in truth do i and sometimes we see those youth with plainness but other time they be lose to we sight in the utter shadow of the night land yet by the tell of we instrument and the sense of my hearing there be no awaredness among the monster and the force of evil that any be abroad from the pyramid so that a little hope come into we heart that yet there might be no tragedy and time would they cease from they way and sit about in circle among the shadow and the gray moss-bush which grow hardly here or there about and we know that they have food with they to eat for this could we see with plainness as some odd grim flare of light from the infernal fire strike upon one or another strangely and pass and leave they in the darkness and who of you shall conceive what be in the heart of the father and the mother that bear the youth and who never cease away from the northward embrasure but spy out in terror and in tear and maybe oft with so good glass as do show they the very feature and look upon the face of son and son and the kin of the watcher bring to they food and tend they so that they have no need to cease from they watch and bed be make in the embrasure rough and resourceful that they might sleep quickly a little yet be ever ready if those cruel monster without make discovery of those they child thrice in those three day of journey to the northward do the youth sleep and we perceive that some keep a watch and so know that there be a kind of order and leadership among they also they have each he weapon upon he hip and this give to we a further plea to hope and concern this same carrying of weapon i can but set out here that no healthful male or female in all the mighty pyramid but possess such a weapon and be train to it from childhood so that a ripe and extraordinary skill in the use thereof be common to most yet some breaking of rule have there be that the youth have each achieve to be arm for the weapon be store in every tenth house of the city in the care of the charging-master and here i must make know that these weapon do not shoot but have a disk of gray metal sharp and wonderful that spin in the end of a rod of gray metal and be someway charge by the earth-current so that be any but stricken thereby they be cut in twain so easy as aught and the weapon be contrived to the repelling of any army of monster that might make to win entrance to the redoubt and to the eye they have somewhat the look of strange battle-axis and might be lengthen by the pull out of the handle now the youth make as i have tell to the northward but have first to keep a long way to the north-east that they might come clear of the vale of red fire and this wise they journey and keep the vale about seven mile to the north-west of they and so be presently beyond the watcher of the north-east and go with a greater freedom and have less care to hide and this way it may be certain of the giant wander perceive they and go swiftly to make attack and destroy they but some order go about among the youth and they make a long line with a certain space between each because of the terror of they weapon and immediately it seem the giant be upon they a score and seven they be and seem to be hair like to mighty crab as i see with the great spy-glass when the great flare of far and mighty fire throw they fierce light across the dark land and there be a very great and horrid fight for the youth break into circle about each of the giant and many of those young man be tear in piece but they smite the monster from behind and upon every side and we of the mighty pyramid could behold at time the gray strange gleam of they weapon and the jether be stir about I by the passing of those that die yet by reason of the great mile they scream come not to we neither hear we the roar of the monster but into we heart even from that great distance and safety there steal the terror of those awesome brute and in the great spy-glass i could behold the great joint and limb and e ` en i think the foul sweat of they and they size and brutishness be like to that of odd and monstrous animal of the olden world yet part human and it must be bear to mind that the father and the mother of those youth behold all this dread fight from the embrasure and they other kin likewise watch and a very drear sight be it to they heart and they human natural feeling and like to breed old age ere its due then in a time the fight cease for of those seven and twenty giant brute there remain none only that there cumber the ground seven and twenty lumber hillock dreadful and grim for the lesser dead we could not see proper and we that be within the pyramid see the youth sort together by they leader all in the dim twilight of that place and with the great spy-glass i make a rough count and find that there live of they three hundred and by this shall you know the power of those few monstrous thing which have slay full two hundred though each youth be arm with so wondrous a weapon and i set the word through the pyramid that all might have some knowledge of the number that have die for it be better to know than to be in doubt and no spy-glass have the power of the great spy-glass after this fight the youth spend a time have a care to they body and wound and some be make separate from the other and of these i count upon fifty and whilst the other make to continue they march towards the road where the silent one walk these be constrain by one who be the leader to return to the pyramid and in a little i see that they come towards we wearily and with many a halt as that they suffer great wound and harm of the fight but those other -lrb- maybe two hundred and fifty youth -rrb- go onwards into the night land and though we sorrow at this thing yet be there come a huge pride into we heart that those raw one who yesterday be but child have so hold themselves in the battle and do a great deed that day and i wot that whilst they mother weep easeless they father ' heart swell within they and hold somewhat of they pain away from they for a time and all this while those wound youth come slowly and rest and come on again the better help the worse and a great excitement and trouble there be in all the mighty pyramid to learn which be they that come and they that go and who lay out there quietly among the slay but none might say anything with surety for even with that great spy-glass in the tower of observation they be not overplain save when some light from the fire of the land flare high and light they for they stand not up into the glare of the fire as have the giant and though i see they with clearness yet i know they not for there be so mighty a multitude in that vast redoubt that none might ever know the half even of they ruler and about this time there come a fresh matter of trouble to we mind for one of the monstruwacan make report that the instrument be record a influence abroad in the night so that we have knowledge that one of the evil force be out and to I there come a awaredness that a strange unquiet steal over the land yet i know it not with mine ear but my spirit hear and it be as though trouble and a expectation of horror do swarm about I and once listen i hear the master-word beating strangely low and i know the aether to thrill about I and a faint stir be there in my soul as of a faint voice speaking and i know that naanus call to I some message across the night of the world yet weak and come without clear meaning so that i be torment and could but send comfort to she with my brain-element and presently i know that she cease to speak and later i hear that there be a new matter forward in the redoubt for ten thousand man have assemble to attend the room of preparation for the short preparation and by this we know that those poor youth who stumble towards we through the dark be presently to have help and through all that sleep-time there go forward the spiritual and the physical preparation of the ten thousand and upon the morrow they sleep whilst a hundred thousand make ready they arm and in this space of time the two hundred and fifty youth that go towards the road where the silent one walk have come very nigh thereto have go very warily and with some slowness because as may be of the lesson of the giant and to we in the pyramid the instrument make known constantly that influence which be abroad and which all those of the tower of observation think to proceed from the house of silence yet nothing could we see with the great spy-glass and so could come to no sure know but only to fear and wonder and presently the youth be upon the great road and turn to the northward and beyond they a great way stand the house of silence upon a low hill at a certain distance to the right of the road by now they that be wound have come to within maybe fifteen mile of the great redoubt and the news go through all the city that the ten thousand man that be prepare make to arm themselves and i go down by the tower lift and see they come down by thousand from the room of preparation and none might go nigh to they or cause they to speak for they be make ready and be as it might be holy and all the million of the mighty pyramid stand in they city about certain of the main lift and watch those thousand go downward all in they armor of gray metal and each one arm with the disko which be that same very terrible weapon which all have training to and i doubt not but that the young man of the pyramid look with longing in they heart that they might have be among those that go forth to succor yet the older man have graver thought in they heart for the blood run more soberly in they and they have knowledge and memory of the peril and by this i would make clear that i speak less of the peril of the body which be common to every state of life but of the peril of the spirit and it may be think by those of this age that it be most strange that they of that have all the knowledge of eternity to aid they have no weapon by which to shoot and kill at a distance but indeed this have not be so in the past as we history do show for some wondrous weapon there have be that might slay without sound or flash at a full score mile and more and some we have whole within the great museum and of other but the part in decay for they have be foolish thing and reckless to use for we of that great pyramid want not to kill a few of the monster that lay at a great distance but only those which come nigh to harm we and concern those same weapon that kill silently at a great distance we have now little knowledge save that they do waste the earth-current and no practice have we concern they workings for it be maybe a hundred thousand year go that they have be use and find to be of no great worth in a close attack and harmful otherwise to the peace in that they anger unneedful the force of that land slaying wantonly those monster which do no more than beset the mighty redoubt at a great distance for as may be see by a little thought we do very gladly keep a reasonable quietness and refrain from aught that should wake that land for we be bear to the custom of that strange life and live and die in peace for the most part and be very content to have security and to be neutral in all thing that do not overbear we but as it be always arm and ready but concern the great and evil force that be abroad in the night land these we have no power to harm nor could we hope for more than that we have security from they which indeed we have but the hugeness of they power be about we and we dare not to wake it save through such extremity as have come to pass by this folly of the youth though even now we have no thought to attack aught but only to succor those wounded one and concern this simplicity of weapon which excite somewhat even my wonder in this we present age it may be that the power of chemistry be someway quaintly limit by condition in that age and there to be always a need to spare the earth-current and hence by this cause and by that we be bring by the extreme nigh to the simplicity of the early world yet with a strange and mighty difference as all may know who have read now presently the word be send to every city throughout the great redoubt -- as be the law -- that the great gate should be open and each city send its master to form the full watch as be the law and each go clothe in gray armor and carry the disko and the full watch number two thousand for there be also the watchman then the light in the great causeway be make dim so that the opening of the gate should cast no great glare from within into the night land to tell the watcher of the north-west and all the monster that certain human go out from the mighty pyramid but whether the vast and hidden force of evil have knowledge we know not and they who go must but chance it remember that they be prepare and have the capsule and the ten thousand that be prepared go out through the great gateway into the night and the full watch stand back from they and speak no word but salute silently with the disko and they that go raise each the disko a little and pass out into the dark then the great gate be shut and we make to wait and to watch with trouble and expectation within we heart and at the embrasure many do comfort the woman of those man and i go back upwards by mile until i come to the tower of observation and i look out from there into the night land and see that the ten thousand halt at the circle and make arrangement of themselves and send some before and upon either hand and so go forward into the night land and after that i go to the great spy-glass and turn it towards the two hundred and fifty youth that be far off upon the road where the silent one walk yet for awhile i could not perceive they for all the road seem empty but afterward i see they and they be clamber back into the road have go aside as i think because of the passing of one of those silent one that i saw now at a distance to the southward of they there pass then some three hour and in that time i vary my watch between those far-off youth and the ten-thousand that go forward to succor the wound that be now maybe scarce nine mile distant from the mighty pyramid and the ten-thousand come very close to they and in truth in a little while they spy one the other and i gather in spirit something of the rejoicing of those youth yet weak and troubled be they because of they wound and they knowledge of failure and they disobedience of the law and presently they be surround by the ten-thousand and carry upon sling and all that body swing round towards the pyramid and come back at a great pace and in the same time i hear the sound that make they so swift to hasten for there smite up through the night the baying of the hound and we know that they be discover and i sweep the great spy-glass over the land towards the valley of the hound that i might discover they quickly and i see they come lumber at a strange gallop and great as horse and it might be only ten mile to the east and i look once upon the watcher of the north-east and i saw and marvel that the great bell-ear quiver constantly and i know that it have knowledge and give signal to all the land then do one of the monstruwacan report that a new and terrible influence be abroad in the land and by the instrument we have knowledge that it approach and some of the monstruwacan call foolishly with weak voice to the ten-thousand to haste forget and desire only they safety from that which come near then look with the great spy-glass i see that there move across the land from the direction of the plain of blue fire a mighty hump seeming of black mist and come with prodigious swiftness and i call to the master monstruwacan that he come and look through one of the eye-piece that be about the great spy-glass and he come quickly and when he have look a while he call to the monstruwacan that have make report and the monstruwacan answer and reply that the influence draw nearer by the reading of the instrument yet of the thing itself the man have no sight and i cease not to look and in a little while the humped thing pass downward into the vale of red fire which lay across the land that way but i watch steadfastly and presently i see the black hump climb up from the vale of red fire upon this side and come through the night so that in scarce a minute it have come halfway across that part of the night land and my heart stand quiet with fear and the utter terror of this monster which i know to be surely one of the great force of evil of that land and have power without doubt to destroy the spirit and the master monstruwacan leap towards the home-call and send the great sound down to the ten-thousand that they might attend and immediately he signal to they to beware yet already i perceive that they know of this utter danger that be upon they for i see they slay the youth quickly that they spirit might not be lose for they be unprepared but the man be prepare have the capsule and would die swiftly in the last moment i look again towards the hump and see that it come like a hill of blackness in the land and be almost anigh then there happen a wonder for in that moment when all have else go quickly that they might save they soul out of the earth there rise a little light like to the crescent of the young moon of this early day and the crescent rise up into a arch of bright and cold fire glowing but little and it span above the ten-thousand and the dead and the hump stand still and go backwards and be presently lose and the man come swiftly towards the mighty pyramid yet ere they be come to safety the baying of the hound sound close upon they and they face to the danger yet as i could know without despair because that they yet live after so enormous a peril and the hound be very nigh as now i beheld with the great spy-glass and i count five score run with mighty head low and in a pack and lo as the hound come at they the ten-thousand draw apart and have a space between the man that they might have full use of that terrible disko and they fight with the handle at length and i see the disk spin and glisten and send out fire then be there a very great battle for the light that arch above they and hold away the power from they soul make not to protect they from this danger of the lesser monster and at a hundred thousand embrasure within the mighty pyramid the woman cry and sob and look again and in the lower city it be tell after that the people could hear the crash and splinter of the armor as the hound run to and fro slaying aye even the sound of the armor between they tooth yet the ten-thousand cease not to smite with the disko and they hew the hound in piece but of the man that go forth there be a thousand and seven hundred slay by the hound ere the man win to victory then come that wearied band of hero back to the home shelter of the vast redoubt and they bear they dead with they and the youth that they slew and they be receive with great honor and with exceed grief and in a great silence for the thing admit not of word until a time have pass and in the city of the pyramid there be mourn for there have be no sorrow like unto this through mayhap a hundred thousand year and they bear the youth to they mother and to they father and the father of each make thanks to the man that they have save the soul of he son but the woman be silent yet neither to the father nor to the mother be ever make know the name of the slayer for this might not be as all shall see with a little thought and some do remember that in verity all be due to the unwisdom of those youth who have heed not the law and they life-teaching yet have they pay to the uttermost and pass outwards and the account of they deed be close and all this while do great number spy toward the road where the silent one walk that they might watch that band of youth afar in the night land who go forward amid those horrid danger yet when the dead youth have be bring in many have cease to look out for a time and have turn to question and some have make inspection that they might know which have come back and which lay out there where the giant have slay they or go forward to more dreadful matter but who of those that be abroad be slay or still go onward we have but indifferent knowledge though the man of the ten-thousand know somewhat have have speech with the wound youth ere they slew they and as may be think these man be sorely question by the mother and the father of those youth that be not account of yet i doubt that few have much knowledge wherewith to console they now there be presently in the garden of silence which be the lowermost of all the underground field the ending of those seventeen hundred hero and of the youth that they save and slew and the garden be a great country and a hundred mile every way and the roof thereof be three great mile above and shape to a mighty dome as it have be that the builder and maker thereof do remember in they spirit the visible sky of this we present age and the making of that country be all set out in a single history of seven thousand and seventy volume and there be likewise seven thousand and seventy year spend to the making of that country so that there have unremembered generation live and labor and die and see not the end of they labor and love have shape it and hallowed it so that of all the wonder of the world there have be none that shall ever come anigh to that country of silence -- a hundred mile every way of silence to the dead and there be in that roof seven moon set in a mighty circle and light by the earth-current and the circle be sixty mile across so that all that country of quiet be visible yet to no great glare but a sweet and holy light so that i do always feel in my heart that a man might weep there and be unashamed and in the midst of that silent country there be a great hill and upon the hill a vast dome and the dome be full of a light that might be see in all that country which be the garden of silence and beneath the dome be the crack and within it the glory of the earth-current from which all have life and light and safety and in the dome at the north there be a gateway and a narrow road go upward to the gateway and the road be name the last road and the gateway be name by no name but know to all as the gateway and there be in that mighty country long roadway and hidden method to help travel and constant temple of rest along the mile and grove and the charm of water fall and everywhere the statue of memory and the tablet of memory and the whole of that great underground country full of a echo of eternity and of memory and love and greatness so that to walk alone in that land be to grow back to the wonder and mystery of childhood and presently to go upward again to the city of the mighty pyramid purify and sweeten of soul and mind and in my boyhood i have wander oft a week of day in that country of silence and have my food with I and sleep quietly amid the memory and go on again wrap about with the quiet of the everlasting and the man-soul within would be draw mightily to those place where the great one of the past eternity of the world have they memory name but there be that within I which ever draw I in the end to the hill of the babe those little hill where might be hear amid the lonesomeness of a utter quiet a strange and wondrous echo as of a little child call over the hill but how this be i know not save by the sweet cunning of some dead maker in the forget year and here mayhap by reason of this voice of pathos be to be find the countless token of memory to all the babe of the mighty pyramid through a thousand age and odd while would i come upon some mother sit there lonely or mayhaps company by other and by this little tell shall you know somewhat of the quietness and the wonder and the holiness of that great country hallowed to all memory and to eternity and to we dead and it be here into the country of silence that they bring down the dead to they burial and there come down into the country of silence maybe a hundred million out of the city of the pyramid to be present and to do honor now they that have charge of the dead do lay they upon the road which run up unto the gateway even that same road which be name the last road and the road move upwards slowly with the dead and the dead go inward through the gateway first the poor youth and afterward they that have give up life that they might save they and as the dead go upwards there be a very great silence over all the mile of the country of silence but in a little while there come from afar off a sound as of a wind wail and it come onward out of the distance and pass over the hill of the babe which be a great way off and so come anigh to the place where i stand even as the blowing of a sorrowful wind do it come and i know that all the great multitude do sing quietly and the singing pass onward and leave behind it a utter silence even as the wind doth rustle the corn and pass onward and all fall to a greater seeming quietness than before and the dead pass inward through the gateway into the great light and silence of the dome and come out no more and again from beyond the far hill of the babe there be that sound of the million singing and there rise up out of the earth beneath the voice of the underground organ and the noise of the sorrow pass over I and go again into the distance and leave all hushed and lo as there pass inward to the silence of the dome the last of those dead hero there come again the sound from beyond the hill of the babe and as it come more nigh i know that it be the song of honor loud and triumphant and sing by countless multitude and the voice of the organ rise up into thunder from the deep earth and there be a great honor do to the glory of the dead and afterwards once more a silence then do the people of the city arrange themselves so that from every city whence have come a hero be the people of that city gather together and when they be so gather they set up token of memory to the dead of they city but afterwards do charge artist to the making of sculpture great and beautiful to that same end and now do but place tablet against that time and afterwards the people do wander over that country of silence and make visit and honor to they ancestor if such be deserving and presently the mighty lift do raise they all to the city of the pyramid and thereafter there be something more of usualness save that ever the embrasure be full of those that watch the youth afar upon the great road and in this place i to remember how that we spy-glass have surely some power of the earth-current to make greater the impulse of the light upon the eye and they be like no spy-glass that ever you do see but oddly shaped and to touch both the forehead and the eye and give wonderful sight of the land but the great spy-glass to be beyond all this for it have the eye of it upon every side of the mighty pyramid and do be truly a huge machine and to I as i go about my duty or peer forth through the great spy-glass at the youth upon the road where the silent one walk there come at time a far faint thrilling of the aether so that sometimes i be aware that there be the beating of the master-word in the night but so strange and weak that the instrument have no wotting of it and when this come then would i call back through all the everlasting night to naanus who be indeed mirdath and i would send the master-word with my brain-element and afterwards such comfort as i might yet hard and bitter be the truth of my helplessness and weakness and the utter terror and might of the evil force and monster of the night land so that i be like to have brake my heart with ponder and the silence would come again and anon the weak thrilling of the aether but no more the far voice speaking in my soul v into the night land now after that destruction which have come upon the ten-thousand and the fresh assurance that be upon we of the terror of the night land it may be know that there could be no more think to succor though in truth those youth that go now upon the road where the silent one walk be far beyond we aid yet might it be think that we should have signal to they call by the home-call which be that great voice which go forth from the machine above the sealed base of the mighty pyramid but this we might not do for then we give signal to the monster of that land that some be even now abroad from the pyramid yet we could no more than hope that the evil force have no wotting of they for in verity none might ever know the knowledge or the ignorance which those power do possess yet it must be keep to the mind that we know even then there be a influence abroad in the land strange and quiet so that the instrument do not more than make record of it and as i have surely set down ere now we have belief that it do come from that house of silence afar in the night land upon that low hill to the north of the great road and many among the monstruwacan fear that it be direct upon the youth but of this there could be no surety and we could but wait and watch now about this time those poor youth do draw nigh to that part of the road where the silent one walk where it turn more swiftly to the north and they to be now at no mighty distance from that grim and horrid house and presently we know that the influence have a greater power in the land and i have a assuredness that it come from the house yet no certain proof be this but i set out my feeling to the master monstruwacan and he have trust in they and in my power moreover he also have belief within himself that some secret power come out from the house of silence and some talk there be at time that we send the home-call into the night to give warn to the youth of we knowledge and we fear and to entreat they to make a safe endeavor to return swiftly yet be this a error and refuse by the master monstruwacan for it be not meet that we put the soul of those youth in peril until such time as we have certainty that they should be lose if we do not bestir ourselves for indeed this home-call be as a mighty voice call over the world and do have so exceed a noise that it have immediately tell all that land how that some be yet abroad from the great redoubt and here will i set down how that the home-call have no use in those age but have be a call in the olden time when yet the great flying-ship go abroad over the world and there pass now a day and a night and in all that time there cease not great multitude to peer forth into the night land at the youth for it be know concern the influence and all feel that the youth do draw nigh very speedy to they fate and much talk there be and many thing say and much foolish speech and kind intent but no courage to go forth to make further attempt to rescue which in truth call not for great astonishment as i have surely writ or oft thought and in this place let I set down that the land be as it might be say wake and unquiet and a sense of thing pass in the night and of horrid watchfulness and there be at this time and at that low roar that go across the land and if i have not tell the same before this time it must be set to count against I and my tell for indeed i should have writ it down before this place yet be the difficulty of my task great and all must bear with I and entreat for I that i have courage so that i may come at last to strength and wisdom to tell all that i do see now in the space of this day and night it be know that the youth have not sleep neither have they eat save once as they who have the watch through the great spy-glass do affirm but they to hasten alway at a woeful speed towards the north along that great dismal road so that presently they must cease or slay themselves with they endeavor and all this do give surety to we fear that they be under a spell from that horrid house afar in the land and we have a assurance that this thing be for presently there come a monstruwacan to the master monstruwacan to report that there have come sudden a mighty influence into the land and in the same moment as it might be i spy through the great spy-glass and do see those youth break swiftly from the road where the silent one walk and begin to run very swift that they might come quickly to the house of silence then do the master monstruwacan hesitate not but do send the home-call across the world aye even to those poor doomed one that hasten unknowing to the terror which do compel they and immediately upon the sound the master do send a message to the natural eye in set language and make warn that they suffer themselves to be draw to they destruction by a force that come from within the house of silence and he beseech they to put forth the strength of they spirit and do battle for they soul and if they could in no wise compass a victory over _ that which draw they onwards _ to slay themselves quickly ere they go into that house to the horror of utter destruction and in all the pyramid be there a great silence for the bellowing of the home-call breed a quietness because of that which it do portend and it be swiftly know by the million that the master monstruwacan do plead for the soul of the youth and there go forth unknowingly a counter-force from the mighty pyramid by reason of the prayer and soul-wishing of the countless million and the counter-force be plain to my inward hearing and beat all the aether of the world into a surge of supplication so that it stun my spirit with the great power of it and it seem to I as it be that there be a vast spiritual-noise in all the night and i spy tremblingly through the great spy-glass and lo the youth do cease from they swift running and be come together in a crowd and have a seem to be confuse as might some who have wake suddenly from sleep to find that they walk in they sleep and have come to a strange place then come there a great roar from all the million that spy from the embrasure -- from nigh five hundred thousand embrasure they do look and i count not the great view-table and the shout rise up like to the roaring of a mighty wind of triumph yet be it over-early to sound for victory for the counter-force which come from the intensity of so many will blent to one intent be brake and the evil force which come forth out of the house do draw the youth again so that they heed not they salvation but turn once again to they run and the mighty pyramid be full of a shake silence and immediately of lamentation and sorrow and horror at this thing but in that moment there do happen a fresh wonder for there grow suddenly before those poor youth billow of mist -- as it have be of pure white fire shine very chill yet give no light upon they and the mist of cold fire stay they way so that we have knowledge that there fight for the soul of they one of those sweet power of goodness which we have belief do strive to ward we spirit at all time from those force of evil and destruction and all the million see the thing but some with a great clearness and many doubtful yet be all advance more in spiritual sight and hearing than the normal people of this age but of they all none have the night-hearing to know a soul have speech in the aether half across the world yet as i have say some there have be aforetime who be thus give the hearing even as be i and there come a monstruwacan to the master monstruwacan to make report that the influence have cease to work upon the instrument and by this thing we know that in verity the force which proceed out from the house of silence be cut off from we and from those youth and we have assurance that there fight a very mighty power for the salvation of the soul of the youth and all the people be silent save for a underbreath of wonder and talk for all be utter stir with hope and fear perceive that the youth have some chance give unto they to return and whilst the youth yet waver in they mind as i perceive with the great spy-glass and the knowledge of my soul and of my natural wit lo the master monstruwacan send once more the great voice of the home-call abroad into the land and immediately beseech those youth for the sake of they soul and the love which they mother have for they to come swiftly homewards whilst they have yet this great power to shield they and allow they sweet sanity and i think that some do look towards the pyramid as that they answer to the mighty voice of the home-call and do read the message which the master monstruwacan make to they but in a moment they face about seem to have a good obedience to one who do always lead and of whom i have inquire and find to be one name aschoff who be a great athlete of the nine-hundredth-city and this same aschoff out of the boldness and bravery of he heart do make unwitting to destroy the soul of they all for he go forward and leap into the billow of the bright shine fire that make a barrier in the way of they destruction and immediately the fire cease from its shine and give way and sink and grow to a nothingness and aschoff of the nine-hundredth-city begin again to run towards the house of silence and all they that be with he do follow faithfully and cease not to run and they come presently to the low hill whereon be that horrid house and they go up swiftly -- and they be two hundred and fifty and wholesome of heart and innocent save for a natural waywardness of spirit and they come to the great open doorway that have be open since the beginning and through which the cold steadfast light and the inscrutable silence of evil have make for ever a silence that may be feel in all the land and the great uncased window give out the silence and the light -- aye the utter silence of a unholy desolation and aschoff run in through the great doorway of silence and they that follow and they nevermore come out or be see by any human and it must be know that the mother and the father of those youth look out into the night land and see that thing which come to pass and all the people be silent but some say presently that the youth would come forth again yet the people know in they heart that the young man have go in to destruction for in truth there be that in the night which speak horror to the soul of all and a sudden utter quiet in all the land but unto I -lrb- that have the night-hearing -rrb- there come a great fear of that which might be whisper into my spirit out of the quietness of the night -- of the agony of those young man yet there come no sound to the hearing of the soul neither then nor in all the year that be to come for in verity have those youth pass into a silence of which the heart can not think and here will i tell how that the strange quiet which do fill all the land seem to brood within the night be horrid beyond all the roaring which have pass over the darkness in the time that go before so that it have give my spirit some rest and assurance to hear but the far-echoing low thunder of the great laughter or the whining which be use at time to sound in the night from the south-east where be the silver-fire hole that open before the thing that nod or the baying of the hound or the roaring of the giant or any of those dreadful sound that do often pass through the night for they could not have offend I as do that time of silence and so shall you judge how dreadful be that quiet which do hold so much of horror and surely it will be know that none have thinking now even in idle speech that any should have power to succor the people of the lesser redoubt neither as i have say have any the knowledge of the place where it do stand and so be it make plain that those people must suffer and come unhelped and alone to they end which be a sad and dreadful thought to any yet have those within the great pyramid come already to much sorrow and calamity because that some have make attempt in this matter and there have be for gain only failure and the sorrow of mother and the loneliness of wife and of kin and now this dread horror upon we which concern those lose youth now as may be conceive this _ sure knowledge _ that we might give no succor to the people of the lesser redoubt weigh heavy upon my heart for i have maybe with foolishness hold vague hope and wonder concern we power to make expedition secretly into the night to discover that lesser pyramid and rescue those poor thousand and above all as may be think have i the thought of that sweet moment in which i should step forward out of the night and all mystery and terror and put forth mine arm to naani say : i be that one and know in my soul that she that have be mine in that bygone eternity should surely know I upon the instant and call out swiftly and come swiftly and be again unto I in that age even as she have be in this and to think upon it and to know that this thing should never be but that even in that moment of thought she that have be mine in these olden day of sweetness might be even then suffer horror in the power of some foul monster be like a kind of madness so that nearly i could seize the disko and run forth unprepared into the evil and terror of the night land that i should make one attempt to come to that place where she abide or else to cast off my life in the attempt and oft do i call to naanus and always i send the master-word beating through the night that she might have assurance that it be indeed i that do speak unto she spirit and no foul thing or monster spelling evil and lie unto she and oft do i make to instruct she that never should she be tempt forth from the shelter of that redoubt in which she do live by any message out of the night but always to await the master-word and moreover to have a sure knowledge that none that be she friend would ever seek to entice she into the night and this way and that way would i speak with naani send my word silently with my brain-element yet be it doleful and weariful and dreadful always to have speech into the dark and never to hear the answering beat of the master-word and the sweet faint voice whisper within my soul yet once and again would i have knowledge that the aether do thrill about I weakly and to mine inward hearing it would seem that the master-word do beat faintly in the night and thereafter would my heart have a little comfort in that i have assurance of a kind that the love-maid of my memory-dream do still live and constant i put forth my soul to hark so that my health fail I with the effort of my harking and i would chide my be that i have not a wiser control and so make a fight to do sanely yet day by day do my heart grow more weary and restless for indeed it do seem that life be but a very little matter against so great a loss as my heart do feel to suffer and oft at this time and that do there come a voice speak plainly out of the night and do purport to be the voice of naanus but ever i do say the master-word unto the voice and the voice have no power by which it could make the one answer yet i jeered not at the voice to show contempt of its fail to bewit I but let the matter bide and the voice would be silent a time and again would make a call unto I but never do i make speech with it -lrb- for therein lie the danger to the soul -rrb- but always do speak the master-word to its silencing and thereafter would shut the thing from my memory and think only upon sweet and holy matter as it might be truth and courage but more often of naanus which be both sweet and holy to my spirit and heart and be and so it be as i have set down there be monster without in the night that do torment I have it may be intent to lure I unto destruction or indeed it doth chance that they have no hope but to plague I with malice and as may be think all this consider of my trouble and the give of my strength unto naanus through the night of the world that she might have comfort and help do work upon I so that i grow thin plainly to the eye of those that love I and the master monstruwacan he that do love I as i be he son chide I gently and have wise speech with I so that i but love he the more yet without have gain of health for my heart destroy I as it doth if love be hold back and make always to weep and it may be think strange that my mother and my father do not talk also with I but i have neither mother nor father those many year and this thing i should have set down early so that none should waste thought ponder to no end but the blame be to my tell now concern my love-trouble there do happen a certain thing which give I to decide for one night i wake from a sore troubled sleep and it do seem that naanus do call my name mine olden love name and in a voice of utter anguish and with beseech and i sit up in the bed and send the master-word into the night with my brain-element and presently all about I there be the solemn beat of the master-word answering but weak and go faint that scarce i might hear it and i call again with my brain-element unto naanus that be mirdath and speak to give she assurance and to haste to tell unto I that which be so wrong and pitiful with she and who shall be amaze that i be shake with the eagerness of my spirit in that it be so long since naanus have speak clear within my soul and now behold she voice yet though i do call many a time unto the everlasting night there come no more the voice of naani speaking strangely within my spirit but only at time a weak thrilling of the aether about I and at the last i grow madden with the sorrow of this thing and the sense and knowledge of harm about the maid and i stand upright upon my foot and i raise my hand and give word and honor unto naanus through all the blackness of the night that i would no more abide within the mighty pyramid to my safety whilst she that have be mine own through eternity come to horror and destruction by the beast and evil power of that dark world and i give the word with my brain-element and bid she to be of heart for that until i die i would seek she but out of the darkness there come naught but the silence then i clothed I swiftly and go up quickly to the tower of observation that i might speak instant with the master monstruwacan for my heart burn in I to intention and to be do speedily that which i have set upon myself to do and i come to the master monstruwacan and tell all to he and how that i do mean no more to suffer in quiet and to no end but to make adventure into the night land that i find naanus or perchance find a swift peace from this my long troubling now when the master monstruwacan hear that which i have to say it sit heavily upon he and he beseech I long and many time that i refrain from this thing for that none might achieve so great a task but that i should be lose in my youth before many day be go by yet to all he speech i say naught save that this thing be lay upon I and even as i have promise so should i make to act and in the end the master monstruwacan perceive that i be set to this thing and not to be move and he do put it to I how that i have grow to leanness with so much troubling and that i should have wisdom to wait awhile that i put on my full strength but even as i be so would i go and this i tell to he gently and show how that the thing be meet and helpful to the safety of my soul for that my strength be still in I yet be i sweeter in spirit because that i stand lean and pure and much poor dross and littleness have be burn from I so that fear be not in I and all do i lay to the count of my love which doth purify and make sweet and fearless the human heart and because i be even as i have say so be i the less in trouble of the force of evil for long and sore have be my preparation of spirit and i wot that none have ever go forth into the darkness so long withholden from that which doth weaken and taint the spirit and here let I set down how that the three day of preparation which be proper to those that will to go forth into the night land have for they chief aim the cleanse of the spirit so that the power of evil do have a less ableness to harm but also it be as i have say that none should go forth in ignorance of the full dreadfulness of all that hold the night for it be at the preparation that there be make known certain horror that be not tell unto the young and of horrid mutilation and of abasement of the soul that do shake the heart with fear if but they be whisper into the hearing and these thing be not set down in any book that might be lightly come by but be ward and safe lock by the master of the preparation in the room of preparation and indeed when i do hear that which presently i be to hear i have wonder in my heart that ever any go out into the night land or that ever the room of preparation should have other than student that mean not to go forth but only to achieve some knowledge of that which have be do and mayhap shall be once again yet in verity be this but the way of the human heart and have always be and will be so in all the year for ever for to adventure be the lust of youth and to leave safety be the natural waywardness of the spirit and who shall reprove or regret for it be sorrowful that this spirit of man should cease yet must it not be think that i do uphold fighting to the death or to mutilation _ between man and man _ but rather do sorrow upon this think now when the morrow come if thus i shall speak of that which be outwardly even as the night though change alway within the mighty pyramid i go unto the room of preparation and the door be close upon I and i undergo the full preparation that i might have full power and aid to come to success through all the terror of the night land and three day and three night do i abide within the room of preparation and upon the fourth day be mine armor bring unto I and the master of the preparation stand away from I silent and with sorrow upon he face but touch I not neither come anigh to aid I nor have any speech with I for none might crowd upon I or cause I to answer and presently be i clothe with the gray armor and below the armor a close-knit suit of special shaping and texture to have the shape of the armor and that i might not die by the cold of the night land and i place upon I a scrip of food and drink that might keep the life within I for a great time by reason of its preparation and this lay ready to I with the armor and be stitch about with the mark of honor so that i know loving woman thus to speed I and when all be do and make ready i take up the disko and bow in silence to the master of the preparation and he go towards the door and open it and signal that the people stand back so that i might go forth untouched and the people stand back for many have crowd to the door of the room of preparation so that i know how that my story must be to the heart of all in all the city of the great redoubt for to come unbidden anigh that door be against the lesser law and that any err in this matter betoken much and i go out through the door and there be a mighty lane of people unto the great lift and about the great lift as i go downward do the countless million stand and all in a great silence but have dear sympathy in they soul yet loyal unto my safety in that none in all the mighty pyramid do make speech unto I or call out aught and as i go downward through the mile lo all the aether of the world seem to be surge with the silent prayer and speeding of those quiet multitude and i come at last unto the great gate and behold the dear master monstruwacan do stand in full armor and with the disko to do I honor with the full watch as i go forth and i look at he quietly and he look unto I and i bent my head to show respect and he make silent salute with the disko and afterwards i go onwards towards the great gateway and they make dim the light in the great causeway that there should no glare go forth into the land when the gate be open and behold they open not the lesser gate within the greater for I but do honor my journey in that they swing wide the great gate itself through which a monstrous army might pass and there be a utter silence all about the gate and in the hushed light the two thousand that make the full watch hold up each the disko silently to make salute and humbly i hold up the disko reverse and go forward into the dark vi the way that i do go now i go forward for a space and take heed not to look backwards but to be strong of heart and spirit for that which do lie before I have need of all my manhood and courage of soul that i come to the succor of that maid afar in the darkness of the world or meet my death proper as it might need to be and thus do i go forward steadfastly and conscious in all my being of the emotion of that parting from my mighty home and of the tenderness and wiseness that do underlie so much curb rule and guidance and my heart be warm towards the master monstruwacan for that great honor that he should come downward in armor to make one with the full watch that he might uphold I to a lofty spirit at the moment of my go and all that time as i go forward be the aether of the night about I in tumult with the thought and blind wishing of the great million i have but now leave to my back and presently as i steady somewhat upon my emotion i be conscious of the exceed coldness of the night air and of the different taste of it upon my lung and in the mouth and it have as it be a wondrous keen sharping upon my palate and do fill the lip more in the breathing so that it may be suppose it have more body within it than that air which do fill the plateau of the thousandth city where be my home for the air of every city be of difference and the greater between one that be afar up and another nigh to the earth as may be think so that many people do migrate unto that level which give they best healthfulness but under rule and with a guidance of quantity and not all that be lack of health for some be ever contrary and here let I set down that within the deep of the field there be air utter varied and wonderful that might charm one here and likewise sorrow another that be happier elsewhere so that all might have suit do they but wander and have reason to companion they and thus do i go forward full of new thought and olden memory and fresh-breaking wonder neither forget something of doubt and fear more than a little and again be it most cunning strange to be out there in the night land -- though not yet afar -- where often have my fancy and imagining lead I yet until that time never have i touch foot in all that life upon the outward earth and this must be a wondrous quaint seeming thought to those of this present day and so come i at last nigh to the circle that do go about the redoubt and presently i be come to it and something astonish be i that it have no great bigness for i have look for this by _ reasoning _ have always a mind to picture thing as they might be truly and hence come sometimes to the wonder of a great truth but odd while to error that other have not make and now lo i do find it but a small clear tube that have not two inch of thickness yet send out a very bright and strong light so that it seem greater to the eye do one but behold from a distance and this be but a little thing to set to the tell yet may it give something of the newness of all and moreover shall you have memory with I in this place how that oft have i see thing and beast-monster peer over that same little tube of light they face come forward out of the night and this have i see as child and man for as child we do use to keep oft a watch by hour upon a holiday-time through the great glass of the embrasure and we do always hope each to be that one that should first discover a monster look inwards upon the mighty pyramid across the shine of the circle and these to come oft yet presently to slink away into the night have in verity no liking for that light and pride have we take of ourselves to perceive those monster which have most of ugliness and horror to commend they for thereby do we stand to have win the game of watch until such time as a more fearsome brute be discover and so go the play yet with ever it doth seem to I now something of a half-known shudder to the heart and a child 's rejoice unknowingly in that safety which have power to make light the seeming of such matter and this also be but a small matter yet doth it bear upon the inwardness of my feeling for the memory of all my youth and of the many beast that i have see to peer across the light do come upward in my mind in that moment so that i do give back a little unthinking of what i do but have upon I the sudden imagine of that which might come out of the dark beyond and i to stand a little moment and presently have grow free in my heart to have courage of farewell and so do turn I at last to the viewing of that wondrous home of the last million of this world and the sight be a astonishment and a uplifting that indeed there be so mighty a thing in all the earth and well might be that there be monster and force gather together about that hill of life out of all the darkness of the world for the thing be as a mighty mountain that go up measureless into the night and spread out upon the earth to the right and to the left of I so that it do seem to hold all the world with its might and in the nearer slope be there three hundred thousand great embrasure as well i do know there be in all the four side of the redoubt twelve hundred thousand embrasure as be set out in the book of the school and upon the cover of atlas-book as they still quaintly to be call and many another place as might be suppose and half a mile upward be the lowest tier of those great window-place and above that countless other tier and a great light come out from they into the darkness so that i look up into the night many mile and yet do see they in shine row and do make separate each embrasure from its fellow for a great way but there grow yet more above in the mighty distance so that they be lose in the upward space of the night and do seem to I presently but as a constant glimmering fire that do shape a shine peak into the blackness of the heaven dwindle into the utmost height and thus be that everlasting monument then do it come to I that those little thing which i do see to cluster against the embrasure be in truth the countless million of the mighty redoubt and this i could make out with some plainness in those lower embrasure which be the more near to I than they above for the people be set against the light within yet be as small thing like unto insect in that distance and within so huge a bulk and i know that they look out upon I and do watch through they spy-glass and i send my gaze upward again along that great slope of gray metal aye upward again to where it stride glimmer into the blackness and so at last to the little star that do crown that wonder of the world in the eternal night and for a little i do stare towards that far light for it come from within that tower of observation where so lately i have spend my life and i have knowledge within my heart that the dear master monstruwacan do bend the great spy-glass upon I through which so oft have i spy and i raise the disko unto he in salutation and farewell though i see he not at all through that vast space and my heart be very full yet my soul but the stronger for it and then behold i be aware of a murmur in the night come to I dim and from afar off and i see the little shape of the people in the lower embrasure in constant movement and i know upon the instant that the multitude do take that salute unto themselves and cry out and wave to I they farewell or to come back -- as may be and indeed i be but a lonesome person look up at that great mountain of metal and life and i know that i have danger to realize my plight and i stay no more but do raise the disko reverse as be but meet from one young man unto all the million and i look swiftly upward through those eight great mile of night unto that final light which do shine in the black heaven so that my friend should know that i thought of he that be beyond my sight in that last moment and it may be that the invisible million that be far up in the night in the upper city do take that also to be a meaning of farewell to themselves for there come down out of the monstrous height a far faint murmur of sound as of a vague wind up in the night then do i lower the disko and turn I about and i breasted strangely against the air clog and stept forward across the circle into the lonesomeness of the night land and i look no more behind for that which be my home do weaken my heart somewhat to behold so that i make determination that i look not again to my back for a great while yet about I as i go there be constant surge in the aether of the world and it do tell unto I how that those my people and kin have continual mind of I both in prayer and wishing and in a perpetual watching and the same give to I a feeling as of be something company yet in a time it come to I that this disturbance of the aether should tell to some evil force how that i be there abroad in the land but how to stop this thing who should have power for of truth have i be among they to make a full explain of the danger they have be yet powerless to cease for but to have such great multitude a-think upon one matter be to set a disturbance about as should be most clear to all now at the beginning i do walk outwards into the night land somewhat blindly and without sure direction be intent only to put a good space to my back that i might cure somewhat the ache which do weaken my heart at the first but in awhile i cease somewhat from my overswiftness and do put think to my go and i come quickly to reason that i should try a new way through the land for it might be that there be a over-watchfulness in that part which have be tread by the youth and i begin therewith to set this thought to the practice and go not direct towards the north but to the north and west and so in the end to mean to circle around to the back of the north-west watcher and thence to the north of the plain of blue fire and afterwards as might be have a true and straightway to the north and by this planning come a long way clear of that house of silence which do put more fear upon I than all else that be horrid in the land yet as all will see this make to I a greater journey though in verity it be better to go slowly and win to success than to make a greater haste towards destruction which be indeed surely to be mine end do i not go warily now it may be think upon with wonder that i do go so assuredly to the north but i go thiswise part by a inward know and part come upon by much latter study within the pyramid of olden book and by reasoning upon all thing that i do observe that have seeming of verity in they and because of this constant search upon one matter i have come but a while back upon a little book of metal very strange and ancient that have lie forget in a hide place in the great library through ten hundred thousand year maybe or less or more for all that i have know and much that be writ in the book be common knowledge and set mostly to the count of fairy-tale and suchlike even as we of this we age take not over-surely any belief in myth of olden time yet have i always much liking for such matter perceive behind that outer shell which do win always so much unbelief the kernel of ancient truth and happening and thus be it concern this little book which i have make discovery of for it tell again that which oft i have hear -lrb- even as we in this age read of the deluge -rrb- how that once in a time monstrous far back from that but utter future to this age of ours the world do brake upward in a vast earth-quaking that do rend the world for a thousand mile and there come a mighty chasm so deep that none might see the bottom thereof and there rush therein a ocean and the earth do burst afresh with a sound that do shake all the city of the world and a great mist lay upon the earth for many day and there be a mighty rain and indeed this be just so set in certain history of the ancient world also there be make reference to it within some olden record yet nowise to be take with a serious mind to the seeming of the people of the mighty pyramid but only as a quaint study for the student and to be set out in little tale that do entertain the nursery or as it might be wise man and the general yet there be this about that small and peculiar book that it do speak of many of these thing as it be that it do quote from the pen of those that do have actual witness and set all out with a strange gravity that do cause one to consider it as mean to be indeed the telling of truth and to seem thiswise to have great difference from all that i have read before concern those matter and there be further a part in the ending of the book that do seem to be writ of a time that come afterwards maybe a hundred thousand and maybe a million year but who shall say and therein it do tell of a huge and mighty valley that do come out of the west towards the south-east and make turn thence northwards and be a thousand mile both way and the side thereof be a hundred mile deep and the sun do stand in the western end and make a red gloom for a thousand mile and in the bottom there be great sea and beast strange and awesome and very plentiful now this as may be see be as the talk of romance yet do i turn my wit to they natural end and make thus plain of it for in truth i to have something of belief and it to seem to I that in a bygone eternity when the world be yet light as in my heart i know to have be indeed a thing of verity there be a great and wondrous earthquake and the earthquake do burst the world up along a certain great curve where it have weakness and there fall into the yawning furnace of the world one of the great ocean and immediately make of itself steam and so brake upward again and tear the earth mightily in its swift uprising and thereafter there be a mist and confusion and rain upon the world and indeed all very seemly put and not to be take as a light tale then in that ending of the book there be one that do write have live in a vast later age when the sun have come anigh to he die and the upward earth be grow quiet and cold and not good to live upon and in that time the mighty chasm have be calm by the weight of a eternity so that it be now a most deep and wondrous valley that do hold sea and great hill and mountain and in it be great forest of kind and land that be good and healthful and place give over to fire and to steaming and sulphur cloud so that they hold poison that have ill for man and great beast be there down in that far depth that none might see ever save by a strong spy-glass and such there be in the early world and have now be breed in the end by those inward force of nature which do make the valley a place of good warmth so that there be as it be once more the primal world bear to give new birth unto such olden monster and to other new and peculiar to that age and circumstance and all this indeed do the book give also but constrain and difficult to take clearly to the heart and not like to the wise plain speech of the early telling so that i must even set it out here in mine own speech and it do seem to I by my reading that man have come at one time to a great softness of heart and spirit through many age of over-ease but that the world do come to coldness and unfriendliness by reason of the sun 's slow ceasing and there be presently in naturalness a race upon the earth that be hardy and make to fight for they life and do perceive that the mighty valley that cut the world in twain be a place of warmth and life and so do make to adventure they body down that wondrous height and be many age come safe to the bottom but do find safe place in the downward way where they build they house and make to live and beget they child and these grow up to that life of constant and great climbing and of hard workings upon the road which be the one intent of that people so that the book do speak of they always as the road maker and thus do they make downward through the long year and the age and many generation do live and die and see not the reach of the road down into that great vale that lay so monstrous deep in the world but in the end they do come there with the road and they be very hardy and they do fight with the monster and slay many and they build they many city through great year in the mighty valley and do make the road from city unto city along that great valley even unto the bight of the valley and they find here a constant darkness and shadow for that the sun could not make a shine around that great corner yet even here they cease not to make the road but take it around and a mighty way unto the north pass it among strange fire and pit that burn from out of the earth but there be presently such a power and horror of monster and evil thing in that valley of shadow that the road maker be make to go backwards into the red light which do fill the westward valley and come from that low sun and they go back unto they city and live there mayhap a hundred thousand year and grow wise and cunning in all matter and they wise people do make dealings and have experiment with those force which be distasteful and harmful unto life but they do this in ignorance for all that they have much wisdom think only to experiment that they come to greater knowing but they do open a way for those force and much harm and pity do come thereby and then have all people to have regret yet too late now presently when a hundred thousand year have go or it may be a greater space there come slowly the utter twilight of the world as the sun to die the more so that presently it give but a utter gloomy light and there grow upon many of the people of the city of the valley a strangeness and a wildness so that strange thing be do that have be shameful to all in the light and there be wanderings and consorting with strange outward being and presently many city be attack by monster that do come from the west and there be a pandemonium then be a age of sorrow and fighting and hardening of the spirit and of the heart for all that be of good fiber and this do breed a determine generation and there grow up into the world a leader and he take all the sound million and do make a mighty battle upon all foulness and upon all that do harm and trouble they and they drive they enemy down the valley and up the valley and do utterly scatter and put they to flight then do that man call all he people together and do make it plain how that the darkness grow upon the world and that the foul and dreadful power abroad be like to be more horrid when a greater gloom come and he put to they that they build a mighty refuge and the people do acclaim and lo there be build presently a great house but the great house be not proper and that man do take all the people to wander and they come to the bight and there be build at last that great and mighty pyramid now this be the sense and tell of that book and but late have i read it and talk somewhat of it with my dear friend the master monstruwacan but not overmuch for i have take so sudden a mind to go that all else have drop from about I yet to we it do seem clear that there be no life in all the invisible upper world and that surely that great road whereon the silent one do walk must be that same road which the hardy people of that age do make and it do seem wise to the master monstruwacan and unto I that if any should find the lesser redoubt they must surely do so somewhere within the mighty valley but whether the road that lead into the west where be the place of the ab-human should bring I to it i have no know nor whether it might lie on the northward way and i maybe to wander a thousand mile wrong if in truth i be not into some dreadful trouble before and indeed no reason of value be there to give I hope that the lesser pyramid lay either to the west or where the road go north-ward beyond the house of silence yet i do so feel it to be somewhere to the north that i have make a determination to search that way for a great distance the first and if i could not come upon aught then i should have sober thought that it do lie westward but in the valley someway i have feeling of assurance that it must be for it be plain that the tell of the book be sound in its bottom sense as might be see for how should any live in the utter bleak and deadly chill of the silent upper world that lay a hundred mile up in the night hide and lose for ever and strange be it to think of those wondrous and mighty cliff that gird we about and yet be fast hold from we in the dark so that i have not know of they save for the tell of that book though in truth it have be always suppose that we live in a great deep of the world but indeed it be rather hold in belief that we abide in the bed of some ancient sea that do surely slope gradual away from we and not go up abrupt and savage and here let I make so clear as i may that the general people have no clear thought upon any such matter though there be something of it teach in the school yet rather this and that of diverse conclusion as it might be thinking of the teacher after much study and some pondering for one man have a lack of imagine would scoff and another maybe to take it very staidly but some would build fancy upon the telling of the record and make foolish and fantastic that which have grounding in truth and thus be it ever but to the most people of the pyramid there be no deep conviction nor thought of any great hide world afar in the darkness for they give attention and belief only to that which lay to they view nor could a great lot come to imagine that there have be ever any other condition and to they it do seem right and meet that there should be strange thing and fire from the earth and a ever-abiding night and monster and matter hide and tangle much in mystery and very content be the most of they though some have in they the yeast of imagining or the pimple of fancy upon they and to these there seem many possibility though the first to read out to sanity and the second to expect and have speech towards much that be foolish or to no purpose and of these vague believing of the people have i make hint before and need not have much trouble to it now save that with the child as be ever the way those olden tale have much believe and the simplicity of the wise do mate with the belief of the young and between they do lie the truth and so do i make speed towards the north have a strong surety in my heart and mind that there be but two way to my search for without of the valley afar up in the dead lonesomeness of the hidden world be a cold that be shapen ready to death and a lack as i must believe of the sweet needful air that yet do lie in plenty in that deep place of the earth so that surely the mighty valley somewhere to hold that other redoubt yet as i have say i go not direct to my journey but otherwise for those sound reason which i do set down a time back vii the night land now as i go towards the north and west i steer I warily for a great while that i come safe of that great watcher of the north-west and as i make forward i put think to all matter which must concern I so far as i have imagine to see and first i do consider the speed that i should keep and find presently that i do well to be moderate for that i have before I a great and mighty journey and indeed who might speak knowingly of the end thereof and another matter i do arrange for i would make the time of my going forward and the time of mine eating and sleeping all to a wise and regular fashion that thereby i might go a great way with the less harm to my body so that i should be strong when the need do come for my strength and i make in the end that i should eat and drink at every sixth hour and at the eighteenth hour sleep I until the twenty-fourth and by this mean do i eat thrice in that time and have six hour of sleep and this seem very good to I and i do strive always to manage thus in all my great journey in the night land yet as may be suppose there be time oft and many when i must watch without cease and leave my slumber unto the future for the land be full of grim and dreadful peril and as doth be human i brake my rule straightway in the beginning for i cease not to walk for one-and-twenty hour hide and creep as the need do be in those place that be like to show I unto the watcher and when i do think upon food it do sicken I so that i would eat by and by as i make it within my thought but when one-and-twenty hour have go i grow very weary and something faint and be force that i look about for some place where i might have rest and in a little while i do see away off a small fire-hole the like of which i have pass odd time even so early and i make to come nigh to that part for there would be warmth from the chill of the night land and mayhap a place dry and convenient to my slumber and when i come anigh i see that it be a cheerful place as it might be say amid so much gloom for the hole be but a few pace wide and full of a dull glowing fire that do bubble somewhat and throw off a small sulphur-smoke and i sit I down at no great way and do place the disko on the rock to my hand and i move not awhile but be aweary so that i have not the courage to eat neither to drink but must turn I and look back to the mighty pyramid and in truth though i have come a very good space yet be i so anigh to it that i be both cheer and put out of heart for it do seem close upon I by reason of its greatness so that i who have journey a hard and weariful way be shake with the greatness of the task that be upon I yet be this but one side of my heart for it be good to feel the nearness of my mighty home and i know that there do countless million make watch upon I as i sit yet do i make no sign for it be not meet to make a constant farewell but to go yet be it very strange to be thus near and to show such behavior as be proper to one afar from all humanity but so it be that i order my way for it do seem proper to I yet be i happy to know that the dear master monstruwacan must time and oft have spy upon I through the great spy-glass and mayhap do watch I in that moment and it grow in I that i do act weakly to hold off from mine vittle and show foolishness before my kind friend afar and i do ope my scrip and take therefrom three tablet the which i chew and do eat for this be a strong food treat that it have but small bulk yet be they not fill to the belly and i make that i would drink well that i might feel that something be therein and to this end i shake from a strong and especial tube a dust and i catch the dust within a little cup and the air do make a action upon that dust as it be of chemistry and the dust do boil and make a fizz in the cup and rise up and fill it with a liquid that be of simple water yet very strange to see come that way but ordinary after a time and in this way as might be see have i such food and drink in but a little scrip that might keep life within I for a great time yet be it a way of discomfort and lack to the mouth and to the belly but a sufficient thing unto the need of the body and good matter for a thankful heart in that dark and hungry land now when i have eat i do go over in they order those thing which i do carry for there be beside the disko and that scrip of food a pouch that do contain matter various and these i do look into and afterward do take out a small compass that i have be give by the master monstruwacan so that i might find of its workings without the great redoubt and he have say unto I that it might be that i should pass far off into the night land and lose the mighty pyramid amid so great a country and so plentiful a darkness then perchance if that ancient principle do still lurk within the machine though turn no more to the north but unto the pyramid then should it guide my foot homeward out of the everlasting night and thus have once more that ancient use which as i do know be common unto this age and this be a very cunning thing to have with I if but it hold service to the earth-current and a rare thing which the master monstruwacan do make with he own hand and much skill and pain from a olden one that have place within the great museum and concern which i have tell somewhat before this place and i set the thing upon the ground but it have no certain way with it but do spin and waver constantly and this i make to consider and remember that i be yet above that part where afar in the earth do spread the greatness of the underground field and i be haply but a little way off from the crack though a mighty way above and it pleasure I to wonder whether the dear master monstruwacan do behold how that i make test with the compass for the light be good from the fire-hole and the great spy-glass have a great strength yet have i no certainty for as i do know from much watching there be no surety in the search of the land by the glass for there be oft plainness where you do think surely none should see and anon a dullness where might be think that the sight go gaily and this may be plain to all for the wavering of the light from the strange fire be not to be account to rule but make a light here and a darkness there and then do change about oddly moreover there be smoke and mist that do come upwards from the earth in this place and in that and have somewhile a greatness but oft be small and do lurk low and have no power but to confuse the sight and presently i do put by the compass in my pouch and make to compose myself unto sleep but here would i now set down how that in the end after i have go many day ' journeying outward from the mighty pyramid i do indeed find it to draw the northward part of the needle unto it and this be a comfort and a pleasure to my spirit moreover if ever i do get back as i do think it would be a matter for great interest unto the master monstruwacan yet in verity be there other matter that should hold he more for he be right human as all should know and moreover concern this same compass i do find a fresh thing for after a yet greater time as i shall set out in a due place if i do but remember which doubt be ever my fear to fret I i come a mighty way from the redoubt and lo fear that i might indeed lose that my great home in the darkness of the world i do pull out that strange wonder of the needle that i might have comfort by its homeward point and i do discover a new power in the night for the machine do point no more directwards unto the great redoubt but be a point unto the westwards so that i have knowledge that some great power afar in the darkness of the world do sway upon it and i have a childlike wonder that this might be in truth that same power of the north of which the book and my memory-dream do tell and indeed no doubt should there be upon this matter yet who might not have doubt in that time that they should perceive after a eternity that ancient northward force sway that small servant unto a olden obedience and it be as it be a revealing unto I how that to know within the brain be one matter but to have knowledge within the heart be another for i have always know concern this northward force but yet have not know with the true meaning of knowledge and yet one other matter there be to cause doubt at that moment of this new know for it come to I that maybe the power of that lesser redoubt do begin to act upon the machine even as the earth-current of the great pyramid do hold yet a strong drawing upon the needle and be this so then do i not surely begin to stand anigh unto my journey 's end for that less power of the lesser redoubt could have no impudence to pull save that i have come to a closeness with it yet in truth as i do now have knowledge it be the north that draw and i do seem to make a great tell about this little matter but how else shall i show to you mine inward mind and the lack of knowledge and likewise the peculiar knowing that do go to the making of that time and the people thereof which be but to say the same thing twice over and now as i do say i make to compose myself for sleep and to this end i take a cloak-matter which do cross my shoulder and hip and wrapt it about I and lay down there in the darkness of the night by that strange fire-hole and i lay the disko beside I within the cloak for it be indeed my companion and friend in bitter need so that i have pleasure to feel the strange thing anigh to I and as i do lie there in those moment that do drowse the soul as it be that they do proceed as breath out of the mouth of sleep i have a half-knowing that the aether do surge about I and i doubt not but that there have watch my every do many of the million and have be humanly stir at my commending of my spirit unto sleep and thus do shake the aether of the world about I with they unity of sympathy and mayhap i have some little know of this thing as i do pass drowsy into slumber and it be surely like that i sleep the better for it moreover i be wondrous tired and worn and thus do sleep very strong and heavy yet i mind I that my last dim thinking be upon that sweet maid i do go to find and in slumber do i have speech with she in dream and a strange happiness about I and all seem to be touch by fairy-light and free from the sorrow of life and it be from a sweet and lovely sleep such as this that i be wake suddenly by a great and mighty sound and i come instant to a possess of my sens and i know that the mighty voice of the home-call do go howl across the night and swift and silent i slide the cloak from about I and take the haft of that wondrous disko into mine hand and i do look towards the pyramid quickly for a message for i have a sure knowledge that there have a great need arise and that some terror come towards I out of the dark else they have never wake all the night land to a know that a human be abroad out of the mighty refuge and even as i do peer towards the great redoubt i could not abide to keep my gaze entire that way but do take a large and fearful look all about I yet could make to see nothing and so do stare eager and anxious afar into the upper blackness of the night where do shine that final light of the tower of observation and the same while crouch and hold the disko and make to glance across my shoulder and to watch for the message and all in the same moment and then afar upward in the prodigious height i do see the great and bright and quick dart flash of a strange green fire and do know that they spell to I in the set-speech a swift warning that a gray monster that be a great gray man have make scent of I in the dark and be even in that moment of time crawl towards I through the low moss-bush that lay off beyond the fire-hole to my back and the message be sharp and bid I to leap into the bush unto my left and to hide there so that i might chance to take the thing to a advantage and as may be think they have scarce flash the tale unto I but i be go in among the shadow of a clump of the moss-bush that do grow anigh and i sweat with a strange terror and a cold and excited shake of the heart yet be my spirit set strong to conquer and lo as i do crouch there hidden i see something come very quiet out of the bush that do grow beyond the fire-hole and it be great and creep and be noways color but by greyness in all its part and the glare from the fire-hole do seem to trouble it so that it look lay its head to the ground and spy along the earth in a strange and brutish fashion that it might oversee the glare of the fire-hole yet i doubt that it see beyond the fire with plainness for in a moment it creep swift in among the bush again and come out towards the edge of the fire-hole in another place and this it do thrice unto my left and thrice unto my right and every time do lay its head to the earth and spy along and do hunch its shoulder and thrust forward the jaw horridly and turn the neck as a very nasty beast might go wanton now as you may think this manner of the beast-man do shake my courage mightily for i do think each time that it do go inward among the moss-bush that it have make discovery of I and would make to take I in the back from out of the dark of the bush and this be a uncomfortable thing to consider as other might think also have any be there in the bush with I and then in truth do that same swift sense of mine hearing prove helpful to my save for behold the thing do go back into the moss-bush after that last come out and do seem to make as it have make a fail to discover I and have no further intent save to return unto the night and i have this think truly in mine heart and for maybe a minute and then lo within my soul a voice do speak plain and do warn I that the thing do make a great compass among the moss-bush about the fire-hole have make discovery of I and it do go warily to take I in the back from the other side now when i hear this voice speak within my spirit i have knowledge that the dear master monstruwacan make watch from the tower of observation and do send the speech with he brain-element have in mind that i have the night-hearing and i trust the speech for in the same moment of time there do beat all about I in the night the solemn throb of the master-word as that it have be add with speed to give instant assurance and i leap quick from that clump of the moss-bush unto another and crouch and make a watch all about I and keep the ear of my spirit open know that the master monstruwacan do also watch all for I and suddenly i see a little moving of a bush that grow to the back of those bush in which i have be hide and there come out of the bush that move a great gray hand and move the moss of the clump where i have be as it be that something peer out of the move bush and there follow the great gray head of the gray man and the head go into the clump of the moss-bush where i have be and i know that i must strike now and i leap and smite with the disko and the thing fall upon its side and the great gray leg come out of the hither bush and twitch and draw upward but the head remain in the bush where i have be hide and i stand away from the thing whilst it die and in mine hand the disko do spin and send forth fire as it be that it do live and do know that it have slay a great and horrid monster and presently the gray man be dead and i go away from those bush unto the far side of the fire-hole and i stand with the disko hold high and spinning and send out fire that they within the mighty pyramid might know that i have slay the beast-man for it might be that it lay too much in the shadow for they to look upon but the master monstruwacan speak not again to I for indeed it be not meet to do so except it might save I from a sure danger for as you may know from my past telling there be power of the night land that do hearken unto such matter and it be like enough that there have be overmuch do even thus for my further safety yet the thing could not be help and now that i be a little calm and ease from my fear i could know that all that the aether of the night be disturb by the gladness of the million within the great redoubt so that it be plain how great a multitude have give note unto the fight and they heart to beat in sweet sympathy and natural fear so that i do feel companied and befriended though as it may be think something shake yet about the heart now in a little time i do gather unto I my wit and have myself to order and i look to see how the hour do go and i find that i have surely slumber through ten hour and i reproach myself for indeed i have sleep oversound by reason of my have lack a regular way and time as i have with a proper wisdom make to be my rule and i resolve that i would obey the wit of my reason in all the future time and make to eat and rest in due season as you will wot that i do before intend then with a self-reproachful heart i go around the small fire-hole and catch up my cloak and other matter and i turn I towards the mighty pyramid and do look once upwards along all the great slope where it do go measureless into the far blackness of the everlasting night and i make no salutation for i have so resolve as you will know moreover i desire not to call forth any unneedful disturbance of the aether of the world which indeed must be do i make to stir the emotion of the million and i turn I then away and go off into the night go swift and cautious and bear the disko cunningly and almost as it be with a love for that strange and wondrous weapon that have so befriended I and slay the foul gray man with one stroke and i have feeling that it do know I and have a comradeship for I and i doubt none will understand this save it might be they of the olden day that do carry one strong sword always yet be the disko more than the sword for it do in truth seem to live with the fire and the flame of the earth-current that do beat within it and it be well acknowledge within the great redoubt that none might touch the disko of another for that the thing go crustily as it might be say in the hand of a stranger and if any make foolishness of this knowledge and do persist much to such a handling or make to use the same would presently act clumsy with the weapon and come to a hurt and this be a sure thing and have be know maybe a hundred thousand year or perchance a greater time and by this it doth seem wise to believe that there do grow always a affinity between the nature of the man -- which doth as ever include the woman -- and the disko that he do use in he practice and because of this known thing and that the place would elsewise be lumber with olden weapon of those that do die it be a law and usage that there be place with the dead the disko of the dead there upon the last road in the country of silence and be thus make to give back unto the earth-current the power that do lie in it and this doth seem to a careless thinker as it be that i tell once again those olden custom of the ancient folk but this be otherwise and have a sound reason to it yet if you do so believe i doubt not but that a right human sentiment be something at the bottom which be proper for it be meet that love should mate with wisdom to mother comfort in we sorrow and it be a warm thing to do aught for we dead and none may say nay to this now as i do go onward into the night land look ever to this shadow and to that it may be conceive how my heart would stir with swift fear at this and that and that my body would oft quiver to leap aside and as swift discover that naught assail and so do i go forward and always with imagining and wonder concern what manner of uncouth be or brute might come out of the darkness all about yet in all that time there be a certain proudness of the heart that i do come safe out of the power of the gray man and do surely slay he but truly it be well that the praise be consider and not overmuch give unto I for i have die as i sleep but that they of the great redoubt have make a watch over I and wake I unto my saving now presently as i walk i grow something faint and have knowledge that i do foolishly for indeed i should have eat after my fight yet may i be forgive for this forget in that i have be much shake and put about and i sit I down in a little clear place among the bush and do eat three of the tablet and do once more shake forth the dust that do turn in the air to a natural water by a proper and natural chemistry of these matter and after i have eat i sit a little while and do think and do look upward at the great slope of the pyramid in the night and all the time do i listen with mine ear and with my spirit and keep the disko across my knee and look this way and that very frequent but nothing come anigh and so i rise presently and go onward and walk for six hour towards the north and the west and i make much to the west for a little that i might come clear of the north-west watcher yet after a space i make to do foolishly for i change my mind about and keep something more towards the north so that i should have a surer sight of that monster and this be in truth a rash and naughty thing to consider for if i be but see then should that grim brute make a signal unto the evil power and i be meet swiftly with destruction but surely the heart be a strange and wayward thing and give to quick fear and immediately unto great and uncountable rashness and so i do go forward unwisely to the northward of a safe and proper go and it may be that a influence be upon I and draw I thatward but who shall say now a great time i walk and make a halt upon every sixth hour and do eat and drink and look a little unto the monstrous towering of the great redoubt and afterwards make strong mine heart and go forward again and always i do go warily and chiefly among the low moss-bush but sometimes out upon stony ground and oft across place where sulphur do puff somewhat from the ground in a low smoke very strong in the nostril and not like inwardly and as i make onward i look always to my right and to my left and anon to the rear yet make a constant observation of the mighty watcher that i do begin to draw nigh unto and oft do i stoop to crawl and my hand do bleed somewhat but after i be trouble so i put on the great glove that make complete the gray armor and so be shod proper to such journey and presently when eighteen hour do have pass since that my sudden awakening to the peril of the gray man i do search about for a place to slumber for i would keep wisely unto my ruling and go not over long lack of sleep and by this planning i should be the less like to sleep oversound and so should set my spirit to listen whilst i do sleep and by so much as my spirit should serve I with faith should i have safety and this thing be plain and want not more to the say thereof and i come presently unto a sudden place where the land do go downward brokenly as that it have be burst a great while go by the inward fire and i look downward over the edge of that place and go round about it and do see presently a ledge upon the far side that be difficult to come upon yet a place of some little safety to any that might go down to it for it be awkward to see and do any monster seek to come at I i should have chance of warning and might go downward a greater way in time to my salvation and by this determination i abode and come down to that place with labor but be cheerful of heart that i have find so sure a shelter and i eat my three tablet and drink the water that i do get from the powder and so make to compose my body to sleep yet at this time a thought do come to I and i make calculation afresh and laugh somewhat at that my poor counting for indeed i have think to eat but thrice in the twenty and four hour yet by my arrange i be make indeed to eat four time as you shall see immediately by a little thought and this thing come more strong upon my spirit than any might think for i do eat overmuch for the lasting of the food though in verity it be but little to my belly as you must all think and have sympathy for my discomfort and i consider a little and have determine that i should afterwards in my journey eat but two of the tablet to my meal and this be a wise thought and like much wisdom a discomposing thing but so it be and i set it down that you may know the arrange of my way at that time now in all this while of meditation i have be set my cloak about I and be fast set to my sleep for i have walk a weary way and i lay I down upon my left side with my back to the rock which do overhang I something above so that i be contented to feel hide from thing that might pass by in the night and i have the cloak about I and the disko close against my breast within the cloak and my head upon my pouch and upon my scrip and as i lay thus a moment easeful i could see that so mighty be the uprising of the great pyramid that it be not hide from I even thus but do stand upward into the night and do shine and be plain to be see above the further edge of that deep place where i do lie and i fall upon sleep look upward at that final light where as might be the master monstruwacan do bend the great spy-glass upon my lonesomeness as i lay there upon the ledge and this be a thought of sweet comfort upon which to slumber the which i do but my spirit lay wakeful within my breast and do listen through the night and hark for all evil matter and thing that do make to come anigh but also my spirit do whisper unto naanus as i go into sleep and so pass i into dream now it may be think that i do act with a strange valiance in that i compose my body so properly to slumber and with but a little trouble of the heart concern the come of monster and in truth this have seem somewhat so to I think since that time but i do but set the thing that be truth and make not to labor to a illusion of truth and so must tell much that doth seem improper to the reality yet must all bear with I and have understanding of the hardness of set forth with true seem the honesty of truth which in verity be better serve oft time by timely and cunning lie and so shall you understand this matter so well as i and presently my spirit wake I there in the half dark of the night land and i look swift about I and upward and see nothing to fear then do i peer at my dial and make to discover that i have sleep full over six quiet hour and by this i know the reason of mine awake for it be so great impressed upon I by mine inward sense and be and this you shall understand someway who have think ere sleep to wake to a certain time of the morning and by understand shall you believe and give I all you kind hark and human sympathy and i make to have a smartness of go which be ever hard to the newly wake and i eat two tablet the while my belly do cry out for a wholesome and proper filling but i drink some of the water and so do ease somewhat of my hunger then do i wind my cloak to its shape and put upon I my gear which be the scrip and the pouch and the disko to my hip and i clomb out from that place of rest yet before i do come rightly up into the open i peer about and make some surety that no evil brute be anigh and then i gat I out and stand upon my foot and look for a little upward at the mighty slope of the great redoubt which do seem yet very nigh unto I by reason of it be so monstrous in bigness and i wonder whether in that moment the master monstruwacan do look down upon I with the great spy-glass and afterwards i turn away swiftly and go on into the night land for it do always make I shake with lonesomeness to look upon my great home and so i do go forward with a strong and uncaring stride but grow presently to quietness and to have back the proper caution of my go yet have i not go all foolishly for i have take the disko from my hip ere this so that i possess it handily now there be one matter which shall seem but a small and natural occur unto you yet be strong upon I in that time and this thing be that i do begin now to see the night land from the new outlooking of my distance from the mighty pyramid and it be as that a man of this day do go from the earth to travel among the star and lo should he not find they to shift upon he vision so that the great bear and this and that shaping of the star clustering should make a new order as he do wander onward and so should he find that there be naught that be truly fix as he do before then think but all to alter accord unto the place whence the look and this thing shall be plain unto you though no thought be put to the matter for it be of a evident verity that doth need not argument to expound and so shall you have memory of I there a-wander among those strange shaping and wonder of that grim land the which i have never but suppose to seem but as my memory do retain they from the looking of all my life within the great redoubt and so it be and ever there do this thing and that open out to a new view and the night land take to itself a constant new aspect to mine eye which have never until that time have but the one fix vision of the same and you shall understand with I how that when about the fourteenth hour of that day 's travel i do draw very nigh unto the monstrous watcher of the north-west it do seem so utter strange from this fresh aspect that i have be like to think that i do see a new monster for in truth when i do come at last to creep to within a mile of it among the low moss-bush i be confound that the mighty chin do come forward towards the great redoubt even as the upward part of a vast cliff which the sea doth make hollow about the bottom for it do hang out into the air above the glare of the fire from the red pit as it have be a thing of rock all score and be-weathered and dull red and seeming burn and blast by reason of the bloody shine that beat upward from the deep of the red pit and by the way in which i do tell upon it you shall know that i do surely view it something from the side at this immediate time for in truth it be then that i do draw the nearer and moreover i be the more astonished at this viewing than i have be to the front for it be so utter strange and shapen so different from the brute that do hang in my memory and a great time i do lie there upon my belly and shake by a fear of the beast yet embolden as you may conceive by have come to the side and be hopeful in my heart that i be very secure within so great a shadow and the thick shelter of the moss-bush and surely it be that i do creep more nigh the while that i do look for presently i have a very plain see of the great monster and do know where i have get to and thereby do acknowledge unto myself that this be a utter foolishness and like for all that any might say to lead unto destruction yet as all must know there be the first fear and the ceasing of this fear as i do wot that i be so little a thing to heed out there in the shadow and presently a gain of courage and the prick of my be that do crave to see clear this exceed wonder and so be i come close more or less have go far upon my hand and knee yet sometimes to pause but afterwards on again now by this nearness i be the more truly able to perceive how that the bulk of the watcher do rise up into the night like a hill and the color be mostly black save and indeed where it do face to the red shine of the pit and concern this i have do tell and so do i lie there and stare a great while parting a small hole in the moss-bush that i might spy through the same and the thing be squat there and might have root within the earth so it do seem to mine imagining as i do stare with a dumb wonder and there be monstrous wart upon the thing and indent and a mighty ruggedness and lumping as it be that it do be pimple with great boulder that be inbred within that monstrous hide and where the shine from the pit of red fire do strike upon these they do stand out into the darkness away from the skin as you of this age shall see mountain of the moon catch a bright fire from the sun and show plain upon the night of the moon now as i have set down i do lie there and look a great while and it come presently to I that there be unease within the mighty pyramid among the million for i do feel the aether of the world to be disturb by they distress and so have a know that they have a cunning wareness concern the place where i do hide among the moss-bush and the thrilling in the night do bring a wisdom into my head for in verity as i have say this be a foolish matter that i be upon and i gat a thought that the watcher might have a awaredness of the trouble of the multitude and indeed for all that i do know it have a full knowledge of all my wander though concern this i do think otherwise truly in my heart as be a most human and proper way to make comfortable the spirit where doubt can have no ease from reason and i make that i would go backwards to a good distance from the watcher and go forward again upon my journey if but that i come safe from so unwise a adventuring and as i do begin to return it be to I as that all my sens be newly awake for i have a sudden know that i be within the atmosphere should i not call it of the monster and i gat a abrupt and horrid shake of the spirit for i do feel in verity that my soul have come too anigh and that the beast have a sure knowledge concern I yet do make to my destruction with no haste but after that way and fashion that do seem proper unto it and this feeling you shall understand the better maybe when i do tell that it be to I as that the air all about I be full of a quiet and steadfast life and keen intelligence that i do believe to come forth from the watcher on every side so that i do feel as one already within the gaze of some great and evil power yet though i have a great terror upon I i make no foolish haste but command my soul to courage and put a guard upon my way of go and so make a very quiet journey for maybe two full mile and afterwards do allow myself something more of haste for i be now grow easier in my spirit and feel apart from the spirit of the great watcher and after a longer while i do leave that hill of watchfulness to my rear and be go onward into the night yet as may be know with a vague unease and trouble to my heart and a swift and frequent turn to learn surely that no evil thing come after I for as you may know i could nowise have forget concern that great quiet life which do seem to be live in all the air around that mighty bulk for it have be all about I in the night as i have tell and i to feel that i have be surely discover and thus shall you know how shake be my spirit in verity now presently at the eighteenth hour of that day 's travel i cease from my journey that i might eat and drink and i do sit a little while and look back upon the strange and monstrous thing which i have come beyond and the great humped back and vast shoulder of the watching-thing rise up into the night black and cumbrous against the red shine of the pit and thus as you shall think have that brute look always unto the mighty pyramid through eternity and do cease not from watch and be steadfast and silent and alone and none do understand and after i have eat and drunk some of the water i go onward for a full matter of six hour more be mind to have no sleep until i have put a great way between I and the watcher and in this part of my journey do i come to the place where the silent one kill as it be name in the map and i observe a very wondrous caution and go away from it a little unto the north where i do see at a distance the shining of fire-hole the which do promise I warmth through my slumber and here you must know that the place where the silent one kill be a utter bare place where all do seem of rock and no bush do seem to grow thereon so that a man might not come to any hiding though in truth there might be some hole here or there yet be none show in any map within the pyramid neither do there seem to be any such to I as i do creep there among the moss-bush to the northward of the place and look constant and fearful towards it so that i should see quickly whether any silent one do move across all the gray quiet of that rocky plain and concern this same place where the silent one kill it be well to make a explanation how that there be always a little and far-spreaded light over all that lonesomeness and the light be something grey-seeming as it be that a lichen might grow upon the rock and send out a little uncomfortable glowing even as certain matter do in these time if you do but know the place and the time to seek they yet be the light exceed weak and very cold and dismal and do seem truly to show naught with a sureness so that it do appear to the eye if one do look fixedly that there be shadow that do move here or there as it be of silent being and none might know in truth whether this shaping of the greyness be to the clouding of the reason or that the eye do see of reality yet if one do look with the great spy-glass then might there be some surety and plainness and likewise be it so if one do have come sufficient anigh to that uncomfortable place even as i then do be and so you shall conceive how that i do slide very quiet from bush unto bush for i have alway in all my life have a very dread fear of this place and oft do i peer out into the dim gray light of the lonesome plain unto my left and would think sometimes to perceive the shape of the silent one stand vague and watchful yet on the instant to see nothing and thus i do go onward and come presently to a part where the gray plain do stretch out a bareness into the night land to my front so that my way end unless i do make a long passing round about and i sit there among the moss-bush and do consider and lookt out cunningly through a spy-hole of the bush in which i do sit and i perceive that the part of the plain which do jut bareness into the land before I have no greatness of size but might be pass swiftly in but a little running and this thing should save I a wearisome go round so that i make to consider it with a serious mind and all the time do i search the bare greyness before I and see presently that it be surely empty and i make to adventure myself across run very swift until i have come to the far side and lo as i do go to rise up out of the bush mine eye be open as it be and i see that there be something amid the constant greyness and i fall quickly into the bush and do sweat very chill but yet do haste to look and i saw now that there be in truth matter that do show vague upon that part of the plain that be before I and i do peer very constant and anxious and behold i see that there be face I a great line of quiet and lofty figure shroud unto they foot and they move not neither make they any sound but stand there amid the greyness and do seem to make a unending watch upon I so that my heart go unto weakness and i do feel that there be no power of the moss-bush to hide I for in verity they that stand so silent be certain of the silent one and i be very nigh to the place of destruction now i move not for a time but be make stiff by the greatness of my fear yet i be presently aware that the silent one come not towards I but stand quiet as that they do mind not to slay I if but i do keep from that place and there grow therefrom a little courage into mine heart and i obeyed my spirit and take a hold of my strength and go slowly backward in the bush and presently i be come a long way off yet troubled and disturbed and very strict to my go and i make a great circle about that place where the plain of the silent one do come outward and so do gain to the north-west and be thence something the happier in my heart and go easily and oft upon my foot yet make a strong watch to every side and so i come at the last to a time when i have walk through four-and-twenty weariful hour and be eager that i should come to a safe place for my sleep yet do lack a happy belief of safety in that i have come twice anigh to so grim trouble and unsure i be that i do not be secretly pursue in the night and this you shall believe to be a very desperate feeling and a plight to make the heart sick and to long with a great longing for the safety of that mine home yet have i put myself to the task and truly i do never cease to the sorrowful remember of that utter despair that have sound to I plain in the last calling of mine own love out of all the mystery of the night and but to think upon this be to grow strong in the spirit yet to have a fresh anxiousness that i do the more surely keep my life within I and so come to that maid 's salvation now as you shall mind i have spy the shine of certain fire-hole somewhat to the northward and have think to make thereabout a place for my sleep for in truth there be a bitterness of cold in all the air of night that do surround I and i be warm nigh to a slow happiness by think upon a fire to lie beside and small wonder as you shall say and i make presently a strong walking unto that place where do glow in the night the shine of the fire-hole as i do well judge they to be and so be like to have come over-swiftly upon my death as you shall presently see for as i come anigh to the first i perceive that the light come upward out of a great hollow among the moss-bush and that the fire-hole burned somewhere in the deep of the hollow so that i do but look upon the shine thereof yet very eager be i to come to that warmth and i make more of haste than care as i do hint and so come very swift to the top of the hollow yet be still hide by the kindness of the moss-bush and as i make to thrust forward out of the bush that i might look and go downward into the hollow there rise up to I the sound of a very large voice and deep and husky and the voice be a dreadful voice that do speak as that it say ordinary thing and in a fashion so monstrous as that it be that a house do speak and in verity this be a strange thing to say yet shall it have the truth of my feeling and terror in that moment and i draw back swiftly from discover myself and be then all fear to move or to make to go more backward lest that i should give knowledge that i be come anigh and likewise do i shiver lest that i be even then perceive and so shall you have something of the utter fear that do shake I and i abode there very quiet and move not for a very great space but do sweat and shake for there be a monstrous horridness in the voice that do speak and as i crouch there within the moss-bush there come again the large voice and it be answer by a second voice and thereupon there arise as it do seem the speech of man that must have the bigness of elephant and that do have no kindness in all they thought but be utter monstrous and the speech be slow and it rise up out of the hollow brutish and hoarse and mighty and i would that i could make you to hear it and that you could but borrow mine ear for a little moment and forthwith be shake with that utter horror and a afraidness even as be i now presently there be a very long quiet and i cease at last a little from mine over-fear and later i do calm somewhat so that i make to shift my position which be grow very uneasy and there be still no sound from the hollow wherefore have a little boldness and much curiousness and these despite my great fearfulness i put forth mine hand very cautious and do move the mossbush a little from my face and i go forward upon the earth and do lie upon my belly and be by this so close upon the edge of that place that i be able to look downward and you shall know that i peered down into that great hollow and do see a very strange and horrid sight for in truth there be a large fire-hole in the center of that place and all about the side there be great hole into the slope of the hollow and there be great man lay in the hole so that i might see a great head that do show out to my sight here from one of those hole and would seem to be that of a monstrous man heavy with sleep and there i would see but the buttock of another as that he do curl himself inward to he brutish slumbering and so be it all about and to my memory there be maybe a score of these hole yet have i not time to the counting as you shall see for after that i have make but a glance as it be at these sleep and utter monstrous man i perceive that there sit beyond the fire-hole three great man and they be each greater than elephant and cover a large part with a stiff and horrid hair that do be of a reddish seeming and there be upon they great seg and wart as that they skin have be hide that have never know cover and there be between they the body of a mighty hound so big as a horse that they do skin and i judge that this beast be one of those fearsome brute which we do call the night hound yet as i should set down they do nothing in that time in which i lookt at they but do sit each with a sharp and monstrous bloody stone in he fist and do look to the ground as that they heed not the earth or the food that they do prepare but do listen to some outward sound and you shall know that this bring to I a very swift and sudden terror for i perceive now the why of they long silence for in verity they have a unease upon they be subtly aware that one be anigh even as be the brute beast in this manner and kind as all do know and i make to draw back and win unto safety if indeed this thing be to be do and as i move I it may be that i shake a little earth into the hollow for there be indeed a little sifting of dry dust below I as i do wot be very keen to hear by reason of my fright and immediately do those three monstrous man look upward and do seem to I to stare into mine eye as i do lie there hide amid the moss-bush and i be so put in fear that i do clumsily and send another siftering of dust downward as i do strive to go backward swift and quiet from the edge and all the time i do look through the bush very fixedly into the eye of the giant and lo they eye do shine red and green like to the eye of animal and there rise up a roar from they that do nigh slay my soul with the horridness of the noise and at that roar all the giant that do lie in the hole do awake and begin to come outward into the hollow now i be surely lose and give over to destruction for they have possess I immediately but that in that moment as i go backward the earth give behind I and i fall into a hole among the moss-bush to my back and i make first to come out very hurry and all choke with a dust of sand and ash but in a moment i be sane to know that i have come to a sudden hiding-place and i lay very still and strive neither to cough nor to breathe and well for I i come to so close a hiding for there be all about I the sound of monstrous footstep run that seem to shake the ground though maybe this to be a imagine breed of my fear and shouting of great voice there be and the thudding of huge foot all about and the noise of the bush rustling but presently the search draw away to the southward and i perceive that there have surely fight for I some power of good fortune and i come up out of the hole very cautious and shake and a moment weak with the beating of my heart yet with a lovely thankfulness for my salvation and i gat I about and go swift through the moss-bush to the north and west for three hour and cease not to run upon my hand and knee and by that time be i come a great way and do have a surety in my heart of present safety and i cease to run and lay quiet for in truth i do near swoon away with the hardness of my travel and indeed as you shall know i have sleep not for seven-and-twenty hour and have scarce cease to labor in all that time moreover i have eat not neither drunk for nine hour and so shall you conceive that i be truly a-weary and presently i do slumber there as i lay and all abroad to any monstrous thing that should come along yet do i wake unharmed and find by my dial there have go by a full ten hour the while that i do lie there and sleep unwotting and i be sore perish with the cold of the night for i have not the warmth of my cloak about I and my belly be very empty and i stand I up and do peer about for any dread matter but all seem proper and i begin to stamp my foot against the earth as that i would drive it from I and this i do say as a whimsy and i swing mine arm as often you shall do in the cold day and so i be presently something warm and i dismantle my cloak and wrap it about I and do feel that the disko be safe to my hip then do i sit I down and do glow a little with relish in that i should now eat four of the tablet for indeed these be my proper due by reason of my shiftless fasting ere i come so wotless to my slumbering and the memory of that eat doth live with I now so that i could near to smile for the eagerness of mine inwards be proper and human yet be even four tablet but a little matter to so great a emptyness and i drink a double portion of the water that i might make less the void and this thing be seemly for indeed there be two portion due unto I and when i have eat and drunk i do fold the cloak once more to shape across my shoulder as i do carry it and afterwards i take the disko into my hand and go forward again to the north and west yet as you shall know i do pause a little in the beginning and peer to every side for any close danger and then do look more abroad of that place but could nowhere see any matter to have I to immediate fear and afterwards i look a little while at the monstrous humped back of the watcher of the north-west and it do grow to I how steadfast that thing do look toward the mighty pyramid and this set I to new hatred and horror of the monster as you shall conceive and believe and presently i look beyond the watcher unto the vast mountain of the great redoubt and i be still seem close upon it yet in truth go a long and weariful distance but this you shall understand be by the greatness and utter height and bulk of that shine mountain of life and strange and wonderful it be to I to think that even in that one moment it might be that the dear master monstruwacan do look upon my face through the great spy-glass and i should not seem utter far to he by reason of the power of the big glass but to I as i do look upward through the night unto that far and utmost light in the upper blackness of the everlasting gloom it do seem doubly to I that i be afar off and lose forever from mine home and this thinking do breed in I such a great and lonesome feeling and a weakness of the heart and spirit that forthwith i take my courage close unto I and do turn away quickly and go onward to the north and west as i have tell now i walk for twelve hour and in that time do eat and drink twice and make onward again very steadfast and happy that all do go so quiet with I so that it be as if i have at last come to a part of the land that be give over to quietness and lack of monster yet in truth be i come to a worse place than any maybe for as i go forward stride very strong and make a good speed i do hear presently a little noise upward in the night and someway unto my left that have seem as that it be a strange low sound that do come down to I out of a hidden doorway above for indeed though the sound do come from very nigh as it do seem no more than a score foot above my head yet be it a noise that do come out of a great and mighty distance and out of a foreign place and i do know the sound though never as you may suppose could i have hear it in all my life yet have i read in one of the record and again in a second and a third how that certain of all they that have adventure from the pyramid into the night land to seek for knowledge have chance to hear a queer and improper noise above they in the night and the noise have be strange and do come from but a little way upward in the darkness yet be also from a great and monstrous distance and do seem to moan and hum quietly and to have a different sound from all noise of earth and in the record it be set forth that these be those same doorway in the night which be tell of in a ancient and half-doubted tale of the world that be much in favor of the child of the pyramid and not disdain by certain of we wiser man and have be thus through all the latter age and i do seem to know the sound upon the moment for my heart grow swift to understand and it be a very dread uncomfortable sound and you shall know how it do seem if you will conceive of a strange noise that doth happen far away in the country and the same noise to seem to come to you through a open door near by and this be but a poor way to put it yet how shall i make the thing more know to you so that i must even trust unto you wit and true sympathy that you shall conceive of the fullness of my meaning now in all the history of those that have adventure into the night land there be but three sure record that do concern this sound and each do tell of a great horror and of they that do hear the sound there have die the most part out in the night land and the record do make always that they have come upon destruction and not simply unto death but be destroy by a strange and invisible evil power from the night and of those that come alive unto the pyramid they have all one strange tale to tell how that there be secret and horrid doorway in the night yet how this thing could be plain to they who may know truly save it be that the eye of they spirit do behold that which be hide to the eye of the flesh and there be afterwards writ a proper and careful treatise and do set out that there do be rupture of the aether the which do constitute doorway as those more fanciful one do name they and through these shattering which might be liken unto opening -- there be no better word to they naming -- there do come into this particular condition of life those monstrous force of evil that do dominate the night and which many do hold surely to have be give this improper entrance through the foolish and unwise wisdom of those olden man of learn that do meddle overfar with matter that do reach in the end beyond they understanding and this thing have i tell before and it doth seem proper unto my belief for it be always thus and i have that same taint within I as must all that have the zest of life now by this that i have set down swiftly to make a little clear the sure horridness of this sound you shall know even with I the great horror that do come immediately upon my spirit and i do know that my search be surely like to have a end in that moment and i bared mine arm for my tooth where the capsule do lie below the skin and so be ready to a instant death if that destruction do come upon I and in the same moment i do fall silent inward among the moss-bush and do begin to creep very quiet toward the right for as you will mind i have hear the sound over beyond my left and all that time as i do creep there be a great sickness upon I and it do seem that my mouth have weaken unto water so that i could scarce hold my tooth tightly from unseemly clittering and i creep always very silent and do often stare quick and painful over my shoulder upward and this way and that but do never see anything neither could i hear now the sound and i go thiswise for a great hour and be like to faint through the effort of my care and the soreness of my go but upon the end of that long while i grow something easier in the spirit and do perceive that i be save from the destruction that i have come so dreadful anigh and this thing it may be be because that i do chance to hear it whilst yet it be beyond and before i do come right unto it to pass below yet may i be wrong in this thought and do but make a guess but as i shall here explain after that time i keep mine ear newly keen unto hearing and do chide my spirit for that it have not take account of that sound a great while earlier yet as i do presently conceive the spirit have no power to hear that thing which be very strange but truly so now because that i go with a very wary hearing i hear the sound once a far way off before I and i hide upon the moment and go backward and after a while do judge myself to have come unto safety and so it be in verity for i hear no more that time and so do i come presently unto the eighteenth hour and do eat and drink and make I a place of slumber in a little hollow of a rock that stand upward out of the moss-bush and i sleep for six hour and afterwards wake and be come to no harm and after i have eat and drunk again i do look outward over the night land and with particularness to that part that i do travel in as it might be call the yesterday and i do observe it to be a very bleak and desolate country and not give over to fire or other warmth nor to sulphur-vapours but to be very quiet and with but a little light in all its breadth and i could conceive that it be no place for anything of life to desire but rather to avoid and that country do seem to be yet all about I for i be by no means come clear from it at that time though northward there be a glimmer as of fire-hole and beyond those the strange shine of the plain of blue fire and after that i have think awhile i do believe that i should meet no monster of natural life in all that country of desolation until i do draw nigh once more unto fire and i conceive that this sound from out of the invisible doorway might yet trouble I but whether the quietness of that part be because all of natural life do fear the sound or because that there be neither fire nor warmth i do not say have no know in this matter but may yet believe that it be to be lay to both cause and this doth seem of common reason as you shall agree and when i have look a while unto the mighty pyramid which be now truly a great way off for i have walk so many weary hour i turn I once more to my journey and here let I observe that i have go very far yet not so distant as might be think for oft i do go less than one mile in a hour or maybe two hour have to be of great caution and oft to hide and to go upon my belly or to crawl all as might be and further as you may have perceive i make not a straight forwardness but do strike this way and that way be very intent to escape the monster and evil force that be all about now because that i believe that i travel in a place where be surely to be discover those strange doorway within the night i make a especial care of my go and do stop oft that i might listen and watch and keep a very strict ward in all the night about I yet as you shall see this serve not to prevent I from go forward into the fearfulness of that which do haunt all the void for sudden as i go carefully i hear a faint humming noise come downward from the night a little unto my rear and the hum noise do grow more plain as that a door be open slowly above and do let out that sound ever more loud and surely after i do hear that i could not doubt that a door be open upward there for the noise do grow in such wise as you shall hear a distant sound come through when a door truly be ope for if the noise have be make just in that place it have seem to come from there but this sound though it do come _ through _ there be as that it do come outward from some far lose and foreign eternity and this i do struggle always to make plain and you shall not blame I that i think overmuch upon it for in truth there be a horror so wondrous and drear about it that i can forget not but do strive always that other should know with I that peculiar woe and terror that do haunt the night now as you will see i have in truth go past the place where the doorway in the night do open yet have come to no harm but rather it do seem that it open by chance unwotting that i be anigh or it may be that my quiet passing do disturb a evil power so that it do even come to listen or to make search and all this doth pass through my brain as i do write and it doth seem to I that my thought be but the thought of a little child before so great a mystery and that i touch not even the edge and fringe of the truth with my thinking and so do cease upon they and will but go forward so plain as i may with my tell now as you may truly believe when i hear that sound and do understand that i have in verity come past beneath that place i do surely sicken to a utter weakness of body and heart though it be but for a moment and then be i swift hide within the close shelter of the low and thick moss-bush and i shake in all my being and creep shake upon my hand and knee and do near totter to my face thrice so weak go be i in that moment of terror and i do have a wickedness of forget in that time for i bared not mine arm to have the capsule to a readiness for my death if that do need to be and this be a abominable foolishness and i do shake now when i think upon it for death be but a little matter by the side of destruction though in truth dreadful enough for all yet as it do chance no harm come to I and i gat away as that some wondrous power do cast a viewless cloak about I that i might be utter hide and oft have i wonder whether this be truly so but have no know and presently i cease from flee and have some calmness and do eat and drink and so come to the comfort of a firm spirit the which have be sore trouble above all understanded cause by that horrid sound upward in the night and after that i have eat and drunk i do rest a little but afterward go onward to the northward go towards that place where the fire-hole do glimmer the same be by this time no great way off then as i do come anigh i think to hear once again the sound in the night and i stopt very swift and hide into the moss-bush and do listen but do hear naught and so be hopeful that fancy do play upon I yet because of this matter i go upon my hand and knee for a good way and so come at last nigh unto the shine of one of those fire-hole the which i do see for so long now as you shall suppose i go very cautious through the bush unto that red-shining fire be careful both that i do attract not any evil force that might listen in the night and because that there might be some monster nigh to the fire-hole but presently when i be come so that i could peer through the bush i do see a little fire-hole set in a small hollow and there do no thing seem to lurk anigh and the sight of that warmth do cheer I for it be long since i do have the comfort of such a matter and when i have lie hide awhile that i might watch all about i see the place to be safe and quiet and i go out from the moss-bush and sit down a space from the fire which do fill the pit in which it do lift and bubble and the noise that it send out be strange and slow and it do seem to gruntle gently unto itself in that lonesome hollow as that it have make a long and quiet grumble there through eternity and oft be it still and make no sound and again would give a odd bubbling in the quietness and send off as it do seem a little smoke of sulphur and afterward fall once more upon a quiet and so i do sit there very hushed and restful and the loneliness do lie all about I and the red shine of the fire-hole do glow soft in the hollow and i be glad to be quiet for my heart be weary and there be to my back a little rock that do jut upward so high as a man and the rock be warm and pleasant to lean upon and moreover do seem to guard I from behind and there i eat and drunk and keep very still and so be presently rest and this i do need as you have perceive for i be go sudden weary of the heart as i do say and this might be because that i do never cease to have destruction over I to companion my way though as you will mind i have be no more than twelve hour afoot since my last sleep yet i doubt not you do understand and presently my heart grow strong again within I and i have a warmth in my spirit and i get up from the earth and stretch out mine arm and i see that my gear be safe upon I and afterward do grip the disko as it be newly then i go away from the fire-hole and climb the far slope of the hollow and go northward and there be before I many of the fire-hole for i do perceive they to shine in the night for a great way as it do seem that they be a path of red shining that lead I onward to the north-west of the light of the plain of blue fire now i have a believe that i have come out of the country where do lurk those horrid doorway in the night and i go not with so utter a weight upon my heart and do feel that naught should come now upon the back of my neck which have be a odd and troublesome fancy whilst that i do creep through that country of gloom yet as you shall know i go with no foolish confidence but with a great caution and mine hearing keen to hark and a care to my step and do ever watch around I as i journeyed and because that i go forward in this proper and sedate manner i have great cause for a thankful heart as you may perceive for i have come after a long way to another of those hollow where do burn one of the fire-hole and i make a pause upon the edge of the hollow in which it do lie and look downward keep guard within the moss-bush where they grow anigh to the top thereof but there be no living thing there to be see and i go downward so that i should warm my body at the fire and lo as i stand upon this side of the fire-hole and turn myself about i look presently more keenly to the other side for the yellowness of the earth do seem a little strange in one place but i could see with no plainness because that there arise a glare from the fire against mine eye and i go round that i should look the better yet with no fear or thought of evil in my heart and truly when i be come upon that far side of the fire-hole lo there be spread out in the yellow sand of that place a curious thing and i go more nigh and stoop to look upon it and behold it move and the sand all about do move for a great space so that i give back very swift and swing upward with the disko and strangely i hear the sand to stir at my back and i look round very quick and the sand rise upward in part and sift back and there come to my sight odd thing that do move and curl about and immediately before i know which way to go i know that the sand do shift under my foot and do work and heave so that i be totter and be shake also in the heart for i know not what to think in that instant then do i perceive that i be all surround and i run swift upon the heave sand unto the edge of the fire-hole and i turn there and look quickly for i do not know what this new terror should be and i see that a yellow thing do hump upward from out of the sand as it have be a low hillock that do live and the sand shed downward from it and it do gather to itself strange and horrid arm from the sand all about it and it stretch two of the arm unto I but i smote with the disko and i smote thrice and afterward they do wriggle upon the sand but this be not the end as i do hope for the yellow thing arise and run at I as it might be that you should see a spider run and i do leap backward this way and that but the monster have a great swiftness so that i do seem surely lose then make i a strong and instant resolve for i perceive that i have no hope to slay this thing save that i should come at it in the body and i put everything to the chance and make not to escape any more but run straight in among the leg and there be great hair like to spine upon the leg and these have prick I to the death but that the armor save I now i have do this thing with a wondrous quickness so that i be under the mighty arching of the leg before the yellow thing do wot of my intent and the body be bristle with the great hair and poison do seem to come from they and to ooze from they strangely in great and shine drop and the monster heave itself up to one side that it might bring certain of the leg inward to grasp I yet in that moment do i smite utter fierce with the disko -- thrust and the disko do spin and hum and roar and send out a wondrous blaze of flame as that it have be a devour death and it sunder the body of the yellow thing and do seem as that it scream to rage amid the entrails thereof so wondrous be the fury and energy of that trust weapon and i be cover with the muck of the thing and the claw upon the leg seize I so that the gray armor do bend and crack to the might thereof and i grow sick unto death with the pain within but smite with the shine disko use my left hand weakly for my right be gript dreadful fast to my body and lo i be sudden free and a great blow do knock I far across the hollow so that i be like to have fall into the fire-hole but fall instead upon the edge and come backward unto safety and i turn I about and the yellow thing do throw the sand all way as it do die but have lose power to come upon I and for my part i lay weak upon the earth and be no more able to fight nor could i do more than breathe for a great while but yet come presently to health and make to examine my hurt then i see there be no great wound anywhere upon I but only a utter bruising and i find upon my right leg that there be a sharp and hairy claw clipt about it but the armor have save I from harm of the horrid thing so that i do but kick it free with my left foot and thence into the fire-hole now by this time that monstrous creature be dead but i hold off from it and go upon the other side of the fire for i be yet surely in horror of it and i sit for a time and do think upon all matter that do concern I and i see that i should have not comfort of heart until i be wash clean from the taint of the monster and i gat I up wearily to go forth into the night again that i should make a search for a hot spring of which i have come past many and i have oft find they to be nigh unto the fire-hole so that i be trustful that i should see one ere long and lo there be a little hollow just beyond and scarce a hundred pace off and in the hollow there do shine three small fire-hole and there be a steam puddle as do seem beyond the third of the hole now before i adventured downward into this place i go all about the topmost edge and make a search of the moss-bush about but find naught that should scare I and afterward i go all across the hollow but do find no monstrous thing hide anywhere yet there be that in the place that discourage I and do keep I from strip mine armor so that i should bathe in the hot puddle for i stept upon a small serpent and the same do lap about my leg but could do I no hurt for the armor which be a very bless protection and i free myself from it with the handle of the disko and because that i could not go naked to my cleanse i try first the hotness of the water which be not over great and afterward do take off the scrip and the pouch and the cloak and lay they with the disko upon the edge of the warm puddle then i stept into the water and be immediately go downward a great way for truly it be no puddle as i have suppose but a deep well as you might call it of hot and sulphury water and this doth show how a man may act foolishly even when he doth believe that he have a great caution and surely it be bear in upon I afresh that none should trust over freely unto unproven matter the which shall you heartily agree with but yet do as foolishly accord to you light and character and so shall you laugh not over hardly upon I now i have go over the head and surely i do not know what deepness be there yet as you shall think i stay not to consider upon this matter but make to climb out and much shake with my spluttering and the smarting of mine eye for truly the water be strong with sulphur matter yet very cleanse be it as i do presently see for there be no more any taint or horridness upon mine armor or the flesh of my face or hand and i take the disko and wash it clean also and then the cloak and afterward the scrip and the pouch and the band of the same and after i have do this i be mind to dry myself by the little fire-hole but when i be come there lo maybe a score small serpent be about those place and i be strongly pleased that i should keep away yet that i must warm and dry I in that desolate and bitter night land you shall agree and to this end i put the scrip and the pouch upon I and afterwards take the disko readily into my hand and run quietly unto the hollow where i do fight with the yellow thing and the cloak i bear in my left hand now when i be gat there i be truly glad to think that there be no serpent in that place and because that i have slay the monster of the place how should it be that any harm might come unto I for truly be it not like that a creature of such might should keep all that hollow unto itself and slay any that do come therein and thereby preserve that place from all other horror though surely until it do die and cease to be there have be no call for any greater abomination now all this do go through my brain as i do sit to dry mine armor and my body and my gear upon that side of the fire-hole which be away from the slay monster and i make presently to think that this would be a sure and proper refuge wherein to sleep for truly it must have get a place where none other creature should be like to come to work I harm and it must be that you do all see with I in this matter and commend I that i think with properness and so do i resolve that i put my disgust within my pocket as we do say and stay safe and quiet within that hollow and this thing i do surely and do eat and drink and presently i go over to the dead monster and make very sure that it be truly slay which indeed it be and after that i have see to this matter i return unto the fire-hole and make a comfortable place in the sand for my rest for i be well dry by this and i wrap the cloak about I and take the disko to my breast for a sure companion as it have truly prove in my need and i could think almost that it do nestle unto I as that it know and love I but this thing can be no more than a fancy and i do but set it down as such and that it doth show my feeling and mind at that time then ere i do compose myself to slumber i look about I upward to the edge of the hollow and i perceive that i be lose to the sight of the mighty pyramid for i be come so far off that it look not down from so wondrous a height as you shall perceive and moreover the hollow be something deep and afterward as i lay my head back upon the scrip and the pouch which be to I my pillow i go to think a little upon naanus as alway i do in my constant journey yet presently i strove sometimes that i put she from my mind that i should sleep for a bitter sorrow and anxiousness be oft upon I when that i do think upon she and this you may know for truly i know not what terror be come to she afar in the silence of the night and do i think overmuch i should feel that i could have no calmness needful to sleep but to need to walk for ever until i die which could not be long and so should i make a foolishness of mine anxious journey to do she true service and to save she from destruction if such do truly threaten and i be soon go over to sleep and wake not for seven hour be much wearied by the fight and the soreness of my body the which do put I into a great pain as i do rise upward from my slumber but this be presently something less and i eat two of the tablet and drink some of the water and afterward do put my gear upon I and go forward into the night have the disko in my hand and my heart be glad that i have come safe through the time of my sleep now i walk six hour and do stop a little to eat and drink and go on again and it be in this second third of the day that i see afar to my right two strange and wondrous man and they do shine as they have be make of a pale mist and they come anigh go very swift and do seem as that they be maybe forty foot high yet have no thickness and i hide downward into the moss-bush and they past I so quiet as a cloud of this day might go and do appear to be if i do guess but a hundred fathom off yet be this no sure thing for they position have no more surety than shall a rainbow have in this age and so they be go onward into the night and do seem to come out of the north and they do appear not to wot of I and whether they be harmful i know not for they harm not I and i lay there in the moss-bush until they be well go away and i have belief that they must be those same mist-man that be tell of in certain of the olden record but be never see anigh to the pyramid though i have think odd time to see man as of mist through the great spy-glass when i be within the tower of observation but they be always a mighty way off and some would say it be but a bright vapor that do move yet would other be in doubt and so be it ever in such matter and here let I take chance to say how that it be a hard thing to speak of such happening to man of this age and to make the truth proper unto they and because of this oft be i tempt to say no word upon many thing that i do see yet must i tell my tale or suffer from the weight of it within I and so shall you hark to I and give I you sympathy and human understanding and concern these mist-men i have wonder oft whether they be the visible shape of some of those many force that be abroad in the night land for they do truly seem to I as that a thing of strange life be half show to my human eye yet i do not know and be but tell of my natural thought and pondering now as i do say those mist-man be never see nigh unto the pyramid and be as i do hint always so far off that they be half give over to the fable of the olden day in the belief of the people of the mighty redoubt and set about with a halo of unrealness for none within the great pyramid have ever behold they with surety and because that now i see they anigh to I it be bear in afresh upon my spirit how greatly i have wander away and how that i stand afar in the lonesomeness of that land of night as it have be that a man of this age do wander amid the star and perceive a great comet to go by he very close for then he should know in he heart how that he be far off in the void and this i do say to you that you may know somewhat of the emotion of my heart in that moment yet presently i shake free of my melancholy and lonesomeness and rise up out of the moss-bush and go onward and as ever i think much upon the maid that i do search for yet strove to think quietly concern she state else should i have turn to run and wreck my body before that i have go any great way and that day i pass seven large fire-hole and two that be small and always i come softly unto they for there be oft live thing about the warmth and at the sixth fire-hole i do see that which i do think to be a great man that do sit to the fire with monstrous knee draw upward unto he chin and the nose be great and bent downward and the eye very large and do shine with the light from the fire-hole and move watch always this way and that so that the white part do show now this side and now that but it be not properly a man and i go away very quiet from that place and look oft backward until that i be sure of safety for it be a very horrid monster and have that place to be for a lair as i do judge from the smell thereof and when the eighteenth hour be come i look about for a safe place to my sleep and i keep away now from the fire-hole for i do always find the more life there yet when i come to my rest i be lack of warmth by reason of this care and could scarce sleep at all because that i be so cold yet manage something of slumber after a while but wake very stiff and be glad to beat my hand and bestir myself that i should come to some warmth of life and after that i have eat and drunk i put my gear upon I and take the disko in my hand and go forward again upon my journey and here i should tell that i be come soon unto the north-west border of the plain of blue fire and presently i be but a little way off from it and do go direct to the north so that the plain be always upon my right now this plain be a strange and fearsome place as you shall see for it be as that a blue void do rise upward from the earth in all the country of that plain for surely the plain do not lumber with flame but be hide with a strange and inburning light as of a shine atmosphere of a cold blue color and it do throw no sure light upon the night land as have seem proper but be a very dreadful cold shine as of a luminous and blue void and the moss-bush grow nigh to the edge of the plain and do show to I black and strange against that horrid gloom of light and you shall know that i could not see into the plain for it be as that the cold blue light be a void that swallow all within it and give no power to the eye that aught should be perceive and it stand between I and the mighty pyramid and i could nowise see across and i know not whether i do make all this matter clear unto you for surely it be no easy task and presently i have go very quiet upon my hand and knee through the moss-bush and i come near upon the edge of the plain and hide there in a clump of the moss-bush and peer forth and hark and i hear constant voice that do call to one another across the plain as it be that strange people of spirit do wander within that blue shine and do make a call one to the other and be all hide and hold apart and surely i could see naught and do judge as i have writ that they likewise go blindly and truly be this a strange matter to set out and easy to think on with doubt yet as i do see so have i tell for in verity there be surely hide people of spirit scatter and lose afar upon that improper plain and you shall judge that i keep safe hide for whether this might have any natural explain or whether it be a matter that do go utter beyond knowledge of man i do not know for surely in that strange land it do like to be a horrid danger in any case and whether of some monstrous creature or of the evil force of the land i do wisely to be away and for two day i do make a safe coasting of the plain of blue fire and do keep well off maybe two great mile among the moss-bush and i make a very good speed through the darkness and at the eighteenth hour of each journey i make a place for my slumber and the first i do manage under a thick bush but the second be high upon the ledge of a rock that grow upward in the night amid the bush and save that i be bitter cold there do no harm come to I and in all that time of journey i have no sight of the mighty pyramid for the blind shine of the plain of blue fire be ever between now there have be certain little matter in my journey beside the plain of blue fire which i have not set down for they be of no account and do but repeat much that i have tell before and indeed there be naught in that part of my journey save that i do pass nineteen great fire-hole and four small and do observe no life beside any save about one of the great hole that there be no hollow around and here i do happen to see some strange and ugly creature so big as my head that do have a look of the scorpion of this age but proportion more squat and thick yet though they be naught to remark upon in that land they have be but woeful bedmate to any man as you may think and you shall know how it give a rest to my spirit that i do go so long with no trouble of the monster of the night or the evil force thereof and i grow bolder to my journey and make ever a greater speed of go and it be like that i take presently a less heed for my safety which be a wrong and foolish state yet there come no harm unto I in all that part of my travel then it be in the sixteenth hour of the third day of my journey beside the plain that i do come out beyond the end of it and have fresh sight of the mighty pyramid afar in the night upon my right and i stopt there in a bare place among the moss-bush and do in a weak moment hold up the disko so that i make a salute unto the pyramid mine home for truly be i so utter glad to behold it once more and in a little while be i aware that there be a disturbance of the aether of the world all about I so that it do seem that there have be one at the great spy-glass to watch for my come into they sight from behind the shine of the plain of blue fire and it be like that news have go downward through the city of the great redoubt so that they do print the word of it in the hour-slip and by this there would be many great million think upon I and a rush unto the embrasure that they might spy out at I yet i doubt that any glass might perceive I surely at so great a space save the power of the great spy-glass in the tower of observation but the emotion of the million to reach to I and you shall know that it do seem homely and sweet unto I to hear all about I the shake of the aether of the world and to be ware that so many do think humanly upon I and have prayer unto my safety and it be a strange thing to stand so utter far off in the night and to look back to that everlasting hill of light that be grow something small by the distance and to have surety that i be lookt upon through the great spy-glass maybe by the kindly eye of my dear friend the master monstruwacan and so keenly that he could it might be make almost to guess the look within mine eye as i do gaze backward unto that mine home yet though this dear and homely sympathy be a sweet and companionable thing to my heart it come swift to my thought that i be in a sore danger if that they cease not quickly to think so onely upon I for surely be i not come over-near unto that _ dreadful _ house of silence and well might so much emotion of the million tell unto the horrid power that dwell within how that i be even anigh and so shall you see the mixt feeling that come upon I everyway yet as it do chance the aether be quiet in a little for it do need unity of the million -lrb- be that they be untrained to they spiritual power -rrb- to stir the aether and so be i more easy of mind and go forward again upon my way now as it do chance at the eighteenth hour i be come to a place where i hear a noise of water and i go to my left that i might come upon it and there boil a hot fountain that go up out of the rock of that place and the water rise upward in a column and be maybe so thick as my body and it fall unto the north for the water come not up straightly but do shoot out from the earth unto that way and i see the thing plain for there be many fire-hole all about as you shall have wott from my tell and so be there a certain and constant light in that part of the land and i follow the water that run from the fountain and try it with mine hand but find it to burn and so do go further beside it for presently it should be no hotter than i do need and it go onward wind among the moss-bush and send up a constant steam that hang about it and the steam make a red cloud about the way that it do go for the light from the fire-hole make a shine upon it and so be it a wondrous pretty sight now presently i try the stream again and find it to be nicely warm and i sit upon a little rock and take off my foot-gear that i might bathe my foot which be go something tender moreover i do ache to have the sweetness of water about I and i make that i should bathe my foot and afterwards find a place among the moss-bush and so eat and drink and have my slumber then as i do sit there beside that warm stream with my foot dabble therein i hear sudden afar off the voice of a mighty night-hound baying in the night and the sound come from the north-west of the plain of blue fire and there be afterward a quiet and you shall see I sit there upon the rock by the side of that smoking river and the steam all about I and my foot within the lovely warmth of the water and i very still and freeze with a sudden fear for it do seem to I in a instant that the night-hound might surely be upon the track of my going and after that there have pass a little time the while that i do listen very keen lo there burst out in the night as it do seem scarce a mile off the monstrous deep baying of the giant hound and i know surely that the brute do track I and a sick and utter horror do fall upon I so that i could scarce get my foot-gear upon I once more yet in truth i be not long to the matter and be to my foot and do hold the disko ready and very desperate i be to the heart for it be ever a fearsome thing to be put in chase and the worse a hundred time when there be a sure knowledge that a deathly monster doth be the pursuer now i do stand there but a moment it do seem to make a anxious consider how that i might best assure I some chance to live through this swift come danger and then do i think upon the stream to use it and i leap quick therein and do run very strong down the middle part which be nowheres so much as thigh-deep and oft not above mine ankle and as i do run there come again the bellow of that dire brute following and be now as mine ear do say scarce the half of a mile to my rear and i do run but the stronger for the dread of the sound and so maybe for a little minute and after that time i stopt from mine heavy running and go very wary that i make no loud splashing for by now the monster-brute should be something anigh to that place where i do enter the stream and i look round with a constant look but do see no surely visible thing though my fear do shape I a hound from every shadow of the moss-bush about I then in a moment i do hear the great beast for it bay but a little way up the stream as that it have overshoot the place where the scent do end and immediately i sink swiftly into the water which be there so deep as my knee and turn upon my belly and the water surge over my shoulder for i keep my head above and so i do look eager and fearful through the steam into the shadow and the half-darkness towards where i do think to see the night-hound and in a moment i see it come and it be a little vague by reason of the smoke of the river yet do seem black and monstrous in the gloom and great as a mighty horse and it go past I at a vast and lumbersome gallop but i do not see it in that moment for i dive my head down unto the rock of the river bottom and hold downward until that i be like to burst for sore longing of breath then i put upward my head and take swift and deep breathing and lookt about I very cautious and fearful as you can know and i hear the night-hound casting round among the moss-bush and it do send up a wild and awesome baying and i hear the bush brake and smash beneath it as it do run to and hither and afterward there be a quiet yet i move not but stay there very low in the water and do have a thankful heart that it be warm and easy to persist in for i have surely die of a frozen heart if that it have be cold for by this time you do know even with I how bitter be the chill of the land now i have be awhile lain thus upon my belly and hear no sound from the monstrous hound yet i cease not to be full of a horrid unease concern the great beast for i do better to know what it do than to have no know and sudden i hear the sound of it run very swiftly and come nigh and it pass I and do go up the stream and there be surely a quick stupor upon I for i duck not my head under the water but stay very still which as it do chance be maybe not such a utter foolishness for my head do seem in that half-gloom to be mayhap no more than a little rock in the water and i make no move to tell of life yet should the hound have smell I and that it fail in this matter doth be a puzzle to I and as the great night-hound past I it tear the earth and the bush with the exceed strength that it put forth to run and clod of the earth and stone of bigness be cast this way and that by the foot of the hound run and so shall you have a little knowledge of the strength of that beast and the hound run on into the distance and presently i hear it bay in the night then i rise and go onward down the warm stream and make a strong walking yet keep alway to the water and oft do stop a little that i should listen and always i hear the night-hound a great way off in the night bay and seem that it do surely run to and fro search now i journey thus for twelve hour and the baying of the hound make search do never cease and i keep always to the water as i do say that i should leave no scent unto the hound and by that twelve weary hour have go i find that i be come anigh unto the house of silence and this put I in great trouble as you may perceive for surely have mine whole effort be to the end that i should avoid that house by a great way yet have the hound drive I thus a-near now i see that the small river do go onward and do make a breach across the road where the silent one walk and i determine in my heart that i should leave the water which be now grow nigh to a bitter cold in that it be so long upon the face of the land yet chiefly do i mind to leave the water that i should come no more anigh unto that house of silence for the water do go that way and i stand awhile and do listen for the baying of the hound but could hear it no more and do have a surety within I that it be indeed go from search for I then i come out of the water and go forward stoop and creep among the moss-bush go outward to the westward of north so that i should go away so quickly as i might from the nearness of the house yet lo i be go upon my hand and knee no more than a hundred fathom when i do find the moss-bush to cease to the westward for a great way and there to be a great bareness of rock which in truth be much show thereabout and i dare not to go outward upon that naked land for then i have not be hide by the moss-bush but have stand plain there for all thing of the night to behold and moreover though i could nowise have a sure knowledge concern this matter yet do i hope within I that i should make a sure hiding from the power of the house of silence do i but go very low among the bush but indeed it be like enough that naught could give I hide yet should i lose no chance unto my safety and because of this i go backward among the bush and cease to escape out unto the westward and i find presently that the moss-bush make but a narrow growth in that path and grow only for a while by the side of the great road so that i be surely fain to keep nigh to the road that i have the covering of the bush and in a while i find the road where the silent one walk to bend inward at the north of the house of silence so that it come right horridly close unto the house for here the hill on which the house do stand be very abrupt and fall steeply unto the road and so be that dreadful house stand up there above I in the silence as that it do seem to _ brood _ there upon the land and this side do seem truly as the other and equal lone and dreadful and the house be monstrous and huge and full of quiet light and it be truly as that there have be no sound ever in that house through eternity but yet be it as that the heart do think each moment to see quiet and shroud figure within and yet never be they see and this i do but set down that i bring all home unto _ you _ heart also as that you crouch there with I in those low moss-bush there beside the great road and do look upward unto that monstrous house of everlasting silence and do feel the utterness of silence to hang about it in the night and to know in you spirit the quiet threat that live silent there within and so shall you have mind of I hide there among the bush and sodden and cold and yet as you will perceive so hold in my spirit by a utter terror and loathing and solemn wonder and awe of that mighty house of quietness loom above I in the night that i wotted not of the misery of my body because that my spirit be put so greatly in dread and terror for the life of my be and also you shall have before you how that i know in all my body and soul that i stand anigh to that place where but a little while go there have pass inward so dreadful to a everlasting silence and horrid mystery those poor youth and after that you have mind you of this you shall consider how that the memory of all my life hold dread thought of the monstrousness of that house and now be i anigh unto it and it do seem to my soul that the very night about it hold a anguish of quiet terror and always my mind do come back to the sheer matter that i be so anigh and this thing i do say unto you once and again for truly as you do see it have imprinted itself deep into my spirit yet shall i now cease from say further in this manner for surely you shall never know all that be in mine heart and if i cease not i do but be like to weary you and so do i hide and creep and oft pause to a time of shake quiet and afterward gather something of new courage and go onward and peer upward at that monstrous house stand above I in the night yet as it do come about i come presently clear of that horrid place for the road come round again unto the north and i begin that i make a better way through the moss-bush but never that i grow to much speed for i have oft to go about that i should miss a naked part here and another there for truly there be a abundance and bareness of rock so that the bush grow not so thick as i could wish and in the space of five hour be i clear of that house and do have a greater ease about my heart but yet be not free to come to food nor to slumber the both of which i do sorely need for i have sleep neither eat for a weariful time as you do know but first i must go further off from the house and afterwards come to some fire-hole that i should dry myself and get warmth again into my body which be bitter cold and now that i have come unto the northward of the house of silence there come to I a great wonder which breed in I a mighty hope and gladness for as i do go among the bush there break sudden all around I in the aether the low and solemn beat of the master-word and the throb of the word be utter weak so that one moment i do say unto myself that i hear and in a moment that i do not yet have i no proper doubt in my heart and i reason with myself and with a great shake of excitement and expectation upon I that the master-word come not from the great pyramid which should have power to send it as a great force across the everlasting night whilst that this that throb about I be faint and scarce to be know even unto the keenness of the night-hearing which be mine and immediately as i crouch low there and thrill with the hope that be breed in I lo there seem to come the far faint voice of naanus call with a little voice within my spirit and i think the cry to have a utterness of supplication within it so that i grow desperate to up and go to run yet do curb such foolishness and stay very hushed to listen but i hear no more yet be shake continually with the joy and hope which this call do breed in I for truly do it seem now that i be right that i do determine to go unto the north for sure be i now that the lesser redoubt lay that way in the night and it do seem plain unto I that the house of silence have put a barrier between and have power to withhold so weak a call and now have i come beyond the barrier and i do perceive in my heart how that naanus have call off maybe in the sadness of despair yet have the weak cry of she brain-element be hold from I by the horrid power of the house and surely as i do think it be well name for it do make a silence and so shall you stay with I in you heart and take to ourselves something of the new gladness that hold all my be for it do seem truly that my bitter task and adventuring should not in the end be offer to uselessness and that i do truly draw unto that far place in the everlasting night where mine own maid do cry for I that i should succor she and ever as i go do i hark but there be no more the low eating of the master-word in the night not at that time and presently i spy outward to the west as it do seem a good mile off in the night the shine of a fire-hole and i begin to plan that i should come unto that place and have warmth and dryness and food and slumber and in verity so set be i to the need of these matter that if there do be a monstrous thing nigh to the fire -- as be so oft the case -- then would i give battle unto it for neither my joy nor my labor do serve to put warmth into my body and i must surely come anigh to fire or die then as i kneel upward among the moss-bush and make to lay a true course unto the fire-hole i perceive that there come a be along the road unto my right and i go low into the bush and move not for truly i have see that there draw nigh one of the silent one and i make a little place that should let I to see and i spy out with a utter caution and lo the be come on very quiet and with no hurry and in a time it go by I on the road and do take no heed to I yet do i feel that it have knowledge that i stoopt there among the moss-bush and it make no sound as it go and be a dreadful thing yet it do seem unto my heart as that it have no trouble of wanton malice to work needless destruction to any and this i crave strangely that you to understand for it be so to I that i have a quiet and great respect for that thing and do feel no hatred yet be very dreadly in fear of it and it be huge in size and be shroud unto its foot and seem maybe ten foot high yet presently it be go onward down the road and i be no more trouble by it then do i make no waste of time but set off unto the fire-hole and keep so much to shelter as i might but be oft make to run over baked place ere that i should come to more of the bush and i come presently nigh unto the fire-hole and make a pause and creep unto it with a great care and i find it to be in the bottom of a deep hollow of the rock of that part and the rock be clear look of all live matter the which do make I to be glad and i go round about the top of the hollow carry the disko very handily but there be nowhere any live thing and i fear not to go downward into the deep hollow and so unto the fire-hole which lay in the bottom as you have perceive and when i be come there i make a close search of the rock and find it be very sweet and warm and there be no serpent neither any stinging creature so that a certain comfort come upon my spirit then stript i off mine armor and gear and afterward all my garment so that i stand naked there in the hollow yet be that place almost so warm as some mild oven and i have no fear to suffer from the cold of the night land but be uneasy lest that any monstrous thing should be anigh to come to take I so unawares now i wrung the garment and spread they upon the rock near unto the fire-hole where it be hot and i do rub my body very brisk with my hand so that i glow into health and have no fear of a stiffness and afterward i do look to my food and drink and to the matter in the pouch but there have no harm come to any by reason of the tightness of the scrip and the pouch that have keep off the water and i eat and drink there as i stand wait for the garment to come to dryness and i walk about a little as i eat for i be restless to be into mine armor swiftly and now i do turn this garment upward of the dry side and now that but do find they to steam so that i turn they many time before they be proper yet in truth they dry in but a little while and i gat I into they very swift and into the armor and i feel the strength and courage of my spirit to come back into I which have go outward somewhat when i do stand there so naked and this feeling you shall all have understanding of and know that you would have feel that way likewise have you but stand there in that land in so unhappy a plight and when i have come into mine armor i put my gear upon I and take the disko into my hand and do climb out of the hollow for i would find a more secure place to my slumber and do not dare to sleep in that place for it be beyond seven and thirty hour since that i do have sleep though as i do see by my count i have make it to seem but as five and thirty yet be a part consume in diverse matter that i have not set down and you shall mind how bitter have be my labor and weariness in all that time and i do know of a surety that sleep must come heavily upon I so that i be sorely in need that i should search out a safe place for i should not be lightly wake until that i have sleep away the tiredness of my heart and the weariful aching from my body and indeed i should mind you how that i be not yet come perfect from the bruise which i have get from the fight with the yellow thing and presently when i have search but a little while i do find that a rock stand upward from a great clumping of the moss-bush unto my left and i go over to the rock and make a search about it and i find that there be a hole into the bottom part of the rock and i thrust the disko into the hole and make the blade to spin a little so that it send out a light but there be no thing in the hole and it do seem a dry and safe place for my sleep then i turn I about and go into the hole with my foot that way and i find that it be so deep into the rock as the length of two man and just so wide as i could lie in it without have it to pinch I and there i make my bed in the hole and go swift unto my sleep and scarce have but a moment even to think upon naanus and by this thing shall you know how utter be my weariness now i wake of a sudden and be very clear and refreshed and i creep to the mouth of the hole and lookt out but there be all a quietness round about and nothing to threaten and i find that i have sleep ten hour so that i make a haste to eat and drink that i should go forward swiftly upon my journey and at that time as in the time when i do eat naked in the hollow by the fire-hole i eat four of the tablet and this you shall understand to be rightly due unto I in that i have go so long fasting in that my great journey to come safe from the hound and to come past the house of silence and this shall seem but a little thing to you yet be it a wondrous important matter unto I that have go so long with a empty belly and be never satisfied and neither should any be that have eat so little as i do eat and make to fill they belly always with a drink of water yet i doubt not but that it do keep my soul sweet and wholesome and no useful thing to the power of evil of the land and when i have make a end of so great a gorging and have cease to be drunken with water i gat my gear upon I and take the disko into mine hand and so go forth once more towards the north and presently i be nigh unto the road again for it do curve something westward a space beyond and i be sore tempt to go upon the road for the ground be rough and the moss-bush do catch my foot yet do i stay among the bush though the road be true and smooth by compare and by this tell you will perceive that i walk once more upright and have give over to crawl between the bush and in truth this be so for the land do seem very quiet in all that part and i have less of fear now that i stand beyond the horrid unease of the house of silence now after that i have journey twelve hour i see that i be come upon the commencement of a great and mighty slope as that the world do slope downward always towards the north and i go on again after that i have eat and drunk as i do likewise before this at the sixth hour of that day 's journey and presently i perceive the road to cease and surely this do confound I as that a man of this age have come to a part where the world do end for you shall know that the road be that which have seem to go on for ever and you shall mind the way of my life up till that time and so shall you the better conceive of my bewilderment and as it be a feeling of great strangeness unto one that be overprest as you would believe with strange matter yet truly be this all as the little book of metal have tell unto I and so should i have be something prepared yet be we ever thus need eye-proof and perhaps it be more proper that it be so yet you shall perceive I adrift somewhat as to direction for i have steer before this time so that i should come to the north of the house of silence and afterward have shape my way by the road but now be i adrift as it might be set down in the wilderness and so do i stand and consider and presently do look unto the far pyramid which be now a great way off in the night and have seem but small by that which i know it to be and lo as i do look i perceive that i could but see the high upper-point of the light of the great pyramid where do shine the last light and i be confound afresh yet in a moment i see that the greatness of the slope do account for this but here i should tell to you that the slope be nowise steep but do seem as that it should never cease and mayhap this be clear unto you and i perceive surely that the time be come when i should make a utter parting from the great redoubt and the thought come very heavy upon I and in the same time i know that the aether be stir by the emotion of the million so that i have knowledge they watch I with the great spy-glass and do send word down unto the hour-slip and by this do the million know and have a great thinking upon I in that moment and you shall perceive how utter lose and lonesome i do feel and it be at that time that i do test the compass to comfort I as i do tell before this and fear i must sure forget when i do come to the proper place yet have i mind I as i do desire and i saw now that the night land that i do wot of be hide from I by the slope and i turn and look down the slope and surely all before I be utter wildness of a dark desolation for it do seem to go nowhither but into a everlasting night and there be no fire down there neither light of any kind but only darkness and as i do feel eternity and downward into that blackness do the great slope seem to go for ever now as i do stand there look downward into the dark and often backward unto the shine of the final light and put to a horrid desolateness behold there come the low beating of the master-word in the night and it do appear as that it have be send to give I courage and strength in that moment and do seem unto my fancy that surely it do come upward unto I from out of the mighty blackness into which the great slope run yet could this have be but a belief for the aether doth have no regard unto direction to show you whence the spiritual sound doth come and this do my knowledge and reason know full well and i make that i would send back the master-word send it with my brain-element and so give news unto naanus how that i do struggle to come unto she yet do i have caution in time for in verity have i send the master-word then have the evil force of the land wott that i be out and mayhap have come swift unto my destruction and so do i contain my spirit and desire and make to do wisely yet be i put in courage by the low beat of the master-word and do listen very keen that some message should follow but there come none neither do the weak throb of the word come about I again at that time and because that i be now grow more to my natural state and do feel that i should indeed find the maid i look once more unto the great pyramid long and eager and with a solemn heart yet with no sign or salutation as i be before determine and afterward i turn and go downward into the dark viii down the mighty slope now i go downward very quiet and slow into that darkness and do make but a cautious way for now you shall know I truly wrap about with such a night as do seem to press upon my very soul and such as you shall never have see nor feel so that i do seem lose even from my self and do appear as that i go presently in unreal fashion and do pass onward for ever and for ever through everlasting night so that odd while i do make to walk with random as that i stept no more upon this earth but do go offwards into the void yet be this foolishness of the mind set straight and proper each time that it do come about for lo i do kick against a upjutting rock here and fall upon a great and unseen boulder there and so be shake very quickly to a sound knowledge that i trode the hard and actual earth and have no true dealings with unreal matter and ever i do go downward and by this only do i have a guide to my way yet as you shall think through reason of the utter dark i make scarce a mile in a hour or even two full hour and so grow bitter by reason of mine unableness to go forward with a proper and free stride but i do think I presently upon a thing that i should do to light my path and to this end i do make the disko to spin odd while and do look down the mighty slope the little way that the strange glistening of the disko do show and so fixed my path into mine inward remember and would go forward afresh until that i be shake once more by the darkness and would fain to look once again upon the blessedness of light and make I some knowledge of my way and truly the light from the disko do seem astonishing great and this to be because there be so monstrous a darkness all about I there forever and thereafter would i go onward again until the pain of my stumbling do bid I surely to have that sweet shine once more unto my path and so shall you perceive my go and sore and miserable be it unto the heart and like to shake the courage of the spirit yet in verity i have come through much and do have intent to give way to no foolishness of thought and you shall well believe that i do make the light not more oft than i do surely need for it be no properness of wisdom to use the power of the disko save for mine extremity now presently when i have do thiswise through six long and bitter hour and it be now beyond the twentieth hour since i do last slumber i sit I down there upon the mighty slope in the everlasting dark and do eat two of the tablet and make the water and could but feel and hearken whether i do this thing right and that and when i have eat and drunk i unfold my cloak and wrapt it around I and place the scrip and the pouch under my head and the disko i take to company I and so fall swiftly upon sleep yet do think earnestly but vaguely upon naanus as i come unto slumber and i sleep all but six hour and do waken very sudden there in the utter dark and i get I to mine elbow and do listen very keen for i have wake immediately as that something have touch I or come nigh unto I and i gript the disko and listen but there do not even a little sound come to I out of all that night and presently i have more assuredness that naught do make harm about I and i sit I up in the dark and reach for my scrip and do eat and drink there in that utter night and fumble somewhat as you shall think yet i be do in a while and get my gear upon I and the disko into my hand and so to my foot and forward now all that day i do have a strange unease of the spirit so that i stopt oft to listen as that my soul tell of something nigh unto I that do follow very quiet yet do mine ear perceive nothing and so i alway to go downward again into the night that hold the slope and here should i tell how that in the early part of the seventh hour after i have eat and drunk and go forward as ever upon my journey down the mighty slope i do have a very sore tumble against a sharp rock for i put my foot sudden into a small hole and this do make I to pitch and i be utter shake by the fall and lay very quiet for a time for the rock have surely ript my body but for the armor and after that i be something renew of strength and spirit i make that i should go no more upon my foot but upon my hand and knee and thus should i feel the way that i go and have a less need of the disko which have not overmuch use to light my way in that i shone it not often and do guess more than i do perceive as you may think and so i creep all that day which be a bitter way of travel yet have i do many a sore mile thus through the night land and when that i have go downward for eighteen hour and eat and drunk thrice i cease from my labor and do feel about in the darkness that i come to a level place for my rest and so do find presently a place not so bad and do push and cast away such small boulder as have be like to irk I then do i eat and drink and afterward compose I to my sleep and have many a thought of naanus as i do drift unto slumber yet also have i memory of the strange half-fear that have be with I all that day as though something go constantly near I in the dark and because of this twice do i rise unto mine elbow and listen but hear no sound to trouble I and afterward do trust that i do but fancy and so come at last unto slumber that yet be not over-restful for truly i do listen even as i sleep and when i have be asleep scarce six hour i wake again very sudden as i have do before and have belief that something do be anigh unto I and i gript the disko and do hearken yet be there no sound that mine ear do wot of neither aught that have power to be surely know of the spirit and all that day be as the day before save that about the eighth hour i come near to fall into some monstrous pit in the great slope but do only fall with my breast upon the edge and so draw back and presently do crawl all around it in the dark and come safe unto the lower side yet shake and put more in trouble of spirit than before and fearful how i should go for i know not whether i have come among such thing or whether i have but few to sorrow I and so you shall perceive that i go over-cautious for a great while in all that utter dark but do think at last upon a plan to go with more surety and speed but to this i do need a cord and surely i have no cord upon I and if a boy be no boy that have none such about he shall not the same be say of any man and this i do think as i search I for the saying of that day have many that be like to this yet in the end i do compass my plan for i do buckle the scrip and the pouch together and take one of the strap from the pouch and this strap be long and thin and well suit unto my purpose then i fixt a stone into the end of the strap and buckle it there and after that i cast the stone before I as i go upon my hand and knee and i do hold to the hither end of the strap and so be able to have something of knowledge whether there lay any great deepness immediately before I and thiswise to strive that i fall not down some monstrous cliff in the night and so do i go cast the stone continually to my front down the slope and this you shall think to be a cumbersome fashion of travel yet be i in better case than in all the time since i have begin to go downward of the mighty slope in the everlasting darkness and at the eighteenth hour i do sleep and be wake strangely before the sixth hour even as i have wake before and this do put always upon I a new wonder and unease yet do no harm seem to come unto I and i do strive that i have no needful trouble of mind but that something be always nigh unto I in the dark i do truly believe yet have i no know that it be evil for it harm not I and three day more i journey thus and do never cease to creep downward weariful upon my hand and knee and the disko i have to my hip and so shall you know how i carry it and by this as you do know i have be on the great slope six day of utter dark and do have no wotting but that i go unto some dire and dreadful place for surely i have go for ever downward a monstrous way and here before i tell further i must set down how that the cold be much go from out of the air upon the slope and the air be grow as it do seem very heavy unto my chest and concern this matter i should say something for if i do mind I i have say not overmuch concern the air of the night land and the mighty pyramid for truly i have be so set to tell my story of all that i do truly see and adventure upon yet though i have say but little you will surely have perceive that the air of that far and chill time be not as the air of this but be thin and keen within the night land and lay not as i do think to a great height above the land but only nigh to the earth and as you do know through my telling there be a wondrous difference between the air within the mighty pyramid and that which lay without around the base for upward beyond that i do understand that there be no outward air that any should breathe and so be all the pyramid seal in certain wise in all the upper city for ever and whether it be seal _ utterly _ from the outward air at the base i do not surely remember if in truth that i do ever bother my head to such matter yet if i be set proper in memory and understanding we do draw air from the underground field but whether they gat any change or newness of air from the night land i have no knowledge and do lament that i have no sure know yet as you shall believe i could surely write a hundred book upon that wonder of the future and be still lack in the half of all that there be to be tell and so do i try to have courage to this my task and to have no over-trouble because that i do tell but a little of a great tale and here in this place will i set down how that the people of the pyramid be greater to the chest methink than we of this age but yet do i have no oversurety in the matter for well it may be that the reason of _ this _ age doth blind within I somewhat the knowledge that i have concern _ that _ for in verity be it not but a natural thing to believe those people to be great of the chest so that they should make a proper deal with the thin air of that place and that time and yet as i do strive to make plain unto you because that this thing should be by the making of my reason i do the more distrust that reason shall make foolish my knowledge for even a fool should suppose that which i have tell and the truth may be even otherwise yet that the people of the _ upper _ city have great chest i do well know for this be a common knowledge even as we of this age do acknowledge the people of africa to be of blackness or those of patagonium to be of great stature and by this one thing should any know a man of the upper city from a man of the lower city and because that there grow this difference among the people there have be once as any could learn from the history a plan whereby the people should be move upward and downward through the great height of the mighty pyramid from this city unto that yet have it meet with great disfavor and be put out of force and this be easy to be see as the natural way of the human heart and here it doth occur unto I that it be like enough to be a plan for health beside of training of the mind that each youth and maid be put to travel through all the city of the mighty pyramid the which do take three year and two hundred and twenty-five day as i have tell before this for by this plan be they make to breathe the air of every height and this mayhap unto the good of they develop and they also to discover that air which be best to they need and concern the air of the night land you shall know that there be in all that land no fly thing because that the air be grow very thin yet as the record do show there have once be monstrous flying-brute that go over the land in mighty bound but this be in a long go age and we could but suppose that the record give truth and here you shall know that when the monstruwacan do learn that i would journey through the night land in search of naanus there have be some foolish and well-intended talk among they that i take a small flying-ship that be in the great museum beside the model of the great ship for truly this machine be yet sound to go for it be make of the gray metal of the mighty pyramid that do seem to have no power to cease yet in verity i have no skill to manage this neither have it fly through a hundred thousand year so that none do know the mastership of that art which do be learn but by a constant practice and oft make uneasy by falling that do wreck the machine as i do know from the book of fly and moreover as i have tell the air of the night land be grow over-weak to uphold such a thing which i doubt not have make the people of the pyramid to cease from flying quite so much as that they do fear the force of evil in the night and if that there have be air and skill sufficient unto this purpose of fly yet have i be wicked with foolishness that i should work to be hung upward in the night for all the evil of the night land to behold and though i have go up some great way yet the machine have surely make a great noise in the quietness of the eternal night as you shall suppose now indeed be i go weary that i should need to tell so much concern the air of that time and place for surely i do seem to make this my story as that i do make a lecture upon matter of chemistry and so do i cast about that i may not bother to tell more upon this matter yet in truth a little more of my thinking and observing have i better set down here and so be do with it but you shall have patience with I and know that have this my story be no more than a idle tale i have be free to make no labor with such matter now there doth a wonder come to I why that the road maker who be of that far-off age which be before the age of the mighty pyramid do not _ fly _ downward from the upper world into the deep of the monstrous valley but do instead build a road yet it may be that the air of the upper world have grow thin a great age so that they have truly forget that once man do have power to fly but even if that they do have proper machine to this purpose surely it be a wondrous and fearful thing to fly downward a hundred great mile for they surely to have a dread that they never to rise again through so huge a deep and moreover the downward world that be the bottom of the great valley be full of monster as be tell in the little metal book and the monster be very strange and unknown and foreign to the whole world that have never come unto the deep of the valley and the valley have come as you shall mind when the earth do split and this thing be in truth like to be think that same ending of the world which all nation have be teach to believe shall come for in verity when the world do split and burst and the ocean rush downward into the earth and there be fire and storm and a mighty chaos surely it be proper to think that the end have come yet be it in truth but the beginning of hope of a new eternity of life so that out of the end come the beginning and life out of death and good out of that which do seem a dire matter and so be it always yet doth this go past my first wonder which do concern the wherefore that they make not to descend in thing of flight yet maybe shall my reason stand to show why this be not and again mayhap it do chance that some be wild adventurer and do leap over the edge of the upper world have to ease they flight certain contriving like to parachute and these you shall picture as that you watch they to leap and so shall you see they go downward into the gloom and you shall see they for maybe ten mile and maybe for twenty mile and afterward shall they be lose utterly in that great deep and see no more of any man for ever but when the nation become road-maker and come downward slowly to the monstrous deep of the mighty valley that do split the world then be they come there by million and with power sufficient to fight against the beast and afterward to grow back again to a ancient civilizing and so to the building of the great airship that be yet show in the great museum of the pyramid and here shall i cease from these my thinking on this matter for indeed who shall say what do be truly a reason for those people and what be they need and so do i come to no surety by my wondering yet as you do know all thing do seem verily to go in a circle for behold in time they of the mighty pyramid be likewise hold off from the glory of the airship and so be go backward a great way accord as we do look upon this matter and so have this be the way always as you shall know who have study and think and see the true way and going of life and now will i go forward in my tell and here will set down a sure thing that i do perceive both by mine ear and by my finger for as i do make clear to you but a while go there have come a change into the air as i do go downward of the mighty slope and truly i be come to a great and new deepness even beyond that of the wondrous depth where do stand the last redoubt so that i be afar down and in a monstrous night and the air here be of a great thickness and abundancy even as it might be the air of this we age or maybe more or maybe less for who may compare two matter with a sure guess that do have a eternity to keep they asunder and because that the air be grow very strong and apparent it shall be mayhap that it be by reason of this thing that the water when i do make it do fizz upward in a moment very loud and plentiful and do boil overward to the earth from out of the cup and wet upon my hand and surely this thought do come very keen to my reason as i do fumble each time of mine eating there in the everlasting night and lonesomeness of the great slope and so shall you have knowledge now of this and that thing which do come upon my thought and of the little and the big wonder and all shall help something to give unto you the ache of newness and bewilderment that be constant companion unto I now by this time as i have say i be go downward ever for six great day and i do seem as that i should presently come to the middle of the world for of go downward there be no end and then when it do be that i be near ready to believe this i perceive far off in the deep of the night a little shine that be yet weak and unsure and i do not know whether i can truly give unto you the great astonishment and pain of hope that do come upon I so that i grow sick in all my be but to behold once again the blessedness of light and to have help unto my belief that i go not downward to a utter desolation and i stand upward from my knee and do look very earnest and surely it do seem that a light be there afar downward in the night and again it do seem that i must be plague by my hope and by my fancy and that there be nowhere any light and then again i do see it very clear and not to be mistaken and i have a shake to come upon I and i gat I to a run and make a great and mad speed down the dark slope and lo i be not go any way but i go headlong and near brake myself and could but hold my tooth together very fierce and quiet until that the pain be something go from I and afterward i gat I again to mine hand and knee and go slowly as before and so for a great hour or more and do look oft and alway the light become more plain to my sight but ever to come and go oddly-wise yet do i go six hour before that i be come anywise near to it and by this shall you know how great a space off it have be and lo when that i do seem surely anigh unto it truly be it still far away in the night and i come not indeed near to it until that i be go onward again for three hour more and all that time do i yet go downward into the night but the slope now do not be so utter dark now presently i make a pause and stand upward to my foot so that i should the better perceive the light and lo as i do look toward it i hear a faraway sound in the dark as that something do set up a strange and monstrous piping in the night and immediately i go to mine hand and knee among the stone of the slope and keep myself low in the darkness so that i should be the less plain to be see do any monster approach but there come nothing to trouble I and i go downward of the slope for yet another hour and all the time that i do go the sound of the piping grow more in the great eternity of the night upon the slope and by this time be i come truly near unto the light but yet do not behold it plainly for it do burn beyond certain monstrous rock that stand between and i go to the leave for maybe the half of a big mile and all the while that i do go the piping make a mightier whistling in the night and it do seem presently as that the earth send forth the sound and revelry of wild roaring and i go the more silent and later do kneel among three rock and peer forth for a while upon the place before I and now be come nigh unto the light -- though yet it be not unhid from behind the great barrier of the uprising rock i perceive that i crouch within the mouth of a mighty gorge and the left side be a great way off and i see it plain at while when the light do rise but the light be to the right and it be so wondrous great that it do make clear to I that a mountain be to that side of the gorge and go upward into the everlasting night as it do seem for ever and afar down the gorge i do see the shining of strange fire faint and a great way off and so be i come at last to the bottom of the mighty slope yet the gorge also to go downward but not so great and presently i do go forward again and so do open the point of the rock as the sailor do say and i saw now that there gush forth a great blue flame from the earth and the mighty rock stand about it as that they be olden giant groupt there to some strange service and concern this flame i be not overmuch astonish in my reason for it have seem to I as i draw anigh that the fire and the sound should be make by the roaring and whistling of a burning gas that do issue forth among the rock yet truly though it do be a natural matter it be yet a wondrous sight and set amazement on my sens for the flame do dance and sway whitherward monstrously and sometimes do seem that it dropt so low as a hundred foot and afterward go upward with a vast roaring unto the utter height and do stand mighty and blaze maybe a full thousand foot so that the far side of the gorge be light and surely it be seven great mile off or more but yet do show plain and wondrous and the light do show I the flank of the mountain that make the right hand side of the gorge to go up measureless into the night and so shall you perceive that i stay awhile among the rock that be in the mouth of the gorge that i should gaze upon this thing but afterward i lookt this way and that way so that i should have a know of the place where i be come and it be a wild and stark and empty place as you must perceive and the far side do be great mile off as i do say and everywhere there be abundance of rock and lonesomeness and before I there go the great and dim length of the gorge and there be light here and light there in a great distance and oft -- as it do seem -- the quiet dancing of light in diverse place but yet be these go on the instant and ever there be a strong and vacant silence upon that place and presently after that i have look once more unto the mighty dancing flame and perceive nowhere any life around it i go onward down the quiet gorge and for a great way as i journeyed be my path light by the dancing of the blue flame and oft should i seem to be go but dimly among the rock and my shadow faint and long and lo the flame would leap and all the gorge come to a wondrous brightness and my figure to shorten and the shadow to be black and strong and so shall you perceive how i go and oft do i turn I about to behold the dancing of the great light for it be solemn to my spirit even amid so much of greatness and eternity to think upon that flame and to conceive that it have a utter age dance there at the foot of the mighty slope unseen through lonesome eternity and this i do tell unto you that thereby may you have some knowledge of the strangeness and the bitter loneliness of that place which in verity do seem the expressing of all the lonesomeness of my wanderings and all the time as i do go downward of the great gorge there sound the blast of the roar that be presently afar to my back and the mountain side do catch it here and in that place and send it offward with strange and improper echoing as of a chill piping or oddwise as hushed whispering of monstrous creature so that i do oft stoop to hide a little among the boulder for truly i know not but that some unnatural thing call from the darkness of the mountain side and for six hour i walk onward thus and sometimes do hide have a sudden fear as i have tell and presently in a great while the roaring be sink to a far and monstrous piping but in the end to no more than a far and uncertain whistle that yet do catch strange echo in the night and in the end there be only a quietness and yet as you do perceive there have be always a silence in that gorge as i have tell and this to the despite of the whistle and i do hope that you have understand with I in this matter for it be truly as i have tell and there be no contrariness of tell in this matter now in all this time that i have walk in the great gorge i have past four of the far light that i do see from the bottom of the slope and the two first and the fourth be blue but the third be green and all do dance and quake and send fitful shining into the belly of the gorge and there come also from they whistling and from the second one a low and strange moan noise and i doubt not the gas do come oddly and with trouble and i past these thing with no great thought for truly they be no matter for notice after that which i have behold now as you shall mind it be surely in the early third of the seventh day of my journey down the mighty slope that i see the first shine of the monstrous gas fountain and from that time until now have there past maybe sixteen hour and as you do wot i have eat not in all my travel since that i have see the light so that i be go to a proper lack inward and moreover it be full nineteen hour or more since that i have sleep and all that while have i labor and i cease I from wander and lookt about that i should come to a safe and proper place for my slumber and this i see very quick for there be dry stone and rock everywhere and no fail of hole and diverse place to my purpose so that i be soon in a little cave between two mighty boulder and here i eat four of the tablet for truly so many be my due and i have not be violent have i eat more and afterward i make some of the water and it do fizz up in a moment so that i perceive that but a good pinch make a great cup-full and this i set to the count of the strong and heavy air as i have tell which i do think to have a greater power of chemistry and presently i sleep have my gear about I as ever and the disko to my breast and as i go into slumber i think sweetly upon naanus as i have do indeed a hundred time since i be come to the hopefulness of the light of the gorge now whilst i sleep i dream that the master-word do presently beat all about I in the night yet as i do mind i wake not and because that i continue to sleep i have no sure know whether this be truly a dream or a happen and i mind I upon it when i wake but this be after that i have sleep seven hour and i could have no sureness anywise of the matter but only that i be come safe through my sleep though heavy within my head and limb as that the air do call I unto a further slumbering as be like enough and after that i have eat and drunk i put my gear about I and the disko to my hip for i need both my hand to the task of journey amid the great boulder and i set forth again down the half-light of the mighty gorge and through eighteen hour i make a strong go save when i do pause at the sixth and the twelfth hour to mine eating and by the eighteenth hour be come i be very ready to my food and slumber and presently i be asleep in a place of the rock and that day have i past three and twenty of the dancing gas fire and five be like a white fire but the other blue and green and all do dance and make a strange and uncertain light within the great gorge yet be it a peaceful thing unto my spirit that there be truly light as you shall understand and i sleep six hour and wake and do want more sleep as you shall think but i eat and drunk and put my gear upon I and go on downward of the gorge and at the sixth hour after that i have eat and drunk i come to a part where the big gas fire do cease to dance and there be a certain darkness upon that place yet be it not a proper dark for there come the glimmer of a flame here and the glimmer of a flame there as that little flame come upward between the stone and do vanish and come upward in another part and so do light and die out constant and forever amid the stone and the boulder of that lonesome gorge and make a low-spread light so that it do seem unto I that strange shudder of light beat upward through the dark of that place and i go onward and a heavy fume do seem to hang in the air and horrid gas to come upward from the earth in odd puffing and anon a light would leap upward beyond the next stone and afterward vanish and there would be a hundred thousand such upon every hand run to and fore and afterward for a moment a utter dark and again the little flame everywhere so that it do seem i go one moment amid the heart of a strange country of fire and immediately through a country of utter night and this be to I strange and a peculiar matter yet as i do think the gas do bother I the more for they do seem as that they be like to hurt mine health utterly for in verity oft do i seem as that i should choke and breathe no more by reason of the poison that come upward from among the stone and the boulder and all that time as they come or go do the little flame make small phlock of sound in the gorge as they do flash or die and the sound do seem to my liken as stone cast into a utter silent pool for they but make apparent the everlasting quiet of the gorge and afterward i come beyond this place and you shall see I go very lonesome among the rock of the gorge beyond and by this it be come nigh unto the eighteenth hour and i do find a place proper to my slumber and do eat and drink and be quickly go over unto sleep and here i should tell how that i have not a over-fear of evil power whilst i be in the great gorge for truly it do seem as that nothing that ever do live come anigh to that wild and silent place of stone and rock but that i journeyed through it alone and be surely the first that do go that way for maybe a million year and this feeling that be upon I i do hope you to perceive and take unto yourselve and thus have a understanding of my heart at that time and as you shall know i go always unto slumber with sweet and with troubled thought of the maid yet for a great while i have be put so mightily to the labor of my way that my heart do suffer less at this time than should be think and truly it doth show I how i be draw unto that one with all my be that i do surely think so oft and sweetly upon she amid so many peril and matter of horror and this doth seem something strange to say when that you do consider that i be adventured unto these same peril and horror but only for the sake of the maid and in six hour do i wake as i do strive alway to set myself to do yet be i very heavy and slow for a little until that i be more properly come to wakefulness and surely as i do think before this be like to be put upon I by the weighty air of the place but yet it might be that the gas which do float in the gorge be upon my lung and also as you have perceive if but you have attend my way the air be grow warm and oft be the rock pleasant to the seat and all of these matter do contrive to make I slumbrous now presently the gas fire do cease utterly in the gorge and i lookt downward along that great place and see only a greyness but above the greyness there be as it do seem something of a vague and ruddy shine in the night and this do wake I to wonder what new thing lay before so that i grow more eager among the boulder and later when i have eat at the sixth and the twelfth hour and go on awhile i come to a place where the gorge make a quick turn unto my left and at the end of the turning be a red and glowing light that be very great and wonderful so that i be utter keen to come to that place that i should discover what make the shine and the place where i be come then be very dark because that i be nigh under the mighty wall of the mountain of the right side of the gorge yet above as it do seem to I there be a far red upward glowing in the night then do i go forward very fast and presently in a good while i discover that i draw near to a second great turn that go to the right and about the seventeenth hour i come nigh unto the second great turning and here do i put caution upon I and creep for a while among the dark rock of that place that i should come to a sight of that which make the monstrous red shine and presently i be beyond the corner of the mountain and do look downward into a mighty country of sea and the burning of great volcano and the volcano do seem as that they burn in the sea and the country be full of a great ruddy light from the volcano and so shall you perceive I there among the rock that do all stand upward strange and bold and silent in the red and monstrous glare of the light and i as it do seem the one thing of life in all that desolation and eternity of rock and stone there in the end part of the great gorge and i peer forth into the wonder of the light and be full of thrilling and fancy that i be surely come to the place where the lesser redoubt have be build and immediately i know that this be not so for surer have not naani tell how that they be in a land of darkness and if this do be so truly how wondrous and dread a way have i yet to go if that this country of sea and mighty volcano stand between surely it do seem to I then as that i must wander search unto the world 's end and so shall you be company unto I there with my trouble and my thought and the immediate wonder and strange glory of that mighty country ix the dark pyramid now in two hour more i be come clear down out of the gorge and stand in that country and for all that i do feel fresh troubled and bewildered yet be i rejoiceful as you may believe in the surprising light and splendor of that sudden land and before that i have come down out of the great gorge i have stand high within the mouth thereof and lookt well out over the mighty country and i have count seven and twenty great volcano and this doth not take heed of two monstrous range of fire-hill that burn afar off something unto my right neither doth it take account of a hundred thousand lesser place of fire and truly it do seem a very land of fire and water for there be a small fire-hill stand within a sea as it do seem no more than a little mile from that place where i do stand and maybe a score to the back of it spread all about and here shall i do proper to tell concern the sea for there be of these that i do count at that time three that be small and a mighty sea that go onward for ever into the red light of the fire-hill so that it be go utterly out of my sight and do show no end and there rise up out of the sea island and on the island volcano but in other part the fire-hill do come upward straightly from the sea and over the near sea as it do seem there lay a plentitude of steam as that the sea do boil at while and in diverse place and there do seem to I as it be within the red atmosphere of that place as that there be a mutter thunder low and constant shake the air now from that distance and now from this and this do i judge to be the voice of the fire-hill speak with the fire that live in they and you shall conceive how utter new be all this unto I for there be in that country a constant voice of the energy of life so that the world-noise of this we age be even there again and with a keen and undoubted apparentness and the more so some way than now and here shall i set down more closely the thing that be ready to my gaze and first that it do much attract I there be a huge and blacken mountain unto the left of the mouth of the gorge and the mountain do go upward into the night maybe fifteen and maybe twenty mile and there be a mighty peaked volcano that grow out from the side of the mountain so high up as five mile as i do guess that height and this be upon the far side and above this there be a second maybe nine or ten great mile up in the blackness of the night that hang afar upward and as that this be not great wonder enough there do burn and glow two other mighty fire-hill at a utter height upon the left crest of that black mountain and these be upward so monstrous a way as that they do seem to make strange and smouldering sun within the night and truly as you shall perceive this be a wondrous thing and below these upward fire-hill there rise up from the earth vast mountain of ash and burned stuff that have be cast forth by these perched volcano and have pour downward unto the earth throughout eternity and so to build gray and sombre monument unto the dreadful glory of time and to my right there be always sea and sea and the red blaze of the fire-hill but unto my leave there be mighty forest and there rise upward here and in that place as that they be beyond the great wood monstrous fire-hill and so do you take from I something of that first impress upon my brain and sense and after that i have come down out of the mouth of the great gorge as i do tell a little while go i come upon a pause for surely which way be the way proper unto my search and i lookt about for a great while and afterward do climb back into the gorge and call myself foolish that i have not think to map my way ere i come down and when i be come up into the gorge again lo i see that there be but one way that i should go for truly as i have say there be only the sea unto my right but unto the leave where the shore do meet the sea there seem so far as mine eye do tell to I a clear way for a space and mayhap when i have come so far i should even find a further way to go forward and so do i descend again unto the country of the sea as i do ever call that red-shining country of water and fire and by that i be come again from the height of the gorge it be four and twenty hour since that i do last sleep so that i be fain that i should put into some nook and come to slumber as you shall well believe and i find I a neat and proper place where three great tree grow about a little basin of rock that be very dry and warm and here after that i have eat three of the tablet and drunk some of the water -- the while that my belly do yearn as ever for proper eating-stuff -- i make my bed in the little basin of the rock and lay I down and do begin to think awhile upon naanus but be go over to sleep before that i be aware and lo i be suddenly awake and do find that i swam in a hot water and a mercy i do think be it that i be not drown as i do sleep and i gat I to my foot and the basin be full of water hot and steam and pungent to the taste as well i do know and i perceive now that the water pour in from a smooth slit upon the far side and do come with a strange gurgling and bubble so that i conceive some deep well to boil and thus to drive upward this water into the basin and glad be i that it do not boil as it come forth and surely now that i be upon the dry land and do consider i do quickly suppose that the water have pour forth at season into the basin for a eternity of time and afterward do go back by fissure in the bottom of the basin and this to happen as i soon do find a little beyond the length of every hour and indeed the basin to empty slow as i do watch now be much wetted i stript off mine armor have before this dipt out mine effect from the hot pool and so do come down to the naked flesh and i find a place where the rock be hot and here i do spread my garment and whilst that they come to dryness i gat I into the hot pool and have a very pleasant bathing and do have no great fear of any dangerous thing for as it do seem i have surely leave all such behind within the night land yet do i have the disko upon the pool edge to my hand for i have no proper assurance in this matter yet as it do prove there be many monstrous beast in that country but never do i feel the nearness and horrid power of any evil force for these as i do conceive be congregate and gather about the mighty pyramid be attract thereto by the great spiritual essence of so wondrous a multitude of human get so close in one spot even as shark do come after the ship that have bullock within yet how that the evil power be give entrance unto this state of we life i have no sure know yet have i put forward certain thought on this matter in a earlier place and more than such thinking be surely vanity for there be no certainty in my reasoning concern the thing now presently be my clothing dry yet before this i have come out from that bath which truly be nigh all go backward into the earth and i dress I again and get my armor upon I and afterward be i in a more lightsome state of the mind and yet very ready to come again unto my sleep and this i do and have six hour more beside the pool and once be waken somewhat by the gruntle and bubble noise of the water that be make as the pool do fill time and again and when the six hour be go i wake very well fit in my sens and feeling to go forward again through that red-lighted country and this i do after that i have eat and drunk now all that day i go forward at a great pace and the nameless wood be unto my left and the shore of the sea unto my right and oft do i find that the tree grow even into the water so that oft do i go forward among the tree and a very wonderful thing be this to I that never have know before in all my life until i be come into that country how that a glad and wild mystery doth live among forest tree for there be no such strange wildness among the grove of the underground field though a solemn beauty in plenty and the scent of the wood be sweet unto my spirit as you shall wot now all the time that i do go there be the shore unto my right but alway to my left and around I oft-time as i do say the great forest and as i do go lo there be life in all those darksome wood and live eye do peer out odd while upon I and afterward go backward into the dark so that i wotted not whether to fear or to have no heed of trouble yet naught do come anigh to I to make any hurt and thrice in that day do i come to little fire-hill that burn redly and send out fire and noise so that i hear they trouble each time through the forest before that i be come to they and about each be there a deadness and desolation where the fire have kill the big tree yet as i do observe the quick life of little plant do grow more nigh as that they be bear and live between the time of the fire-burst and this i do take it that you perceive and in that one day i past thirty and seven boil spring but whether they boil truly i do have no knowledge only that they send out a great steam oft-time and some do make a strong roaring noise so that to hear they afar off in the forest be to think odd time that some wild beast roar strangely now when the eighteenth hour be come i sit I down as i have do upon the sixth and the twelfth hour and eat two of the tablet and drink some of the water which here do fizz very rich and quick and afterward i lay down to my slumber for i be greatly wearied and i have choose a place against a great rock which be so that no creature might come upon I from behind and i come easy upon sleep but yet i do fix it upon I that i slumber only with the body for i do know by the shine of the eye in the darksome wood that strange creature abode in the mighty forest and ere i be go over to sleep i think upon naanus as i have do much all that day as though she spirit do hover near unto mine and do strive pitiful to speak with I and this i set out to you that you shall know how it do seem unto I in my thought and fancying and as i lay there i put a blessing upon she and a determination into my heart that i make a more desperate speed of my go if that might be so that i come the sooner to that strange and unknown place in the dead world where do stand the lesser refuge and i be then asleep in a moment and lo sudden i be awake and lovely be the brightness of that country that do show I in a moment my danger and do not keep I suspend in fearful doubt as do the gray darkness and strange shadow and light of the night land for i see on the instant that i get I to mine elbow how that certain thing do crouch within the border of the tree no more than a score pace off and i perceive in a moment that my spirit have be give knowledge and have waken I and i stare the while that i do grip the disko and i see that there be six squat man that be humpt at the neck and shoulder and they do crouch all there in a row and be something hide by the shadow and i perceive that they watch I and the eye of the man do shine like the eye of beast and so shall you know somewhat of the strange terror that come upon I yet have i the disko and mine armor and though my heart do shake a little yet be my spirit assure to conquer now i gat I to my foot and have the disko ready within my hand and behold i could not see the humped man for they be go from that place yet never do i see they go though i have keep my gaze very steadfast upon that part where they do hide and as you shall understand i be near ready to believe that there have be nothing there within the border of the wood yet truly i know that the man with the hump have be there as i have see now i look presently and find that i have sleep five hour and i eat two of the tablet as i do stand there watchful and afterward drink some of the water and so be ready to go forward again for i be grow very anxious to be go from that place and do have no knowledge but that those strangely humpt man be but a little way off among the tree and might come upon I in a moment or further that they do go to call a army of other humped man to my destruction and after that i be ready and have my gear secure upon I i set off at a great stride and do hold the disko very handy and lookt this way and lookt that way and all the while make onward with speed for truly i be grow so lean and hard that it do seem to I that i have power to out-pace those man or aught else of they kind and all that day through thirty great hour do i go forward at that stride and do always watch and at every sixth hour i eat two of the tablet and drink a little of the water and go onward again and so do i hope that i be lose from those humped man yet though i do hope my faith be not this wise for twice and thrice do it come to I that there go thing through the wood to my leave all that day and do keep always to a level with my speed yet be always hide and as you shall believe this do be a very shake thing to my heart and do make my hope of but little account now because that i have no faith to company my hope i be not easy to have slumber until that i be come to a place proper and safe and so as i have tell i go onward through thirty great hour and in truth in all that while i do find nowhere that do seem to fit my need and lo about the end of the thirtieth hour i perceive that there be water ahead besides the water of the sea that be ever to my right and i think maybe that the sea do go inward at that part of the land but it be otherwise for when i be get to that place i find that a river come into the sea and do come out of all the country that lay unto my left and in the mouth of this river there be a small island and surely i do look across to the island and think it a refuge from the humped man that do surely play dog upon my go yet truly this be but a idle thought and my need be that i should come to some way to cross over the river that i go forward beside the great sea which do stretch onward as it do seem for ever before I upon the far side and i know not how to go across for i have no power to swim and have i swum there be surely monster in that great and warm-flowing river as you shall believe and i go upward of the river-bank that i might come to some place where the river do narrow and surely i have be like to walk a mighty distance to this purpose but that i come soon to a second river that do enter the first not a mile above the shore of the sea so that as you do perceive there be the sea to one side of I and this second river unto the other and the first river before I and thus be i sorely perplex as any have be truly that be in a like trouble yet as it do chance the need to go forward and the danger of the humped man put wit into I so that i lookt about for a tree that be fall and there be many yet great so that i be much wearied and something strain of the spirit before that i gat two little tree unto the water now when this be do i make I a rough pole of a young tree-plant and afterward i lash the two tree together with my belt and strap and so have somewhat of a raft and you shall picture that all the time as i do go about this business i be very heedful lest the humped man should come upon I ere that i be go free upon the water and this constant heeding do double the labor of my work as you shall perceive yet in the end it be do and i ready to adventure over the river and so i do push off with the pole and i pusht and paddle maybe the half of a hour for indeed it be all a clumsy contriving and mayhap i the more so in my labor yet presently i be come so far over that i draw nigh to the island and it do seem a wise and proper thing that i should have my slumber there and afterward go onward to the farther shore and this i do and after that i have eat and drunk as ever i lay down to sleep and by this time it be three and thirty hour since last i do slumber so that i be bitterly awearied and i have a great and restful sleep for truly the island do seem a very safe place and in verity i come to no harm though i be as a dead man for nine great hour and so shall you perceive my weariness and when i be come proper awake i eat two of the tablet and drink some of the water and afterward make a end of my voyage and then do take back my belt and strap from bind the tree and so forward again upon my way and no more fearful of the humped man for surely i do think i have leave they all upon the far shore of the river though afterward i mind I that they might grow likewise upon the two side but yet be i only discover by those upon the one as you do know and all that day i go very swift and past many strange matter and do coast upon wonder oft and at the sixth and the twelfth hour do i eat and drink as ever and between the eighth and the fourteenth hour do i come past two mighty fire-hill that make all the country to tremble with they noise and four time do monstrous creature pass by I but i be swift hide and come to no harm and oft as i do go be my thought upon the dear maid that i journey to save from destruction yet as you must see always be my thinking bring sharply unto my go so that scarce be i ever set off to ponder upon naanus but that there come some danger or wonder to give I heed to my way and because of this as you have learn i be more put to plan free of the instant trouble and peril of my way through all that mighty journey than to have quiet chance for thought of love unto mine own yet truly be not my journey one whole thought of love unto naanus and that peril make oft dumb my brain be but the truer song unto my maid and at time i be among tree but oft do go past unnumbered boiling spring and small fire-hill and oft be the air full of the noise of the little fire-hill and the roar of the boiling spring but there come no harm unto I and a thousand time do i perceive thing that have life and i make a very cautious way though with a great speed and cleverness of go that make my heart glad and oft do i come to part where a great life hold the tree and green stuff do flourish exceedingly and the air rich and full and wondrous sweet so that i be fain to think how that in some far-off time it might be that we child 's child should come down unto this country when the upper valley of the night land be grow to a utter chill and lack of air and here build they a new refuge if indeed any should come clear of the evil force and the monster that do live about the mighty pyramid in the night land yet how should they come clear of those thing so that this be as you do perceive no more than a thought that do rise vaguely in I and yet again who shall say what may be and onward i do pass and i do mind I how that i see the lower fire of that country to burn very fierce and this i set to the richness of the air but yet with no surety of knowledge and do but tell the same that you shall see the oddment of thought that go oft across my brain and so have so much knowledge as i concern this and that now a little before the eighteenth hour be come i come out from among the tree and the sea be downward of a great cliff unto my right for i have go upward for a long and weary hour and i do see now a thing that make I to be cautious and yet that do hold my heart to go swiftly to perceive the thing for it be very strange and i go forward quickly yet with a wise care and so be come presently more nigh and i perceive that the thing be in part a high rock very tall and pointed and maybe a hundred foot high but afterward i do find it to be more and there be a monstrous great thing upon the top of the rock that do seem very strange and i stopt and lookt and afterward go forward again and so for a time until that i be but a little way off and now i see that there do seem to be a mighty long rock lay across the topmost part of the upstanding rock and yet have a very strange and shapely appearance and do seem upon the underpart to be as that i have lookt before upon it and upon the upper part there grow tree and green thing even as these do grow upon odd ledge of the upstanding rock yet for the most the rock be very stark as that a blast have blow upon it and make it bare now when i have lookt for a while i bethought I that this should be a safe and proper place for my slumber if that i have power to come safe to the top and when i have think this thing i begin at once to climb up the rock and i find that the rock be very high so that in a while i be come a great way off the earth and yet be not come to the top of the rock and because that i be awearied i lookt about for a safe place to mine hand and lo there be a shelf of the rock very nigh that go inward a little to the side and i gat I to this ledge and do eat and drink and presently i sleep and scarce have think of naanus in the moment of my slumbering for a great weariness be upon I the which i do think to have come by reason that i be not yet proper rest from the task of the day that be go before that one now i wake very sudden maybe seven hour after and i have knowledge within I that my spirit do wot of some nigh danger and i gat upward from the rock very quiet and have the disko ready in my hand and i lookt swift about I in the moment that i do wake yet do see nothing for there be naught on the ledge with I and i creep to the edge and lookt downward and lo i do see that there come up the rock two humped man and they do climb very swift and silent and i perceive that they smell I and come to destroy I and i make ready the disko to do battle and cease not to look downward and i see how that the humped man do seem to be humpt by reason of they be so monstrous thick and mighty of the neck and the shoulder as that they have be human bull and i see that they be very strong and by the speed of they climb i know they be swift and so do i make steady my attention and my heart to the saving of my life for truly i do know that i should be dead in a little or they now i stept back a space from the edge of the rock and have the disko very ready for it be needful that i should kill one of those brute man speedy that i have no danger that one take I in the back whilst that i fight with the other then in a moment it do seem there come upward of the rock edge the great and brutish face of the man and in that moment that i slew he i do note curiously how that he have large tooth upon each side of the mouth and be aware that he have come so quiet as a great cat and in the backward part of my brain i bethought that even thus maybe be primal man so that a strange and secondary question and wonder do live in that part of I and i do learn from these scarce conscious reasoning that i be of belief the thing be truly a man but very crude and dangerous and surely it be strange that i have all this think in that little moment but in verity so it be though i doubt not but i bettered it with after thought when a while have go now the first man die ere he great haired breast be come upward over the rock and he sink back and sag and fall dully and i hear he bodge downward from rock to rock very lumbersome and so in a moment be silence then do i look this way and that way of the ledge for the second humpt man be not yet upon I and i fear that the pause do mean a cunning mischief and strategy and when a little time have past and all the while i be ready with the disko and naught do come upward to harm I i stept very soft to the edge of the rock-ledge and lookt downward but there be nowhere any thing to see now for a little moment i do think that the brutish man have run off be fear by the death that i do deal unto the first yet i put this from I at once for i do wot that such a creature do not be like to fear in such wise but be rather set to some horrid cunning of attack as i do fear and be somewhere below I among the hole of the great rock then i do think sudden that he might be go upward so that he should come down upon my back and i lookt upward of the mighty rock but do see naught and afterward i stoopt forward a great way beyond the edge so that i should perceive whether the man do hide beneath and behold he be there below I and crouch under the rock-shelf ready to he spring and in that moment he make unto I with so mighty a leap as any tiger should give and he come half over the edge and grip the disko by the handle in a instant and surely i have lose that trust weapon or be pull over and cast into the depth but that the disko do spin and the earth-current do make live the handle -- as be intend -- save where the grip be set and lo the man give loose the handle very swift for it have burn and shake the creature sore and i stagger back with the effort i have make to withhold the disko and the brutish man come upward again over the rock edge and leap at I yet he gat I not for i spring unto my right and make a blow with the disko even as i do leap and the blow come something short but yet harm the humpt man with a gash upon the belly very sore and horrid among the great brown hair of the man and immediately he spring after I but i smote full at the face so that he leap back from the strange roar and blaze of the disko and yet be harm for he gat not right free of the blow but do be cut very sore on the mighty and haired arm now see that he be something fear of the weapon i run in upon he and smite again at the face yet be the man go out of my reach before that the blow do reach for truly he be quick as a panther and immediately he do leap unto the ending of the ledge where it do join upon the rock and he catch the living rock between he two hand and truly the rock must have be splitten there for he tear out a monstrous lump so great near as my body and do run upon I with the rock above the head of he now i perceive i should be smash in a moment if that i do not slay the man very quick for so mighty be he that he do leap this way and that way after I as though the great rock do cumber he no more than it have be but a light matter and you shall perceive that i leap this way and that way to avoid the man and twice do strike he but yet be fear to brake the disko upon the rock which the man do use as a shield each time that i do make a blow and all the while i do act to escape when that the man should cast the rock as i do conceive at the first to be he intent yet truly it be as that he have no wotting that a rock may be throw for he strave only to come at I with the rock that he should crush I as with a monstrous club and in verity what should a man do against so horrid a attack and time and oft do i leap now to the right and now to the left and again in a moment i do cut the humpt man but the blow be something turn off by the great rock in the hand of the man yet so strange and mighty be the power of the disko that it shore away a small portion of the rock and do come to no hurt in itself and surely i have presently fail in wind and limb because of the leaping and charging that i do make and because of the weight of the armor that be not overmuch yet to be consider but that i faint not be by reason of the wondrous hardness and leanness that i be grow to with so constant a journey and strait living for the tablet do keep the strength in a man though truly they ease not the yearning of the belly and lo even the brutish man do grow weary and the hot breath and body-stink to come from he and surely who shall wonder for always he do rush to and fro upon I with the monstrous rock to crush I and sudden i leap unto the right of the man thinking within I that i do perceive a chance that i should cut he upon that side but truly he be less awearied than i do know for he come very sharp upon I and have I between he and the wall of the rock and surely i have no room to make escape and have die in a moment but that i make a sudden sham toward the leave with the disko as that i should leap that way and in the same instant i do go to the right with a strong bound and immediately do come in upon the humpt man from that side and i put my fortune of life to the stroke and stand anigh to the man and i smote he across the middle part before that he do wot of my intent and the blow slew the man very surely and do nigh cut the mighty creature in twain and surely he fall half leap even as he die so that the monstrous rock that be in the hand of the brutish man do crash down almost upon my foot and i leap very high that i should escape the thundering of the rock for in verity i be near slay in that last moment of the life of the humpt man but yet i live and come free of death and do have a relief of happiness about my heart as you shall believe yet truly i be much shake and a little weakness take I so that i be fain to go down upon the rock-shelf that i have back my strength and presently i be grow steady again and i take my gear and do haste down the rock and so be come presently to the earth again and i see the first of the humpt man that i do slay lie very quiet a little off from the bottom of the rock so that i go round upon the other side to avoid the man for it be no pleasure to mine eye or to my heart and truly it do trouble I always to make a death and when i be come round upon the other which be the seaward side of the rock i perceive that i be yet shake and i remember that it be wise to eat and drink and rest a little before that i do go further upon my way now as i do sit there at the bottom of the rock i look upward at the strange crown thereof and until that time i have be take up with the fight and with gazing this way and that to see whether there come other of the humped man to work I a harm but now that i be give some ease of the mind and of the body i see plainly that i know the thing that lay upward upon the rock for the shape have be something strange and half-known to I even before that moment as that i have a vague knowledge concern it but yet with no surety and now truly i do know in a little instant that the thing be one of the olden flying-ship the which as you shall mind there be certain in the great museum of the mighty pyramid and surely i be ready to wonder why that i have not see the thing plain before that moment yet be this like to be because that there be a shadow upon the other side of the great rock but upon this side there be a little fire-hill a way off to the cliff edge and this do throw a warm light that make a glimmer upon the dull metal of the ship 's bottom which be uncover to my sight and be surely of that same deathless gray metal that make the great redoubt and yet as you shall believe even as i say this thing to my mind that the strange matter upon the top of the rock be truly one of the olden air-ship i do feel that i should be proper to doubt for it be a very wondrous thing to perceive a thing common to man in that utter strange country and after that i be go so far off from the mighty pyramid yet in verity i do know in my heart that it be indeed that which i do perceive it to be and i do stand and walk to and fore and look upward constant for i be very keen that i look well upon it and truly as i do look from this place and from that place it be scarce a thing for wonder that i have not wott it to be a air vessel for there be great tree and abundance of earth and live matter upon the topmost side of the ship so that none could easy perceive it to be aught save a great and desolate rock that do lie upon the other rock yet truly it be as i have tell and presently i do make to climb upward of the great rock that i should come to the air vessel to enter it but yet be this not proper for i have surely no duty save to go forward forever until that i find the maid but yet do i spend a little while to this search of the ship and i do but set down that which i do and with a serious spirit and truly as it doth here occur to I i do be ever seem a serious young man as you maybe shall have grow to think but yet be i to a dread and serious business and the strain do be too great upon I and the trouble too much prest upon my heart to give I much of laughter as you do surely perceive and so you to give I you ear and you understanding for indeed before that i do lose mirdath my beautiful one i be not over-grave but so young and joyous as any now it take I a great time to go upward of the rock for it be so monstrous steep and high yet presently be i come nigh under the bottom of the ship and here i do perceive that she have be sore batter in that far-off age when she do come upon the rock for surely as i do perceive the peak of the rock be through the bottom of the ship so that the metal be burst this way and that and very plain to be see in some part but in other place the earth and grow matter do make a hiding and after that i have climb this way and that way i perceive that i must come to the topmost part by the plant that do hang over and grow downward and after that i have pull upon they to know that they be strong to hold I i go upon they and be soon to the top of the ship yet truly i might so well have be upon the earth for the ship be cover above by the earth and dust of a monstrous age of year so that i be like to need much time to dig downward unto the ship and because of this i consider a little while and afterward make no more to search she but do go downward again that i should come once more to my journey yet as you shall think it be with a queer thrilling of the heart and with strange thought upon the end of those that do come maybe to a bitter and lonesome die in that ship of the air in that far-off time when she do fly and surely it do seem to I as i go downward of the great rock how that the flying-ship have be there for a hundred thousand year and that mayhap the sea do live all about the rock in that age and truly this be no improper thing to think for it be like that the sea have be monstrous high and great in those day so that the rock be but a little island in the midst of the sea and now be the sea go small from a great sea to lesser sea and this through a eternity of year and always as it doth seem to I have the ship lain upon the rock and lookt quiet and silent over the change and wonder and the lonesomeness of all that country of fire and water for ever but how the air-ship do come upon the rock how shall i know save maybe it doth seem as that she might have fly low over the sea in that olden age and come hard upon the rock because maybe there be one to the helm that do steer unwittingly and again it shall well be otherwise and i do but set down mine odd thought and such as they be they have no especial use save that they do show to you the different workings of my mind at that time as i do go downward and so to set you the more in possession of all that i do have knowledge of and presently i be come again to the earth and do go forward with a great speed so that i should waste no more of that day yet oft do i think upon that ship hide there upon the mighty rock under the wondrous quiet ash of eternity and i go eighteen hour walk and in all that time i do see no more of the humped man yet three time be i put in a sudden danger for there go past I thrice between the fourteenth and the seventeenth hour great fly monster that be winged very ugly and do go as i think in a great bound rather than that they do fly proper as doth a bird yet i suffer no hurt from these for i be swift to hide between the great boulder that be very plenty in that part but no tree for i be go now past the forest of tree there be none since that i have go through a very shallow river that i come to about the thirteenth hour and this have i wade and sound my path with the staff of the disko but i have keep mine armor upon I lest there be thing even in water so shallow that might bite and work harm upon I but i gat through pretty quick and have no hurt do I now i have eat as ever at the sixth and the twelfth hour and by that the eighteenth hour be come i be nigh again unto a forest that come down to the shore that go alway upon my right and i to be very sore and wearied as you shall know for i have fight very desperate after my waking and afterward climb the great rock and then again to journey so that it be by this nigh to one and twenty hour since that i do sleep and surely i lookt this way and that way constant and do see no place proper to my slumber but afterward i consider i do be a fool to lack such for truly the tree be plentiful and i could climb a great one and strap my body safe and so have a sure bed for my rest and i do this thing and go upward into a great tree and do tie my body to the tree with my belt yet i eat and drink before that i go up the tree now when i be fast upward in the tree and have make a bed upon a monstrous branch and have the disko ready upon my hip so that it should not fall but be nigh to my hand i lay a little while think upon naanus and i go not over to sleep immediately which be strange yet mayhap because that my bed be so uncertain and i consider very gravely how that it be a monstrous long while since that i do hear the master-word from the dear maid and truly i be come a dreadful way from mine home which be the mighty pyramid for i have go onward for ever through five and twenty great day of travel and be not yet come to any place that do appear like to be that place where the maid do abide and it do seem that i might even wander onward in that great country of fire and water for a time beyond all that i have before go and this thought do put a great weight of trouble and weariness upon my heart for the maid have be in sore need of I and i do feel sudden to be all adrift in the wilderness but before this time it have seem as that i surely go aright and mayhap you sympathy shall tell you just how i to feel in the heart and after that i have lie there very awkward and think upon all matter i mind I that i would try the compass again upon the morrow but have no great hope of the machine yet do be willing to try aught to see where i have get to and truly as it do come to my mind if that the compass do point a little as i do wot it be use to point in the lesser redoubt then in verity i be surely come something more anigh to that unknown place of the world than i do dare to believe and this to be plain to you then a little time do pass in which i do wake and sleep and wake and sleep a little but with no surety of sleep but as that i be very tired of the heart and do but lie too wearied to come properly to sleep and odd while i do lie with mine eye half to open and do look very dreamful upward among the dark branch of the tree as they do show black and pretty against the redness of the shine that come from the sea for there be stand a great and bright-burning fire-hill in that part of the sea that lay off the shore from I and above the glaring of the fire-hill there be the deep night that do brood for ever above in a monstrous black gloom of eternity and do make the red smoke of the volcano to show deep and mighty and thunderous-seeming afar up in the great dark and the red and shine smoke do but show the utter hugeness of the night that have be upon the world through the great age and in verity as i do lie there so dreamful it do come to I afresh how wondrous strange be mine adventure and how that i do lie warm and alive in a country of red light and smoking sea and truly as i do remember and consider there be a great and lost world above I upward through the dark maybe a hundred and fifty great mile up in the grim night and this thing do strike I very solemn as i do lie and i do trust that you conceive how that there be in truth afar above in the eternal and unknown night the stupendous desolation of the dead world and the eternal snow and starless dark and as i do think a cold so bitter that it hold death to all live that should come anigh to it yet bethink you if one have live in that far height of the dead world and come upon the edge of that mighty valley in which all life that be leave of earth do abide they should have be like to look downward vaguely into so monstrous a deep that they have see naught mayhap save a dull and utter strange glowing far downward in the great night in this place and in that and surely as you shall have see i have set the great deep of the valley to be maybe a hundred and fifty mile of night for as you do mind it be conceive that the valley of the night land be a hundred mile deep and mayhap to be more and i have come from that place downward of the mighty slope and of the gorge a very great way yet in verity i do believe in my heart this measuring be utter wrong for i think the deep to have be monstrous beyond these mile that i do give yet have i no proving of this belief and do set it down for no more than it be now presently i have cease from these vague thinking and half dreaming and be go truly to sleep yet nowise do i sleep very strong but do seem to come anigh to wakefulness this time and that and as it do chance this be mayhap a very good thing for my life for i do presently come awake more surely and do turn on the great branch for there be a noise in the air that be not the noise of the great fire-hill and the noise do grow very heavy and lumbersome and in a moment there come seven humped man run among the tree as that some monstrous thing do pursue and immediately they be beneath the tree in which i do lie so that a great fear come upon I and i loose the belt from the branch that i should be free to fight and directly upon this i see that the man do leap upward into the tree beneath I but not as that they do wot of I or make to come at I but as that they do pay a great heed to some creature or happen that be far off among the tree and surely the noise do seem to come from that part and do grow loud and mighty and the humped man do all crouch very silent and do make no noise or motion one to the other but be quiet upon the lower branch and as i do look now more to my ease i perceive that they have each a great stone and bloody that do seem as that it be split to a certain sharpness even as a stone doth break very natural and they carry the stone under this arm or under that arm so that they have they hand free to all matter and alway the noise do come the more anigh and i see that a humped man do come run from among the tree and do run beneath that place where the seven humped man do be on the branch but they make no sign to the man to save he yet truly it be very plain that some monster pursue the man and immediately i see how this thing be for the humped man upon the ground do not run so fast as might be and i conceive that he do act to make some creature to come after he to pass under the man within the tree and surely this thing do prove to be for there come very quick a great and ugly thing that have a ugly way of put down the foot and do have seven foot to each side which be very strange and the back be as that it be horny and the belly of the thing do seem to brush heavy upon the earth and it grunt as it go and shake the earth with the weight of it so that a monstrous noise come from it upon so hasty a journey and i do wot that it be not such a thing as do properly pursue after matter of food but do rather eat of that which do need little haste but a monstrous strength to gain and that it do so make after the man be in truth because that it have be wound and make fierce for indeed there come blood from the creature from great wound upon the back but how these be make i could not know in that instant and it do go under the tree in which i be hide and in that moment when it past under the tree the seven humped man do leap out of the branch and do catch to the brute by the great horn of the spine and i see that the wound be in the joint of the spine as be plain when the back do work with the going of the creature and the seven humped man take the sharp stone from under they arm and do strike very brutal in the wound that be in the joint of the spine and the creature roar and cry and go onward into the tree at a great speed and in all the time that it run the humped man cease not to strike with the stone and sudden when it be go a distance off it do roll very swift over upon the back first to the right as that it would go that way so that the humped man do leap off upon the other side and immediately the creature roll to that side and there run clear of the brute only four of the humped man so that i know that three be slay and afterwards they that live run beyond the beast and gat up into a second tree and the one that be chase do entice the creature to follow and so do tease it once more to pass beneath the other man and they very swiftly again to the back of the creature and so from my sight striking with the great stone and the beast bellow very loud and piteous and how many of the humped man there be to the beginning of that strange hunting i know not but surely there be few that live to the end and surely there be such thing as this thing in the beginning of the world and again be it thus in the end and i do ponder this a little while as i do sit upon the great branch and hearken unto the sound of the hunting that be now go a great way off and be presently beyond my hearing and afterward i gat I to the earth and do look this way and that way to see that no beast be anigh neither any of the humped man and afterward i eat two of the tablet and drink some of the water and when i have gat this far to a readiness for my go i mind I that i should try the compass again as i do intend and surely the machine do point between the north and the south upon the westward arc even as naanus have tell unto I yet as it do seem with somewhat more of a southward point than she have make I to think and because of this tell of the compass a great ease come upon my spirit for surely be not this but a sure sign that i do go direct unto that hide place of the world where the lesser refuge do abide but yet be not come over-close so that the pull of the mighty earth-current of the great redoubt be something stronger than in the place where be the little pyramid and all this do i think very swift to myself and have a glad uplifting of the heart as you do perceive so that i go forward upon my journey with a great stride and do scarce fear any strange thing that all the country do hold in that moment and i go all that day at a strong pace and do be oft tempt to send the master-word unto naanus yet do keep from so foolish a act the which mayhap have bring straightway upon I a evil power and have give I to destruction when that i be near come to the succor of the maid and it be this quick and constant fear of the evil force of the night land that do keep I ever from call unto naanus lest that they should discover I and follow after and this i doubt not you to know by now so well as i now by the sixth hour i be come into a part of the country where there be a exceed abundance of steam fountain and spraying and great upboiling of water in basin of rock and the air do be full of the sound and the roaring of the boiling and the spouting and of a hot mist and spray so that truly i have scarce the power to see to my front nor to any side and here presently i make a pause and do eat and drink and afterward go forward again and i do keep the shore of the sea always to my right and so do go proper to my way yet with no great ease for the sea also do steam very strong in that part and because of this great fog of steam i be surely much labor to make a great speed lest unseeing i go headlong into a hole of the boiling water and in the ninth hour i do go clear of the hot boiling and be come again free of the mist and the steam and might look with mine eye to my go and surely as i do perceive i be come to the end of the great sea that have be ever to my right for it do go against the foot of great and monstrous mountain that go upward for ever into the night and do seem as that they be the hither wall of that strange country of fire and water and so be i stand there very much take upon doubt for how should i go farther and after that i have be there a while in a bewilderment of doubt and of wit i go to the leave along the foot of the mountain and truly this but of common sense for how might i go any other way save i go back again and at the twelfth hour i eat two of the tablet and drink some of the water and go forward once more and lo at the fifteenth hour i be come to a place between the mountain even a upward gorge very dark and gloomy and without light for a great way and in verity i do not want to go up the gorge in that it be so dreary a place and narrow and horrid and drear-seeming after the light and wideness of the country in which i do yet stand and presently i do go past the mouth of the gorge that i should learn whether there go another way out of that country and thiswise for a great hour more along the foot of the mountain and do presently come to a monstrous black river that be maybe a mile wide and it to be very shallow and seeming as that the water scarce to cover the mud of the bottom and here and there a great steam do come from it and spirting and moundings-up of the mud in many place and monstrous babbling and puffings-up of strange smoke as that a great heat go beneath it in this place and in that and surely it go backward into the country for a mighty way so far as my sight do go and i do think it to be no river but truly a further sea and there be no way across for there be no tree anigh to make I a raft neither might i wade across for it might be shallow here and deep there and the mud be in all place and moreover i have be like to be catch in one of those upbursting of mud even do i have a raft to go upon and because of all these thing i gat I back again to the gorge and presently i do go upward into the darkness now i go upward very steady save that i do stumble oft and do go through six great hour and truly it do seem that i go in a utter dark because that i have be awhile in so constant a light and by that i have be six hour in the gorge i be go right away from the country of the sea and do be as that i be back into some place that be like to the dreadness of the night land for there be in this place and in that place of the gorge red fire-hole even as in the night land yet not many until that i be come a great way up of the gorge and there do be life of horrid thing about the fire as soon i do wot so that i make to keep off from they yet as you shall perceive i must come oft pretty near because that the gorge be nowheres scarce a hundred good pace across and do oft come very narrow so that i do come oft anigh to the fire-hole whether that i do heed to or not and all that time and ever do the gorge go very sharp upward so that it be a very weary thing to make great trial of speed as you shall know but yet i go so fast as i could do for i be grow sudden very excited about the heart and to feel as that i do surely draw anigh to that strange and hide place of the world where be the lesser refuge and when i have go upward through six great hour as i do say i take caution for a place proper to slumber for i be surely very wearied and i see a place presently afar upward of the dark side of the gorge upon the right where a ledge of the rock do show in the glaring from one of the fire-hole that make a gloomy light in that place and i climb unto this ledge and do find it to be secure and awkward to come upon and presently after that i have eat and drunk i do compose myself unto sleep the which come very speedy upon I whilst yet i do believe i think only upon the sweetness of the maid and truly it have be something over three and twenty hour since last i do sleep so that i be greatly awearied and in six hour i wake and do eat and do climb downward again to the gorge and so unto mine upward journey now as you do perceive when that i be come properly a great way up the gorge and have come among the fire-hole there be no more a utter darkness for the dull red glare of the pit beat upward upon the black side of the rock-mountain that do make the side of the gorge so that oft i do see both side very plain in the lower part yet of the height of the gorge who might know aught for the black side do go upward for ever into the everlasting night and because of the light from the fire-pits i do see time and oft about the fire horrid monster both that be snake and other like to scorpion so great as my head but no more than these for a long while and afterward i perceive that surely other matter do move among the rock of the gorge so that i do keep the disko very ready in mine hand yet have truly no use for it all that day now i eat and drink at the sixth and the twelfth hour and go onward at a very strong speed and at the sixteenth hour i do seem as that i know the aether to be stir about I and the beat of the master-word very faint upon mine inward ear and immediately a wondrous great and lovely thrilling do wake all my be for surely i say this be the spirit of my love call unto I with she brain-element and indeed this be a very proper and sensible thinking for have the master-word be send from the mighty pyramid i have be like to hear it very plain by reason of the force of the earth-current which be with they and to they command but as you do know the earth-current be nigh go from the people of the lesser refuge so that they be over-weak to make any proper calling and this i have speak of before this place yet in a little while as i do stand very hushed that i should hark the better i be come to doubt whether that i do truly hear the master-word and one moment i do say that it have surely beat in the night about I and immediately would i be just so unsure and so in a while i gat once more to my journey and have doubt in my heart yet as you shall conceive more of hope and because of this thing i go onward for thirty great hour from the time that i do wake for my heart be excite within I and when that i have go so long forward as this i do see how that i do foolishly and i lookt about for a place for my slumber and i find a small cave that be clean and empty as i do discover by the shine of the disko which i make to spin a little time and the cave be in the cliff of the mountain that make the right side of the gorge and be nigh twenty good foot from the bottom of the gorge and hard to approach and when i be come secure into the cave and sure that it be proper to my purpose i eat four of the tablet as be just and nice to my belly and do afterward drink some of the water and so to my slumber and all the while very sweet and strong in my thought upon naanus so that surely i be a little time before that i have myself rightly unto sleep and i sleep six hour and do wake for i have set my spirit hard unto such waken yet be i still greatly yearning for sleep but this do go somewhat when that i have fight a little with my need and afterward i eat two of the tablet and drink some of the water and do gat my gear upon I and be presently down unto the gorge and so again to my journey now in all that day i do go with a very stern speed for it do seem as that my soul do know for surety that i be truly come something nigh unto that hide place in the night where i should find mine olden love again and the sweet hope that be breed of the call that have seem truly to sound about my spirit be in all my being and more sure on that day than before that i have sleep and i go thirty hour in all even as before ere that i do come again to sleep and i eat and drink at every sixth hour so that my strength should abide within I and by that i be come to the ending of the thirty hour i be sorely awearied and gat I upward of the monstrous cliff that do make the left side of the gorge have perceive in a place a great ledge of the rock that do seem very proper for my purpose of slumber and when i be come upward upon the ledge of the rock i see that there do seem something like to a mighty spider that do stay half without of a hole in the back part of the ledge and i smote the thing gently with the disko so that it be very quickly dead and afterward i search well about but do gladly perceive that there abode there no other horrid creature and i eat two of the tablet and drink some of the water and do afterward make I ready for slumber as ever but now i do put the cloak well about I for truly there be grow a chill into the air of the gorge and here also will i tell how that it do seem unto I that the air be go something from that great thickness and strength which have be with I in the past day of my journey now i be go so tired that i fall upon sleep in a moment yet with a dear think and anxious concern naanus but be so starve of the body for slumber that even mine anxiousness keep I not awake and i be then so fast with sleep that i know naught for eight hour of very sound slumber and then do i awake and very thankful of the heart that no evil beast or creep thing have come upon I whilst that i be so utter lose in sleep and now truly be i something fresh and ready and i eat and drink and have my gear once more upon I and so down into the gorge and afterward i go upon my journey for eighteen hour and do pause but a little while at the sixth and the twelfth hour that i should eat and drink and when the eighteenth hour be nigh come i perceive that the nature of the gorge be grow very horrid and dank and in verity i do feel as that afar upward in the night the black mountain that do make the side of the gorge have come together and do make a monstrous roof unseen in the utter height and this thing i do tell only as of my belief for i have no very sure proof yet truly my reason doth say likewise for there do oft drip water upon I out of the darkness even though i walk in the middle way of the gorge and how should this thing be save that there go a overreaching of the side that should let the mildew down upon I and in this place and for more than eleven great hour there be fire-hole and fire-pit only in this part and in that and each a great way off from another and they burn very dull and do seem to throw a fume of sulphur into all the air as that there be no freedom above for the stink to pass away and in every place be the rock of the gorge very thick and slippery with strange growth so that it be a sorrow to walk upon they and all that time be there a heavy wetness and slowness in the air and a smell beside the stink of the fire-pit as that i do go forward through a place where dead thing do be and for a great time there be a horrid darkness as it have be that the air be grow thick with the fuming of the fire-pit as i do believe and beside this thing there be as i have say but a dull fire here and another there so that it be like that there should be a heavy dark and because that it be so utter black and because that there be growth upon the rock in the bottom of the gorge i do go but slowly and with pain of stumbling and always with the stink of that place to trouble I half unto a sickness and sudden as i do go past one of the fire-pits i see that the fire make a dull shine upon some monstrous thing that do move before I upon the far side of the fire and i come in one moment unto a swift silence and hide among the rock of the bottom of the gorge and i lookt very cautious at the thing that move beyond the fire and surely i have see no thing so monstrous since that i have come free of the night land for it be as that some huge creature like to the hull of a great ship do move down out of the dark of the upper way of the gorge and it go by the fire-hole and onward into the dark of the lower way of the gorge and i have perceive somewhat of it as it do go past the fire and surely it be black and beslimed and utter great in height and in length and it go always without noise so that i have not know it to be there but that i see it plain with mine eye and truly if i do say that it be somewhat as that i have see a monstrous slug-thing surely i should use wise and proper word to make know to you this horrid brute and i stay very quiet a time and afterward i go upward again of the gorge and do use a new caution to my way and see that the disko be free upon my hip for even thus i do carry the weapon be that i must use both hand to my way and to save I in my stumbling and sliding over the slippery rock and once it do seem to I that some great thing move in the darkness and i go downward among the rock and stir not my body for a great while and sure be i that there go some living monster past I that do stink as a loathsome grave and afterward i go on again and three hour do i go thus and come at last to a place where a fire-hole do shine more ruddy and i do look well about I that i should perceive that part of the gorge the better and as i stand there very quiet away off from the fire so that it do show no great light upon my person i do note how utter still be that place and this to take I anew as though it have come fresh upon I and here there would be the drip of water and again in that place and again elsewhere and all very solemn and very dismal and the silence to be constant and presently as i lookt now to this way and again to that i see that there be a monstrous slug-thing lay upward against the black side of the gorge as that it have stand up on end and the one end of the monster go upward beyond the light from the fire-pit but the other part do come down and trail into the gorge as a long hillock very ugly and black and beslimed and i near sweat with a disgust and horror of the thing but afterward i have more courage and spy well upon the brute and surely it move not at all any more than the side of the cliff of the gorge and i conceive that it stand not upward upon any foot but cling to the rock even as you shall see a slug to go and for a great space i be very quiet and move not neither do i make to hide but stand there very stupid yet in a time i have more of courage which bring strength unto my heart and i begin again to go upon my way but with a utter caution and i then to creep for a weary time upon my hand and knee among the dank and weariful rock and boulder that lay in the bottom of the gorge and thrice between four hour be i pass by hidden and monstrous thing in the horrid dark place of the gorge yet with no noise save as it might be the odd rattle of a rock in this place and that but with a utter and dreadful stinking and i to be quiet as they go as you shall think and each time now that i do go by the fire-pit and fire-hole that lay odd-way in the gorge i do pause and search about I with mine eye very cautious and oft now do i perceive how that the monstrous slug creature do lie in this place and in that against the cliff of the gorge and i do go then utter still from this space to that space among the rock and oft upon the flat of my belly and with a constant heed that i make not mine armor to knock against the boulder and always as i do go there be a monstrous stench and the choke of sulphurous smoke very oft and here and there as mine heart doth believe there be utter great cavern within the mountain to the right and to the left and of this thing i have some small proof for once i do go by a place where a fire do burn as it should be a fire-hole afar inward of the mountain side upon my right so that i saw in a moment that i look in the darkness through the mouth of a mighty cave-place and i go past very quick and silent for i know not whether any horrid thing should come forth out of that place to slay I and truly as i do think if there do be one such place there be like to be many and mayhap the slug come forth from those cavern where as i do conceive there be naught save a eternal drip of water and the foul growth of thing in all part yet be this last but a think as i do say and you shall wisely take it for no more than that now i come clear of the darkness and the slime and the stink in about twelve hour after the time that i do think the mountain to be a roof unto the gorge and the air be now free and do seem as that some life and health do abound in it and the fire do be more plentiful and burned very bright and clean and throw all they fuming upward so that there be no more any bitter pain of sulphur within my throat and surely it be with a thankful heart that i go onward and with a good speed for there be much of light all about I in that there burn a hundred fire-pit here and in that place so that i see clear before I and behind and conceive that the slug do abide only in the closed part of the gorge and oft i do take the air very full into my lung for the sweetness of it after the horrid stenching that i have abode all those hour and presently when i be come free of the roof part of the gorge maybe some three good hour i lookt for a place proper to slumber for it be surely something over three and thirty hour since that i do last come upon sleep and i be utter worn and lose of strength with so much of creep and hark for monster as you shall believe moreover about that time i have go bitter long while between slumbering through more than a hundred hour as you shall have perceive from my telling now presently i see a small cave that go inward of the side of the gorge and i lookt into the cave and find it to be sweet and clean and very dry and there be a small fire-pit off from the mouth of the cave that do throw a good light for my purpose so that i see there be no creep thing or horror in the place and i go in and make to prepare for my slumber but truly when i be come to look upon myself i be utter soil and do seem as that i stank with the slime and disgust of the dark part of the gorge where i have go upon my hand and upon my belly and because of this i be set that i should not eat or come to sleep without i wash I and i go out from the cave and there be a spring near to the fire-pit as be oft in that part of the gorge and the spring be hot and do fill a hollow of the rock very quiet and with a fume of sulphur as i do bend above it and i wash mine hand and face and mine armor and gear in the hot spring and do dry I with my pocket-cloth and so be sweeten and put to happiness of mind and i go back into the cave and do sit in the mouth of the cave with the disko to mine hand and i eat four of the tablet for i be go a mortal long while without and afterward i drink some of the water and as i do eat and drink i lookt out upon the lightness of the gorge before I and with a cheerful and compose heart and i see presently that there come certain creature out from they hole even as it might be that they be part rat but very strange look and not properly such and some do lie about the fire-hole and some do hunt about in the rock and one come presently and have a snake by the neck and it stand upon the snake and do eat it even while that the snake do lash about upon the rock and the snake do lash until that it be nigh all eat and a very strange thing this be to see and something troublesome to the pity yet be i glad to perceive that there be enemy to the serpent of that place and when the rat creature do make a end of the snake it make across to the spring and do drink the hot water a while and afterward back unto the fire and there lay down anigh to the edge and seem very sweetly comfort of the belly which in truth be much otherwise with I and after that i see many creature that go about the fire and do have warmth from the fire and drink from the spring and surely i do ponder that the people of this we age should say if they have stand with I that providence have make nigh together the warmth and the drink that be needful unto life -lrb- for it be grow to a bitter chill now in the gorge -rrb- but rather do this thing seem to I otherwise that these creature do be but of they circumstance and if that it have be another way then have they grow of they wit to meet it to they means of life yet as some would say the argument do but meet and be the same thing and neither way do i care in this place but do no more than to show unto you the working of my brain in this way and that as i make my journey now presently when i be do eating and come very ready to fall upon sleep i go out from the cave and gat I certain boulder the which i do carry into the cave and when i be come back for the last time i put they very secure in the entrance-way that no small stinging creature come at I as i sleep and after that i make ready and go to my sleep have sweet thought and slumbrous of the maid now i sleep very quiet that time and be not over trouble with the chill of the gorge which be but little in that place both by reason of the fire-pit and because that the cave do help to keep my warmth to I and i have a deep slumber for eight hour and wake then pretty tired but strong to go upon my way and after that i have sit a little while i come full to wakefulness and afterward do eat two of the tablet and drink some of the water the which i do sit in the mouth-part of the cave after that i have cast free the boulder and afterward i gat my gear upon I and i go again upon my journey and the gorge do continue very light and cheerful with the shine of the fire and oft there do be a little steam that do hiss from this part or that of the bottom of the gorge and do blow very quaint and noisy in the quiet of that place and oft there do be hot pool and everywhere the great boulder in the bottom way and to the right and to the leave the black and mighty side of the gorge that do go upward for ever into the everlasting night and so i do go and have eat and drunk at the sixth hour and go onward again and lo at the eighth hour i do thrill sudden with a wondrous great thrilling for in verity it do seem to I that the master-word do beat softly about I out of all the night of the world and all my heart do throb with great glowing of joy yet be the beat of the word unsure so that i know not truly whether my spirit have indeed hear aught for there be immediately a silence as ever about mine inward be yet as you shall believe there be a new hope and strength of courage in all my body and soul and i go forward very swift and all renew as it be and my strength and hope do make naught of any terror that should lie to bar my way neither do i have further heed of the boulder that lay always upon my path but do go over they with quick leaping and a wondrous and thrilling eagerness of the heart within I and sudden in the end of the tenth hour i perceive that the mighty wall of blackness that make the side of the gorge do be no more there and that i be come truly upon the end of the gorge and i near tremble with hope and astonishment for when i be go a little way on i have cease to go upward any more and be come clear out from the mouth of the gorge and do peer forth across a mighty country of night and it do seem to I as that i be come to a second land of strange matter even as the night land where do lie the wonder of the mighty pyramid and surely i do think within my heart that i be come at last to that far and hide place of the world where do be the lesser redoubt but yet be there no place in all that night where do tower the shine light of the lesser pyramid the which i do hope vainly to perceive and because that i see they not a great heaviness come upon my spirit for a time but afterward the heaviness do go for i put reason to help my courage and do plan this cause and that to show why that i be not come to sight of the shine embrasure of the lesser redoubt but yet be there leave a ache of doubt as you shall well conceive now this land be very new and strange and have a great light in this part and a wondrous grim darkness in that and i do pause a great while to determine how that i should go properly and presently i bethought I of the compass and do draw it forth and set it upon the earth that i should see how it do act and truly it do go almost as naanus have tell to I so that i be very sure in all my be that i be in verity come anigh to the hidden refuge but yet do the compass give I no proper guide to my way so that i be no more wise to this end than before only that i have the comfort of that which it do seem to assure and in a little while i go forward into the land and do hope that i should come presently to some matter to help my choice and i go first toward a certain great glowing of fire that lay before I and do seem join to another great glare that go afar to my left and i find the ground of that land to be very fair for my foot and to have in this place and that certain bush even as it do seem to I of the kind that we name moss-bush in the night land as you do know and i make a very good speed and go thus until i have go for maybe six long hour and by that time i be come anigh to the glowing of light and do keep now a strong caution to my go for truly as i do know from the telling of the maid there be very horrid and dreadful power in that land and i do well to remember that i be come again to part where might be the destruction of the spirit now i make a pause and lookt toward the glowing light and it seem to I that for a monstrous way unto the right and unto the leave there do be surely a great hide valley in the earth before I for the shine do seem as that it come up from out of a valley as that there burn a deep light in such a place but yet be i all unsure and have no proper know whether indeed there do be any valley there but only a strange and luminous shine that do come upward from the earth and i make no great haste now to go unto that place but go down sudden into the bush and lay upon my belly and have a new great fear upon my spirit and presently i part the bush a little and make a place for spy and i look a great time unto the place of the light and now to this part and now to that and sudden i see as it do seem a monstrous head within the glowing for the glowing do seem at while as that it sweep to and fore as should a shine smoke that go obedient to a quiet wind : and so to hide and again to uncover and in a moment i lose the great face and be all unsure that ever i have see aught and lo in a little minute i do see it again but whether it do be the shape of some utter monster of eternity -- even as the watcher about the mighty pyramid -- or whether it do be no more than a carven mountain of rock shaped unto the dire picture of a monster i do have no know but i make that i should get hence very quick and i do turn I about in the bush and go upon my hand and knee and so come at last a great way off now presently i come again upon my foot and do take a new look around that land and i have the mouth of the gorge to my back and this i perceive by the shine of the fire-pit that make the place show to I and to the left of the gorge be a utter blackness as i do conceive of black and monstrous mountain through which the gorge do come and to the right side of the gorge there be many low volcano that go always along the foot of the great mountain that make the right wall of the gorge and i see the foot of these dark mountain because that the light from the little volcano make a glare upon the lower slope and so shall you have some know of that part of this second land of night and a good way off be the shine that i have journey unto and the shine go into a distant light through a part of the land that lay afar to my leave for it stretch a great and strange way toward I out of the leftward gloom and come unto my front and so away into a utter distance yet though it be so great you shall not think that it make any huge light in the land but be rather as that it have a shine make unto other end for it make not a great lightness in the land and you do now perceive something roughly how the land do seem to my back part and unto my left and somewhat before my face and because that i do think to have no profit to my search if that i go to the left i make attention unto the right and here there be much of darkness yet oft the shine of fire-hole in this place and that amid the darkness and as i do look it grow very plain upon I how great be the spread and drear wideness of that country of night and how that i do be a utter lonesome person in all that dark and so shall you be with I in sympathy of the utter greatness of my task and know of the fear that do breed odd while that i should search until i die and never find and you to give I good human understanding now i make no more to delay but go unto the right and do keep the chain of the little volcano something level to my course though a great way off and i go thus with a strange growing of hope and a excitement for ten hour and have eat not then for more than twenty hour and surely not since the sixth hour of that day and this because that i be so utter shake from my calmness of go and at the tenth hour i go utter weak and do seem surely as that i must swoon and lo i bethought I how that i be go so long without aught for my belly and surely when i be quiet a time i eat four of the tablet and in a good while do feel all renew and would rest no more after that i have drunk some of the water but go onward for in verity my spirit do be as that it have slay I if that i have lie down at that time and this because hope be so fierce in I for i to feel indeed that i be come near to the maid and i go ten hour more until that i do truly totter upon my foot with utter and dreadful weariness for i have go now through someway of forty great hour and have be foolish in mine eating and drinking as you have perceive but yet be this to be forgive for i be as that i should come any little minute upon the wonder of the lesser pyramid shine afar in the night yet truly there be nowhere anything that might be liken unto it and i lay down there just as i do be and with no proper heed to my safety and i be go asleep in one moment as it do seem and wake not for twelve hour and then do come suddenly unto knowledge and thankful be i in the heart that no monster have come upon I in that dead-time of slumbering and i eat four of the tablet as be surely due unto I and drink some of the water and so gat forward again into the night and truly i be mortal stiff and do ache for a great while and this do be in part because that i have wrap not the cloak about I ere i sleep for the land be bitter cold and do make the blood very chill now when i have go onward through six hour i eat and drink for i do mind now to be wise and keep my strength good within I and i go onward again at a very great speed and full of a excitement and surely i do be glad at last that the tablet be so easy go in the mouth and unfilling to the belly for i have be without power and patience to eat proper victual and at the tenth hour i see that there rise a red-shining out of the land before I as that it come upward from a mighty pit and i make slow my way and so when i be go on for two great hour more i see that monstrous figure go about against the red glare of the shine and i gat I down into the bush which be very plentiful in that part and i stay there for a certain while and make a watch upon the red-shining and the figure and truly it do seem to I that there be horrid giant in that land even as in the night land and afterward i creep away and go outward from the little volcano into that part of the land that be dark save as you do mind for the glare of fire-hole in this part and that and i go now with a utter care for the giant have put a new caution into my heart and i do surely mean that i should live to rescue mine own maid and have joy through all my life and thereafter i go with the disko in my hand and at each hour that be the sixth i eat two of the tablet and drink some of the water and so do keep my strength very good within I now presently i be come to a place where the land do go downward a great slope and there be a difference in the earth that go beneath my foot and no great plenty of the bush but only one in this place and one in that and nowhere any fire-hole and i gat I down and do feel the earth with my hand and lo i do find presently smooth stone and afterward olden shell and immediately a great delight take I for naanus have tell how that the lesser pyramid stand something nigh to the shore of a ancient sea that be long dry up in the year of eternity and surely it might be that i be come down into the dry bottom of that same olden sea and should presently have sight of the little pyramid and because that hope be put so fresh into I i go forward through maybe thirty hour across the olden sea-bed but in all that time i have no sight of the light of the lesser redoubt and a great trouble begin to take I for indeed naanus have not tell I how great be the sea and it might be that i should wander a weariful age across it before that i come to the far side and it do come to I presently how that i should be wise to see that my way be very straight so that i waste not my strength in useless wanderings and i have a great care now to observe that the red-shining do be always upon my right to my rear and by this reasonable cunning do i make to steer very nicely through the great gloom of that place now as i do go across the bed of the great sea i hear strange sound now in this part of the darkness and now in that and oft do there be a noise as if thing do run this way and that way in the bed of the sea and once afar off in the night there do be a strange and horrid scream so that i do know truly that the monster of that land be out and do go about in the dark and as you shall perceive and understand i be all unknowing of the lore of that land so that i know not what to think of this strange sound or that neither know i what they might portend but only that as i do say there be monster abroad and i could do no more than have my way forward with a utter care always and be very ready with the disko or to hide each as maybe accord to the need and surely i go one-and-forty hour that day and eat and drink after every sixth hour and before this in the seven-and-thirtieth hour i hear a great roaring and bellow in the night come nigh unto I and afterward the thudding of monstrous foot as that a giant run past I in the darkness and do make a chase of some creature and the thudding of the foot and the roaring go far off into the night and there do seem presently to come back to I from a great way a little scream but of this thing i have no surety and i abode very hushed in a clump of bush until quietness be come again all about for there have be a utter frightening sound in the horrid voice and in the thudding of the great foot now in the one-and-fortieth hour of that day i come upon the farther shore of the olden sea but lo there be nowhere any light to tell I aught of the lesser refuge and truly a great doubt and bewilderment take I for indeed i could not perceive how it might be that i see not the light of the embrasure of the lesser pyramid and a great despair take I so that i sit down there upon the shore of the olden sea and have no heed of anything for a while but afterward i eat and drunk and go into a clump of bush and wrapt the cloak about I and so go fast unto sleep with the disko handy to my breast and in verity the pain of the despair and the bewilderment of mine heart do make rather for sleep than to keep I wakeful for indeed i be half stunned of the brain and of my courage and do seem now the farther off from the ending of my search than ever i have be and i sleep six hour and wake then sudden and i lean up upon mine elbow in the bush and hark very quiet perchance some noise have shake my sleep from I but indeed there be nothing only that i be wakeful and do mind I of my trouble of failure yet now i do invent this thing and that thing to make natural account that i be not come to the lesser redoubt and so have hope again within I yet much also of doubt and bewilderment and i eat two of the tablet and drink some of the water and again to my journey and i make that i should keep along the shore of the sea the which i do through twelve hour and be then still so much in doubt as ever and i cease from my journeying and lookt about I over the land and lo i do note how that a weak and strange shine be in the air of the land at a great way as it have be that a far spread and faint glowing make a little glare into all the night unto my left and before I now i eat and drink and make to steady my spirit for i do fear lest i should feel utter lose in all the night of the world and to know not where to make any more my search and so to grow desperate in despair and this thing you will understand and afterward i do make across that land unto the place where it do seem that the dull shine be something bright and i go thus through eighteen hour and do make pause at each sixth hour and eat and drink very resolute though in verity it do seem as that even so small a matter as the tablet do be like to choke I and by this be it plain to I how great a anguish be come upon my spirit lest that i be all astray and should have no joy to succor mine own and thrice in the time that i do go there do be a running of foot amid the darkness and odd while strange and horrid crying in the night so that i put a force upon my despair and hide I for indeed i have no right to lose care of my life if there do be any chance yet that i find the maid and lo in the eighteenth hour which be truly the thirtieth of that day i find the shine in the night to be grow very plain and a utter stinking of sulphur and truly i do be aware that the land go upward and i make upward through seven hour and the light do grow more plain and be of a dull redness very sombre and heavy and in the end of six more hour i cease to go upward and do know of a strange low sound that do be like to no other sound that ever i do hear and be like to a dull roar that do never have cease through eternity and i go forward unto the light and the land to be now as that i go over a upland plain and i do go thus through five hour and the low roar do grow ever upon mine ear and truly even as i do shape my thought to take a caution for my body i go upward again a little and come out upon the edge of a mighty cliff and the low and constant roar do moan upward against I with a everlasting muttering and i lookt downward a monstrous way and surely there be spread out a mighty sea as it do seem of dull fire as that a red-hot mud do lap very deep and quiet below I in all that night and i lookt outward across the strange sea and the far side be hide from I for surely there be dull and solemn cloud that come off the sea and hide the distance from I and the cloud to glow a little redly and so to rise and presently to blacken into the night and i lookt to the right and to the left and it be plain that the black cliff do stretch out both way and do go downward ever into that monstrous sea of slow fire and there be great headland that go out into the fire as into a sea and the fire do lap very quiet about these and where the fire lapt about they there do shine and spirt out green flame and vapor at diverse time and indeed as i do perceive i be come to a upward sea of fire as it be the deep inward of a low and utter monstrous volcano that be flat of the top and utter big across and in verity i do look downward into the fire of the inward earth and a very wondrous sight be it to stand there alone upon the cliff of that everlasting sea and a great heat come upward from the dull and grim fire of that gloomy sea and a reek of sulphur so that i be like to be choke and do go backward from the edge of the cliff and surely i be come to the end of that dark land upon that side and have nowhere perceive the lesser pyramid in all the night of my travel and a new despair come upon I for indeed it seem i be come all astray in the night of the world and do nowise have any know whether i stand near to the country of the lesser redoubt or whether that i be go half across the world unto a strange place and then as the despair trouble my spirit and dull the beating of my heart a sudden thought do light up a fresh hope within I for indeed as you do know i be come upward of a great height and do surely have a huge view over all that land and mayhap the lesser pyramid do lie somewhere in a valley if in verity it do be anywhere at all in that country and i turn I from the cliff and lookt backward over all the night of the land but there be nowhere in all that country the shine of the light of the lesser pyramid and lo of a sudden i do know that there be something in the night and i stare with a very keen and anxious look and behold there be the black shape of a great pyramid afar off in the night that do show against the shine of the distant light for it do stand between I and the far-off fire but until i be come to that place whence i do look i have not stand to have it plain against the shine upon the other side of that land and how i do feel in that moment i have no word to set out unto you but surely be my heart gracious with thankfulness and i ready to leap with joy and hope and all my body thrill with a excitement that would not have I to be silent so that suddenly i begin to shout foolishly across the night but i come soon to wisdom and silence as you shall think x the maid of the olden day now as you shall perceive all mine utter despair be turn in a moment into a huge gladness and a great hope so that it do seem to I that i should be with my dear one in but a little while yet be this a over-hope and expectation and be not like to have a swift satisfy for truly i be make aware of naught save that i do perceive the shape of a great pyramid go upward into the night and i know that the pyramid do surely stand upon a hill in the midst of that dark country for only so might it show so great and high and i set I to run swift downward into the land so that i should make a strong go unto the pyramid and i run for a few little minute and lo i fall headlong and do truly feel as that i have brake my neck with the hardness and pain of my fall and i have no power to go forward any more for a great while but do just be there where i do fall and very helpless and moan a little so that any creature have be able to slay I if that it have come upon I in that time yet presently i be able to sit upon the earth and do hold my neck with my hand and afterward the pain go away so that i gat once more to my foot but now i go forward very wisely and have moreover a anxiousness in my heart for indeed how do it be that the pyramid be so utter dark if that it do be the lesser refuge in truth and immediately there do rise in I a fear that it should be some house of evil in the dark of that land or some wicked force work a pretence and a bewilderment upon my sight yet truly the thing be plain now against the far-off fire of the land and i do have little thought but that it should be in verity the lesser refuge now in the first moment that i do perceive the dark pyramid i have be without wit save to run very quick and blind unto the place for you to remember how long i have make so great a search and afterward i have be mind to call unto naanus with my brain-element send the master-word and my speech after to tell how that i be come unto she but now i do heed to have caution and to discover what this darkness should truly mean and so do i go downward again into the night of that land at the first with a carefulness but presently with a fierce eagerness and expect of the heart the which have be dull a little time with the horrid shake and pain of my fall now i have climb unto the upper plain of the great volcano in maybe thirteen hour but i go downward of that great hill in ten and have make a greater speed but that i be sore shake and unsure by reason of my fall and in the end of the tenth hour i perceive that i be come again to the great plain of the land and i have no more any proper sight of the refuge because that it be upward afar in the darkness of the night yet be i abled now to see that there go a bulk between I and the far shining and do know that this great thing be surely the hill on which the pyramid do stand and i go four hour across the land and do pass in this place and that fire-hole that make a little red-shining in the night and because of the fire in those far part and a-near there be not a utter dark and when i be go four hour towards the pyramid i could no more see the distant shining for the bulk of the hill-bottom stand up between and make all a blackness that way and by this thing i do guess that i be come nigh unto the hill but yet be a great hour more before that i come to it and in that five hour since i be come down from the great volcano there have past I thrice and again the sound of thing run in the night and once there do be a sound as of a giant roaring afar and a strange and horrid scream now i begin to go up the hill and at the first a utter excitement take I in the heart so that i could have shout the name of the maid aloud in the night with vain hoping that she should hear I and make a answer but this state go from I very swift as i do go upward and there come a caution again about I and a coldness of fear as that my spirit do wot of something that my heart do not perceive and presently i be come upward almost to the top of the hill the which take I nigh three hour and surely when i be come that i could see the grimness of the pyramid go upward very desolate and silent into the night lo a utter shake fear do take I for the sweet cunning of my spirit do know that there abode no human in all that great and dark bulk but that there do await I there monstrous and horrid thing that should bring destruction upon my soul and i go downward of the hill very quiet in the darkness and so in the end away from that place and i be four great hour before that i be come clear away from the hill and i do feel that there be not any safety for my spirit in all that land and surely i go a little blindly in the first and do go with no heed unto my way and presently i be upon the shore of the olden sea and have no know how that i be come there for surely i do think it to be a great way off but now i do think that the dry bed of the sea do curve around unto that place or that there do be two or more olden sea in that country of night now presently i sit I down very weak and bewildered for it be as that my heart do lie dead within I and in verity you shall perceive how this thing be for i do know by the telling of my spirit that there abode evil thing in the dark pyramid upon the hill and i doubt not but that destruction have come upon the people of the lesser pyramid and that evil creature and power do now abide in that place and if this thing do be truly so i be come over-late to the saving of the maid and with this thought i be very glad that some evil thing should come that i should fight with it and die quickly for there be naught then in all the world to make I glad to have life and so shall you know the utter desolation that be in my heart and truly i can perceive both the wiseness and the unwisdom of my reasoning for indeed i do have no _ sure _ know that the dark pyramid do be truly the lesser refuge but yet in verity my spirit do know with a certain sureness and there be no doubt concern this thing in all my being and after that i have sit there awhile i do mind I suddenly that i should send the master-word through the night for indeed how else might i ever know whether naanus do yet live though in truth i have little save desperate hope in this matter but yet do remember how that i have seem odd time of my journey to hear the beat of the master-word with my spirit out of all the dark of the world and in verity if naanus answer not to the word but there come instead a evil power to destroy I i should but cease I of mine utter heart-ache and i stand I upon my foot and look outward about I into the blackness of that land and i send the master-word with my brain-element and immediately i call naani thrice send the call with my brain-element and lo in a moment as it do seem there break around I out of all the mystery of night low and solemn the master-word beating in the night and immediately there do sound within my brain a far small voice very lone and faint as that it have come from the end of the world and the voice be the voice of naanus and the voice of mirdath and do call I by mine olden love-name then indeed i do near to choke with the utter affright of joy that do take I in the heart and also i be shake with a mighty excitement and my despair be go as that i have never know it for in verity naanus do live and do call unto I with she brain-element and surely i have not hear the voice of mine own for a utter age of grim labor and dread and the voice be as i do say as that it come from one that do be in a far place of the earth and in verity whilst i stand daze with a great joy that the maid do live i know within I concern the fear that she be utter far off and what peril might come anigh to she before that i should stand to she side to do battle for she life and well-being and mine own joy and lo in the same moment and before that i make further speech unto naanus i do wot that someone do be a little way off from I in the bush where a fire-hole do burn anigh to I and it be as that my spirit know this thing and tell of it unto my brain and i make no answer unto the maid across all the dark of the world but go very swift into a great bush that be nigh to the fire-hole upon this side and i lookt through into the open space that do be about the fire-hole and there be a little figure that do kneel sob upon the earth beside the fire-hole and truly it be a slim maid and she do seem as that she hark very desperate even whilst yet she do sob and surely mine own soul do _ know _ all in one white moment of life and she there unknow and hark unto a cry of the spirit that she do think to come through all the desolation of the night -- even from the mighty pyramid for oft as i do perceive have she cry unto I in all that lonesome month and know no answer neither that i be make a desperate way unto she for indeed she weakness be great so that she have no power to throw the word strongly afar neither to make plain she spiritual crying through any mighty space of the aether and lo i draw in my breath and set my tooth a moment to steady my lip and i say : mirdath out of the bush where i do be and use natural human speech and the maid cease from she weep and lookt this way and that with a utter new fear and with a frightened hope that do shine with she tear in the light from the fire-hole and i divide the bush before I and go through the bush so that i come out before she and do be there in my gray armor and i do pause then and be all adrift in myself for my heart say that i should take this maid into mine arm again for that i be come again to be with mirdath after a utter lose eternity but yet be i all pause for truly she be naani and she be mirdath and she do be a stranger in mine eye and very dainty and pretty and shake with woe and sore trouble and grief and in that same moment of my come unto she out of the bush she scream and fall back from I and strive weakly to gain unto the hither bush for truly she know not what be come upon she in that first little moment and immediately she see that it do be a human man and no monster to slay she and in that instant i say the master-word unto she aloud that she should have knowledge of peace and help and i tell my name and say i be that one and she know this thing even as my lip make the sound and she cry out something in a utter break voice and run unto I and thrust she two small hand into my charge and keep and fall thence into a great sobbing and shake so that i be all in trouble to ease she but do keep a silence and hold fast she hand for i have not on mine armored glove and she lean against I very weak and seeming wondrous like to a child and lo in a while she cease to sob and do but catch she breath this time and that but say no word and i bethought I that she do suffer of hunger for i perceive that she have be long wander and alone and be come unto the end of hope when that i do come and the maid stand there yet silent for she might not yet command she mouth to speak and she tremble as she stand and i open my left hand and lookt at the hand within my palm and surely it be utter thin and waste and i make no more pause but lift mine own and set she easy upon the earth with a hump of smooth rock unto she back and i stript off my cloak very quick and put it about she for she be scarce cover with she clothes that have be all tear among the bush so that part she shake with a utter chill and part because of weakness for she be nigh to be starve unto she death and destroy with she grief and lonesomeness and i take from my back the scrip and the pouch and i gat a tablet from the scrip and brake it into my cup and with the water i make a little broth very swift upon a hot rock that be to the edge of the fire-hole and i feed the broth unto the maid for truly she hand do shake so that she have spill it all if that i have do otherwise and she drink the broth and be so weak that presently she do fall again to sob yet very quiet so that i strove not to be trouble in the heart for indeed this thing be but reasonable and not cause for I to have a anxiousness but i put my hand under the cloak and take she hand into mine and hold they strong and firm and this do seem to bring something of peace and strength unto she so that presently the tremble and the weep go from she and indeed the broth be surely helpful in this matter and presently i know that she hand do stir a little within mine and i loose somewhat of my grip and immediately she graspt my hand with a weak and gentle grasp but lookt not yet at I only do stay very quiet as that she do gather she strength within she and indeed i be content save that a anxiousness of the heart do stir I this time and that lest some monster should come upon we and because of this trouble i do hark about I now and oft and with a new and strange fearfulness of danger because that now mine own be give unto my charge and surely my heart would break if that there come any hurt unto she now of a sudden the maid do make as that she would rise and i loose free from she to give help and she gat I by the hand and slipt sudden to she knee and do kiss my hand and do begin again to weep and surely i be so utter abashed that i stand very stupid and let she do this thing but in a moment i draw free from she for this thing might not be and i gat I to my knee likewise before she and take she hand and kist they once newly humble as it be and thus should she know all that be in my heart and of mine understanding and she do but sob the more for she be so weak and utter move unto I because that i have come to she through the night of the world and this thing i know though no speech have yet past between we and i give up she hand lest she need they for she tear but she leave they to lie in my palm as she do kneel there and she bow she head a little over she weep but do show that she be mine in verity unto the very essence of she dear spirit and i take she into mine arm very gently and without caress but presently i stroke she hair and call she naanus and mirdath and say many thing unto she that now i scarce do wot of but she do know they in the after time and she be very quiet in mine arm and seem wondrous content but yet do sob onward for a great time and oft do i coax she and say vague thing of comfort as i have tell but truly she do ask no more comfort at that time than that she be sheltered where she do be and truly she have be lonesome and in terror and in grief and dread a great and horrid time now presently she be grow quiet and i make to put she comfortable in the cloak against the rock that i should have freedom to make she more of the broth but yet she do nestle unto I with a little sweet wistfulness that make warm my heart in a most wondrous fashion for surely she be mine own and she to begin to say odd word to I and so to have gentle obedience and to rest quiet against the rock the while that i do make the broth yet ever she gaze do follow I as i know for i must look oft she way and i take the broth to she and she drink it use she own two hand and i sit by and eat three of the tablet and drink some of the water for truly it be a foolish great time since last i have eat now in a while the broth do make bright the eye of the maid and she do begin to talk and at while have pause because that she lack of strength and there be more to be tell than a human may have the heart-strength and cunning to make plain and twice she do come again to sob for truly she father be dead and the people of the lesser redoubt all slay and disperse through the night of that land and i learn that a evil force have make action upon the people within the lesser redoubt so that some be utter weak by reason of the fail of the earth-current have open the great door and go forth into the night and immediately there have come into the lesser pyramid great and horrid monster and have make a great and brutish chase and have slay many but some have escape forth into the night and with these have come naanus after that she father the master monstruwacan have be slay by a shaggy man very brutal and monstrous and there have be three maid with naanus when that she make escape into the night but there have come certain creature upon they as they do sleep among the bush and have steal two and the other maid have run off as do naanus and they have neither meet the other any more and this dreadful happen unto the people of the lesser redoubt have be a great while go as it to seem to she but she have no means to tell I how long this time should be for in verity how should she make a count yet have it be a dread long while unto she and i find presently that she have be lose through all that time that i do make my journey unto she for indeed this thing i discover by ask concern my calling unto she and she have hear none that do come to she in any time since she have escape out of the lose refuge into this dreadful land yet in verity oft have she callen unto I until that she heart do grow sick with the desolation of she lonesomeness and she utter forsakeness and she calling have tell unto the evil thing of the land that she do be in this part and that for there have come thing and beast in search for she but have the gift of the hearing she have know of they approach most while and have come free from they yet oft-time with piteous and fearful running and hiding among the rock and the bush so that she have grow afterward to make no call unto I save odd while lest she bring the monster upon she and indeed as you do know naught have come plain unto I for she be so utter weak that she have no power of she brain-element to send the word afar or the telling of she spirit and because that she be so sorely chase she have come nigh to be naked even as i find she for the bush and the rock have tear she garment from she and she have naught with which to make any proper mending of they and for food she have eat the moss upon the rock and odd strange berry and growth and have drunk of the water of the hot spring and oft have she be make utter sick because of the sulphur or somewhat of the water and maybe the poison of odd plant yet as i do think it be like that the first do save she life from the second but in this thing i do make only a guess and in all that dreadful time since that she have come to be quite alone she have hear a score drear thing for there have be once the slaying of a young maid nigh unto she by some brute out in the darkness of the land and thrice and more have she hear the foot of people run this way and that and the tread of giant pursue and by this tell i do understand those thing which mine ear have tell to I as i do go across that land and surely a new pity and sorrow and horror do come upward within I and the maid tell I how that she come once upon certain of the people of the lesser redoubt as they do hide among the bush but they run with no heed to she calling that she do be human even as they and by this be it plain the sore and dreadful panic that be upon the heart of such and the bitter chill of the land have make she to strive alway to be nigh unto the fire-hole that be very plentiful but even as this do be needful unto she so be it a thing that draw the monstrous brute of that land even as i have find in the night land and in the upward gorge and because of this she be oft make to stay afar off in the utter cold of the night yet in truth odd while she do be so desperate that she would make the venture and so mayhap have a time of warmth and because of this she have be nigh slay in she sleep twice and thrice moreover there be snake about the fire though not over-plentiful in all part and there do be spider-crab and monstrous scorpion and indeed even as she have lie by the fire-hole very weak and seeming near unto she death even this time when my call have come unto she to stir she unto life and bitter knowledge of despair even then be she all surround by creature that be like to crab that do squat all about she and do but wait for she to die so that she have be fear to sleep lest they destroy she in she slumber and by this thing she have know that she death be surely nigh and lo out of all the night of the world have come the beat of the master-word strong and powerful beating as a low and spiritual thunder out of all the dark of the night yet have she think of I only as speak from the far-off mighty pyramid so that the cry have bring naught of hope unto she but only a newer and more known despair and behold in a little minute there have come she name speak surely with the tongue and a name that be different from the name that my spirit have say after the beat of the word and immediately i have come out of the bush and she have fall back in a sudden great fear that a monster be steal upon she and then do see a young man in gray armor and do know in one instant that i be that olden one of she memory dream and the one that have speak unto she in the spirit across half of the dead world as it do seem and now be i come through all that unknown desolation and affright to succor she and she be immediately safe but yet all break because of she weakness and she utter joy and she sweet honor for I and this be the chief of that which she do tell unto I and the way that she have see and do regard the marvel of this we come together but surely no man be make ever to be worthy of the way that she do look upon I or of the word that she do say unto I in she weakness and happiness now with the maid have speech concern the spider-crab i lookt presently well around and surely in a minute i see that they be not go away but do be a circle of silent and steadfast watching and impudence and horror all about we and surely this thing put a anger and disgust upon I so that i gat to my foot and go unto the border of the light and i spurn this little monster and that and do truly kick maybe a dozen before that they be content to be go and by this thing shall you know of they calm and foolish assurance but yet be they seemingly without courage for they make not to attack I yet a true crab of this day be wishful to pinch I have i put my toe forth unto it now i go back to the maid and she do laugh with a little weak gleefulness so that i perceive that she be like to be a very joyous maiden if but i do have she in health and i make she another cup of the broth and she drink it very easy and afterward i make a very stern and playful order that she must sleep and indeed she to need it sore for she be go again from she excitement and she weakness upon she yet very happy and content and without fear and i make a smooth place for she and put the pouch and the scrip to be for a pillow and i do lay she there very quiet and sweet in the cloak and cover she foot but indeed i see first that they do be sore cut and without any gear to they so that i perceive that mine own have wear out she foot-gear utter in she lonesome journeying and in run from brute that do come to find she and so i to know more in the heart somewhat of the true dreadfulness and fear that have companion mine own and i be mind then that i would wash and bind up she foot but yet be she so utter worn that i do prefer that she sleep so soon as she might and afterward when she be come wakeful again then should i take a proper heed of she foot and truly they be very small and shapely and presently she sleep and surely i doubt whether she have slumber so peaceful and proper for a great month for she never to have know when any evil thing should come upon she in she sleep and this to be a very dreadful feeling as you do know well for you do know how i have be in this same matter now while naanus do sleep i stript off mine armor and take off mine under-suit which be name the armour-suit and a very warm and proper garment and make thick that it should ease the chafe of the armor and afterward i put on the armor again but the suit i fold and lay beside the maid for truly she be nigh unclothed by reason of the bush and the rock that have rent she garment all-wise and i stand watch for the maid the while that she do slumber and surely she go ten long hour and i walk upon this side of the fire-hole and now upon that and do oft cease that i might hearken both with mine ear and with my spirit for truly i be all waken to a new care and delight and do have a fresh and double fear of any horrid creature or force of evil and this shall be very plain to you and in the end of ten long hour the maid waken and i run to she all joy that she be come again to knowledge and to be that i could talk with she and she sit upward and look at I and there be new light and movement in she so that i know she strength be come back into she and for a little minute she say naught unto I the while that i do ask how she do be and she lookt at I very keen so that i wonder some wise in a daze what be in she mind and she askt I of a sudden how long it do be since that i have sleep and have not think to put away she ask because that the question be over sudden i say four-and-eighty hour which should be three day and the half of a day of four hour and twenty and this thing i know because that i keep alway a very careful counting of the hour lest that i get all adrift and know not how long i be take to come to this place and that and truly even as i tell this thing to the maid i be grow very quaint in the head for indeed i be go a wondrous while without slumber and have do much and bitter work in that time and before then have be much lack of rest as you do know and sudden the maid cry out something and tost the cloak from she and have I into she arm and do heed not to have any foolish shame of she nakedness and in verity i know not how i be go so strange but do see now that i be nigh to swoon for lack of slumber and rest and she keep I very steady for a little and afterward help I to be lay upon the ground and she put the scrip and the pouch under my head and so i do lie very calm and restful and do be the more so because that i be grow so tired in the heart the which do make my head to be very husht as that all the world be grow very quiet in a moment and the maid do mind then that she do lack to be properly cover and she gat the cloak and put it about she and do afterward sit a little beside I and do rub my hand and presently i be something more to myself and she do grow more happy of she mind and make to give I something for my stomach for indeed i be grow those late hour to be foolish and to have no wiseness to proper eating and she do lift my head the while that she do take the scrip from under and keep I very sweetly upon she knee and so until she have gat free a pack of the tablet and the flask and the cup for i have put all matter back into the scrip before naanus have go unto sleep and because of this i have not be able to eat or drink aught save by waken she as you perceive for indeed i have put the scrip and the pouch under she head for a pillow as i have tell and she would not bide that i should do aught but only do ask concern the making of the water and be wondrous amaze to see how the powder do fizz up and become water and indeed she have too much into the cup for truly it rise up and run to the ground and when she have do thus and cease to marvel she put three of the tablet into the water and make I a broth even as i have make a broth for she but indeed i be in no need and have do very well to eat the tablet and drink the water yet truly i be not wishful to lack the love of she way as you may think now while i do drink the broth i do be very restful upon the earth and mine head against mine own maid and i do mind I now that i tell she concern the armour-suit that i do mean for she wear yet i say not that i have stript it from I for then she have be like to say nay and to trouble that i be like to come to a chill as be the way of a woman but indeed i might so well have tell she for truly she do know on the moment and set to a little unto weep yet very gentle and sweet and do kiss I as i lay there and say such thing as should make a young man the better to have hear if but that he own dear love doth say the same and she would nowise wear the garment but yet in the end i prevail by gentle reasoning and because that i be she master as i be bear to be and moreover she own sweet sense do show that i speak for wisdom for how should she come through all the bitter way before if that she have not a strong and close-made garment and as you do mind she covering do be in utter rag as i have tell yet very sweet and clean as i have know so that i ween she have stript oft in the lonesome night and washt she garment in this or that hot spring of the sulphur water and other matter and in verity alway she be much give to washing as i do soon perceive now presently i do be very well again but with a sore slumber that do press upon my head yet ere i should sleep i do mean that i bathe she foot and bind they with ointment and with my pocket-cloth and truly she foot be very small and pretty and i sit I up talk my head from she knee and tell she of mine intent but in verity she do but throw she arm about my neck and give I one loving kiss and laught so hearty that i do think to do this thing when indeed she be the better able to mind it and i the better suit to have I to my rest and surely this be very true and i make no ado save to give she the ointment but lay back and do be quiet now i do be upon my right side and she go to my back and take the cloak from about she and spread it upon I and afterward stoopt over very dainty and kist I and bid I to go very swift to my sleep for that she do mean to make she toilet and to get into mine armour-suit and i make no foolishness in this matter yet tell she to ease the cloak a little about I so that i should have room to take the disko from my hip and this thing i do and take the disko to my breast as be my habit and surely i see that she eye do look at I with a little shine because that i have so strange and fierce a bed-mate and i make she to promise that she keep a very keen hark the which be like that she should do and to call I on the instant that she do perceive any unease in the night and after that i shut mine eye that i should not shame she and put out mine arm and kist she once and turn from she unto my slumber and she away to my back that she might be modest to she need and surely i be asleep in but a little moment and with a great love and delight in my heart and in all my being and truly i wake not for twelve great hour and when that time be go lo i come awake and surely the maid do sit beside I so bonny and so winsome and pretty that mine arm go unto she in a moment and she into they and give I a loving and tender kiss and afterward slipt away from I very sensible and loving and do stand up and turn about to be lookt at for she do wear the armour-suit and surely it be loose upon she but yet very please be close-knit and i to my seat from lie that i might see the maid the better and in verity i must kiss she again for she do be with she hair all about she that she look pretty unto I and she little foot do be bare and so that they make my heart new tender to look upon they for truly she be utter lose of foot-gear and i to my knee to she and she not to deny I do come to be kist again now when i find how great a time i have sleep i do scold mine own but yet as she do say i must have long slumber if that i go so long wakeful else should i lose my strength and i askt how oft she have eat and she tell I but the once and that six hour off and on this i do scold again but surely she put a very pretty finger sudden upon my lip so that i might do naught but laugh and kiss that same finger and after that we do eat and drink and make plan and once i do comfort the maid for indeed she sorrow do rise in she because that she father be come unto he death and the people of the lesser redoubt all destroy and adrift in the night amid the monster of that land and in verity i be set that we go quickly out of that place ere there come a horrid destruction upon we and surely there should scarce be any human beside in all that land for there must have come death upon the chief of those that do make escape and after we have eat and drunk i do count the pack of the tablet and be thankful in all my be that i have be careful and deny my belly for i do perceive that there be leave enough for we need if that we make a good speed and do not fear to be empty and of the water-powder as it might be name there be leave two full flask and somewhat of that one that i have drunk from all my journeying and by this thing you shall perceive that we do not be like to die for the need of such matter and here as it doth occur unto I i do ponder how it do be that we have no thought to slay any small creature for we food but mayhap we have no knowledge this way for surely they do not this thing to my know in the mighty pyramid but yet as i have say before this i have not all knowledge of the doings of the people but in verity i never see joint meat in all the time of that far life that i do wot of yet have we but slay somewhat for we hunger in that great wander we have be less empty in the belly now before that we should do aught beside we must contrive that naanus have some gear for she foot and to this intent i do make a search into the pouch and surely i find that there do be a change pair of inner shoe that be make to go within mine own shoe of the gray metal and at this i be wondrous glad and do make the maid to sit upon a little rock while that i make a fitting of the shoe and surely they do be utter big and clumsy upon she little foot so that i be in surprise to know how great be a man beside a maid but in the end i have a cunning thought for i cut off all the side of a strap throughout the length of the strap very thin and careful and so have a lace to tie the boot around the top which be soft and easy for such a purpose and after that i stand away to look at the maid and neither she nor i be truly pleased for indeed she be too pretty to be so hide and muffle yet be we glad otherwise for now she might go without hurt to she foot and afterward we packt we gear and she do make a bundle of she torn garment for truly they might be proper somewise to we need and so we to begin the way out of that desolate land and we go forward together across the land and the journey be no more a weariness but of a close and sweet joy yet do i have a new anxiousness as you do perceive lest that any monster come to harm mine own and we go twelve great hour in the bed of the olden sea and do eat twice in that time and surely the maid do grow utter weak and weary for she be not come proper unto she strength yet do she make no odd say to tell I of this thing but indeed i do know and i stopt in the thirteenth hour and take she into mine arm even as i should carry a babe and i go forward with she and do hush she protest with a kiss and afterward she do but nestle unto I and shelter against my breast and i bade the maid to sleep but indeed she have no power to this end for she body do ache very sore but yet do she strive to give I a obedience in this thing and in the eighteenth hour when that i stopt to have food and drink surely she do be awake yet have she be utter silent and i make to scold she but she gat from mine arm and do go upward upon she toe and put she finger against my lip very naughtily and afterward she do be impudent unto I and do deny I to kiss she but she go unto my back and do open the scrip and gat I to my food even as a quiet and proper wife should go as she do be so sedate that i know she have mischief she heart of harmless kind but afterward this do pass sudden into weep for she have a quick and sore memory of she father and of the destruction and i take the maid into mine arm and do let she be there very gentle and make not to kiss or to comfort she but yet to give comfort and presently she cease from weep and do slip she hand into mine and i to keep it within very soft and quiet and afterward she begin to eat she tablet yet always she do be very husht so that i do be quiet also and feel as that my love do be round she as a shield and i know that she have knowledge of this thing in she heart and oft i hark into the night of the land but there be nowhere any sound or disturbing of the aether to trouble I and the maid in mine arm do know when that i hark for in verity she have the night-hearing and the understanding spirit that doth be needful to such and odd while do i look down to she through the gloom that do be about we and presently i do perceive that she lookt up to I out of mine arm and i kist she now in all that day we have come nowhere upon any fire-hole in the bed of the olden sea and truly i do ache to be nigh unto the warmth of such for i do feel the cold of the land because that i be weary and because that i have not the thickness of the armour-suit below mine armor to warm I and the cloak do be about the maid for i have fear that she should grow cold as i carry she yet now she do know subtly that i be come to feel the utter chill of the land and she gat from mine arm and put the cloak about I and afterward come again into mine arm and i let the cloak bide there and draw it forward to be around she also yet truly i be joyful that i do be cold as you shall perceive for it be sweet to the heart to bear somewhat of that dread chill for mine own and she half trouble and likewise with understanding of my heart because that i be less clothed than i have be now in a little while the maid do pack the scrip and so we do make ready again to go forward for i be grow anxious as you may suppose that we should come to some fire-hole that we have a place for sleep that have warmth and light for truly the cold of the land do be drear and horrid and i stoopt to take the maid into mine arm that i should carry she but she do say nay that she do be well rest and i not to gainsay she for she do mean the thing as i perceive and i have no desire to force my way upon she save when i see truly that she do seem to go unwisely and indeed when such do be the case i do strive with she only with a nice reasonableness as you shall know and the maid walkt by my side and wondrous silent but yet very nigh to I so that i know she do be very full of love to I and of that quaint and sweet humbleness that love doth breed odd while in a woman when she doth be with she man if but that man be also she master and presently i perceive that the cloak do be over mine own shoulder and i take it and would have put it about the maid but truly she do not allow this and when i do be stern with she that she obey I in this matter she do stand upon she toe that she might kiss I and pull my head down and surely she kist I and coax I that i wear the cloak else should i give pain to she in that i do surely be cold because she do wear the armour-suit yet i would not hark to this thing so that the maid do be truly in trouble and first she make a threaten that she wear but she olden garment that do be only rag if that i do persist but this i see to be foolishness and scarce-meant and do as much need to smile at she as that i do think to scold she but i do be firm that she wear the cloak and lo she go sudden into cry and this have be beyond my thought and truly it set I all adrift for i perceive that she do be greatly distrest concern this matter when i have conceive that she do but mean this thing for tenderness ' sake but mine heart help I to understand and i see how she do be truly shame in she sweet womanhood if that i help she not in this matter for she do feel that she be make to do hurt unto that one that be she love and this thing i do pray you to think upon that you understand for indeed until that i be make to think i have not see it thiswise for she and in the end i come to agreement with the maid that we wear the garment hour by hour in turn and she to wear it the first hour and i to wear it the second hour and so to go forward and truly this do be a happy arrange but yet she stampt she foot a little as i put the cloak about she and thrice in the hour do she ask I concern the time that be go and surely when the hour be but up she have the cloak off in a moment and go to my back and cast it upon my shoulder and after to my front and make it fast upon my breast and so eager and naughty be she to this that i take she by the shoulder and shake she somewhat even as she have make to stamp at I yet mayhap with more of laughter and she to take no heed at all but to button the cloak and be very sedate yet in verity i catch she up into mine arm and kiss she for a sweet and naughty maid and she very willing now that she have get something of she way but yet in a hour i do have the cloak about she again and so do straiten matter as you shall conceive now when we have go forward through five great hour i perceive that the maid do be utter worn but yet do make presence that she be unwearied and because i see how she do be i do heed and be anxious only that we come to some rock to be for we safe refuge and mayhap there to find a hole or cave that should be somewhat to keep we heat about we for there be nowhere any fire-hole anigh in all those hour and presently we come to a part where there do be rock and we go to and fro in the gloom and come in the end to a place where the rock do go upward into the night as that it have be a small and ancient cliff and surely in a while i find a hole that do go inwards of the rock and the hole do be above mine head yet when i be come to it and have make the disko to spin therein that i should have light to see whether there do be any creature or creep thing in the hole i be well pleased for truly it do be sweet and dry now the maid have cry out a little to see the sudden shine that do come from within the hole when i make the disko to spin and because of the low roar of the weapon but i answer she that there do be naught to have fear concern and so be she peaceful again but yet a little tremble when that i come down to she for indeed the disko do make always a strange sound and a quaint and drear shine as you do know and she do be fear for I that some evil force have come upon I out of the cave for she have neither knowledge nor conceive that ever there do be so wondrous a weapon in all the world and i give the maid a help upward to the little cave and come after myself and so we do be in a very nice and cosy place that do not be easily get at by any monstrous thing and surely i be utter glad for such a place so that both should have safety that we might sleep in the same hour and in truth this be a needful plan for if one have stay wakeful to keep a watch for the other then have we sleep take we double hour and this thing might not be else should we food be do and we to be twice so long as need be ere ever we do come unto the refuge of the mighty pyramid and i utter wearied and anxious of the heart and spirit that i bring mine own soon unto the safety and glory of my mighty home and so free from the destruction that do hang above we two soul for ever in that land and the peril that do be everywhere save in the last redoubt now when we be come into the hole of the rock the maid do slip the scrip and the pouch from my shoulder and she gat out the tablet and make some of the water and do be very swift and natty and all to the despite of the gloom that do be utter in that little cave and we eat each of we two of the tablet and drink some of the water and i make jest with the maid how that the tablet do be proper for strength yet very lack to fill the belly though indeed i name it otherwise and she to agree and do pat mine arm and do tell I how that she should cook I a monstrous tasty and great meal when that we be come unto the mighty pyramid and immediately afterward she do make to laugh upon I and to name I impudently for so much thought unto my feeding and afterward again to silence and to pat my hand now when that we have make a end of eating and drinking i be very ready for sleep for truly it be six and twenty great hour since that i do last slumber but for the maid it do be eight and thirty great hour for as you do mind she have make no sleeping when that she do lie in mine arm for six hour of we journey and i make how we should sleep and put the cloak about the maid but surely she do refuse very piteous and seeming to have also somewhat of doubt and puzzlement but in this thing i do be very stern and intend for she do not be over-warm clad as you do know and moreover she be but a little one while i do be wondrous hardy and in verity i make she to obey and give she the scrip and the pouch for she pillow and she as it do seem to I to sob to herself a little in the gloom of the night but yet do i stay my heart a little stern to mine intent and i wrapt the cloak about she and set the scrip and the pouch very nice beneath she head and afterward i knelt over to kiss she before that i come unto mine own slumber yet do she turn she mouth from I and do put she hand above she face to ward I off the which do grieve I for truly i do heed alway that i should never thrust my love upon she in she lonesomeness but only let it be to she for a shield and for all comfort unto she heart and i turn my back and go a pace away and lay down for truly there do be no way else but to be near unto the maid for it be but a little cave and i lay very husht because that i be so sore in the heart yet truly i could not come unto my slumber for i be so disturbed in my love and i stay very quiet maybe for a great hour and do fight that i shake not mine armor to jingling with the utter cold that do make I to tremble but the maid do sleep very sweet and calm as i perceive by she breathing yet in verity the maid do be so much awake as i and with some sweet and naughty intent of the heart as my spirit do sudden perceive and i lay very husht and do wait to discover what this thing might be and i make my breathing to seem as the breathing of one that do sleep even as that naughty maid do make pretend and surely in a while i do know that she move very quiet and come unto I and i make yet that i sleep very sound and strong though the cold do nigh to conquer all my quietness and in a moment i perceive the intent of the maid for i do feel the cloak spread over I with a wondrous gentleness and afterward there do be a soft kiss put upon my hand and the maid back then to she pillow yet as i do hear she bring it something more nigh to I as that she do crave to be near unto I that be she own love and i sit up and i put forth my hand suddenly and take the maid into mine arm and she to nestle unto I so that i do be wordless because that i love she so utter and presently i feel she to stir in mine arm and i loost she somewhat for i do be always very mindful that i impose not upon she dear liberty of maidenhood yet she make not to go from I but only to gather the cloak about she so that we do both be in the cloak and she askt why this might not be for surely it do be madness that one should starve and the other be very nice in warmth and indeed this do be but wisdom yet it might not come the first from I and i say to mine own that this thing should be and she reach out and bring the scrip and the pouch and place they for a pillow for my head and tell I that i should put my head thereon and i askt she how this do be right for she do need a pillow the more than i but she bid I to bide and to have obedience in my turn and when i be so she spread the cloak over I and afterward creep under and do lie down beside I and do seem as that she be asleep in one moment yet though she do be so sedate and matter-of-the-fact as we do say while that she be wakeful she do yet nestle unto I very sweet and childlike in she sleep and surely i do want to kiss she but yet do refrain from my love for truly i do well that i treat she very gently at such a time as you do perceive and in verity such a maid doth make a reverence in the soul of a man now presently i be go over unto sleep and in seven hour i wake and in that time have the maid slumber through eight hour yet do i intend that she be not disturb until that we be aready to the journey and i slipt from under the cloak and put it round she very gentle yet it to be as she do miss I even in she sleep for it to seem to I that she put out she arm in the darkness and she make a little moaning in she slumber yet in a moment she do be quiet and afterward i put the cloak about she again and i go then to the opening of the little cave and put forth my head and lookt well about and hark a long while but there stir nothing in the night thereabout neither do my spirit wot of any matter for trouble unto we and presently i gat out two of the tablet for as you do know the maid have give I the scrip and the pouch to be my pillow so that i have power to come at these matter without awake she but for she own part as i do learn after she have use she torn garment to be for a pillow yet have make no explain as you do mind and surely this be one of she naughty whimsy and mayhap she have be so full of a playful happiness -- as doth take the heart betime -- that she have make a little mystery where there do be no mystery and this but to release she joy and so to say masterful thing unto I out of she impudence and afterward have mean that she tell I but yet be go unto slumber ere that she do mind she yet since that time a new thought have come unto I that she do mean in the first that she should come into mine arm to sleep and thereby need no pillow but afterward it may hap that she see with a sudden olden wisdom all in one moment and afterward do act lovingly yet with understanding and so do change from she intent yet with no improperness of modesty but only with a niceness of sense which she do make no talk of but yet do have and surely how oft be a man thus wisely order unknowing and to cease from these thinking and to go forward i eat two of the tablet and afterward make some of the water and lo the fizzing of the water wake the maid and i know that she reach out very sudden to I but afterward know in a moment what do make the sound and that i do be up and make ready for the journey and she gat up in the darkness and say my name and come unto I and kist my forehead in the dark and immediately she run she hand gently downward of my left arm and when she come to the cup she take it from I and slapt my hand very dainty and afterward i know that she take a sip from the cup and then do turn that side to I and so give I to drink and do scold I that i have not wake she to tend to my need for surely she do be mine own to have she duty to I and after that i have drink she take the cup and do finish it and she gat two of the tablet as i do think and come afterward and sit upon the rock to my side and do nestle somewhat against mine armor and take mine arm and set it about she and so do make to eat but first she put she tablet unto my lip in the dark that i should kiss it and surely this be a olden way of mirdath my beautiful one so that i do be all shake of the heart and i kist the tablet and immediately she nestle unto I and do begin to eat and truly it be as that eternity have be roll backward for i have discover the soul of mine olden love in this dainty maid to my side yet in look have mirdath be of a utter differ but in verity naanus be wondrous lovely but though i to be so stir i do be silent for my heart be very full of memory and as the maid eat she slipt she finger between mine curl they softly and surely she finger do be very little and she stir mine olden memory again in this thing and surely i be dumb before my memory and presently she put up the second tablet as i do think that i should kiss it and i kist it as before yet ere she do begin again to eat i do wot suddenly that she hide some intent from I and i catch she hand very quick in the dark and she finger do close upon the tablet very guilty so that i perceive that i have guess aright and i open she finger and i find that there do be but the half of a tablet within she hand and surely she have take but that one tablet and have give I the one end to kiss and afterward the other so that i should suppose she do eat two proper and complete tablet and i perceive that she have do this thing secretly be mind that if she eat always but one tablet then should i never lack even if that we do be over-long come unto the mighty pyramid and i askt how oft already have she eat but one for two and she confess in a very quiet voice that this do make the fifth time and i be so angered that i take she hand and whipt it thrice so hard that she have scream if that she have be any coward and she say nothing to I neither go away and she begin again to eat the half of the tablet and do eat it from the other hand as i to be aware because that she left hand do be hurt and she weep not but be very quiet by I and presently i know that she kist the whipt hand secretly in the dark and afterward i put mine arm again about she and she do be there in it very sober and happy and when she have make a end of the first tablet i give she the second and she eat it very quiet and content and presently i talk with she and show she how that this thing do hurt my heart even as she have be hurt that i do be cold garment the while that she do be warm and i show she the wickedness that she have do that she do play so foolish with she life and strength and well might she be weak and all a-lack yet do i think a little sweet impudence come into she as i tell she concern she wickedness and i take she then into mine arm and i show she how that i know all the unselfishness and wonder of she heart and i kist she and truly she lip do have a lovely glad humbleness as they come unto mine so that it be as that i have not kist she truly until that moment and i make she to promise that she never deceive I in such matter again and indeed she promise but yet with no ready tongue and afterward we make proper for the journey and when we have get we gear together i go downward of the rock and give the maid help to come down and when we do stand at last upon the bottom of the rock i askt naani how she do feel and whether she foot do hurt and she answer that she do be very well and have no soreness in she foot and we go forward then and she close unto I and odd while with low speech but more oft with silence because that we do need that we hark alway for any danger or horror and also there do be so utter a silence upon that part of the land which do be the bottom of the olden sea and we eat and drink at the sixth and the twelfth hour and in the fifteenth hour we come upon a great slope of the earth and lo it do be the far side of the sea and we go upward for a long hour and so come to the upward part and do be able once more to look over the greatness of that land xi the homeward way now truly it do seem very light after the horrid and lonesome gloom that do lie all-way in the bottom of the olden sea and i see that i be come out upon a part of the land that do be surely to the right of that place where i make entry into the sea-bed on mine outward go and there do be a great plenty of fire-hole so that mine heart be warm to see they yet do i mind to be wary in come unto they for as you do know there do so oft be life of this kind and that about these fire and i lookt now down to the maid and she upward to I and do come more anigh to I and truly she do be most wondrous pretty and sweet yet do seem very awearied and pale in the face so that i make blame upon myself that i have overwalk she for in verity i do think that i be so strong and hard as that i have be make from iron and she but a dear and tender maid yet do she refuse that i should so reproach myself and do but stand anigh to I and look at I with eye that be very beautiful and so i put mine arm about she and kist she and afterward lookt again over the land that i should shape out we further journeying and from that place where i do stand there spread out all before I the blue shine that i have see from the mouth-part of the upward gorge yet do it be a great way off and indeed i should tell you in this place that it be by the glimmering of this shine within the sky of the night that i have steer as we do come across the olden sea-bed and truly it be but a broad thing to go toward but yet do serve I in that it tell I that i go toward the far side of the sea-bed and make not to go all about in blind circle in the night and after that i have consider a while i do know somewhat where the gorge should be and perceive that i should go unto my left but not overmuch for indeed i see the red-shining of the giant ' hole that lay at a great space that way and surely i must go so that i miss the place of the giant so much as i might and in the same go come not overnear unto the blue-shining that lay before I across all the far part of that country for in verity i mistrust the place where that shine do be now when i have gain somewhat of knowledge where should be find the mouth of the upward gorge i put mine arm about the maid where she do stand so nigh to I and very husht the while that i have lookt about and i point outward over the dark land unto my left and tell she that the gorge do be somewhere that way a great distance off yet utter out of my sight and only to be know that it do be somewise there by the thing that i do mind of concern my way after i come into the land now the maid have stand very quiet have lookt all that time about she and so have come to some know of the place where she do be in the land for she to know the land someway as you shall think and she askt I how i do mind to go and truly i say so straight as we might but yet so that we come neither too nigh to the shine nor to the great red fire-pit of the giant and the maid bid I to look in the way that i do mind to go and i lookt but yet there be nothing save as they do seem certain fire-hole that have a green-shining about they and she set out unto I then how that there do go a tract of bad gas in that part of the land that should be utter poisonous unto any and this have be well know in the lesser redoubt by the reading of they instrument and where the gas do go there be there a green-shining about the fire-hole and she show I how that the place of the gas go a great way unto the north-west so that i learn now somewhat how the land do lie as we do say in these day and it be in all the north-west that the great blue-shining do burn and i askt naani how they name this and she tell I by no name save but the shine and mine own make very earnest to warn I regard the shine and urge that we go no more that-wards than should be needful to we life -- the which indeed be no wish of mine and she reason to be that the fix giant do be within the border of the shine and all hide in the light thereof save when the burning mist do roll this way or that and i take a great heed of this thing and do guess that these fix giant be somewhat even as the great watcher that be about the mighty pyramid as you do know and immediately i mind I of that utter monstrous face that i do see amid the bright smoke of the shine when that i come first into the land and surely this have be one of the fix giant that naani tell I be force of great and very horrid evil and i askt mine own how far the place of the gas go across the land and she point and make further explain and in verity in the end i see not how i should come that way to the mouth of the gorge if that i would keep off-wards from the shine yet in a moment naani askt I how i do come across the land when that i search for she and truly as i show she i have walk then by a sweet chance or guide alway upon the far side of the place of the gas and so unto the olden sea bed and be in this way come free of the gas and all unknowing of it and at this tell the maid say that we go downward again into the bed of the olden sea and walk some great hour below the shore but in the way that should take we unto the south-west and so until we be come beyond the place of the gas and afterward up again into the land and then to have a utter caution that we escape the watching of the giant who do be ever about the great red fire-hole and by this plan very speedy to the entering-part of the upward gorge and truly this do be very good and sound and such as i should have plan in a moment for indeed i be not over-slow in such matter only the maid do be very eager and quick and it be very sweet to I that she should thus plan for in verity i love alway the sound of she voice and to hear she have speech and to plan and think and so to show I the workings of she inward self and she dear quality and human niceness and to have part and lot alway with I in all thing and thinking and we shape to this plan that naanus make but at that time as you do mind it be somewhat of seventeen hour since last we have slumber and the maid be sore wearied as i do see and i show to she how that it do be wise that we have we rest very soon and so forward again in new strength and ability and the maid do soon agree with I for indeed she be very weary and we make it that we should venture unto one of the fire-hole that lay no great seeming away a little upon we right which be the northward-way of that land and we go toward the fire-hole and truly it do be further off than we have think for it be a good hour before that we come anigh to it and indeed it to prove a very great and red-glowing shine that go upward into the night out of the hollow place where it do burn among rock and when we be come near unto it i make a sign to the maid that she be utter husht and i take the disko from mine hip and go forward before she and afterward to my knee and hand and beckon backward to mine own that she do likewise and we come this way to the edge of the hollow-place where the fire-hole do burn and so be able in the end to look downward and truly it be a great fire that burn in the earth in that place yet as i perceive very swift there do seem nowhere any monstrous thing about the fire the which set some peace upon mine heart but yet not overmuch for it be come fresh upon I that we do well to stay afar off from the fire of the land in that it be about the fire that all live thing do congregate and i lookt a great time and the maid creep unto mine elbow and lookt with I and afterward we hark very keen into the night but there be nowhere any trouble of the air or of the aether of the land yet i speak quiet with the maid and show unto she how that we do well to stay off-ward from the fire but truly she be so utter cold and chill that she do beg that we go down by the fire-hole even should it be that we stay no more there than should put a warmth through the utter chill of we body and in verity i be so bitter cold that i be all weak to go beside the fire yet truly i do think that the shivering of the maid be that which do force my heart to go against the teaching of my head so that in the end we come down into the hollow and very swift unto the fire now truly it doth seem a strange thing to be so diverse-minded as this when that as you do know i have be so long a-search for a fire-pit and mayhap you shall perceive the better how my heart and brain do be contrary when that i tell to you now how that i have belief that my spirit do even then be subtly set to warn I and also as all do know it doth be easy to forget this warning and that of experience by which say i do mean that oft as i have come to know the danger that do be alway about the fire-hole yet when i do be far off from they and mine own broken and a-shiver with the chill of the land the danger do seem but a small thing and afar off from my mind and unreal but the cold to be doubly real yet when we do come even unto the fire-hole then do come again all about my heart the truth of those danger that have seem but a while go so little and indeed i do hope you perceive I in this thing and how that i strive alway to set unto you the utter truth so that you shall go with I all the way and lend I you nice understanding now when we be come down unto the fire-pit i go this way and that among the rock that do be in the bottom of the hollow so that i should perceive whether there do be any living creature there hide that should mayhap come out unknown to work we harm but indeed i discover nothing of any greatness yet i see three snake and there be beside two scorpion-creature as i do name they that neither go backward from I nor come against I but do bide where i see they each in a hole of the rock and because i have see these thing i see that we should not do wise to sleep nigh unto the fire-hole for the creep thing do mortally like the heat and should be like to come upon we in we slumber and indeed this do but uphold my caution that we should be well action if that we choose some other part to we rest yet as you shall suppose i say naught unto the maid concern the creep and the poisonous thing for i do mean that she have rest and happiness the while that we do stay beside the fire-hole and afterward i should tell she and so she be the more ready to see the properness that we go elsewhere to we sleep but as you to understand if that she not to see wisely and be still intent to the fire-hole i should have she to obey for surely she be mine own and i do love she and do mean alway to have she to safety now presently the maid be something warm and afterward she slipt the scrip from my shoulder and so have food and drink very swift to my need and we sit together and eat and drink and the maid very sweet and quiet as she do begin to eat she second tablet and truly i have know that she do remember in all she body that i have whipt she and indeed she do be utter mine and oft as we do eat and drink i lookt this way and that so that no creep thing should come anigh to we and presently when we have make a end of we food the maid see that i do look about and she then very swift to catch some of mine unease and to stare over she shoulder and indeed in a little while she see a snake go among the rock and she then to be very eager that we find some place that should be secure from creep thing and we to begin then to look for such but in the end we stay in the hollow for we find a little cave that do be in a upstanding rock of the hollow and the upstanding rock be mayhap a hundred good foot off from the fire for the hollow be very great and the cave do be a hole that be thrice my height up from the bottom rock and it be dry and sweet and with no creep thing within it neither do there be any place to hide such therein and when we be get into the hole surely it do be very sweet and cozy for the shine of the fire-hole do shine therein and surely we have feel it a very haven but that there be ever the fear of the land upon we heart and upon mine the more than upon the maid for truly mine own do seem to trust I utter and to seem that she fear not any evil monster but to have surety that i have power to succor she in all way and truly this trust have be very sweet unto my heart if that i have lack somewhat of my terror for the safe home-going of mine own and we sleep that night as we have do before and share the cloak over we for truly the fire-hole make no great warmth unto we yet be it less bitter in that part than in the darkness of the land and by that we have come unto sleep it be twenty good hour since last we have slumber and truly we do be very wearied but yet come unto we rest with we spirit set anxious to harken on danger the while that we do sleep and we sleep seven hour and do know suddenly of some matter that have need to waken we and lo in a moment i do wake and the maid in the same instant of time and there be a great scream and cry out in the night that surely affright we both yet do hurt we heart the more for it do be the utter crying and terror of poor human in the night of that land yet might i do naught but only wait that i learn more of the matter for my duty be unto mine own and i have no leave of rashness any more yet as you do suppose i be all shake to go downward of the rock and afterward to climb out from the hollow that i should give some help unto they that do need help but yet might i not leave the maid and immediately there be a great roaring in one part of the night and again another roar in another part of the night and lo in a moment the roaring do be answer and the roaring be the sound of big and husky voice so that it do seem that we hark to man so big as house that do run and shout in the night and the maid do begin to shake and i put mine arm about she and draw she backward into the hole so that she do be into the shadow and she to tremble like one that be break in courage for truly she have hear those sound oft in the night in all the long and dreadful month that she have wander and indeed i be all shake in my courage for it do be the shouting of giant that i hear and you do know somewhat of the utter horror and terror that do be alway in the heart that do harken unto those monstrous voice for you do know my tale and there come in a moment a dreadful scream out in the night and the scream do be the scream of a young maid that doth be slay very brutal and my heart sicken because of mine own but my spirit do swell with a strange and utter anger as that it should burst my body and the maid to my side break into a utter sobbing and the scream of the maid afar off in the dark do end very sudden but in a moment there do be other screaming in diverse place and the hoarse shouting of the great man and the thudding of mighty foot that run this way and that a-chase and the crying of the human come nearer and the thudding of the great foot and in verity in a little minute it do seem unto I that the sound do be right upon the hollow and i creep forward and peer out and i feel the night to be full of people run and immediately there pass by the hollow a clustering of human that run ever and scream and gasp and weep panting as they run and the shine of the fire-hole make they plain see and clear and they do be both man and woman and be but in rag or utter naked and all tear by the rock and the bush and do seem indeed as that they have be wild thing that do go by so swift and lost and mine heart trouble I with the pain and longing that it do know so that i have go in a moment after those people but that i should leave mine own and put she to peril and even while that i feel so utter in this thing there come a great thudding of monstrous foot and there run four great man out of the night and go past the hollow very quick and three do be dull color and seem much haired and brutish but the other do be a horrid white and livid-blotched so that it do seem to my spirit that there go by a thing that do be a very man-monster fill of unwholesome life and surely they do be go from out of the shine of the fire in one moment as we do say and again into the night to they dreadful chasing and when the thudding of they foot have go a long way off over the land i hear they bellow and afterward a far away scream that do have a death note in it and i know that those dreadful brute-man do be take the life from some poor wild human and afterward there do be the silence again and surely it do come to I with a fierce impatience of sorrow that those people do be without spirit of courage else have they turn they upon the giant and slay they with they hand even if that all have die to compass that slaying for truly they should all die anywise by the giant-men and they have die then with somewhat to comfort they hate yet as i do know the people of the lesser redoubt have long be bear of parent that be starve of the earth-current through a hundred-thousand year and more and because of this thing they do surely lack somewhat in all way yet be naani otherwise but this not to prove aught save the rule as we do say now sudden as i stooped very husht and troubled in the mouth of the little cave i know that mine own sob dryly in the back part of the cave and i have go to comfort she but that in the same moment i see a naked maid run very swift over the edge of the hollow and do look over she shoulder as she run and she come to the bottom and creep in under a ledge of rock that do be in that place and she do seem utter worn and go of the spirit and desperate and i perceive in the same instant why that she do go stealthy and swift in that fashion and to cower as for she very life for there come a squat haired man so broad as a bullock who do come silent down into the hollow look this way and that even as a wild beast doth peer very sudden and the squat man have instant know of the place where the maid do be and run in upon she with no sound and i pause not but leap all the great way unto the bottom of the hollow which do be mayhap twenty good foot and more for mine anger be upon I and i do mean that i save that one though i do be powerless to give succor unto those other and i fall strong upon my foot and have no harm of my limb for all that the leap do be so high and in that moment before that i have time to save the maid the squat man ript she and she cry out once with a very dreadful scream and be suddenly dead in the hand of the brute-man and my heart make my blood to burn with wrath in mine eye so that i have scarce power in that instant to see the squat man as i run upon he and the roar of the disko fill all the hollow as i make it to spin as that it do rage with a anger and to be glut of the man and the man come round upon I and think mayhap to deal with I as it have deal with that poor maid but not all thatwise as you must know and i swing the disko and it do seem to sing and to cry eager in my hand and i smote at the squat man even as it do leap silent upon I as a tiger doth leap make no sound but i gat not home the blow for the man dropt sudden down upon the hand and the blow go overward and the brute-man catch I by the leg to rip I and i cut quick with the disko and it do have but one monstrous talon leave unto it and immediately it cast I with the other half across the hollow and i fall with mine armor clang mightily and the disko do ring like a bell and by the graciousness of all good thing i be harm not by that monster throw but be to my foot in one instant and have not loose the disko from my hand and the beast-man do be upon I with two quick bounding and i stand up to the man and it make no sound or cry as it come at I and there do a great froth of brute anger and intent come from the mouth of it and the tooth come down on each side of the mouth very great and sharp and i leap and smite so that my blow should come the more speedy and the disko take away the head and the shoulder of the squat man and the dead thing knockt I backward with the spring that it have make but it harm I not greatly yet afterward i do know how sore and bruised i do be in all my body and be and i come back very swift against the man but it do be truly dead and greatly horrid and i go from the dead monster and do go all heart-shaken unto the dead maid and i take the tear body of the maid very sorrowful and cast it into the fire-hole and i turn I then that i should look unto the cave that i should know that all do be well with mine own and whether she do have see the horror or be go into a swoon and lo mine own do run toward I and she have in she hand my belt-knife which i do give she before that time to be a weapon for she defense and i perceive that she have come to be mine aid if that i do need such and she do be utter pale yet very steadfast and not seem to tremble and i make to take she from that place but she go beyond I and lookt at the monstrous bulk of the squat man and be very silent and she come back unto I and still so silent and she stand before I and say no word but my heart know what she do be think for i be not foolish to have lack to know what do be in she heart though mine effort have not show itself that way unto I before that moment and i have no pretending of modesty but receive with gladness and a strangeness of humbleness the honor that she eye do give to I for indeed she do be so that she might not give word to she joy of I and she glad respect the which be so wondrous good unto the heart of all man that do be loving of a dear and honest maid and she say nothing neither then nor afterward but i do be honor all my life after when that i do anytime mind I of the way that mine own lookt upward at I in those moment and afterward she do need and allow herself to come unto mine arm that i hold she from the tremble of heart which do come to she after that there do be no need for courage for surely we have both see a very dreadful thing and there be a great horror upon we and i climb upward again to the little cave and do help naanus and when we be come there again we do rest awhile and presently we eat each of we two of the tablet and drink some of the water and indeed we be both utter thirsty and in about a hour after that we have hark very keen a time we come downward again from the cave and have we gear with we and we come up out of the hollow and set forward with a great caution unto the olden sea-bed and we come there in two long hour for we go very slow and with constant harking for the fear of the monstrous man be upon we but there come no harm anigh neither do we perceive any disturbance in the night of the land and we go down a hour into the olden sea-bed and do go now the more swift for we fear be something ease from we because that we have come away from that place where we have perceive so great and dread a hunting but yet have we all care about we for the giant surely to be everywhere in that land but yet as i do think they to roam more oft anigh to the fire-hole for the human do surely wander in such part that they have warmth of the fire and after we have go downward a hour into the sea-bed we turn somewhat unto the south-west and go for twelve great hour and do never be any huge space from the shore for it do run that way as you do know and i make to steer by the shining of the land and with advice from mine own and in the end of the twelfth hour i do count we distance make that we do walk somewhat of a certain speed and by the telling of the maid we do be surely come beyond the place of the land where the poison gas do lie and by this it do be something after seventeen hour since we do sleep and surely we do be very ready to have rest for we have go forward strongly and with anxiousness and truly my hurt do be come upon I so that my whole body do ache for the quick fight have be bitter and i have be throw very hard and brutal and indeed it be wondrous that i have not be all smash only that the armor do save I and this doth show truly how hard and strong i do be and naanus do speak upon this and be oft a-wonder and at that time do beg I that i make some rest to cure my hurt for she have not conceive that a man do grow so strong and hardy and in verity the man of the lesser redoubt do be soft-made and lack of grimness as i do perceive both through my reason and from she telling for they do lack the strong life that doth breed where be the beat of the earth-current as we to have in the mighty pyramid and this thing i have say somewise before this time and because that we do be so wearied i say unto naanus that we find a place for we slumber and she very willing as i have show and to counsel I likewise yet do we search about in that gloom for a great hour more and find no cave or hole to give we a safe refuge for we sleep and when that we could not find such i tell naanus that we should put the boulder together somewhat and so have they about we that we be greatly hide and in truth even as i begin to tell she my plan she do have the same word in she mouth so that we catch we little finger there in the dark of that grim land in the end of the world even as she and i have do oft in the early year before that eternity when that she do be mirdath the beautiful and we do both be silent and after that we have wish very solemn and earnest we say each a name even as lad and maid shall do in this age and so to laughter and kist one the other and truly the world doth seem not to alter in the heart as you shall think and this be what i do find and we set-to and gather together the boulder which do be very plentiful in that part and she carry those that do be thin and flat and i to roll those that do be great and round and i make a place that do be long and narrow and afterward i set the flat stone round the side that there be no little hole by which any creep thing should come inward to sting we in we sleep and afterward we gat inside and surely it do be very cozy as we do say but yet not so secure as i do wish only that i could not shift to plan aught better and indeed it should keep off from we any small thing and should be like to save we from any monstrous brute tread upon we but otherwise it do be but a poor affair now we eat two of the tablet each and drink some of the water even as we have do in the sixth and the twelfth hour and afterward we share the cloak for we slumber and we kist very sedate and loving and charge we spirit that we wake if that any horrid thing should come anigh to we in we sleep and afterward we do be go very swift to slumbering and suffer no harm and i wake seven hour after and surely i do ache very bitter as i do move my body for the bruising do be get hold of I and i slipt away from the maid very gentle for i have mind that she sleep a while more as i do mean that we make a great journey that day and after i have hark a while and perceive that there be no evil thing anigh i go outward of the stone and i walk to and fore and move mine arm that i be ease somewhat of the stiffness and ache but surely it do seem that many hour must go ere i should make any speed of travel for i do be all clumsy and slow and nigh to groan with the pain of go and aught that i do and i mind I that i should do somewhat to ease this thing lest that i cause we both to come to a harm by stay over-long in that land and i go back into the stone and gat a ointment from the pouch that i do carry and surely the maid do yet sleep and i go outward of the stone again and stript off the armor and all my garment and i rub my body with the ointment and surely the pain do be so that i groan at this time and that but yet must i rub good and strong so that i die not of the cold of the land and beside i be greatly anxious to cure myself and sudden as i do rub very strong and savage and heed so well as i might that i groan not the maid do speak close beside I and indeed she could see I but dimly and have wake sudden to hear my groan and i be not to she side and immediately she have think that some evil thing harm I and be come in a instant that she be with I and she care not that i do be naked but be utter in anger that i strove to do this thing alone and with none to aid I and all uncover to the chill of the land and she run back into the stone and bring the cloak and put it about I and be so angered that she stampt and have no impudence but rather as that she do be mind to have tear and she send I back into the shelter of the stone and gather mine armor and bring these thing after I but the disko i take in my hand and she take the pot of the ointment from I and make I to lie and she rub I very strong and tender and keep I warm with the cloak and surely she be a wise and lovely maid and utter mine own and in the end she askt I how i be and i say that i do be different and she hurry I that i be clothe very quick for she do be sore afraid that i should come to a chill and when i be get again into mine armor she come to I and show I where i do lack wisdom and speak very straitly and gentle and serious and afterward kist I and give I my tablet and to sit beside I and we eat and drink and i with a new lovingness unto mine own and she somewhat as that she do mother I but when i put mine arm about she she do be only a maid and we do be thus with but little talk and a great content and afterward we gat we gear together and go from that little refuge that we have make and in a while we do go upward out of the olden sea-bed and when we be come again to the top of the shore the which we do in two good hour i lookt over the land a time with mine own anigh to I and i perceive that the great red fire-pit of the giant do be no mighty way off unto the south and west and surely in a little moment we see that there go monstrous figure against the shine of the mighty fire-pit and we stoopt unto the earth for it do seem that the light do be like to show we stand there though truly we do be afar off as you perceive yet mayhap you do share with we the utter horror and distress that those horrid man do cast about the heart and so have a kindly understanding of we fear and over all the land in this place and that there do be the small shine of little fire-hole and pit that do be alway red save in that part where the poison gas do lie the which we have now come safe past and beyond the fire-hole be the great shine that lay from the west unto the north of all that land and in verity we do need that we steer so that we come not anigh to it neither unto the great red fire-pit of the giant neither unto the low volcano which be beyond the great red fire-pit as you do know and someway unto the mouth of the upward gorge and the way of we journey be between the west and the south-west of that land and to be make with cunning and wisdom that we come clear of all unseemly danger unto mine own and i askt she concern this thing and that of the land and surely she tell I so much of terror that i be half in a wonder that ever i do live in the end to come unto she and it be because of the thing that she set out to I that i perceive how we must come nowise anigh to the low volcano that be upon this side of the mouth of the upward gorge for it have be know alway in the lesser redoubt that there go very horrid man in that part that do be call wolf-men but whether there do be any such thing in that age she have no know for she tell I the thing that do be set down in the record and the history and truly no man of the lesser redoubt have find heart in a thousand great year to make a journey through the land for the desire of glad and dreadful adventuring such as we young man do be oft set to though it be not all such that go and because there do be no adventuring for so monstrous a space of year there be no certain new knowledge of the land of that age and this thing be plain to you and need not of many word which do so irk I and naani set out to I how that the shine be conceive to be a land where evil do live for ever and whence come all those force of evil that do work upon the lesser refuge and afterward she do quiet so that presently i perceive that she do weep to herself because that she memory be all new-stirred by my questioning and i take she very gentle into mine arm as we do be there kneel upon the earth and after that time i askt she no question save as it do be needful to we health and life yet oft do she tell I this thing and that of she knowledge to be for mine help and guide now we go forward go a space toward the north-west so that we come the more clear of the place where do be the great red fire-pit of the giant and we journey with a care alway that we show not ourselves over-plain unto the light that shine over the land from the great pit and oft we do creep a while over this stark place and that and go nimbly amid the bush that grow oft in great part and we make six hour this way and do then have pause that we eat and drink and truly it be nine hour since first i do wake yet have we make no pause because that we be so set to we journey to come clear of the place where do be the giant and after that we have eat and drunk we go onward again and make now unto the south-west for we do heed that we go no more unto the north-west because that should bring we over-near to the shine and in the fourteenth hour of that day 's travel we come to a part where the land dipt downward into a broad valley and surely it do be very dark down there and do be seem shallow yet truly of a great deepness but we go that way because that it do be a weary long journey to go around the place where the valley do be and the valley have a different darkness from the gloom that go alway in the olden sea-bed for the gloom of the sea-bed do be ever of a greyness but the gloom of this valley have a greater dark within it yet do the air seem more clear and we go downward three hour into the valley and stopt then that we eat and drink and truly i have not pause then but that mine own do insist for we method do be like else to go all adrift and we to be lack of proper strength and this be wisdom of the maid but i to be a little irked-like and restless and this mayhap because that my blood do itch I because that it do be so full of the poison of my bruise and it be go now of seventeen hour since last we do sleep but yet do we be ready to go forward that we come so quick as maybe out of the dark of that valley for there do seem nowheres any fire-hole to make a light only that in this place and that there do be a little blue shine as that there burn a strange gas in this part or that now in two hour after the time that we do eat we stopt both of we very sudden for there do be some vague and curious sound in the night and we go very swift to the earth that we be hide and hark but do hear nothing and in a while we to go onward again yet there do be a unease upon we spirit for we spirit do perceive something afar off in the night but yet have we no surety in this matter and we go forward through a great hour more and do pass in that time two place where the blue-shining do be and truly it seem as that a low gas hang to the earth in this part and that and make a slow burning have neither noise nor spurting but slow as that it do smoulder and be all to shine and luminous and oft there do be a strong smell of a bitter gas very horrid in the throat and in the end of another hour while that we be a space off from one of those gas-shining there go past we at a distance as it do seem people run in the night as that they do be lose spirit yet with a rustling very soft so that they do be like to be barefoot and i think mayhap that these do be some of the people of the lesser pyramid yet do they be only as that shadow go among the blue-shining and i ponder a moment whether that i send my voice over the valley to question what they do be but yet have caution and hark through the utter silence of the night for i have no surety of aught and surely in that moment that we hark very keen there do be a sound afar off in the night of the land and it be as that we have hear the sound before and in verity we spirit have perceive the sound those two hour back and now we body do wot and perceive that we have know it subtly before that moment and the sound be as that something go spin in the night and a very great terror come upon the maid for she do know the sound and the sound be that which do show that one of the great evil force of the land do approach and the sound have be know alway in the lesser refuge to show this thing and indeed mine own spirit have be half to know that a power of evil do come through the night but yet be the assurance very terrible for how should i protect mine own and the spin come toward we and be presently in the valley and it come swiftly across the dark of the valley and my heart be all break within I because that there have be happiness with we but a little time go and now there do be we death anigh and mine own give I the knife that i have give to she meaning that i slay she in the last moment for she do heed even in that moment that she be not gash horridly by the terror of the disko and i take the knife and i kist not mine own but stand there very shake and desperate and gript she fast unto I scarce heed the hardness of my gripe and alway i lookt unto the way of the come of the sound and presently do unbare my wrist where the capsule do be and the sound of the thing spin come anigh across the valley and my heart do dull and my spirit go black with my desperateness because that this thing must be and because that i could nowhere see hope that i should save mine own and of a sudden the maid put up she arm and pull I downward and kist I once on the lip but i wot not whether i kist she for i do burn with despair and be all adrift in my be yet be there a sharp comfort that mine own die do be so nigh and the maid stand gently against I so that she do be convenient unto my hand and afterward i remember this thing and do you pray that you be never to have such a matter on you heart but indeed there be a wonder in this thing beside the horror so that my memory doth be alway know of this wonder and mayhap you do see with I and love mine own also in you heart and in the moment that the maid stand thus as i have tell i perceive sudden that there do be a little glowing in the night and the glowing be pale and horrid and there be no more any sound of the spin only there do be as it be the trunk of a great tree that do show in the glowing and the trunk of the tree come toward we across the darkness and i turn the maid from the tree and she do flutter a little in my hand as i do know scarce-knowing for she perceive that she do be go to die in that moment and i have my body thus between the evil thing and the maid and lo the tree come no more anigh to we but go backward and the pale glowing do fade and the tree no more to be see and i cry unto the maid very husky that we do live for that the evil power be go off from we but she answer not and do be heavy against I and i hold she and lookt alway about we lest the tree come in upon the other side and as i lookt this way and that i see naught and afterward in a moment i search the night above lest that the thing come from above and behold i see that there abode over we a clear light as it be a clear burning circle above we in the night and my heart do leap with a holy joy and a utter great thankfulness and i be no more in fear of the tree for in verity there fight for we soul one of those sweet power of goodness that do strive ever to stand between the force of evil and the spirit of man and this matter have i show to you before this time and concern this holy defense i have think that it should not mayhap to have have so strong a power to save we if that we have show a over-weakness and fear but because that we do rather stand so well as we might to make battle of escape from so dire a destruction and surely this doth seem but a sane think unto I but yet without proof and to be say to you only as the shaping of my thought and this the chief end of that happen that the holy circle do truly deliver we and burn through twelve great hour above we and by this do i know that the evil power hover anigh to destroy we all that while for indeed it doth not be proper of reason to suppose that such a utter wondrous thing do be needlessly over we save to be a shield of great and lovely force against a wait evil thing and surely you do see thiswise with I and truly so soon as my spirit and reason perceive that we do be no more to suffer from the evil thing i remember that i do know that mine own have swoon and in verity you shall mind how that she do face she death so utter sweet and brave and have give no cry but make quietly to help I in that dreadful moment and do stand brave and gentle to the stroke and so fall into a swoon as you have see because that she do suffer a hundred death as she do stand so brave wait to be slay for the blow do be so long delay yet to come in any moment and i gat she to come-to unto she life again and i set the lovely tale very swift to ease she and surely with love and warmth and kist she with a great joy and i show how i do honor she for she good courage and she to weep a little with the ease come so sudden upon she and afterward to kiss I upon the lip a hundred time and to need that she be very safe in mine arm because that i have mean that i do so dread a office to she and surely i do wonder whether you perceive all that do be then in she heart and the holy light that do be over we she do watch with a sweetness of awe and rest do come more great upon she in the heart as she do learn how sure be the seeming of that lovely power to deliver we and presently we make forward again in the valley and do go steadfast and newly-loving each to the other and so through twelve great and body-weary hour but we heart could never be do singing within we nor we hand to cease from the hand of the other because that we do so crave each unto the beloved and in the ninth hour a monstrous way off in the dark of the valley there do seem as that there go a far and dreadful scream in the night and it do be as that we spirit perceive the sound of something spin in the night yet faint and a great way off but yet have we no surety that we do truly hear the sound of the spin only we do be so shake in the heart for truly there be some horror do unto human downward in the mighty darkness of the valley and to think upon the sound of the spin be to be in a shake trouble of the spirit and to bless the quiet and holy light that go above we in all that time and to ache only that it should stay to be to we protect and surely it do be plain that there be the sign of great force in that land and three hour after that time when we do hear the far-off scream we be come up over the edge of the valley and do be once more unto such light as do be general in the land and truly it do seem a wondrous lightness after so utter a dark and we do be all exhaust and mine own draw she foot so weary that it be as that she must go no more until we do rest for indeed it be three and thirty hour since last that we have sleep and a bitter trouble and work there have be in that space as you do know now we have eat some of the tablet a few hour back as we do walk and have drunk some of the water but have make no rest for we do crave only that we come free of that valley and now it be needful that we rest if but a little time and i mind that we find some place where i should have a hot pool that i be able to bathe naanus 's foot and surely we come in a while to a hollow-place and there do be two dull-burning fire-hole in this place and a hot-bubbling spring the which do seem to be a rare thing in that land so that we be the more fortunate to perceive it and i make mine own to sit with she foot in the hot-spring for it be not over-hot and do seem pretty natural to my taste as i do prove in the first and also i do search about the hollow lest there be any harmful creature near-by and this you will have truly suppose because you do know the method of my journey but yet do i not have so much care as do be proper for i be so dull in the mind by reason of my weariness but indeed there come naught to work we any harm and so we come to no suffering through mine ache and dullness and i sit beside the maid and make she to eat a tablet and see that the cloak do be nice about she and she head to rest against my knee and i lay the palm of my hand to be as a pillow because of the armor to ease the hardness and i eat with the maid and we both drink after and so there come back somewhat of we strength then i take the maid 's little foot and rub a portion of the ointment from the pot all about they very gentle and constant and so do they be new-rested and ease and she presently fit again to the journey for i be strong set that we go quickly hence out of that land and stay no more there to sleep lest we come unto destruction and when we have rest a hour i put the shoe again upon the maid and make they secure and so gat my gear about I and make to the journey and lo as we do leave the hollow i lookt upward unto the holy light and behold it be go from we and by this thing i suppose that we have come free of instant danger but yet do there be to I a seeming of nakedness and unprotection as you must perceive and because that the light be vanish i be the more set that we come speedy out of the land and we go forward at a strong speed and have the great red fire-pit of the giant to we rear unto the left and a mighty way off in the night but yet i do wish it the further and before we be a small ridge up of the dark land as i do judge because that we view of the light and the shining be bound and to we leave at a great way the low volcano and somewhat to we right across all that part of the land go the cold and horrid glare of the shine now in a little while i feel that the ground do be slope upward before we a little and by this thing i see that i have know aright for that there do be a ridge that hide the land somewise over unto the part where i lookt to find the mouth of the upward gorge and we go up this slope at a strong pace because that i be so eager that i find where we do be in nearness unto the mouth of the upward gorge and surely i be something forgetful in mine eagerness and come somewhat ahead of mine own who do make to hide from I that she do begin to lag because that she new strength be near go from she and sudden there do be a very dreadful cry to my back and i come round in one instant so quick as a light doth flash for it be the voice of mine own and all my be do suddenly burn with fear that kindle through I in a moment of thought and lo mine own do struggle terribly with a yellow thing which i perceive to be a man with four arm and the man have two arm about the maid and with two do make to choke she unto death for she cry out no more and i come unto the man with a quick leap and stopt not to pluck the disko from my hip and surely i do be very strong and mine anger and rage to make I monstrous for i catch the two upper arm of the man and bring they backward in a instant so fierce and savage and so wrencht upon they that i brake they in the shoulder of the man and the man roar and shriekt even as a wild and dreadful beast should cry out and come round upon I with the two lower arm and surely it be a mighty and brutish thing and so broad and bulkt as a ox and the lower arm be huge and greatly hair and the finger of the hand do have the nail grow into horrid talon as that they should grip very bitter and it catch I by the thigh to rip I upward as i do fear but yet this do not be the intent of the man for in a moment it catch I round the body and on the instant i gat the man by the great throat and the throat do be hair and so great as the neck of a bull and i strove with mine armored hand that i choke the man and surely i make it to suffer great trouble yet i could not harm it in the life and so i do be a horrid minute and fight with the beast with no more than the strength of my body and it be as that a human go with he hand to slay a monster so strong as a horse and the breath of the man-beast come at I and do sicken I and i hold the face off from I for i have die with horror if that it have come more anigh and surely the mouth of the man be small and shape so that i know that it do never eat of aught that it do slay but to drink as a vampire and in truth i do mean that i chop the man to piece if that i have chance to the disko and i do sway this way and that as we do struggle and surely it be as that the man have never make to use the lower arm save to hold unto prey the while that it do use the upper arm to strangle as i do think for all that weary minute of the fight the man make not to loose from I that it should tear my hand from they grip to the throat but make vain wagging with the arm that i brake as that it would use these to the attack but surely they have no more power to do hurt and sudden it put forth a utter power about my body so that mine armor do be like to crack and truly i have die in a moment but for the strongness of the armor and the man hug I thus for a horrid time the while that i do hold off from I the brutish face and gript very savage into the haired throat and lo the creature do work slow in the brain and in the end loost from I abrupt and go back with a leap so that my hand do be ript from the throat of the beast and in one instant it do be back unto I and give I no moment to free the disko but i make anew to fight and shape as i have learn in the exercise of mine upbringing for truly i have be alway deep in practice of such matter and i slipt from the great hand of the man as it do try to take I by the head and i hit the man with mine armored fist and put a great power and skill to the blow and i go instant to the side with a swift step and evade the man and i smote the man again and take he very savage in the neck but all the while grow very cold and brutal and cruel for i be set to the slaying and the man-beast come round on I and lo i slipt the gripe of the great hand and my body and my leg and mine arm do work together unto that last blow so that i do hit so hard as a great hammer and i gat the beast in the throat and the beast go backward to the earth even as it do think to hold I and lo in a moment i be free and i pluckt forth the disko from my hip and the yellow beast-man grunt upon the ground and it rise up again to come at I and it stand and do grunt and do seem as that it be go maze for it do make other sound and a horrid screech so that truly by the way of it i conceive that it cry out unknown and half-shapen word at I and in a moment it come again at I but i cut the head from the beast-man that be in verity a horrid monster and the man die and be quiet upon the earth and truly in that moment the distress of mine effort and mine utter tiredness and the ache of the bruise take I so that i do surely think i rockt as i stand but yet be my head strong to think and my heart set in anxiousness for i wotted not how great a hurt have be do upon mine own and i run to she and come to where she do be upon the ground and surely she be all huddle and have she hand very piteous to she throat that do be so pretty and it do shake I in that moment that she be truly slay for she be go so utter still and as that she do be break unto death and i take she hand from she throat and surely it do be a little torn yet not to be much or so that it should loose she of she dear life and i strove that i steady the tremble of my hand and i gat free of mine armored glove and make that i feel whether she throat do be deadly hurt and in verity it seem not so only that my hand do so shake because that i be so frightened for mine own and because that i be but new come from the battle and because of this i have not power of touch to assure I i make then that i quieten my breath which do yet come very full and labor and i put mine ear above the heart of the maid and lo she heart do beat and the horridness of my fear go from I in a moment and i have the scrip from my back very speedy and some of the water to fizz and i dash the water upon she face and upon she throat and surely there do be a little quivering and a answering of she body and i strove with she for a while more and she come unto she life again and in the first she be all a-lack as you may think and immediately she begin that she remember and she then to shake and i tell she how that the four-armed man be surely dead and could harm she no more and she then to weep because that she have be put to such shock and horror and hold by so brutish a thing but i take she into mine arm and so she do come presently to a ease and i perceive in all my be that she be as a little ship that doth lie in harbor for she do cling and nestle unto I and do be safe with I in all she heart and body and belief and surely she be mine own and i to have glory in that know and presently i put she from mine arm to lie yet so that she might not perceive the body of the yellow beast-man and i make clean the disko from she sight and afterward i put on the scrip and i take the maid to mine arm again and have the disko in my hand beside she and she make protest that she should truly walk for that i be all a-weary and she come to she strength again and indeed i carry she a certain way and do then put she down to she foot and truly she knee do so tremble that she have not stand let be to walk and i catch she up again and i kist she and i tell she that i do be surely she master in verity and she mine own baby-slave and truly you shall not laugh upon I for i be so human as any and a man doth talk this way with he maid and she do be quiet and sweet and to obey wisely for she be go very weak and thiswise we do go and i to say loving word in the first but afterward i do heed more of my go now that she be something ease and at rest within mine arm and i do peer everywhere about lest that some other evil thing come outward of the bush to have at we ere i do ware and truly the bush grow here and there in that place very plentiful in great dumping and presently i be come to the top part of the ridge and lo a great gladness take I and some amazement for there do be the light that do be in the mouth of the upward gorge and they do show I that i be come anigh to that place yet have i fear that we be surely a dozen great mile off and now i to learn that we do be scarce of two or maybe three as i do judge and i tell this thing to the maid and she rejoice in mine arm with a deep and quiet thankfulness and i set forward then at so good a pace as i might and i be come into the mouth-part of the upward gorge in about a hour and surely i do be very weary for it be beyond six and thirty hour that we have go since last we do sleep and there have be sore labor and terror to we share in that time as i have tell and i turn in the mouth of the gorge and tell mine own very gentle that we do take we last look upon that land and she askt that i put she down to she foot and i put she down and therewith we stand in that place and mine arm about she and so do i support the maid the while that she lookt silent over the dark of the land and presently she askt I in a very husht voice whether that i know where the lesser pyramid do be in all that darkness for she be all adrift of she bearing and be as a stranger because that she have never lookt upon the land from that place before then and i show she where i think the pyramid to stand hide in the everlasting night and she nod very quiet as that she do think thatwise also and so a time do pass and i know that naanus say good-bye forever unto all that she have know of the world in all she life and she do be whisper a goodbye in she soul unto she dead and i be very husht and deeply sorrowful for the maid and do understand for in verity there should no other human look upon that land of terror through all the quiet of eternity and the maid do lose all she young life into that blackness and the father that be she father and the grave of she mother and the friend of all she year and there go death in the land even then after those that do live and mine own shake a little within mine arm so that i know she strive that she be brave to weep not but afterward she make not to cease from she tear and truly i be there to be she understanding and she do be sweet and natural ever with I for she be mine own and do be hourly the more so and presently i move a little to sign that we go downward of the gorge and she stay I one moment that she look once more over all that land and afterward she submit and turn with I and do break into very bitter sob as she do go stumble beside I for the sorrow of memory do fill she and she be truly a very lonesome maid in that moment and have come through much dreadfulness and in a minute i stoopt and lift she and she weep in mine arm against mine armor and i very silent and tender with she and carry she downward of the gorge for a great hour more and presently she be grow calm and i know that she sleep in mine arm and in thiswise we make farewell of that dark land and leave it unto eternity xii downward of the gorge now i carry the maid a hour downward of the gorge as i do say and i be then grow so weary that i near fall as i walk and stumble everywhile because that i have lose somewhat of guide in my foot the which do show mine utter alackness and i see that i must come very swift to a place for slumber or that i do be like to fall headlong with the maid for i nigh sleep as i walkt and i begin that i give attention to the side of the gorge and surely i have go that hour all in a dream for i be fresh-waked as it be in that i do give my will to perceive aught and when i do come to have power to attend i know that i have go even as a sleep-walker for the gorge do seem a fresh matter unto I and as that i have come awake sudden to find myself a-walk in that strange and narrow place and presently i see somewhat where i do be for i mind the memory of mine outward journey and truly i have a good power to know and remember a way that i have go and i see that there be a great and ruddy fire-hole anigh to I and i be all sure that i have perceive certain cave in the wall of the gorge near to that fire as i past it on mine upward way and i have be give a mighty longing of heart at that time that it be give to I that i should bring safe mine own out of the peril that beset she and have she unto just such a place for she slumber on the way of we journey backward and surely i tell you this thing as a child in pleasure for truly it be a wondrous happy matter that my desiring should be like to have a true end as indeed it do seem be truly to be if that my memory have set I aright and i go onward somewhat and lo i to be right for the little cave do be there a little past the great fire-hole and there be seven of they in the left side of the great cliff of the gorge and one do be as that it be very cozy and a place of sure safety if that we could win unto it and truly as i do conceive we have come safe from the evil force of that land but yet do i mind that there be no surety in this thing and neither do i know but that some monster should come downward of the gorge out of that land and so work we death as we do sleep if that we have no sure place for we slumber and indeed i have wish that we be come a greater way downward of the gorge but this might not be for i be all adrift with weariness and truly if that we gat upward to the top-most cave there do be few monster that should have power to come at we ere we be warn of they come and afterward they should be like to come upward against the disko and this should be indeed a thing difficult as you shall conceive now it do be needful that i wake the maid and i kist she as she do be in mine arm and surely that dear one do kiss back again in she sleep and be yet asleep and truly i do love she with all my being and i kist she again and shake she very gentle and so have she to wakefulness and tell how we do be come to a place fit for we slumber and she to look about very sleepy as i set she to she foot and then to upbraid herself that she do over to slumber the while that i do labor with she carrying and in verity i kist she again as she do stand make to steady herself and look so pretty with the sleep that do lie yet in she eye and she to kiss I very dear and all mine and even then scarce proper come to wakefulness and do say with something of a little dear abandon that she do love I utter and forever and afterward i climb to the topmost of the cave and tell mine own the while that she walk up and down a little so that she come to a full awakedness and this i be careful to because that she should have a need of all she power that she come safe upward unto the cave and when i be come to the cave lo it do be so sweet and dry as do make glad my heart and there do be a warmth in the cave as that there go a fire somewhere through the rock anigh and the light from the fire-hole do make a reflection inward and so this do seem a place safe and fit to we slumbering and i come downward unto naanus call that the cave be very proper for we use and presently i give she mine aid to the climbing and so we come in the end safe into the cave and truly we do feel very safe and happy yet before we do sleep i set free the scrip and the pouch and take the strap and go downward again into the gorge and i gat a good boulder so heavy as i might carry and strapt it to my back and come upward again to the cave and the maid very grave and anxious lest that i slip to my hurt and when i be come to the cave again i set the boulder in the mouth of the cave and do balance it so light upon the edge that a touch should send it roll downward and by this devise i conceive that any beast or monstrous thing that should climb upward whilst that we sleep should be like to set the rock adrift and mayhap the rock to work a harm to such but the chief end to be that i should be swiftly wake by the noise and then i do turn that we go to we slumber and lo the maid have spread the cloak upon the rock that we should sleep upon it for truly there do be no need that we have it now to we cover because that the cave do be so warm as i have tell before and surely there do be no cause either that i should have the cloak for a bed for how should i perceive any softness from the cloak through all the sternness of mine armor but yet do i see that the maid have make a couch that should be for the two of we and do be so sweet and natural and to lie by I but yet to preserve she sweet modesty and to do the thing with no thought save that it be natural to we heart and that she do long alway to be anigh to I but yet mayhaps scarce full conscious that she heart do prompt she in this thing and in verity i love she very dear and surely naani show I the where that i should lie upon my side and when i have obey she kneel and kist I on the lip very sober and loving and she lay down then upon the cloak beside I and truly we have both go to sleep in one little minute as i do think now i do be wake twelve great hour after by the fizzing of the water and lo when i lookt the maid be not beside I but do make ready we simple eating and drinking and she laugh at I very sweet and tender because that she love I so and do be so glad to have I awake to she and she come over to I and kist I very bright and loving upon the lip and after that she have kist I she kneel beside I and lookt at I very dear and tender so that i know in a moment that she have wake a while go and watch I somewise motherlike as i do sleep but how i know this thing i be not sure save that my spirit do know or that she thought do have tongue unto mine and truly i need that i be so love and all of you to say like with I and i put up mine arm to she as i do yet lie and she not to deny I but come into mine arm and do snuggle there so sweet and happy and gladly and with so true a delight that it do be plain how she do love in all she body and spirit to be anigh to I as i to she yet truly as you do mind the armor do be upon I so that i fear to take she very strong in mine arm lest i hurt the dear maid and surely the armor do be a stern matter for she to nestle unto but yet mayhap do the sternness something please she womanheart and yet again mayhap to lack and presently she make that she would go from I and i loose mine arm from she very ready because that i do heed alway that she have full sweet liberty of she dear maidenhood and i to be watchful sufficient unto this end yet always honest and wholesome and not over-pondering even in this my care and this proper intend you shall ever perceive if that you heart do strive to hearken unto my heart which doth speak alway before you and the maid go from I over to where she have put the cup of the water and the tablet and i to make to rise that i look that the boulder do be safe untouched in the mouth of the cave but she call unto I that i lie backward for that she do mean gently to spoil I that once and that i have no heed to the boulder or whether there do be any monster or beast anigh in the gorge for that the boulder do be safe as i do balance it and nowhere any creature to sight in the gorge for she have lookt oft since wake to this end and truly i obeyed and lay back and do like that i should be spoil as we do say and naanus bring the cup of the water and the tablet over to I for she gat they from the scrip before i have it to my pillow in that while when i have go downward for the boulder and surely even when she bring the cup she would not have I to rise but take my head upon she knee and kist I once very dainty on the lip and i very happy to be so love and wishful no otherwise and she take a tablet and kist it and give it to I and afterward touch another to my lip and have that to be for she own and so we eat and be very glad and happy someway as child be happy and we heart all at ease and presently we eat each we second tablet in the same wise as the first and truly i do be kist more than once and afterward we drink each of the water and when we have make a end naanus tell I that i move to stand and surely i wonder and i stand up and lo i near cry out with the pain of my bruising for i be all go stiff in my sleep and as that i do be more sore than ever and this to be because i have fight again as you do know and surely have be hurt more by the four-armed man than i have know and i perceive then that naanus have suppose that i should be thus pained and have give dear think to the matter and truly she have the pot of the ointment ready if that i do be very bad that she rub I and she give I aid with mine armor and afterward ease I with my garment and surely i do be utter bruise in the body by reason of the violence of the yellow beast-man and the maid have somewhat so tender and sweet in she eye as she look upon the bruising that i do be very happy and to glow with contentment and she have I to lie and make I in comfort with the cloak so loving and grave so that i be as a child that doth be care of by he mother and she do rub I very skilful and gentle for a great hour until i be all refresh and in verity she be a lovely wise maid and as the maid minister unto I i lay alway very restful and hark to the low sound of the muttering of the fire-hole that do be in the bottom of the gorge and alway i do feel as a happy child that doth be clothe in love and guide in wisdom and presently when that the maid have end she dear care she put by the ointment and give I she hand very dainty that she mean to aid I to rise and surely when i be come again to my foot i be all ease and to have movement with no great pain and truly this make I wondrous pleased and to feel new couraged for i have be trouble that i should be so helpless in that i do be the protector of mine own and when i have try my limb and find they to be in command and ready i lookt about for my garment and lo the maid bring I my spare body-vest from the pouch and have it upon she arm to give to I but surely she deny I a moment of the vest and stand before I and have a admiring and wonder very sweet and honest because that my arm do be so great and hard with muscle and indeed i do be very strong as you have perceive for i do be alway in affection of the exercise that be teach in the upbringing of all the people of the mighty pyramid and by this explain you shall understand that i be like to be strong but indeed i owe the straightness and shaping of my body to the mother that bear I and afterward in all my life have i take pride of my body to be of health and to have strength and surely this be a matter very fit for pride and to be tell bravely and with honesty and the admiring of the maid be very sweet to I and in verity i do be to deceive if that i say otherwise and in a moment she dropt my body-vest and put out she hand to I that i take she into mine arm and i take the maid into mine arm with a great gladness and with somewhat of humbleness that i be nowise good enough to hold she for my heart be young and i love she very dear and youthful and she do lie there very quiet and happy a little and surely i do find presently that she kist the great muscle of my breast very sweet and sly where she face do be press against it and lo in a moment she come free of mine arm and give I a aid with my garment and afterward with mine armor and when that this be do she stand off from I and she lookt at I half shy and half of sweetness and naughtiness and she come then in a moment and put she hand upward to my shoulder and so stand she eyelid something down over she eye and do steal a little look up this time and that and lo in a sudden moment before i do wot she be to she knee before I and do weep and i down very swift to kneel with she and i askt not why she weep for i perceive that she do have joy and glad happiness and sweet trouble of she man and that she do be a true woman and one part of the woman do worship so that she do be strangely humble and nigh to be shy and another do love and need that she be anigh to I and a third to have a calm wisdom and all do now be a-tremble together in she heart and i know that i do be truly a hero to she though but usual to all other and my heart be wondrous proud and wondrous humble so that i be in the same moment upraised and to feel dreadly unworthy but i make no pretend to discredit myself to she but only do resolve that i win alway she dear respect and i do be natural and truthful of my manner and without foolish denial of she sweet worship for she be utter mine own and it do be a pitiful thing if that i seem otherwise than a hero unto she but of you i ask kind understanding and to call I not a thing of conceit because that i do understand for truly i know my fault even so well as you that do know all of my go and you to look backward upon the love-day and to mind how that you maid do ever to make you great in manhood with she dear belief and uplooking and so shall you conceive of all my feeling for we do be all so human in this matter and to meet on a dear natural ground as you will say and truly in a little time mine own do be steady and wipe she pretty eye and nestle to I a while very husht and to need that she be close and i to have she gentle against mine armor and to be in my heart as that i do be she father and she lover in the one man and surely to be silent and joyful that i live and presently i slipt she shoe from she little foot with my right hand the while that she do rest within my left arm and i condemn myself that i have think not more swift to this end but indeed i have think upon it while that naanus rub I and have intention thiswise but afterward forgat as you shall understand that have be with I alway and truly mine own do be hurt that i say aught to my blame and i to cease but yet to feel reproach by my heart and when i have lookt to the maid 's foot i tie on she shoe again and we gat together we gear and afterward we come down from the cave with a great care because that it do be so high up in the cliff of the gorge and afterward we make downward of the gorge and have a good care to we go and so much of speed as we could make that we come something off from the dark land of the lesser redoubt so quick as we might and in six hour we have go very well and we stopt then that we eat and drink and afterward i lookt again to the foot of the maid and i bathed they in a great rock basin of warm water that do be anigh to the place of we eating and afterward i put the ointment about they very thorough and gentle and for a good while and so she have some ease and comfort and afterward we make onward again but now we do go pretty easy for i have consider the noting of mine outward journey and so do perceive that we should be but six or seven hour off that part of the gorge where do be the slug and i be mind that we rest and sleep ere that we make through that dire and dreadful place for that we should be twelve great hour and more to go through and to have no rest or pause until that we do be safe outward again as you shall think and so do we need to be strong and well rest and this to be wise also for the foot of the maid now surely the maid do be in delight of the fire of that part of the gorge where we be come and she have beside a rest of the soul in that she have feeling that there do be no evil force to trouble we to we destruction and i bother she not yet awhile with telling of the horrid place that we should to journey through in a while as you do know and so we do go and alway with a good caution lest that some beast or creature should come upon we and alway with the fire-hole before and behind and in the air of the gorge the little whistling of steam that do spirt out in this place and that and a good warmth in many part by reason of the fire and odd while a smell of sulphur but not greatly nor to we trouble and alway the low muttering of the fire-hole and pit and the red light and the dancing of the shadow when that we do go by a fire-pit where the fire do frisk and burn lively and upon either side the grim wall of the gorge go up measureless into the night and so we be go presently pretty comfortable for six good hour since last that we eat and we make halt and eat and drink and i show the maid how that we should make a short journey that day and sleep and so be ready to the horrid journey through the dark part of the gorge where the slug do be and we make search then that we have a safe place to we slumber and surely i perceive where we do be for we come upon that same cave where i do sleep after that i be come free of the slug and that we be come no farther doth show how easy do be we present go and this you do know and there do be the spring where i wash and the fire-hole anigh and truly they be not like to be go away as you shall say yet do we exclaim very natural for the maid do be so deep in interest of the matter of my come and to be at once that no other place should serve for we rest and slumber and indeed this be a natural thing and the place so good as any save that i do wish it have be upward unto a high place of the gorge as you shall understand but yet might we block the mouth-part of the cave with boulder somewise as i do before and so to have a defense against any thing that should make to enter upon we sleep or at the least to be wake by the fall of the boulder now mine own go inward of the little cave which do be very light from the fire-pit that be to the front but before that she do go i make a swift search of the place that there should be no creep thing and truly it be sweet and free and the maid do be strangely take that she should come to the veritable place where once i do lie on mine outward way and truly i do understand and so shall many that do have these feeling about matter and afterward we go unto the hot spring that be in the hollow of the rock anigh to the fire-pit and i see that there do be no snake neither any of the rat-things anigh and so i have the maid to sit very comfortable on the side of the pool and i free she shoe and bath she foot and afterward rub they very steady with the ointment and so for a good time and alway to keep a look out upon the gorge and presently when that i have take a loving care of she pretty foot i tie the shoe again upon the maid and so back to the cave and the two of we to carry boulder accord to we strength and when we have a sufficient we build a rough and clumsy wall after that we be go into the cave and the wall rise nigh to fill the mouth of the cave and make we to be somewise in darkness but yet to feel in safety and i have a good heed to make the chink of the wall very close in the bottom so that no small creep thing should come through unto we whilst that we sleep and afterward naani set the scrip and the pouch to be for my pillow but have the bundle of she torn garment to be for she own purpose and i perceive that she have the water-powder and a pack of the tablet to she hand for we wake that she might prepare we food and mayhap to wake a little before I so that she have all ready to greet I from my sleep but indeed i say naught to show that i know for i see that this thing do give she a dear pleasure and truly it be very sweet to have she to these gentle duty that do be to she so sure and quiet a delight and mine own bid I that i lie and she put the disko upon the outward side of I to mine hand and with a dainty and fearful touch for the weapon do be very dreadful unto she thought but yet a comforting thing to abide for we defense and afterward she cover I with the cloak and kist I very sedate upon the lip and then to she own side and to come very nice and happy under the cloak and so to she rest and presently she do sleep as i perceive by she breathing and surely it do seem to my spirit that she have a utter and dear content in this arrange of we slumber so that she do be all at peace in all she being because that she do be nigh unto I that do be she own love but indeed i could not sleep for a time and surely in a while mine own do nestle unto I in she sleep so sweet and dear as a child and likewise as that it do be she right to be so anigh unto I and i to be that i should put mine arm about she but indeed i move not neither do i kiss she as i do wish for truly i should be very manly with mine own maid that do be so trustful and utter mine in she sleep and presently i be over unto slumber also and stir not for eight good hour and do wake then to the hissing of the water so that i know mine own be awake before I as she have plan and be make ready that we eat and when she see I move in the half-light she give out a little word of joy that i do be again to knowledge of she and she come over and put she arm about my neck and kist I very loving thrice upon the lip and in verity it come to I in that moment that i have be kist a while go in my dream but scarce to know it yet i perceive now that mine own have take a naughty advantaging of my slumber that she kiss I to she own pleasure yet do the maid say no word of she naughtiness and i to be likewise but to resolve that i waken mayhap on the next time and so catch she in she sweet and secret delight of I and truly this doth sound quaint but to be true and i rise and take down the half of the wall that do be across the mouth of the cave and afterward lookt out but there be no sight of any horrid thing in the gorge save that one of the rat-thing do slumber very gorged-seeming upon the side of the little fire hole and afterwards we eat and drink and the maid then to rub I as before for i be greatly stiff on my waking as you shall think but she come not into mine arm presently as i do hope but only kist my shoulder when that she have finish and so bid I to dress yet after that i be drest and have mine armor full upon I she must come unto I and she slipt she two small hand into the one of mine and so stand by I very silent and sudden she put up she lip very quiet and passionate that i should kiss she and she kist I once as it do be as that she spirit kist mine and all she being come unto I and she give I but that one kiss and afterward slipt she hand very gentle from mine and make to the gathering of we gear but truly i that love she so great know that a tumult of love do be hide in she heart and indeed she look once at I in such wise that i grow near to a true humbleness of heart because of the honor and love that do be in she eye and surely it be a very little thing to die for such a one as mine own do be and by this say shall you perceive my heart in that moment and that i do pant as it be that i do some deed of love to show my love and truly this be but a natural desiring and human and the cause proper to the uplifting of manhood and surely you shall all mind you of such feeling in the past love-day that i do pray should be never past and when we have we gear together i leave it in the cave and take mine own over unto the hot pool that be anigh to the fire-pit and she to exclaim upon the rat-thing that do be yet a-slumber upon the side of the fire-pit and i to say that the thing do be no cause for fear but rather indeed a good friend in that it be a devourer of snake as you shall mind and while that we talk i bathed the little foot of naanus and surely as i dry they upon my pocket-cloth i be take that i should kiss they and surely i kist they and they do be very shapely and dainty and all ease of travel by the care that i do take to this end and afterward i rub they with the ointment for a good while and so have they again into the shoe and the maid very quiet after that i have kist she foot that do be so dainty but yet with a sweet naughtiness in she way as my heart perceive though she do nothing neither say anything to this end and be truly very obedient and orderly to all my wish and we go back then to the cave and the maid put the pot of the ointment back into the pouch and she buckle the pouch and the scrip upon I and the disko i have upon my hip for i go nowise anywhere without it as you shall suppose and she have the little bundle of she clothing for she burden and truly i be ready that she should carry so much for we do be to act wisely and she well able to carry so small a thing and i better to have my hand alway free to the disko and to the need of the way and we go downward of the gorge at a strong speed for there do be somewise of fifteen hour good journey ere that we come out upon the far side of that place where the monster do be and this do be three hour to the upward beginning of that place and twelve hour journey then in the least that we should take to go through again into the light of the gorge below and this i do reckon from my noting of mine upward journey as you do know and i make all clear to the maid of the thing that do be before we and make not to hide the danger and horror but yet to make not overmuch of the same and she to walk close beside I very sweet and trustful and to say that she fear naught so that i should be there to have care of she but only that she do fear harm for I and yet to have confidence that i should slay all hurtful thing that should be like to trouble we and truly i do kiss she for she dear belief and love now in the middle part of the third hour the air of the gorge do begin that it be heavy and to have a seeming of fume that stang something upon the throat odd while and there be presently less of the fire-hole and soon as we do go the more downward the beginning of a great gloom and to have smoke therein that make we to feel husky and in the end of the fourth hour we be come truly far downward within the gloom and to be as that we grope in a fog of distaste and to know not how we go with any surety for oft there do be a utter darkness about we and awhile the shine of a dull-glowing fire-pit upon we sight that do show we the gloom and dread of that place and we go alway very husht and the maid to my back but i do halt now and this time and make to know how she do be and surely she whisper very brave to I through the dimness and once do slip she hand into mine and i to take off mine armored glove for a little moment that i hold she hand and give she nice assurance but in verity there be terror in mine heart that do be a terror far beyond the trouble of mine upward way and surely i be shake newly with every danger lest that i should lose mine own or she to come to any hurt and indeed you shall perceive how i do be for so should you be in a like case and in truth it doth be a utter anxiousness and suffer now when we have be two hour in the dark part of the gorge i smell of the dread and horrid stink that you do wot of and surely a great fear come upon I for i perceive that we do come among the monster or that one come anigh to we and i whisper unto the maid that she halt and we stand very husht a while and surely the stink do grow and to be very dreadful in the nostril so that i feel mine own maid to shake somewhat with the fear and disgust that this thing do make in we and presently the stink do ease somewhat from about we but whether there have go past we a monster slug i have no sure know for there do be no fire-pit anigh to that place so that there be a great darkness all about and surely there be a great slowness and wetness of the air and dismal dripping that make desolation in the silence and the feel of strange growth upon the boulder as you do know and oft a horrid slime and dankness and the stink to be everywhere so that we know a constant disgust and fear and alway the fuming of sulphur that do seem in verity to beat down upon we utter heavy and sore upon we lung and so go we onward amid the smell that do be as of dead thing and oft do we make pause and hark and have a great care as we do go by the dull fire-hole and fire-pit that we should make no showing of ourselves in the light and sudden as we do go by a great pit that burn very deep and red i reach back and catch mine own by the arm and i set she gaze unto the right side of the gorge which be beyond the fire and the maid go very still as she do see the thing that be there for in verity it be utter monstrous and do shine very wet-looking in the light of the fire and truly it move a little with the head this way and that stretch through the dark and the shadow as you shall see a slug to move and with no speed or sound and nowise seeming heedful of aught but yet do i fear that it smell we if this might be and this as you shall think to be a very natural fear and alway as i do mind it seem to go blindly somewise or to have that slow and strange move that doth make one to think of a blindness but whether it do be truly blind how shall i say only that it be a utter monstrous brute so great as the black hull of a ship and very dreadful unto we heart and we move not for a while save that i pull mine own down into the hiding of the boulder of that part and she to put she hand very anxious unto I yet not to be comfort as i do half to think but to persuade I lest that i go to some adventuring that should set I in a surer danger and this i perceive in a little moment and love she for she care but indeed i have no mind to aught save that we come clear of that place and i watch the monster through place between the boulder and surely in a little while it sway the great head very slow and quiet unto the cliff that do make that side of the gorge and the brute set unto the cliff and begin that it go upward with a strange moving of muscle that do go wavewise under the wet and horrid-gleaming hide and so in a little time it be go quiet against the cliff and the head-part do be upward in the darkness above so that it do be from we sight but the monster body do be plain for a great way and be seem clung to the cliff and to come downward out of the dark as that it do be a great black ridge of soft and dreadful life upon the face of the cliff and the tail be something less bulk and to taper and do trail outward into the gorge upon the boulder and surely the thing do seem as that it sleep but that odd while the tail do lift a little off the boulder and curl somewise and afterward come down again upon the boulder mayhap in this place and mayhap in that place as we do watch all hide and it be as that we sense and we spirit do assure we that the thing have no wotting of we but surely we fear do nigh to equal the comfort of this sweet reason and to make we think otherwise yet in a time i make that we go forward together through the space that do be among the boulder and i go creep and the maid to follow likewise and oft i do pause and make a watch upon the monster but truly it move not save as i have tell and i keep a great heed upon the maid that she follow alway close unto my foot and in the end we come safe from that place where the monster do be cling unto the great cliff in the night and we go then for two great hour without adventure save that once the maid touch I that we pause for that something go by we where we do be in a utter dark place of the gorge and no fire-hole anigh and i know that the thing do be near even as the maid toucht I and catch i the maid in the dark and thrust she under the side of a boulder and i crouch then before she with mine armor that i should protect she from any brutish thing and the disko in my hand and afterward a horrid time of wait and the stink of that part of the gorge grow very dreadful so that it do be as that we should not breathe with the horror of the stink and there go past we some horrid and utter monster that make neither sound nor anything save that there seem a strange noise that might be the breathing of a great thing but yet do be all uncertain in that the side of the gorge cast the sound this way and that in a horrid whispering of echo so that we do not know whether the sound be make nigh to we or afar upward in the eternity of the night where i do suppose the mountain to be join over the gorge in a monstrous roof in that part and presently the strange noising die in the upward height and all about we and the utter disgust of the stink go from we so that we know that the monster have go past we and do make downward through the dark gorge and mayhap then to some lone and dreadful cavern of the world as i do think and indeed as i do mind i have a sudden wonder at that time and other while as it do chance whether this way do be truly the olden way that the people of the lesser refuge do travel in the olden day and surely as i do suppose they have come some other way or the gorge to be different and less dreadful in the far-off year and this thing you shall agree with I to be a reasonable thinking and after that the monster have go a good while we go onward again and with a great caution and dread alway lest that we come upon that monster in the darkness but yet do we know by smell and by all we consciousness whether that we come nigh unto one of the monster slug then in the end of the fifth hour in the dark part of the gorge we come by the mouth of that great cavern upon we left and you to remember the same and i make pause in the darkness and have the maid very gentle by the arm that she should look with I and i whisper how that i past this place to my right upon mine upward way and how that i do think there to be a-plenty of monster cavern within the mountain that make the side of the gorge and that mayhap the slug-creature have there a home in such place or come up it might be from some utter strange deepness and mystery of the great world and the maid do bide very close unto I and silent whilst that i whisper for the terror of the place do be on she yet not to make she lack of courage but yet to put a monstrous awe upon she and a great and natural fear and i likewise as you do know and we stay there where we do be a little moment and look downward into the bowels of the monster cavern and the shine of the fire-hole beat over the cavern in the near part but there do be a utter mystery and deathly dark beyond the shine of the pit that do be within as you shall remember and in verity as we stay but to glance i perceive that there lay humped thing about the fire and some to be black-seeming and some to have a seeming of whiteness but with no sureness in the color to mine eye and there come a move in one of the humpt thing so that it do be as that a hill do wake unto a horrid life and immediately i know that the hump do be some utter monster mayhap even the great slug a-slumber about the fire-pit that do burn in that strange deeply cavern and i see that i do ill for we life that i should pause even for a little moment to such stare and immediately i whisper to mine own that we go with all we speed for indeed i know not whether that we nearness have wake that monster or whether that it have but wake by chance and truly i be utter eager that we be go from that place so swift as we might and we go on then through all of the sixth hour that we do be in the slug part of the gorge as i name it unto myself and in all that hour there do nothing harmful come anigh only as i do know presently there come a unease upon we spirit but yet to be very little at that time and we to be scarce know of it and alway as we go there do be darkness for the most and odd-while a vague murmuring of the night far above as it do seem and presently the dull glare of a fire-pit to shine out far off below we in the gorge and to seem very dim and unreal unto we by reason of the smoke and the fume that make a haze and a distaste in the gorge and presently the murmuring of the night to grow somewhat and afterward the sound of the muttering of the fire-pit to come unto we and the murmur to die unto we ear that do be hear now only the dull mutter and so we to know that the murmuring of the night do be truly the far-off muttering of the fire-hole and we eye to guide we hearing and we reason to explain and knit the sound and so we to pass by the fire-hole with a great quiet and caution and ever with watchfulness as you shall suppose and afterward again into the dark and presently again the murmur to tell that we come unto another of the fire-pit that be yet afar off in the gorge and make dim echo in the night and alway we go very watchful and in grim fear but with steadfastness and good intention to win forth out of that desolation and horror and have alway so great a speed as the darkness and the danger and the trouble of the way do allow and in this place i will make explanation why that i speak somewhile of fire-pit and otherwhile of fire-hole for the hole do be those fire that burn nigh to the brim of the hole but the pit be those place where the fire be deeply in the earth and this thing i give for you enlightenment even on a small matter so that you shall have a clear knowledge to abide with I all the way and you to agree of this for wisdom and i to be please that you so agree and here also i should tell that there do not come a mutter from all of the fire-hole and the fire-pit but mayhap from this one and mayhap not from that one accord to the way of the fire therein and this shall be plain unto you and so shall you see we go and the smoke and the bitterness of the sulphur to be all about we and oddwhile the murmuring of a far-off pit and oft the utter silence and to pass this time a lonesome fire-hole and afterward the utter dark or the half-gloom all as might chance accord to the nearness of the fire and upward in the everlasting night the grim mountain to make a roof over we as i do suppose and all this while do the unease of which i have tell make upon we so that presently mine own whisper unto I the thing that already my spirit do half to perceive that there come after we through the night some harmful thing that do be surely no great way off as i do feel within I and the maid to have a likeway belief and truly i think at once upon that brute that do wake downward in the mighty cavern where do be the great inward fire-hole as i have tell but whether this do be true knowledge that we do be chase in the dark by that thing or whether there come after we some other monster i could have no sureness but only that we do be chase and of this i have assuredness and i set the maid before I that i have myself ready to the danger that follow and we make forward again then so quick as we be abled and she go very wisely for she have good wit and have note the way of my lead and we go thus until the end of the seventh hour and surely in that time we hear the murmuring in the night which tell of a fire-hole somewise before we and soon to have the red glare plain to we eye and the noise of the murmur to die away into the nearer mutter of the fire and so presently to be anigh and we to make forward with a good speed because that we fear utterly the thing that make quiet chase of we through the night and oft i do look backward and smell the air that i know whether it do be a monster slug-beast that chase we but there do be no worseness of the smell to tell I aught and alway i do be fret in the heart that we could make no greater speed but indeed as you shall perceive we go do be but a slow thing in the dark place and even thus we have many a sore tumble and bruise and by this we be come almost unto the fire-hole and immediately i see that i know the place for there go upward beside the fire a great jaggedness of rock that i have see upon mine upward way and surely i catch the maid in a instant and bent she and she quick to obey with she body and we be both immediately hide downward among the boulder and this i do because i mind how that there do be many of the monster nigh to this same fire-hole as i do go upon mine upward way and we go forward then with a utter care but yet to keep onward because that there do be somewhat in chase of we and in verity when that we be come opposite unto the fire-hole i see that there do be seven of the monster slug against the far side of the gorge and do be all set upon they belly against the cliff and they horrid head to be hide in the upward dark and they tail to lie very great and soft-seeming in the bottom of the gorge upon the boulder and lo the maid toucht I and she draw I to look upon the near cliff of the gorge and truly there do be three of the brutish thing lay upward there and a fourth do be hump somewhat upon a great ledge that do be upward of the gorge and just to be plain to we eye and surely it be as that we do be all surround by such monster and to make the heart sink and fear to lie upon we hopefulness but indeed the maid show a good spirit and i to have fierce determine that we come free of that gorge and afterward in time unto we mighty home and we make forward again and do go creep among the rock and the boulder and so come presently past that place and have not wake the monster if that indeed they do truly sleep and i make halt a moment upon the far border of the light from the fire-hole and i lookt backward up the gorge perchance that i should see the thing that follow we but indeed there come nothing out of the dark of the upward gorge so that i know that there do be some safe space to we back which do be truly a comforting thing and here i should tell how that there be no great stinking in that place where do be so many of the slug-beast and this to puzzle I and in the end to make I think that some of those horrid thing do stench more great than other but yet i to have no certainty in this matter as you do perceive and truly this thing trouble I for i have be comfort that my nose should tell I when that the thing that make chase of we should draw nigh in the darkness and now in verity i know not what to have for assurance for the awaredness of the spirit be but a vague thing and no more in such a matter than a feeling as of a inward warning and we go onward then for a great hour and with a horrid unease upon we and thrice we do go by fire-pit in the darkness and alway i make pause upon the far side of the light that i should look backward but do have no sight of aught yet do my spirit or my fear warn I with new fear and a greater sense of nearness and the maid to confess also to this thing now we see not any of the slug for a long while neither have there be any about the three fire-hole and the air of the gorge be grow something sweet and free somewhat of the stench of dead-seeming thing but yet to be very bitter with fuming and smoke and sulphur stink and lo in the middle of the tenth hour as we do go painful and with anxiousness in a very dark place of the gorge there come unto we again the smell that tell to we that one of the monster do be anigh and surely we have both a great fear in that we have belief that it do be a sign that the thing that make chase do draw near upon we but yet do i to use my reason also and to know that the stink might be from some monster that we be come nigh to in the darkness of that place and i whisper this unto the maid and she to say very husht that it might be so but to have no belief and i to be likewise as you do see and we pusht forward at a new speed and have many bitter fall so that we do be all bruise but not to know it at that time because that we fear do be so keen and oft we make a little pause and harkt but there do be only the dismal drip of water from on high and presently the murmur of the night that tell that we draw near unto a new firepit and surely this be a great easement to we spirit in that we should have light to perceive we danger and mayhap to win free but to be in that utter dark be a thing to break the courage and to breed belief that we do be utter helpless and all wrapt in horror and despair and the stink grow ever as we make forward so that i know not whether there do be great monster beside the fire-pit that be to we front as i have tell or whether it make plain the advance of the pursuer and we only to be able to make we best speed and to be weary with hope that we rush not blind into death and alway to be chill in the back with the belief that the thing that make chase do be very close in that utter dark and to gain upon we and we know not whether to make we belief to be the telling of the spirit or the uttering of we fear and so shall you perceive we plight and we but to be able to make forward and in verity the dreadfulness of that time doth shake I now to think upon and you also if that you have get my telling to you heart so that you human sympathy doth be with I and there come presently to we ear the far mutter of the fire-pit so that very soon the murmur be lose to we in the night and only the slow mutter to be plain and the dull loom of the fire shone afar off through the night and the smoke and fuming and we to a great speed and to pant with fear but yet with a freshness of hope again to sweeten we and we come nigh to the fire-pit and lo the smell do be grow very drear and foul but there do be no slug-beast near the fire and by this we perceive that we do be truly in a utter danger in that the pursuer do be upon we and the stink to tell this to be truth and we spirit to have warn we very strong and proper and i stopt near to the fire-pit which do be great and very red-glowing and i lookt upward of the gorge into the night of the gorge that we do come from but the monster be not yet upon we to work we death and i lookt to the side of the gorge and the maid to have the same thought that do be mine that we climb the mountain that make the side of the gorge and i lookt very keen first to this side and then do run overward that i look more close upon the other and afterward back again for it do seem that we should have a greater ease upon the side that we do be and i askt the maid whether that she do be prepare and she to be very white and wearied and all besmirch with the dankness and growth upon the boulder and the hidden pool of the gorge and the drip of the water but yet do she be sound in she courage and to show that she have all belief and abide in I and she judgement likewise to be with mine in that she own reason do approve and i take the bundle of she torn clothing from she for it do be at she girdle and like to trouble she moving but she to refuse very determine in that i do be already over-burdened and i to be firm in my decide and to make she to yield the bundle the which i hookt unto the hold of the disko where it do be to mine hip and the maid to be there a little figure and white in the face and strangely anger and she anger mixt with hidden acknowledgement that i do be she master and half to be mind that she move not from where she do stand and part to be reasonable and fearful of the hidden beast and in part also to thrill in she womanhood unto the man that do be so masterful unto she and all to pass in a little moment and we to be to the gorge side and busy very eager to the climb and the maid to be first as i do heed and i to follow and have constant look to the task and to she safety and alway to be bitter anxious for we speed to be good and to be anxious the more then lest that mine own should slip for there do be a horrid wetness upon the side of the gorge as you shall have guess and horrid growth that blotch the great rock mightily and make a utter slipperiness if that they do be tread upon and we to have to come so clear of all such matter as we might and yet to be speedy for we life and likewise to lack no care and think to the setting of we hand and of we foot in place fit to the lifting of we weight and truly you shall see that we go very desperate and i to give word to the maid that she look not downward the which i be urgent upon lest that she come giddy in the heart but i as you shall think could scarce to keep from fearful peering below so that i learn speedy whether the pursuer do come yet into the light of the fire-hole beneath and presently the maid do gasp very weak and troubled with the soreness of the climb and i come higher and set mine arm about she as we do be there upon the face of the cliff and she stopt very still a little while and a ease do come to she and a assurance of safety and surely i kist she there where we do be in that upward place and she lip do tremble unto mine and she courage and strength to come back into she so that in a minute she do make once more to the climbing and we come presently to a place where a great ledge do be that jut out from the mighty cliff and be surely a huge way above the gorge bottom and the ledge slope and there be on the ledge great stone and boulder that do make lodgement there through eternity and i lookt very careful to we way and see that we do be in the path of a mighty rock that be over-nigh unto the edge of the shelf-place and do put fear upon I in that it seem that it should come down with great thundering upon we if that we but shake the place where it do be and i catch the maid very swift and gentle and shaped we path unto one side of that great rock and do presently lose my fear when that we do come safe from under it and in a minute after we be come upward upon the ledge and a very safe place it do seem and surely as that no monster should be able to come upward upon we and this i do try to make for comfort unto ourselves but that we both to know how that the great slug could lie up against the side of the gorge and surely it do be like that they should be able to come upward clear of the gorge and so to the place where we make to have safety and i have no thought to deny this thing when that it be clear to my brain but set rather that we should have some way to fight the monster if that we do be discover and i think in a moment upon the stone that do be about and the maid in the same moment cry out that we should push the big rock down upon the slug that we believe to have chase of we and indeed the rock to be a great weapon if we could but stir it as you shall think and alway as we talk very hushed we lookt downward into the deepness of the gorge unto the upward end of the fire-light but there come no thing yet unto we knowledge only that the stink do rise up to we through that great distance and the fire-pit to seem now a very small burning and to give no great light up to we and we neither to be able to see very clear of the gorge bottom in that the haze of the fume and the smoke be in the air of the gorge and make uncertainty and we to be nowise proper free of the smoke even where we do be and we watch very set with anxiousness and fearful expect of the monster and do be both yet lose of breath and the maid that she make she word something break for a little while and lo in a moment naani cry out very low and sharp that the thing do come and i to see a moving of somewhat in the same instant in the gorge that lay upon the upward side of the fire-pit and immediately i see the great and monster head of the beast come forward into the shine from the pit and the head do be of a blotched white and to have the eye upon great stalk that come from the forward part of the head and the stalk to be set downward so that the eye lookt upon the bottom part of the gorge and surely this doth be very horrid-seeming to the mind of this age but yet to have a less strangeness unto the two of we that have see many horrid sight as you do know and as the monster come forward the more into the light i see that the great and utter mighty bulk do be all of that same whiteness that do be so set over with blotching and a seeming of unhealth but truly the color be proper to a creature that do abide in so great a darkness as you shall say yet have those slug that we do see be black and shine for the most as i have tell and this to be as i saw and i not to heed here that i try unto explaining in this place else should i be never ease of my task as you do see and the monster slug come onward and as it do go it set the stalk of the eye in among the boulder as that it do search sway now this way and now that way from side to side of the gorge and alway it push the stalk of the eye inward among the boulder and so to go forward search and truly it be very dreadful to see the thing make search for we and to go so steadfast to so dread a purpose and indeed i see it not so plain as might be because of the haze of the fume and the smoke that do lie in the air of the gorge as i have tell and make something vague the sight at this time and that but yet we do both see a strange thing for when that the great white body do be come half into the light the slug-beast set out a big tongue among the boulder after that it do peer thereunder and the tongue do be very long and white and something thin-seeming and the monster lap inward in a moment a great snake from among the boulder and the tongue do hold upon the snake as that there do be surely tooth or roughness upon the tongue but yet the distance to be too great for any surety of the sight as you do know and moreover there do be the uncertainty of the haze within the air and the slug take the snake inward all as it do lash and wriggle and swallow it in a moment and in verity that snake do be a big and horrid creature else have it be not so plain to we sight but it do be as a worm unto the monster and go instant and immediately the slug-beast go again to search and the head to sway from this side unto that side of the gorge and by the wideness and ease of this sway shall you perceive the utter greatness of the beast and alway as it do come downward of the gorge it thrust the stalk of the eye inward among the boulder look all way and oft the breath do come from it as a cloud and the stink to rise up unto we very plain and a abomination and again we see the beast set the tongue in among the boulder of the gorge bottom and it lickt forth a snake that do seem so thick as a man in the body and the snake to thrash in the great white tongue and to be immediately draw inward and go utter and surely as the thought do stir in I there do be a great mercy over we in that we do not die by such a serpent in some dark and horrid place of the gorge but yet as it be like to be mayhap the snake do be only anigh to the fire-hole yet doth it be anywise a wondrous thing that we have come so free of they alway and truly to learn be to be give a new terror now the monster be come fully into the shine of the fire-pit and be upon this side and the fire to make a shine against the side of the slug so that odd while i do perceive very plain the huge wrinkling and muscling of the skin as the beast make onward and alway it do search thrust in the eye-stalk among the boulder and sudden it make pause and do begin that it bring all the mighty body together and humpt itself and bring the head-part round unto the bottom of the cliff that make this side of the gorge and it gather itself and afterward do lengthen upward against the cliff and begin to climb and lo i see that the beast do scent of we and make to come upward to destroy we and as the mighty hill of the body do come into length against the great cliff-side the beast set the eye-stalk into this cave and that as it do go and into all cranny and so lengthen upward very straight and monstrous and dreadful unto we and do be as a white and mildewed hill that have a horrid life and the stink to come up so that we do be like to lose we breath with the dreadfulness of it as you shall think and surely for a moment i look unto the rock upon the ledge and this way and that way and upward unto the everlasting darkness that do be above we and again unto the great rock that do seem to quiver upon the edge as i have tell and i be grow utter desperate in a moment for truly it do seem in that instant that there do be no power in the world that should slay so utter mighty a monster and immediately even as i do despair i have run very swift unto the great rock and the maid with I both very strained and shake with the horror of the thing that do make upward unto we so sure and intent and i set my strength unto the rock and heave but indeed the rock give not from the place where it do be so that i have a dreadful despair for i see that it do be more secure than have seem and the maid lend she strength unto mine and we heave together with sore panting and little cry to guide we endeavor and because we could not be contain in that moment and surely it seem that the great rock move and lo as we strive together to the task there come a vast and sudden grind and the rock to cease from we shoulder and to be go from we or scarce we do wot of the happen and the rock go over and rush downward upon the monster and with mighty crashing as it do grind and crush the face of the cliff-side with a quick and constant thundering and i catch the maid as she do stagger upon that dire upward edge because that she have set she strength so utter to the endeavor and the rock to be go so sudden as you do see and she to be like to follow after and she cling unto I and i to hold she very safe as i lookt down upon the fall of the rock and behold the great rock smite the monster in the humpt part of the back below of the head and do enter into the monster even as a bullet doth strike and be go instant from my sight into the vitals and there come a mighty sound of anguish from the monster and the monster do loosen from the cliff and to crumple as it do seem and sink backward and a great steam of dread breathing to go upward from the beast and a reek and it make again the strange and horrid noise of pain and the gorge to be yet full of the echo of the rock thunder and with the noise of the rock there be now mingle the horrid sound of the death-crying of the beast and the gorge to be fill with dull and dreadful echoing as that a hundred monster die in this place and that of the darkness in the gorge and all to be breed of the noise of that mildewed hill a-dying and the echo cease not for a while even after that the monster do be utter quiet for truly they come presently from far upward and downward of the gorge out of all the eternity of the night and to be as that they come backward very faint out of lonesome mile and out of the strange deepness of unknown cavern of the world and so in the end to silence and the far bottom of the gorge to be fill with a white and horrid hill very dreadful and that do yet quiver to show the slowness of death and alway a dreadful reek and stink to fill all the air even unto the height as of the grave and i stand upward in that far high place and hold the maid very strong and tender and she to have cover she ear from that dreadful cry and to be yet shake with the greatness and horror of the die of the monster and the nearness that she do come unto fall as you have see and presently she come less to tremble and do weep very easeful even as a babe doth weep and i mayhap to be not over-steady as you shall think but yet to have a great gladness set in my heart and a triumph and a utter grace of thankfulness and i hold mine own very tender and sure as i do say and she very soon to be ease of she trouble and the shock to be something go from she and she lookt up at I and slipt she arm upward about my neck and pull I downward unto she that she might kiss I and we to talk then of the go down and surely this do seem a great and dangerous task for truly we have come upward pretty easy in the excess of we fear but how we might go down with we blood cool i do be all in doubt yet before that we do aught else i lead the maid upward on to the safe part of the ledge and we sit there very quiet and weary and she do be lean against I and we eat each of we two of the tablet and i to scold and coax mine own to this end and she to obey and to be better afterward because that she have eat and we drink some of the water and do rest a time longer and presently we courage and strength be come back into we and we packt the scrip again and the maid set it fast to my back and we go then to the edge of the shelf and lookt downward this way and that and surely there do be no way to go save the way we come only that we might shape we downward climb to bring we a little below that place where the dead monster do be and i see by mine own heart and by the paleness of the maid that we should do well that we consider the thing no more but make to the task and i go immediately over the edge of the shelf upon my belly and i bade naani to follow and we begin then that we go downward and in verity we go downward for mayhap a great hour and i give help alway unto mine own as i could and she to come after I very brave and make that she hold back she fear and come downward of that cliff that do be oft like to a mighty wall and surely even as we come down i marvel how we do ever go upward even though fear do aid we but indeed i do think it doth be easier to climb safely than to come backward for this be how i have find and we make rest thrice upon ledge of the cliff and afterward come downward again and alway very slow and with exceed heed where we hand and we foot do go that we slip not suddenly to we death and once as i do see the maid be lose of all she strength and do be go to fall because that she do be all go into a sudden weakness of the head in a instant and she do be silent even in that moment the which doth be marvellous unto I and to give I a strong pride of she as you shall understand if that ever you have love and surely i come upward in a moment that little space that be between and have mine arm about mine own very swift and hold she hard and fierce against the cliff and this i do that she should feel how that she could never fall and immediately she strength and she dear courage come back into she and i kist she there against the mighty cliff and afterward she do have power again to come downward safe and presently we be come to the gorge bottom and maybe a hundred pace down the gorge from that place where do be the dead monster all sink into a ugly and horrid heap so great as a small hill and a dreadful stinking do hang in all that part of the gorge by reason of the slug and sign of disgust as you shall think and the great and mildewed body of the thing yet to settle and twitch as i do look as it do come properly unto death in all that mighty bulk and everywhere the skin of the beast do be set into great wrinkling and horrid blotching to be upon the improper whiteness thereof and truly i do be in haste that i turn the maid away from that thing and that we haste downward of the gorge and we go then for two good hour and alway i do hearten the maid and she to go very husht and trustful by I but truly i do be in a anguish of heart because that i be newly aware that there do be such great and dreadful serpent in that part of the gorge as you do also know and i be not over-feared for myself but for the maid that do have no armor to protect she dear body and because that i be so set with this trouble i take the maid presently into mine arm that i carry she and so to have she clear of aught that should lie among the boulder and in verity mine own do show a anger very surprising and determine for i say not why i should carry she -- fear to give she a greater unease -- but only that she do be weary and i very strong and willing and indeed i could not bring she to reason without i tell she which be not mine intent for she do refuse I to carry she and say that truly i have need of no add burden unto my labor and when she see that i would not be move by she reasoning she make to win upon I by she loving way but indeed i only kist she and go forward with she in mine arm and she half naughty that i do be so heedless of she wishing and somewise hurt also and so to be silent in mine arm yet mayhap to be something stir in she nature that i do be steadfast to mine intention despite that she will do be contrary and this i do believe to be truth because that afterward i do think that she lay there in mine arm only as a woman that doth be in the hand of she master that have all she love and in thiswise we go forward and in the end of the two hour that we do go there be come the end of the dark part of the gorge and we to be outward of that mighty roof of the mountain as i do think it to have be and the air to be free of the stink of the monster and the fire-hole to be very plenty and they smoking to go upward very proper so that we have no more the bitterness of they fuming in we throat and there do be a pretty good light to go by the contrast of the past hour and i set mine own again to she foot and make that she keep to my rearward so that if there do be any serpent to we path they should come first under my foot and thiswise to work no harm to I because of mine armor neither to naani mine own maid now by this time it be somewhat of nineteen great hour since we do sleep for we have be a long while make that we come safe from the slug and indeed we have come downward with a less speed than i do go through upon mine upward way as you shall mind and this to be that mine own do not have the hard strength that be in my body to the endure of great labor and stress and this surely all to be plain unto you that have be with I in all my journey and moreover there must be keep to mind the three hour that we have go ere we be come proper into the dark part of the gorge and so all to be remembered unto you and also you to mind that we do be wakeful a time ere that we set forward upon that day 's journey and we do go almost in joyous-wise because that we be come safe out of that dreadful place and surely odd while i do feel the hand of mine own naughty one to be hookt very pretty and sly into the backward part of my belt as that she do make a pretend that she drive I before she and surely this doth be a strange thing to tell upon for there do be no knowledge of the olden horse in all the eternity of that dark world but yet maybe some dear olden memory-dream do set she hand unconscious to this pretty work and in verity once i turn very sudden and have she swift into mine arm as she do pretend to drive I and she to laugh with a sweet and joyous gurgle against mine armor and i to heed that i hurt she not because i do be like a iron man that should put arm about a tender maid and we lookt alway now for a place that should be proper to we rest and to we sleep and when it do be close upon the end of the twentieth hour of that journey the maid show I a cave that be mayhap fifty good foot upward in the right side of the gorge and i lookt about and see that there do be two fire-hole anigh and a warm spring to make a basin of water that do lie between the fire and all very well set to we need as i do perceive for indeed we do be utter besmirch with the filth of the slug part of the gorge and to need that we be nice and fitly wash before that we have any comfort of we self and i bade naani to wait a little minute and i lookt well up the gorge and well down the gorge and lo there do be no thing to set I in unease and i tell mine own that she keep a sharp and steadfast watching and not to heed I and this i say because i know she do be like otherwise to look at I and be over-anxious as i go upward to the cave and indeed she to be better anyway in watch of the gorge and to cry out to I if that anything come anigh whilst that i go upward and i make upward to the cave and be come there pretty quick and truly it do be good for we purpose and fresh-seeming and dry and to have no hole that i could see for the hiding of creep thing and i call down gently to the maid that the cave do be proper and she to show she gladness and to be look upward at I instead of the way of the gorge as i set she and truly she do be a dear and human little maid and utter mine so that i do find a new joy in each small lack of wisdom and this just so much as that she have do a wondrous proper thing and truly you shall say there be some properness to she heart in that she could abide not but to watch I and i go quickly down to mine own for there be alway a unease upon I save when i do be nigh to she in chance of trouble and when i be come down to she the maid do be seem a little in thought and afterward show I how that she do be all in a pitiful disgust of the dirt and slime and the dripping of the gorge that do be on she and have make she garment utter wet and bemire so that she do feel that she very body be a repulse unto she and i see how it do be with naanus and i go to the warm pool and feel that it do be not over-hot and afterward find the deepness by the handle of the disko and this to be scarce of three foot and the water very clear to show I the bottom so that it be surely a nice and proper place to be for such a purpose as i do think and i set some of the water to my mouth use my hand and truly there do seem no hurtful chemical in the water and therefore be i ease that the maid should have the desire that i do see to be in she mind and i see that i should be helpful to mine own if that i make the arrange of thing to be in mine own hand and i go back unto the maid and tell she that the pool be very nice to be for a bath-place and that she to haste to wash herself whilst the gorge do be free of any creature or monster now i see that naanus be trouble and fear that i do be go to leave she and yet do be pause a little in she word to show I all that she do wish and surely i stoopt and kist she as she do look so wistful in she little puzzlement and immediately i remove she trouble very natural and tell that i should stand guard anigh to she the while that she bath and truly she do be at ease on the moment and mayhap something surprise to know wherefore she have be something a-lack to ask I but in truth it do be very natural and i tell she to be so quick as she might which be a needless thing to say yet to start she and she to go quietly to obey I but first to take the cloak out of the hold upon my shoulder and to unfold it and so to the pool and i to stand with my back thatward and to lean ready upon the disko and presently she do be in the water as i know and i to be she man very sure and gentle to she and sedate and truly as you shall think i do love that i be to stand guard to she in she dear maidenhood and she after that she be cheer and warm by the delight of the water to sing very low and happy to herself where she do be to my back and sudden the singing to cease and the maid scream and i to have no thought of improper modesty but turn instant to the maid and in a moment i see what do trouble she for there come a serpent out of the water and the maid to be all adrift with natural modesty and with she fear of the serpent and i be come into the pool in a moment in mine armor and do lift the maid naked and wet into mine arm and have she instant from the water and upon the side of the pool and there i wrapt the cloak about she and run very quick and kill the serpent as it do go offward among the boulder and surely it do be so thick as mine arm and to have come from some hole that do be hide in the bottom of the pool and i come back then to mine own and take she into mine arm and set the cloak well about she and she to cry and to tremble with the shock and disturbance of the thing but soon to be ease and ready to laugh with I and so she be come proper to she happiness again and i very gentle and joyous with she for truly my heart have be sick that she have come so nigh to that horrid danger and i ease the scrip from I and open it and make she to take two of the tablet and she to refuse to eat save i company she also and indeed i do be very willing for truly my belly be alway empty and she to be very glad to eat because she do be clean now and to have no more disgust of herself and afterward we drink some of the water and soon we do be finish and she to ask for she girdle that i do give she with the knife as i have surely tell and she belt the cloak very graceful about she and lookt very dear and pretty with she little bare foot and she hair very lovely upon she shoulder for she do wear alway in the gorge the lining of my head-piece and so have she hair dry and sweet and in verity i do mind now how that she do look very beautiful in she bath as i have go to succor she from the snake and i to be nicely wholesome in this remember because of my love but yet to be know that i be sweetly stir to new thing and do not know before that a maid lookt in the same moment so holy and so human and afterward in odd while i remembered but never to think overmuch because that i do feel inwardly that i should be gently wise in such thing and you to understand my heart in this if that ever you have love and surely the maid bring I from my dreaming very sensible in that she have I to stand and she be go about I very swift and natty with she pretty finger that she ease I of mine armor and afterward she bid I to strip and wash whilst that she keep watch for I of the gorge and she take the disko and lean upon it very brave and proper but yet as i do think with somewhat of roguishness within she very deep hide and scarce known unto herself and i warn she to be very wise with the great weapon for it do fit only to fight in my hand and do be like to cause harm to any that should meddle with it or make to use it save I and naanus to nod that she do hear I and to be half in fear of the thing and half to feel that it do be friendly to she and so to stand guard for I and truly to seem a very sweet and slender maid despite the bigness of the cloak and the great weapon to seem more great in she small hand and to mind I how strong i do be and surely you shall think I in conceit but truly i do be glad to be so strong and a proper thing for pride if that there be no scorn for other therein and you to agree with I in this thing or to be lack of sympathy and good human understanding now i washt I not by go down into the pool for indeed i do not wot whether there be any more snake hide there in some other hole and the way i washt be that i dipt my head-piece into the hot pool and pour the water over I and rub my body very strong with my hand and there to be surely some certain chemical in the water that aid mine effort for the water go very smooth under my hand and when i be do i washt my pocket-cloth very speedy in the pool and wring it and do then wipe my body so dry as i should and afterward i wrung the cloth again and set it about my loin and so to be as proper as i might and i do call to the maid that i be proper and she to come then and kiss I and she give back to I the disko and set I that i stand anigh to the nearer fire-hole and so to be that i should guard she and in the same time be come free of the chill of the gorge which be not great in that place and surely i do mean that i help she but she would have no help in she work that she do say to be she glad right but bid I that i to mine own work to be she dear protector as she do call I and i to lift that wilful one into mine arm a moment and to give she a very loving hug and for that time to have no fear that i harm she because that i be free of the hardness of the armor about I as you do know and surely she to feel very dear and pretty in mine arm and she kist I the once with a little passion of love and immediately to want to go from I so that i free she in a moment as be ever my way and she then to pause a small space off from I and lookt at I with a light in she eye and half to put out she arm that she be take again into mine but so to cease ere she yield to she heart and turn from I immediately to the task of the wash and she take first my body-vest and washt it very quick and clever in the pool and afterward come over by I and spread it upon the hot flat rock anigh to the fire-hole and she get then my change body-vest from the bundle of she torn garment where she do put it to be washt on opportunity even as now and mayhap to like that it should lie in she bundle with she own garment for so as i do mind the thought come to I very natural but she to say naught to lead I thus yet to be a very honest and dear maid and to have little secret way of love as i do perceive that i do not be tell of and she washt the second body-vest and set it to dry by the first and afterward do likewise with all my garment and come then to the wash of she own and lo as she spread it also to the dry there come to mine heart that the maid do have only this one rough and thick garment that do be the armour-suit as i have tell and surely it do be dreadful that she have the hardness of that strong knit and fibrous garment to be next to she dear body and i to be in comfort with the softness of my body-vest and i be all anger in a moment that she have go thiswise while that i have be gentle as it might be and i bade naanus take the second vest to she own use when it do be dry and she to look upward from where she do turn the garment upon the hot rock and to mean in the first to deny I but indeed she be quick to see that i do be truly in anger and mine anger to come because that i be hurt that this do be and because that i be shame that she have go so rough-clad the while that i have no thought to the matter and moreover because that she have know she lack and do not tell I of the thing but yet i do have a great tenderness in the backward part of mine anger because that i perceive all the unselfishness and delight of she love that do be about this little matter as you shall see if you have go alway with I but mine anger yet to be something hard because i do see that i have need to watch the maid that she put not she dear body to pain that i might come unknowing to some little pleasuring or ease as do be now as i have show and truly it do be sweetly do in love but to be somewise lack of judgement and so shall you know somewhat of the way that i do be anger and to have understanding with I but if you have not you shall think it to be naught and that the maid do need only that she be kist and to be shake a little in playfulness and warn to heed that i do be earnest and mayhap you to be somewise right and not to guess far off from the inward deepness of my heart but yet it doth be verity that i be truly angered and fit to shake mine own and in the same moment to be utter tender unto she and surely this doth be all a contradiction and the human heart to be a wayward thing whether it doth be of a man or of a woman and naanus as i do think to have love the chafe of that rough garment for love 's sake and to go very humble and loving as i lookt at she but in verity to be never go from the sweet naughtiness that do be alway in she heart and to plan even in that moment some new and secret service unto I that should be for she quiet joy and to be hide from I until that my wit should come upon it to uncover it and in verity a young man doth want that he whip he maid and kiss she and all in the one moment and indeed he to have delight in both and she obey I that time as alway when i do be earnest without more word and surely that naughty one do know how i love she and the maid washt then she tear garment that do be in the bundle and have get soil by the slime of the dark part of the gorge and she put these to dry and afterward wash mine armor and the scrip and the pouch and the cloak-hold and all such matter of we gear and so to be presently do and she be heedful then that she turn the garment upon the hot rock and afterward do attend to my bruising and when she do rest i lookt to she pretty foot and rub they very gentle and constant with the ointment and surely they do be pretty well but i to _ like _ that i should tend they and to have joy to feel they littleness within my palm and surely she do know how it do be with I for presently she take she foot inward under the cloak and i maybe to look something woeful for she put one out presently when that i do the least expect and slipt it very cosy into my hand and surely i kist she naughty toe and she then to be very sedate now presently when naanus find the garment to be proper dry she give those to I that be mine and bid I to turn my back and be drest very speedy and lo in a little time when i be nigh do she come over and stand before I and be drest again in the armour-suit and to look very slender and dainty and she lookt at I so that i put out my hand that i kiss she but she go from I very proper and bring mine armor and give I help with it and alway very grave and quiet but yet to have naughtiness underneath as i do believe and when i be full armed she take my hand and set mine arm about she waist and she lean she head against my breast and put up she lip to be kist as that she do be a child maiden yet when i kist she she do be a woman and to kiss I very dear and loving and to look at I then from under she eye-lid and sudden to make a dainty growl and to pretend that she do be a fierce thing that should be like to eat I and i to be utter fear as you shall think and to be scarce able that i kiss mine own pretty fierce one because that i do laugh so hearty and to be so take with a surprise that the maid do show this new playfulness and in the same moment to be stir and wake anew that she do be so lovely and graceful in mine arm and to make she naughty growl so pretty that i do be eager that she make it again but she to do this play only as she mood do stir she and she make then that she would go from I and i to loose she as ever and she bid I that i guard she the while that she washt the outward part of the cloak for the inward do be clean and the cloak proof to water but the outward part to be something needful of wash and surely when this be make clean it dry very quick because that the water go not into it and whilst that it dry i give mine own a aid upward unto the cave and afterward i pass up the gear and the cloak when it do be dry and so come upward also myself and bring with I a boulder that i balanced very light in the mouth of the cave so that it should fall if that anything toucht it and this plan you do know of for i use it before as i have tell and truly we do be utter wearied and the time to be something beyond three and twenty hour since last we have slumber and the maid have the scrip and the pouch set to be for my pillow and the bundle of she torn garment to be for she own and she to have I to my pillow and to tuck the cloak about I and the disko to my hand and afterward to kiss I very sedate upon the lip and then to come in under the cloak with a quiet and lovely happiness as i do know and to be go to slumber very content and sweet and i wake eight good hour after with the fizzing of the water in mine ear and lo mine own do be wake and to make ready we breakfast and i come upward upon mine elbow to see whether that the boulder do be unmoved and indeed it be not touch and mine own saw that i be come awake and she run to I very dear and glad and kist my lip very eager and loving and surely as she kist I i do feel that she have take again a naughty advantaging of my slumber and have kist I as i do sleep but truly i say no word of my thought for i do mind that i should wake sudden one time and so to catch she in this and to call she then mine own and that she do be a rogue and all as you shall know that have loved and i scold the maid a little in that she have not wake I but i say not that i would attend to the duty that she do heed to for i know that she have joy of these thing in that she do love to do aught that should be do unto I and when i scold she she to make but a little mouth at I as we do say and to put she tablet to my lip that i kiss they and she to kiss mine and so to we breakfast and when we be do we gat together we gear and go downward from the cave and begin again to journey and we go eighteen hour that day and eat and drunk at every sixth hour as ever and in the fourteenth hour i perceive that i do be like to overtravel the maid though i make alway to have a less speed than do be natural unto I and surely then i take she up into mine arm and she to refuse and to be trouble that i should so carry she for she do think that i be like to be weary by the task and i to take no heed to she pretesting but to laugh gently with she and to carry she even as a babe in mine arm and she to love that she be in mine arm if but she be able to have assuredness that i come not to weariness through she and truly it do be a dear love task and to be set unto the need of mine especial heart and i carry mine own then for four hour and in the eighteenth hour we be come to that part of the gorge where do be the ledge where i kill the spider ere i sleep as you shall mayhap to mind and here i aid the maid to climb and we have the same ledge that night to be we refuge and do sleep very happy and unharmed and alway with we spirit set to warn we if that harm do make to come nigh to we and we go then through three day of eighteen hour ' journey each and alway i do carry mine own from the twelfth unto the eighteenth hour of each journey and this to be very dear unto I and to give I a new rejoice that i do be strong and easy to carry mine own and she to lie in mine arm very content when that she perceive how that i do be so glad to go thiswise and that i have no weariness by the carry and thus i do rest she foot and wear not she dear and slender body overmuch with the vigor of my go and be able to make a very good speed and mine own this time and that to make saying of impudence unto I and to hide she naughty lip when that i should kiss they and to have quaint nestling unto I and odd while to kiss I very dainty when that i do be go thoughtful of the way and surely never do there be so dear a maid as mine own so that i do go many a mile and to be scarce that i know that i be go any way because of the stirring of my heart and the content of my spirit and oft as we do go there be great scorpion in the path and odd while they to have no heed to go from my way but to be so great as my head and very fat and lazy so that surely i kickt a good number from my path even as you shall kick a ball with the foot and three i burst in this way and truly it do be well that i have on I mine armor else have they be like to sting I very quick unto death for they be so great and likewise in this place and that there be snake but none to come anigh to I and i to choose alway the open going for i do think there to be many hide snake and lesser monster in the dark place between the great boulder and alway when the maid do walk i to go before that i see clear she way and this thing to be but a matter of wiseness as you shall think and odd while as i do carry mine own she to talk a little with I of she memory-dream of the olden day and mayhap you to think it strange that we say not overmuch on this wise but the way of we journey to have be so utter bitter as you have see and we to be more of that far age than we do be of this present age and this present life to seem but a dream of memory and we to be set then with the realness of that life and this tell indeed to be a plain thing to you understanding yet do we have a greater talk to these end when that we be come free of the gorge but yet oft there to be a odd say and a sweet memory like to a olden and forget fragrance of dream to pass between mine own and I and do you to set you sympathy of understand with I in this thing and to know how holy these thing do be and far off and to hold memory as a mist that doth shine with golden light that do make a holy pain upon the eye of the spirit even as a quiet dawn of this day doth set a pleasure of vague pain upon the heart and once as i do carry the maid i see that she weep a little very husht unto herself and i to say naught for i see that it do be a natural sorrow for she father and for the dead people of the lesser redoubt that do be leave for ever unto the desolation of eternity and so because i do be wise to leave she be she to be ease presently and to wipe she eye quiet and secret and mayhap to think that i do not perceive and then to nestle unto I and so to be the more mine own and about the middle part of the second day we come past the cave where i do sleep on the upward journey and i to tell naanus and she to look upward to the cave and to wish that she might come a moment into it only that it do be twenty good foot upward and i to desire that she run no risk of she dear life when that there do be no need and so to go onward and odd while to see strange thing a-lurk among the boulder but none to come anigh to we yet do i keep the disko very ready in my hand as you shall think and have mine eye alway to look upon every side and mine ear to be wary and to use my spirit alway to mine aid and surely as we do come lower in the gorge the maid be all a-wondered at the warmness that do grow and something disturb in the first by the new thickness as it do seem of the air and she to waste some of the water because that it do fizz up so quick even as i until that she be come use to this newness and all this to be very plain unto you and in the end of every journey we sleep eight good hour in a safe place and so to go onward again and the maid to grow very eager as i do tell she this thing and that of the country that we do come downward unto and she askt I question time and oft and much i tell she and she to think upon it with a grow wonder and desire even as a gladsome child that have never see the sea and doth be tell that it shall presently be there and this to be but to shadow the way that naanus do be for truly she do be a very live and eager maid in all thing and we to be still within the gorge and to go constant by the fire-hole and the fire-pit and to see the flame leap upward in this place and that so that the mighty wall of the gorge would show very plain in a instant and immediately to come the shadow again and afterward the leap of the flame and so do it be forever and oft the muttering of the fire-pit and oft the utter quiet and the shadow and this time and that there do be a snake to go by we and the scuttle of the monster scorpion and mayhap a move in the shadow of the great boulder that do tell I there go maybe some peculiar monster in that place so that i do be very wary and to have the disko alway ready and when the fourth day be come i show the maid in the sixth hour the ledge that do be my first sleeping place when that i be enter into the gorge now presently in the eleventh hour after that we have go five hour in a gloom there do show afar off a shine and i catch the maid and i pointed and she also to perceive that it do be surely the shine of the light of that great country that i do tell upon and immediately we do begin to run downward and with sore stumbling in this place and that but not to halt we for we do be so mad as two child for the gladsome light and we come down presently in the twelfth hour of that journey into the warm light and wonder of the country of the sea xiii homeward by the shore now we come presently out of that sad and dreary place that do go inward of the great mountain and which i have name the upward gorge and we to halt soon between the foot of the mountain beyond the mouth-part of the gorge and naani alway to look every way about she and to breathe very quick and she eye to be go bright with wonder and the see of new thing and the come of freedom from so great a dread and she turn now and do look upward into the dark of the gorge and to spy upon the great mouth thereof and to be fear then and must run a greater way downward into the lightness of the country of the sea and to come once more to pause and to look backward and with a awe and a relieved soul and so again to the wonder of the spreaded country and the great sea and do near to laugh and cry in the same moment with the amazement and gladness and great astonishment that do be upon she and she to turn constant this way and that and to be never cease of look and of deep breathing of the wide air for never in that life have she be in a broad place of light as you shall have perceive and we to feel both that there do be no more need to talk husht as we do alway in the gloom and narrow dark of the gorge and surely she to shout as a child that doth try a echo and she voice to go very pretty into the distance and to be lose afar off in that country and lo in a moment a echo to come out of the dark mountain to we back so that we lookt round very sudden but whether the echo do be truly a echo or some strangeness or some unnatural call to come downward out of the gloom and horror of the gorge we do be all unsure and indeed must run downward a while more until that we do be all breathe and to halt presently where we do feel to be utter free of the gorge and of the strangeness that do seem to we mind in that moment to lie upward in the darkness of the great mountain and surely we do take about for a flat rock to be for we use and we come presently to a place nice to we purpose that do be yet upward over the land and we climb up on to the rock and sit thereon to have we food and drink and as we eat and drink we do sit very close and happy but yet to have a wise look about anigh to we so that we be catch by no danger of the humpt man or by any other danger that might be and alway the maid do question and do stare afar over the country and to have a shine wonder and joy of the sea and to be stir in all she being so that she be pained with vague and sudden memory that do be as strange dream and all mixt with pleasure and pain and indeed she sudden to weep and to need that she be in mine arm until that she know herself once again and so to she dear natural joy and way and oft do mine own speak upon the clear wonder of the air as it do seem to she and to I it do seem likewise that have live my life also in a dark land as you do know and she to break sudden from she rapture and to set back she speech a eternity with vague word and memory so olden and englamour that they do be as moonlight that once have shone and in a moment she to be forward again into that far future time and speech and all she be to be close unto I and oft in a solemn silence of the heart and the greatness of the sea to call unto she with a olden voice and to half waken she and i with she to be thus half-wakened yet have i be not thus as i do come mine outward way but truly i do stir to the stir of the maid and all mine olden thought that do be my memory-dream to come afresh upon my spirit and so we two to sit there all shake with dreaming that do concern happening of the olden world that do lie upward in that dreadful night which make a mighty and deeply roof over that country and surely i be dumb in that i have no speech to make know to you all the troubling and stirring of we spirit that we do know in that moment and far off by mile beyond the foot of the mountain where go the shore of the sea upon we leave there be a great mist and steam and this to be that mist and steam that i do come through on mine outward way and naanus to ask concern it and i to tell she so much as i know and how that we must indeed come presently through it upon we journey and she to be in wonder of the volcano that do burn in the sea and in this place and that of the wide country and the height and grandness to exalt she and in the same time to give she a strange humbleness of she mind so that presently i do take she into mine arm for i must kiss she because that she do be so utter a sweet maiden and lovely with interest and naturalness and truly she to kiss I in turn and to make she questioning between she kissing and this to be because she do yearn for a greater know of the country but also as i do half to think because she do be sweetly impudent unto I and this to be of she joy and presently she to kiss I thrice very passionate and warm upon the mouth and immediately to take my shoulder with she small hand that do seem so pretty upon my broadness and upon the metal of the armor and she to strive thus that she shake I to a speedier answering and she all that while to be full of a dear naughtiness and to need that she be kist very hard and i to answer she but after mine own fashion which do be a word between each kiss that i give to she and she very quick and naughty to put she hand between we lip and i then to kiss the palm that do be in my way and do be very small and pretty and she when i have no thought to open she finger very quick and kiss I through between the finger and immediately to shut the finger so that i do be stopt from the same and afterward i make she to stand upon the rock and i set free she hair over she shoulder and i take then the boot from she so that she little foot do show bare and pretty and she at the first half to refuse I but afterward to stand very dear and obedient that i should have my way with she and to be a little shy and the more pretty because of she sweet blushing and surely when that i have she to my liking i stept back a little pace and lookt at she and she to look again at I very quaint and naughty and then to turn she about very grave and to make pretend that she do be a dummy figure and surely when she do be come right round and to face I again and have a very sedate look she stretch out she pretty foot all in a moment and put she pink toe sudden upon my lip and i to be so in surprise that i have not wit to do aught ere she have they back swift from I and she then to make one glad spring into mine arm and to want that she be hug and to be love very great and i to laugh all tender for i love she so utter as you do know and i to tell she as you sure likewise to have tell you maid that i want a pocket sufficient that i might have she therein alway anigh to my heart and this thing i to say to she as a man that doth love shall say it and you to know the way of it so well as i and she to laugh very mischievous and to tell I that she should truly tickle I if that i carry she thatwise aye and to pinch I too and i to have no answer save that i shake she very gentle but indeed she to kiss I very naughty on the mouth in the midst of my shake and truly what shall a man do with such a one and she then to want to be more sedate and to be set down upon the rock and she to make I to turn around so that she should come at the pouch which do be upon my back and she gat thence the comb that be a fitment and do comb she pretty hair and i to sit and talk with she and to jest with a heart that do be so light as it have not be for a great while for though i do dread the humpt man and the monstrous animal of the country of sea i have not any abide horror of aught that i have see in that country for there seem a naturalness in all thing so that i do have no loathing neither any fear of a evil force and presently when that the maid have comb she hair she to bind it upon she head but i to ask that she leave it upon she shoulder because that it do be so pretty and she to smile at I and to be happy to my pleasure now we do be truly sedate and to set we gear together and i to put the boot upon the maid and afterward we to begin again to journey downward into the country of the sea and we go at a good pace but not to bring we to any great weariness for it be mine intent that we rest for we slumber upon this side of the place where do be the steam of the boiling that be anigh to the shore of the sea as you shall mind and we at this time to be pass along the foot of the mountain unto the place of the steam and to go thiswise for six good hour and still to be a great hour off that part for we go not so fierce as do be the speed of mine outward way which be utter strong as you do mind that have go with I in all my journey and so when we have walkt six hour we do be go something beyond the eighteenth hour of that day 's journey and to be very ready to we slumber now presently we find a tall rock very hard to climb that have a flat top so great as may be twice my length everyway and this to be very good to we purpose and when we be come safe to the top we to eat and drink and presently to sleep and to have the cloak under we as do be the will of the maid for the country do be utter warm and nice so that we have no occasion for cover and surely we wake both of we when that we have sleep seven good hour and we sit upward and lookt newly each at the other and to be as that we do each see the other anew in that good light and to have a fresh joy each in the look of the other and she to come into mine arm and to kiss and to need that she be kist and truly we both to have we need but yet to be something the more hungry of the other for the have and mine own then to make we breakfast and the water to fizz very strong and surprising and we to eat and drink and to be utter happy each with the other and to talk on this thing and that and the maid to look about as we eat and she to look afar off at the wonder and the newness of the country to she knowledge but i to look near lest there be any danger that might be anigh and in a while mine own to draw my gaze to the mountain that the gorge come through and in verity now that i do look in ease i to see with she how that they do be truly monstrous even as a monstrous wall that do go upward for ever until that they be go out of the light of that country into the dark night of the deathly upper world that do be lose a eternity and i to mind that i have some vague thought thiswise on the outward way but now i to have ease and the maid to speak with and so to perceive odd matter the more and i to tell you this little thing so that you shall perceive the way that restfulness do be upon I by compare with the outward go and truly we have no great speed with we talk and with we eating but in the end do make somewhat to hurry because that we do be conscious that we lean to slackness and indeed we come down then pretty speedy from the rock where we do sleep and have forward to we way at a good pace and when we have go a while we to begin to hear the far hissing of the steam and the noise of the upward bursting of water that do boil and the sound to be very strange but i to have hear it before as you do know so that it to trouble I the less than the maid and i to assure she and she to come nigh to I and thiswise we to enter presently into the steam and we go then for more than three hour and i have the maid to my back that i should be the first and this i do that she have no danger to walk into a boil pool in the mazingness of the steam which be everywhere and i to be something guide in my path by the shore of the sea which do be unto we left alway only that we could see neither the sea nor otherwise except that we go so close that we near into the water and truly the sea to seem to boil in part and there to be hot pool in all place so that who should say with ease whether we do go by one of the great hot pool or by the true sea and this we constant puzzle shall be likewise to you and you to perceive how that we do go utter wary and about we from every part there do come the strange bursting and shrieking and whistling of the boil of the water break upward from the deep world and odd while the sound to be as of great monster and the earth to shake under we and other-while there to be a hush and only the steam about we and somewhere in the distance and uncertainness a low piping of some steam cranny very strange and lonesome-sounding and when it do be somewhere nigh upon the fourth hour we come out of the thick steam and the piping and the roaring to be to we rearward and soon the steam to be go thin as but a mist and the noise to be very far-seeming and presently we to be come clear out into the air of that country and the maid now to perceive the tree which do be in great forest unto we right hand while that the shore of the sea do go alway upon we left and she to be utter in wonder of the tree and to need that she pluck branch and smell of they and look at each leaf and so to be all stir for never in that life do she to have see such a matter as those great tree do be but yet to be all stir by vague memory that do seem no more than dream and you to think but a moment and to perceive how the thing do be with she and you to have be likewise stir if that you do be so strangely wake in a corner part of the heart though but a little matter to wake you now when the sixth hour do be full come we make a halt in a wise place and have there we tablet and the water and afterward the maid bid I that i take she unto a warm pool that do be near by and to ask that i turn from she but yet to be anigh for she protector as i do be ever and so she to wash and to make herself happy with a sweet cleanness that do be proper to she and afterward when she do be do she to act watch whilst i to mine and to help I in all matter that she be able and truly i to be happy indeed that she do so have delight to attend upon I and to treat I mother-wise yet truly with she maid-heart not all hide as you have perceive this time and that and surely thus do we go alway in these matter and oft that i have not space to have tell and oft that you shall remember if that i do be too full of other happening to give heed to tell upon and afterward we to we journey again and to talk upon this thing and that thing and i to be watchful as we talk and to tell the maid that she keep she eye wary but yet not to be of unease and when we do go thiswise for seven good hour we be come nigh oppose to the bright-burning fire-hill that do be offward in the sea and have make I a warm light in that time when i do sleep in the tree as you do remember and truly as i shall here mind you we do be past seven hour come to this place from the part where the steam do be yet have i go that space upon the outward way at a speed that be greater but truly i might not set so great a pace to the maid save mayhap odd while and this thing i beg that you have alway in you mind and so to understand why that we do be oft long upon this part of the journey and that by compare with mine outward go and in verity i have set off we hour for food because that i see we do come nigh to the place where the tree do be and i to know that the maid should like to eat and drink anigh to that place and to know that i do sleep there and surely i take she to the tree and when that i tell she she to beg I that i indulge she and that we go upward to that branch where i do sleep and there to eat we tablet and i to be willing and to enter into she wish for indeed there be no danger in the climb and i to go alway below she so that i could be surety for she safeness and we come up to the great branch and she to make how we should sit and i to have to show just where i do lie and she to look very close and to see that my weight have surely mark the hardness of the armor upon the bark and she then to be upon that branch alone as she do eat and drink and to look outward at the light from the fire-hill and to be very husht and to think and i not to disturb she with speech and when she do be do she gat from the branch and kist the place where i do lie and lo in a moment a thought come into she and she draw she knife and cut out a piece of the bark and put it into she breast to be for a keepsake and so to seem somewise contented and truly i tell she about the great beast when we be come down again to the earth and she to cry out and to show I that there do be yet the mark where the belly of the monstrous beast do brush upon the earth as it run and moreover the broken place of the foot-mark and she by this to see how great a beast it do be but yet do it be a little thing beside the slug only that it do be a thing of horn and hardness of skin as you have perceive and truly i do mind how that the observing of the maid do bring very keen to I how that there have past but seventeen day since that i do go onward from this place and this to seem very strange and scarce credible unto I for i have think it somewise as a great time and truly this to be because it be so mark by stress of the mind and great happening and you to agree in this thing but yet also we shall truly mind that those time that i have call day do hold oft the hour of two day and mayhap three as you do remember now we go onward then to we journey and i to make to carry the maid as ever after that she have walk twelve hour though she do walk thirteen hour this time as you have see and she to say that she go now upon she own foot through the next six hour and so to ease I from the labor that do be needful to carry she but i to know how that she do be like to be all go of she strength thiswise in but a day or two and we to make the better speed if that i keep to my way and to have she to walk twelve hour of every journey and afterward to come into mine arm for truly she do be breed less hardy than i as you shall think from all that i have tell concern the people of the lesser pyramid and moreover she be yet something weaken as i do think by the dreadful month of she lonesomeness and escaping before that i be come to succor she and truly as i do carry she the maid do make remark of she wonderment concern I in that i do be so hard of my body and set in the determination of my mind and in verity i do be exceed strong and of great hardness of body and mayhap my will do be somewhat this way also else do i think i have never bear to come unto mine own through so much desolation and i to smile very happy upon she for i do love that i be so strong and very truly in delight that mine own maid do take gladness in this thing and you to mind how you do be also in the love-day and so to have nice understanding of my naturalness and human pride and surely the maid do nestle unto I as she do talk even somewise as a child shall come nigh to the mother but yet also as a maid doth love to be nigh unto she man if that she doth truly love and i to lift she more nigh to my lip but she to refuse to kiss I and to be a sweet impertinence that do lie in mine arm yet when i do make to lower she again to the way that have she easy to carry she to slip she pretty face very snug under my chin and to kiss I there after she own fashion and afterward to be willing that she be as usual into mine arm now as i set the maid again comfortable it seem to I that she be something tender and sudden it come to I that mayhap the armor to be very hard and painful unto she and i to ask this thing of she in a moment and she to see that i would not be put off and so to tell I and truly i be utter anger with myself and somewise also with she in that she do not waken mine unthinkingness to this thing and i set she instant to the earth and make she to bare she shoulder to I and truly they do be much bruise where that she have lie so oft in mine arm against the hardness of mine armor and i to be so angered that i near shake she and she to see how i do be and that she do be nigh to be shake because that i be grow so angry that she should let herself come to this foolish hurt that yet i do know be very dear unto she secret heart and in truth she put up she lip to I very sudden and with a strange naughtiness that she have she own way with I to tempt I from mine anger that yet she do half to like and in verity i near slapt she then upon she pretty shoulder but that she cease from she tempting of I and instead she turn she shoulder to I even as a child that i button she garment for she and surely when i have button she garment she come round unto I and close she hand so that it do be a little fist even as i do love she to do because that it be so small beside my great hand and she slipt she shut hand into mine and surely i let it stay within very quiet and make not to close upon it as i do wont and the maid do move she hand around in mine that she make I to take notice upon she and to grasp she little fist yet i do be very stern for i be truly angered and neither do i put she hand from mine nor make to hold it but only to let it bide yet truly i to be something stir in the heart-part by she pretty way and in a little while she take she hand from out of mine and do have daring to be cold unto I and mine anger then to be quaintly renew and to think that she do well need to be whipt and she make a naughty and foolish impudence upon that which i say to she so that presently i do say that she do need such as should make she to heed she manners but yet as you shall conceive i to know inwardly all that time how that even this true naughtiness do not stir I to proper anger but more that it make I masterful and to lack not that i make she to know truly that i do be she master and in the same time to be strangely touch in a very deep and secret place of my heart and truly love doth have strange acting upon the heart and the maid to ask I in a very saucy fashion that do be intentioned to anger I what i do mean that she to need and truly i say that she do go the way to earn that she be flog like any boy and i to mean actual all that i do say which doth something amaze I now but as i do know i yet to be constant stir inwardly by she beloved quaintness that do be alway so dainty even when that she do mean she naughtiness to be truly to anger I and lo when i tell the maid this thing that she do well go to earn a sharp reproof she turn in a quick instant and come close to I all tender and small and to need to be nigh to I and she slipt both she closed hand into the one of mine and truly they do be little fist and because i could be no more stern with mine own i put mine arm about she and she do nestle to I so that all my be do want to be a shield about she and she to hark very quiet and humble to my counselling and in the end do be so strangely husht that i lookt down to where she pretty face do be hide against mine armor as she do love to do when that i do be those odd while a little stern with she and i hold she face away from mine armor and surely she do be smile very quiet and naughty so that i perceive that she do be good only for that time and do be like to show again this wrongful and impudent spirit yet i not then to be in trouble of the future but to hope only that i do wisely if that she show again this waywardness and truly i to perceive now that i do be very young but anywise as you do know i to act alway from the natural tell of my heart and i shake naanus a little for this naughty spirit which do not be go from she for i perceive that my manhood have but stir the woman in she to that strange quick humbleness that have seem to be a quenching of she wayward unwisdom and truly it have not be still but only sunken for a little moment in the uprising of she dear nature which have respond unto I and the maid to look at I from under she lid as i do shake she with gentleness and i to know that mine own do be a wondrous maiden full of all life and spirit and to be hold wisely and to be loose wisely all as do be for the best to bring out the uttermost of she goodness which do be in all she being and to be very lovely and to make I feel as that i do be a giant that hold a white flower very tender but i to feel also that i do be she master and this mayhap you to understand if that you look into you heart and by all my tell you to know that i do be very dainty with mine own maid that do be all of daintiness but yet i to be masterful as do be my nature and a very proper way it do be with the maid so that she do be alway reasonable in the main and this to come out of she love which do have pleasure to know that i do be master unto she all in the same while that she do fight to show that i do be otherwise and truly and in part by this same show you shall perceive that she naughtiness to come likewise from she love and the way that my nature do work upon she now i to shake the maid very gentle as i have say and with much that do be of play but in the same wise there to be also somewhat of tender reproof and surely that naughty maid to spring very light upon she toe and have kist I sudden and dainty upon the mouth before that i do wot and i to put mine arm about she and to give she a little hug and immediately then to matter that do be practical for i be eager to have come across that stony part of the journey that do be before we as you do know before that we look for a place for we slumber and this eagerness of haste to be because of the great bird thing which i have see to go bound over that waste when that i be upon mine outward way and surely after that i have think a little moment i bid the maid that she dress in she torn garment so that these should be over the top of the armour-suit and thiswise to make a soft thickness upon the top of the armour-suit that should act for a cushion between mine armor and she dear body but indeed the maid would nowise to do this thing and i not to make she because that my heart perceive how it do be with she and she reason to be someways mixt as doth be proper in all human and the more so when that it doth be a maid that have reason as you to know if that you have ever hold such dear perverseness in you arm and she as i could know to be strangely in love that she gentle body be bruise by the hardness of mine armor and if this might not be she to be not wishful that she wear she torn clothing upon she neat suit and so to seem careless and to lack to be dainty in mine eye for indeed she do be alway to wash herself and to make tidiness and she to have a way now that she do set the armour-suit upon she that have it to seem different and she to have set a little sprig from the tree upon she breast and in she girdle and so to seem the more of a maid and surely a man doth know and love these thing but not alway to have full know how that they be do and indeed you to be likewise with I in this thing and we all to think we know but somewise to be just a-lack when that it doth come to the proof and in verity the maid to find a way that she be ease of the hardness of the armor and i to have come to the same thing in the same moment but truly i do think she have be able to think upon it a long while if that she have be so desire and truly this be but that i fold the cloak very thick across mine arm and breast and to take she then into the little nest that do be prepare and surely now that the maid might no more have she secret wish that she lie close against mine armor she to be helpful and to have the cloak fold so in a very quick while and so to be into mine arm again and we to be once more upon the journey and she to nestle to I as that she do hunger to be nigh to I and she to talk with I odd while and odd while to be silent and once i to think that she weep a little and to know that she do be like to think upon she father and she own people but she to have she face turn to I so that i could but guess upon this thing and she very soon to be husht again of this sorrow and to lie content in mine arm and once when that i have carry she for three hour she to ask I that i kiss she and truly i do kiss she very gentle and with reverence because that my heart do understand the holiness that do be in she heart in that moment and surely as i kist she she to kiss I very tender and i to know that some olden memory do be like to stir in she and in a moment she to take she lip from mine where she have let they to nestle very light and do whisper mine olden love-name and i then to look at she and she eye to shine as the olden star that do shine in the olden summer and i to be too shake even that i kiss she but she to put she arm about my neck and to look steadfast into mine eye and immediately after that she have lookt awhile and i to have cease from walk she to put she hand upon each side of my face within the metal of mine head-gear where the guard do come down at the side and she to kiss I very sober upon the lip but yet to mean utter by that kiss and i not to return the kiss for i see that it do not be she need now in the beginning of the fourth hour as i do go with the maid i to see afar off one of the half-bird monster that i do see before upon this place where there do be naught save great stone and boulder for a great way that do be many mile and truly i to hide very swift with the maid where two great boulder do come together and surely the bird-creature to go past at no great way and to go with a great bound that do be half of flight and half of leap as that it do be too weighty in the body to make to fly proper and indeed i to have a sudden memory how that there do be a picture in some book that i do read in the mighty pyramid where it do show such a bird-thing as this and to make remark in the book that these thing have be see no more in the night land for a score thousand of year or more and to be extinct as we do say but indeed now i do think that they do be come downward to that warm country a great while go and so to have new life and to breed through a great age and this way to have set a pattern unto the human and in verity it might be that in some age that do be far after that time the human to find some way to journey from the pyramid and to build a new refuge in that deep country and mayhap the human thiswise to have a new space of life after that all the night land do be dead and lose in the bitter frost of eternity but this indeed to be no more than a odd thought for how might any great multitude pass the monster and i to ask that you take it for nothing of fact but only as of my supposition and thiswise to come back again to happening now when the bird-thing do be go a long way off i to go forward again with mine own and to have a new care and to look very swift and frequent everyway and truly it do be as that the creature do inhabit that part of the country for in a hour after that i to see a good score and i to free the disko from my hip and to have it ready in mine arm beside the maid and so to journey and many time i to have to hide with mine own and to crouch low among the rock and the boulder and this way to escape free of all for a great while yet when that the fifth hour do be nigh go i hear a noise sudden to my back as we do go over a clear space and in verity there do be one of the monster that come upward over certain rock that be to my rearward and surely it to have be stay hide there or rest and to have hear we or to have smell we but anywise then to have knowledge of we and to come with low and brutish heavy bounding very lumbersome after we and i lookt everyway in a moment but there be nowhere any shelter anigh and the maid to leap sudden from mine arm that i be free with the disko and i to look swift to she and to see that she have she knife ready in she hand that she might chance to aid I but surely i might not fight in ease of mind if that mine own do be needless in danger and i catch she very quick by the waist and set she upon the ground between my foot and she to make half to refuse but i to have no time for explain and to be sharp that i have she safe so that i give she a little shake that do sudden to make she feel the strength in I and she then to be instant quiet in my hand and to let I that i set she upon she face and to cast the thick cloak above she and in a moment to be stand over she and to set down the visor of mine head-gear lest that the bird-monster strike I in the face and surely the bird-thing do be scarce a hundred good pace off and to make two lumber and monstrous bound and to come at I yet truly it make sudden a pause because that the disko do roar and send out fire as i make it to spin but in a instant the great thing to come in at I upon the left side and to strike I very hard with the bill that do be so long as mine arm and have surely go through my body if that i have be naked and the bill of the monster ring upon mine armor and it smite I twice thiswise so that i staggered very sick and shake but in a moment as it make to draw off that it should come the more hard upon I i swing the disko very sure and quick and i smote the bird-thing above the place where the great seeming-leathern wing do join upon the right side as it should be the shoulder of the bird-monster and in verity the monster give out a mighty squarking and go backward this way and that and beat all about upon the stone and do strike with the great bill at the place where it do be hurt and i heed that i end it swiftly and i run in upon it and the creature to strike at I with the great bill very savage but i jumpt speedy to this side and again to that and so in a moment to have chance to come in surely and truly i split the skull of the bird-thing so that it die very quick and be go from pain and the bird-creature lay all spread upon the stone and the rock of that place and surely it do be as that it be leathern and make somewise as a bat doth be of this age in that it do have no feather and truly it lookt mighty where it do be spread and indeed the body to be full so big as the body of a young horse and the bill to be very deadly and sharp and cumbrous as you to have guess and i to be all and utter thankful that it do be there dead in the stead of mine own body and the thing yet to twitch and stir a little as the life do go from it and surely i be back then very speedy to the maid and she to be kneel upward to watch I and i take she into mine arm and lookt well about and make then forward again and about the middle part of the sixth hour of cross that rocky land i see that we do draw near unto the shallow river that you shall mind i come over after that i have do with the olden fly ship and in all that time since the bird-monster to come after we i have see but two more and they a great way off so that i guess that i be come beyond that part where they do go very frequent and i to wade over the river and to carry mine own upon one arm the while that i do sound my way with the staff of the disko and truly i come across very easy save that i do have to go around somewhat where that the river do seem to have a deep place and when that we have crost the river it do be full one and twenty hour since that we slumber as you shall know if that you but count a little for you do mind that we spend a certain time within the tree as i have tell and this not to have be proper count into the time of we journey and surely the maid to have be very quiet since that i do show my strength a little to she when that i make she to lie that she be safe from the bill of the bird-monster but she not to be anywise in anger upon I but only as i do think that the woman in she do be something fresh wake unto I and she to be very content that she be quiet in mine arm now the place that we be come to be much spread with boulder but yet to have the beginning again of the forest as you to remember for i to have make some small remark of the land in this part upon mine outward way and we lookt about for a fire-hole that i should dry my lower garment and truly we have not past many in a great while but we to be in fortune that we come soon upon a little fire-hill that do be no more than so high as a man and to have the rock all hot about so that this do be a good place to we purpose and i kist the maid and set she down out of mine arm and when that i have lookt well about and see that there do be naught to we sight to give we to fear the maid to help I with mine armor and afterward with my garment and to ease I all way that she could think of with helpfulness and she set the garment of my lower part to dry and whilst that they do be dry she to make ready the water and the tablet and to have I to sit beside she in my body-vest and gear and we to eat and drink very comfortable in the warm hollow that be something anigh to the small fire-hill now truly i do be very hungry that time and indeed to be alway so for the tablet do be very unfilling to the belly as you do well know from my telling and when that i do be finish i see that the maid lookt at I somewise oddway and sudden she to come into laughter and askt I whether that i do be very empty and in the same moment there to be a wondrous dear look within she eye so that i perceive that there go a mother-note under she impudence and she to yearn as i could know that she have some way to feed I but truly there do be no way for we think not to make to slay aught for we purpose and we do be fear that we eat any root or plant lest that we be ill and this to seem strange to my spirit of this we age but to be natural unto that so that i do think i do be so long breed from the primal obtain of food that i do be all lose to that which should seem natural unto the people of this early age of the world though we truly to think that the world doth even now be old and this to have seem a true thing unto every age that ever do live now beside that we do lack somewise to think serious that we slay something to eat in that the tablet do actually suffice to we strength i to believe that there do be some other reason that i do forget and mayhap never to have think plain upon but which to be set within I as a instinct as we do say and this to mean if that i try to set it in other word that the tablet do keep the body and the spirit in such condition that the force of evil do have the less power to act upon we yet have i no remember that i be teach in the preparation that i eat naught save the tablet and this mayhap never to have be set upon I but to have be as a thing that doth never need to have be tell even as you shall not tell a grown man in this age that he shall refrain from dung and eat only wholesome matter and truly i to hope that i have make this thing somewise clear unto you for indeed it doth be something hard to set out for every age have the subtlety peculiar to that age and these to be hard to the understanding of other age but yet to seem plain and utter natural even without thought unto the people of the age and surely all this to be plain to you and to be over-plain for in verity i tell to you and over-tell until that i should be weary and mayhap you to be the more so and indeed i not to blame you but only to hope that you understanding which doth mean also in general you heart doth be with I all along my way and indeed this my tale to be not easy tell and in verity i to be back now unto the maid a-laugh upon I and in the same moment deeply loving and a-lack that she could not feed I and i to laugh with she and to have understanding with she as you to know and indeed i to have a heart that doth be make someway natural unto understanding so that even though i be dead when you read this my tale you to feel that we be friend and to know that could i meet with you in pitiful trouble i to have understanding and love to you if that you be not utter brutish and even-so i to be sorrowful that you should be brutish and to have understanding in that i to know that by developement you to become wise unto sweetness and charity and in love with all dear thing and kind pity of the rest and thiswise you to be in human sympathy with I because that you do feel that i be honest with you and somewise even now to you elbow as you read and this to be writ now and you mayhap not to be bear a great while yet but in the end to read and to have understanding with I and to know how i do love mine own and so we to go forward again the closer in that we do be the more knit in dear human sympathy and surely the maid kist I very nice on the lip and do promise again how that she should make I a great meal when that we do come to we mighty home and indeed as she to say she to join with I and we both to be naughty glutton for that once and surely i laugh gently at the maid because that she should be so dainty a glutton but for my part i to feel that i could eat a horse as we do say in this age and by that we have eat and drunk and talk awhile and lookt oft about so that we know that no brutish thing come near to we hurt the maid to tell I that my garment do be dry and she then to give I aid that i dress very quick and afterward she to help I with mine armor the which she do wipe after that we have eat and drunk and she to have have joy that she do this thing and all thing for I and to have use a part of she torn garment to this end and so truly i to be clothe and arm very speedy and to feel ease and the more sure in my mind for in verity i be alway in unease when that i do not be ready that i be able to meet any horrid brute that should be like to come upon we now when that i do be into mine armor again the maid to set the scrip and the pouch upon I and all the while i scarce to be loose of the disko as ever and we then to we way which do be that we find a place proper to we slumber and when that we do be go all-ways and no cave proper to we sight we find a great tree that do be set off alone and have a plenty of branch but none that do be near to the bottom-part and surely i give the maid a lift and hold she up so far as mine arm do go so that she might stand upon the palm of my hand and be steady against the trunk of the tree and she thiswise to have a hold upon a branch and so to go upward and truly when that she be safe i loose one of the strap from the pouch and the scrip and i cast this up to the maid and she set it strong about the branch and when i have catch the downward end i go upward very easy and afterward take loose the strap and this way we do be something safe as you shall see and we climb upward then and so come to a part of the tree where the branch do be very thick together and we make here a place for we slumber and the maid set the cloak over the branch that do be so close and afterward we lay down but first i set the strap about she waist and thence to a branch and she to refuse sleep until that i be likewise so that we do be both very safe from any fall and she kist I and we then to we slumber and very weary for it do be two and twenty hour by this since that we have sleep now we have eight hour in which we sleep utter and we both to awake as it do seem in the same moment but truly i to think that mine own do be wakeful before that time for indeed as she put she arm very dainty about my neck that she kiss I i do have a quick and sudden knowledge that i have be kist oft in my sleep and this to have be but a little while go and surely it do seem to I that mine own do have a sweet and contented mischief inward of she eye but yet she to be very sedate outward and to kiss I loving and dear and then we to we breakfast upon the cloak and afterward i climb to the topmost branch of the tree and lookt well over the country all about but there be no brutish thing to my sight in any place neither near nor far and i come down then to the maid and tell she how that there be quietness of life all about and we have we gear together and go downward to the earth and i to help mine own and this way she to be safe now as we go forward upon we journey i perceive that the maid have a wayward air and truly i think that she do have she heart all set toward naughtiness and mischief and in the same moment that i be in this belief i do know in mine understanding that this do spring from the workings of my nature upon the nature of mine own maiden and naanus to walk in the first beside I and to have no word for I because that she do be so fill with the stirring of she naughtiness that do be in the same moment very sweet unto I and yet to waken all that do be masterful within I and she to be that she do know and to delight in she secret heart that she waken that which do be masterful in I but yet in the same moment to be strong determine that she be not master by I and surely this to seem contrarywise in the word but to be clear to the heart if indeed you have ever be love by a dear maid of a high spirit and above all this the maid do be fill with a love for I that do beat and dance in all she being and this in truth to overweigh all but yet from this same thing she dainty naughtiness to be bear because as i do say my manhood to stir all she nature up-wise in sweet trouble that do be half of rebellion and half that she do ache that she be close unto I in mine arm and in verity you to be with I in all these thing if that you have have the love-days beside a dear and dainty maid of a high and pure and natural spirit so that if you be old these day even but the light merriment of a pass maiden to bring a pain of wondering and golden memory upon you heart and presently i see that mine own put a little space between we as the naughtiness do work in she as my heart to know and she to be offward from I a little and she still to have no speech with I but in a little to begin that she sing in a low voice and to have she pretty body very upright and lithesome and to go forward with a wondrous dainty swing so that my heart tell I that she do all be stir with small thrilling of defiance unto I and with thrilling of love and she to have the triumph of she maidenhood and of she womanhood as it be both to contend in she and to thrill upon she tongue and to show out the lilting and pretty warfare of she spirit that do go dancing and dearly naughty in she breast and surely i go very lift in my heart and astir for it do be wondrous to I that this lovely maid do be so utter mine and to see but the way that she set she foot to the earth and the way that she do lift they sure and dainty and the way that she body do be poise and the way of she head and the way of she naughtiness and the sweetness and the love that do be wrapt in with all do make I want that i have she in mine arm but yet i not to do this because that in the same time that she do so stir I to love and admiring she to set somewhat else in I at variance so that i do half to feel stern with she for i perceive that she have that naughtiness then within she that she do be like to have a real intent of impertinence unto I so that she should be naughtily outrageous and to have no heed to my advising neither unto my desire unless that i set my hand upon she to _ make _ she to obey and truly you that have have dear maid shall follow mine explaining but unto other i know not whether they shall understand until they too have be possess of one that shall set all they heart adrift even as this one that do be mine own and sudden i to know that naanus do change from she low singing unto a olden air that have surely not be hear in all that eternity and in verity for a little while i not to know why that it do so shake all my heart nor what it do be nor whether that i have truly hear it before or only to think so and surely it do be as that the silence of the olden moonlit world do steal all about I and sudden i to know that the maid do sing a olden love-song of the olden world and to go halt a little as she sing because that the word do steal something odd-wise through the far veil of she memory even as a song doth come backward out of dream and i to feel all my blood to seem to tremble in my vein and my throat to be trouble as with vague sob that do be the ghost of forget tear and the dim sorrow that have come so swift and strange upon I to be likewise steep in golden mist of the love that i once do love and the glamour to be come all fresh upon I and i to know in that moment how much we do forget even when that we do believe that we have all memory and all sorrow within we heart and i lookt unto the maid something dimly because of the way that i do be and i perceive in a moment that mine own do weep as she walk but the less with pain than with the strange anguish of memory that doth have in it tenderness and sorrow and love and all that have be and all that do never be and all to make a vale unto the spirit where doth be both a dim greyness and a warm and everlasting light and a utter speechlessness and the low and far music of forget song that do come downward over the shadowy mountain that do be build of year and forgetfulness and yet make to be see with the light of that we memory which doth cast so many husht shadow and surely as i do say the maid do weep as she go but not to be cast down but rather that she hold she head upwise as that she do walk in a glory and the song to come oft-broke and oddly and to set she voice to little human quivering as she memory do shake she sweet spirit unto tear afresh and she to walk with she pretty head uphold and as that she do go in a triumph and the tear to come down strangely upon she face and all she soul to be there pure and wondrous and in the same time both troubled and glad and this thing to be very dear and amazing and she to be as that she not to know then that she sing but as that she do be lose in she thought as we do say and this to have come sudden upon she out of all she upliftedness of spirit that have be like to make she very open unto all subtile and subtle power of thought and inward stirring as you shall think and again the song to come full-remembered and fresh as that this eternity do be but the yesterday of that moment and mine own to be all in a sweet madness with those half-dreamed memory and the wonder and pain of all that no man have ever say and that shall be never say and of the utter lose year and all that have be lose and all forget greatness and splendor and the dreadfulness of parting and the loveliness of beautiful thing that do be hide in the abyss of the year and it do be sudden to my quicken fancy that there do be low echo all about we of the voice of dear beautiful one that have die for so do memory set a strange and lovely mystery about my spirit in that moment that i do be all shake so much as mine own and i to be as that i draw my breath anigh to tear and do be there with naanus amid the quiet spareness of the tree and the rock of that part of the land but yet do be to see half dimly that i stand within a light even as the light that doth be the wonder of olden sunset and i to be in the same time both _ that _ man and _ this _ man that now doth write and to have beside my spirit but one maid that i do lack to know whether i say to she naanus or mirdath for though the two that have be mine own do be different-seeming to the eye there to be but the spirit of one maid beside I in that moment and surely i do be there all shake unto the see of vision as it do seem so that the land about I to have grow half as that it do lack that it be real unto my sight because that i lookt inward unto land that do be of memory and lo in a moment this to go and i to be in that country of the sea and to look newly unto naanus and she to go as i have tell and there to be the lonesome tree and the rock in all part for a great way about and sudden as i lookt at mine own she to come round unto I and she hold out she arm and do gaze at I with such a love as that she be transfigure and to need strangely that she be in mine arm and surely i to a holy need that i have she unto I because that after all there do be no wonder so great as that wonder that when all do be say i do have mine own after that all eternity have nigh past and in verity we run each to the other and do be silent because that there be no speech of word by which we could say aught of all that do be in we heart and truly you to be with I in understand for you too mayhap to have suffer thiswise of dumbness even if that it have not be so great but yet to make you to know and presently we grow quiet in the spirit and mine own to come back again to she joyousness and to go beside by I as we make forward and presently naanus to begin that she look at I with dear impudence again that do be very sweet unto I but yet to be like to lead unto defying and truly by these thing shall you know the spirit of mine own maid and there to be none to I that ever do be like she but indeed you to think thatwise of the maid that you do love and all the world to be think each these thought of one dear maiden that doth be the one maid in all the round world and this to be the lovely niceness of the human heart and i not to have any grumble thereat but yet surely you shall say that this maid that do be mine own do be very dear and lovely and in verity i to show my human heart in this thing for you likewise to want that i think you maid to have be just so dear and the more so and indeed we ever to be go these way and to have good comradeship of understanding because that we have all loved and suffer joy and have utter belief in a dear one and surely a defyingness to come presently into the way that the maid do go and she to walk a little offward from I and truly i lookt at she both with love and yet with somewhat that do be to reprove she gently and all in the same moment that she to make my heart stir with she sweet naughtiness and she to look sudden at I and to be that she half to intend to run to kiss I but also that she be mind in the same moment that she set herself up impertinently against I and in verity she make I to harden my nature a little as manhood doth make a man to do and this because of the rebellion that i know to be in she and she likewise to know but she hide she eye when that i shake my head half with play and half with earnest and be then impudent unto I and go from that in a moment to she pretty singing and she naughty walking apart but she no more to sing a olden love-song now in a while we past a basin of rock in a place among the tree and there be a warm spring bubble in the rock and the basin to be full of water very warm and with some smell of chemistry and the maid tell I that she would wash and i to think it a good place for that end and when i have taste the water i find that it do seem smooth and proper for we intent as that there do be a verity of a alkali in it and truly we wash and after that i be do the maid bid I that i turn my back and i to do this and she to mock I very naughty whilst that i could not see she and to seem very quiet for indeed i hear no splashing of water though i stand off from she a long while and she alway to say naughty thing unto I as that she do mind truly to have I anger for indeed she do have a plain intent that she mock at I and to ease not she wit and surely after that i have stand a great while i askt the maid when that she do be like to be do but she to say that she be nowise end of she toilet and i know very sudden that she make foolishness upon I also in this matter and i turn upon she and lo she do be sit upon a little rock very sedate even as when she have bid I turn from she and to have make no more forward but only to have be there at ease that she keep I turn away to please she naughty mood and all the while have a double liberty to have impudence upon I and in verity i do be a little angered but scarce that i do know it for i do love she very great and be stir inwardly with she dearness and that she do look just that-wise that i know not whether i to need to kiss she or to shake she and truly how should i know for my heart do ache that i have she to mine arm but my brain to say that she do go over-far in the joke and truly you to see that i do not be unreasonable neither to be lack of grace for indeed i do think that i be sway all-way because that i see all the dear way that she pretty nature do work and to conceive of she mood and to understand and be stir but yet to shape a little in my manhood unto hardening and in my judgement unto sternness yet truly i scold mine own with no more than a little jesting and do be nice and gentle with she because she do be so dear and i to know just-wise she mood and the cause and working of it and i tell she that i do love she and that she hasten now and let we again to the journey but indeed she only to make a face at I so that i do be near like to shake she unto sedateness and she then to be both merry and a rogue as we do say and to stop she ear and again to sing very gleeful and all so that she might not hear aught that i say and surely she lookt a very dainty rebellious one and i go then straightway to she and take she hand from she ear and i kist she pretty ear very gentle that i not to deafen she and i kist she lip as she do sing and afterward shake she that she be not such a sweet torment but this to have no success that way for she only to put out she toe to be kist for she foot-gear be off from she foot and indeed i laugh even as i make to frown and truly i kist she pretty toe and try then to coax she to go forward something speedy with she hair and to be ready to the journey but she only to sing and to refuse to be sedate and in verity in the end i catch she up in mine arm and have she bundle in my hand and so go off with she very sudden with she hair all loose upon I in a lovely and soft shine and she foot bare as they do be and this action i make because that i be grow truly a little stern with mine own for indeed she do half to need that she be whipt unto properness as you shall think that have see how she do be thiswise only because that she nature do be stir strangely and she womanhood and she maidenhood to be all unto war and in part to make a rebellion against I that she do know glad to be she true master but yet she to be thus even though she do be so glad and this to act so that she do be in the same moment both sweet and wise and yet to show a dainty foolishness and a true naughtiness that do make I to feel somewhat of a real anger but yet do have I to know that all my be do be stir by she so that i do think with one think that she do be very foolish and with another that she do be lovely wayward now when that i take the maid up so quick and make off with she she to give a little gasp and to submit to I with a quick humbleness but immediately she to regain she courage and to be outrage of I but indeed i take no heed only that i be like to shake she and do know also that she hair do be wondrous pretty upon mine armor and she soon to lie very quiet and easy in mine arm and to be demure and i to have a half knowledge of somewhat amiss but yet to have no sureness neither to think much upon this vague feeling and when that i have go a good mile she to put up she lip to be kist and i to kiss she very loving for she be so dear and she then to say very ordinary like that i should do wisely now if that i go back for she foot-gear which truly i have lack think to notice when that i do pick up the maid and i see that she have know this thing all that while and have make that mile of carry all a waste and a foolishness because of the naughty rebellion which do be in she and lo i set she instant to the ground and she give out a little cry as she see that i do be go somewise hard and stern with she and indeed i pull a small branch from a tree that do be near to be for a switch as you shall whip a boy with and i hold she with my left hand and in verity i lay the switch thrice very sharp across she pretty shoulder that she know all that she do need to know and she seem to be cease in a moment from she perverseness and do nestle very quick unto I that have whipt she and do need that she be wondrous nigh unto I and truly how shall even a young man flog such a one and the maid to be very husht against mine armor and to resist that i look into she face that do be prest so anigh I but presently i use a little and gentle force and so to look into she face something sudden and truly that one do be smile very naughty and dainty to herself so that i perceive that i have not truly whipt she enough but yet i could harden my heart no more at that time for in verity there doth be a strange half-pain in the bosom if that you have to flog a maid that doth be utter thine and this to the despite that there have be -- as then -- no properness of anger to have for a after self-reproach and surely i to have do this thing only of a stern intent and steadfastness that i steady mine own maid unto wisdom but yet to have be helpt by a little anger because of the thing that she have do yet alway my love do be so strong that mine anger never to have aught of bitterness as you shall have see and to understand and we go back then for the foot-gear of the maid and she to be very husht in mine arm but yet as i perceive not to be quiet of a humble little heart but only of the chance that she nature do be stir that way for the while and truly when we be go back the foot-gear do be there to the side of the pool and the maid gat shod very speedy and would have no aid and afterward do up she hair very tight upon she head to have it utter from my sight and this to be for a perverseness for she know that i do love to see it pretty upon she shoulder or if that she must do it that she do it up very loose and nice and truly you to know how i mean only that i have no skill of such matter but yet a good taste to admiring if that the thing be aright and i to say nothing as i look at she and she presently to make a quick glance unto I to see why i do say naught and i shake my head smile at she waywardness but she to look away from I and to seem to be set to fresh naughtiness now we go forward then upon we journey and alway the maid to walk onward from I but yet to have no other impudence neither to sing and i to go kindly with she but yet to think that she do lack somewhat to know that i do be truly she master and i to wonder a little whether she do know proper that my gentleness with she do be not of weakness but bear of understanding and love and the more proof that i do be fit to possess and to guide she and truly this be the thought of a young man yet lack not of reason in the bottom part though mayhap to be something clumsy-seeming unto the mind of a maid and to be very human to my year and you to have be likewise if that you have try all-way with a dear one and she to be yet over-wilful so that you to wonder whether she do truly know how you do understand and surely a maid doth know much that doth be in the heart of a man if that she be true woman in she own secret heart and oft she doth know more of she man than she man doth wot of himself and to go she own diverse way that she search out and bring forth and waken all that be the inward being of the man that she doth love yet when that she have stir you in the deep that you scarce to know she to be all fearful and in the same moment to have no fear and to be in rebellion and in the same moment to be most strange humble and all to be bear of love and nature in action upon nature and more than this how shall i have learning of the heart to tell you for in verity there doth be much in these few line if that you know to read and surely you to know or to learn but if neither then have you go short of joy and the true inwardness of life now this way i do be as i have tell and the maid to be quietly naughty in perverseness as also i have set out yet to have a strict mind to she duty and to go now wondrous sedate upon the journey yet alway apart and likewise when that the sixth hour do come and we to we halt as ever she to be very speedy and nice that the water and the tablet be ready for I but yet to have no word neither to eat by I but again a little apart and not to share the water but to make a brewing to herself when that i have do and likewise the maid hold not up she tablet to be kist as alway but eat they quiet and meditative and with little nibbling as that she do ponder upon other matter or mayhap to be not hungry and these thing i see as we eat and drink in a silence and i to look at the maid somewise sad in the heart and something stir and i to say to myself wisely yet as a young man that she do not yet be teach sufficient that i be she master and this you to perceive and she never to seem to look at I but to be quiet and demure and to have she eyelid something down upon she eye now presently as i think upon the matter i see that i do well that i take no heed of mine own but to let she to come to a natural end of this naughtiness that do be in the same time both pretty and a little foolish so that in half i condemn it and in half i be stir and alway i love the maid very dear and have a good understanding and there to be also a interest in my heart at this new side that she do be show and also she to stir I odd while unto masterfulness and so you to know pretty well how it do be with I in the matter now surely i find this plan that i attend not to the maid to have something of success for i know presently that she do look upward at I slyly from under she pretty eyelash and after to be demure in a moment and this to go forward for a while yet i to show no heed and in a while i see that she give attention to she garment in the way of nattiness and afterward she take down she hair and make it up then very loose and pretty upon she head so that she do be very lovely and to tempt mine eye that they look alway at she but indeed i do make as that i have no heed that the maid do shape she hair different upon she head and she very soon then to speak and to have the lesser gear together and to make that she attract I but truly i be very nice with she yet to keep she now a little off from I in the spirit and so to teach she that-wise that she be somewhat of a dear naughty maid but also as i do think i be this way because that in part i would tease she in great love of she prettiness and she makings up to I and so maybe even that i make she to be the more defy of I and this to be as that i also lack somewhat of reason for i do strangely that i think that she need to be whipt and in the same time that i go to make she the more deserving of the same yet this to be the truth as i know it and surely to be the natural waywardness of love but yet there do be also in the backward part of my wisdom a intent that i be wise and careful with mine own and i surely to have no full realising that i do be like to set she further unto perverseness than yet she do be now after that i have show well that i lack to heed the maid i find that i do be look oft at she and she to be so dear and pretty and to be all husht that truly i could not bear that i be longer silent to she advancement and i cease then from pretend and would have have she into mine arm but she to be now in sweet dignity and to keep I off with very sober grace and because of this i to feel someway that i do be someway in blame and surely now that i consider it i can see that i be something act upon even as have be the maid and so we two to be and a most human pair as you to say and somewhat both a-lack but indeed we do be very wholesome and in utter love each of the other and mayhap both then to perceive something of the sweet foolishness within we that do be as yeast a-work in we for i think that naanus do smile a little to herself but surely this clear-seeing to be but for a odd time and afterward we each again to earnestness in we way with the other but alway even when we do make to show indifference we to be something troubled inwardly with sweet flashing of we bewildered nature now though i have show you that i to know that i do be not utter free of this most strange and natural foolishness yet you to perceive that i tell this only that i have utter truth of all thing that do happen for in verity because that i be something subtly touch this way at while yet be this no full excusing of the maid though in the same moment you to perceive that there do be only the half of I to think that she do need to be excuse for in truth mine understanding go alway in the main with the workings of she nature and have a natural sympathy with she dear whimsy but also as you to know i to be stir constant in my manhood by she naughty defying and to be trouble in my natural sense when that she whimsy make she to act that she be likely to come unto aught of harm and surely now you to see all the way of my heart and to have understanding in thing that do follow and alway you shall mind that i do love she utter and to crave alway that i be a shield unto she though truly there doth be mayhap somewhat in I that doth act to make I a little stern seeming in my love but yet not oft so as you do know that have go with I in all my telling now we go then upon we journey and the maid to be somewhat before I and offward to the side upon my right and to have no speech with I but to make a good pace and to be very dear and graceful as she go and now we do pass this thing of strangeness and now that and these i do point out to she and make some tell concern the same have the memory of mine outward way and how that i do see these thing then when that i be all in suffering of so lonesome a doubt and she to hark alway very intent and to move she head nice and intelligent to show that she hear I and once i see that she lookt sudden at I with a dear light in she eye but this to be do in a moment and she to be again silent-seeming and in she new perversity of dignity and surely she do seem so utter sweet in this new way of naughtiness but yet i do think odd while that i should like to shake she unto dear humbleness and she usual way and in the twelfth hour we make halt again and have we food and we drink and the maid to serve I very clever and quiet as that i do be she lord and she a husht slave and i see that she make a constant and naughty mock upon I and truly as i do half think she to need that she be in care that i not treat she sternly as shall a slave-master and to give she that which she do ask for so mute and impudent but alway she do stir I mightily to have she to mine arm and to love she very dear and presently we do be again to we way and to be yet silent so that i scarce know whether to have patience with mine own or whether that i take she and speak seriously with she to cease this play which do begin a little to dispirit I somewhat strangely and in the end i go over to she as we do walk and i put mine arm about she and she to yield to I without word and to hark very quiet to my speech of reasoning and gentle saying and to hide whether she do be stir inwardly or not though indeed my spirit to know that she spirit do never be afar off from mine in all deep matter but only this thing to be to the top and to set somewhat between we that do be both a sweetness and a trouble and alway as i talk with the maid i see that she do make naughtily to act as that i do be a slave-master and she but a chattel to I for she to be husht before I and neither to yield she slender body willing to mine arm nor to resist I but only to be still as that she have no say in this matter and as that i be like to beat she at my pleasure or to withhold my hand all as might chance to be my desire and this i perceive be the shaping of she action so that all she dumbness and she quiet obedience do be but a way to say this thing to I and all to have come from she love of I and that she do be shake in she nature by my manhood and so to be but a new form of she naughtiness that do have this change when that i whipt she and all this you to perceive that have go with I and i see that she would not cease from this perverseness but make a dumb and naughty and hidden mock upon I very dainty and constant and scarce to be truly perceive save by the inward sense and truly i grow something angered afresh and to feel that she do need that she be shake so stern that she come unto the reality that i do be she man and natural master yet alway in love and surely i loose she then and go off a pace to she side and we again to go forward thiswise yet she soon to have a greater distance between we which she make very quiet and natural but indeed i see what she do now about the fourteenth hour of that journey i see before we in the far distance the rock upon which do be the olden fly ship that you shall remember and presently as we come more nigh i lookt oft to mine own and i see that she do be stare that way and to be in wonder but yet to say naught to I and soon as we come very close i do want that i tell she about the ship and of mine adventuring there and of the wonder of that olden ship set there through eternity but in the first i hesitate as you shall think because of she way but truly my heart know that she heart do be proper unto I and moreover i should be small in my nature if that i let any pettiness put a silence upon I though in verity if that the maid have not be inwardly love to I i have be that i have tell she no word and this to be very natural whether it be of smallness or not and when that we be come beside the great uprising rock i make halt and the maid to halt with I and i show she how that the thing upon the rock do be a olden fly ship from the mighty pyramid and in the first she askt no question but do be quiet and but to show with little nodding that she do be greatly interest and i to show to she how that this olden ship do be there mayhap a hundred thousand year and to have be there as it do seem to we -lrb- that be of that age -rrb- since the beginning of the world though in verity we two spirit do know that the beginning of that age do be truly the ending of this as you also to know and much i tell mine own and afterward concern the two humpt man that do come after I and she alway to be silent until that i speak of the fight but then to come round upon I very swift and with a dear light in she eye and have askt before she do wot whether they do hurt I and surely this to have be the first thing of she olden sweet naturalness that she do say for a great while and i to be so in delight that i have she into mine arm and kist she very loving all in a moment and she to submit with a nice gladness and to nestle unto I and all unwitting that she do be go from she waywardness yet in verity she do be a naughty maid for she mind in a instant that she do forget she pose unto I and lo she lip do be no more to search unto mine but to be as that they do be kist only of my will and she to have no more live nestle unto I but only to be quiet in mine arm and i lookt into she face and she lid to be down somewhat over she pretty eye and she do look very husht and demure so that truly i know not whether to shake she or again to kiss she but in the end i loost she and make then that we go forward yet indeed she do rather stay awhile to hark further concern the olden ship and of mine adventuring but she do then to mind that she obey as a slave shall obey and truly i do punish she in that i tell she no more but go forward at a good pace and have some natural wonder how that i deal with such a maid if that i spare to shake she and surely i think then again that i leave she be and so to have she presently again to she old and natural way now in a while i lift the maid into mine arm that i carry she as ever through the last part of each journey and so to have she never over-tired for the morrow and she for a moment to resist but instantly to give unto I and to lie quiet in mine arm as that she have no say in aught that do be do but must alway obey and indeed you to see how dearly perverse she do be and i go on then through four hour from that time and lookt oft upon every side and walkt quietly for truly we be come now into a part of the country where i do feel that there might be near some of the humpt man but i see nowhere anything to put I in dread and alway as we journey there do seem a great stillness in all the country near about and afar off the low mutter of the great fire-hill in this place and that and a drowse as of life and warmth about we and everywhere the air very rich and plentiful and presently when that we do be come down from that high place where do be set the rock and the olden ship we come in among the tree that come very nigh to the shore for a great way and oft as we do go there be clumping of small fire-hill that do cast fire and noise and oft the roaring of monstrous spring a-boil and then again the smell of the wood about we and oft still in odd place the low near sound of a little fire-hill that do burn lonesome in some clear space of the wood in this place and that and afterward we to be go onward again into the dull low mutter that do be in all the air of that country and that do but make a seeming of silence because that it do be so far and constant now about the eighteenth hour i to note that the noise of the great fire-hill grow more loud and i see presently over the tree afar upward in the great night and gloom that do lie above those two mighty fire-hill that i do feel to make the earth tremble in that part upon mine outward way and surely i have tell something of this before and you to remember if that you but think a little moment now it may appear strange that i speak thiswise of see the two hill of fire as that i have perceive they sudden but indeed i have be long abled to see they both yet to have have no attention to they because that they do be a great way off and because they do be but two hill of fire in a country that do be plentiful with such and truly i not to have say aught about they only that we path do take we now by they foot and i to see they as it be newly and to have nice ease of heart to perceive how that they do be a wonder unto the spirit and the brain for all time for it do be as that the earth have a constant shake within mile of they and that a monstrous force of nature do be in that place but yet there to be no desolation around as you should think but in all part a wondrous growing of tree and great plant in abundance and the tree to grow upward upon the shoulder of the mountain and there to be no fall of hot rock and ash as you to think but all very sweet and wholesome as that the mighty valley make a chimney to the mountain and mayhap to other so that they waste if that they have such do go free but indeed you shall take no heed of this explain save as a odd thinking that have come to I and to be without foundation and there to be no surety of the reason to this only that there do be no fall of ash in that part as i do know yet in other part of that country the fire-hill do make new mountain of the matter that do come from they but this not to be alway so and there to seem to my knowledge no cause to order why this do not be constant save that my guessing to be right or naught to be blow from some but indeed i to be sure only of that which do be plain to mine eye and mayhap there to be no mystery in the thing but a score of natural explaining if that i do know or have patience to think long enough upon such now when that the eighteenth hour do be proper come we to be anigh to the great hill and there to seem nowise any danger of fall fire so that i seek about for a place for we slumber and i find a cave in the side of a big rock and the cave be dry and comfortable and have the mouth about a score foot above the earth and when that i have climb and lookt well into the cave i give the maid a help and have she safe into that place and she then to prepare the tablet and the water the while that i bring up a boulder from below to set very light balanced in the mouth of the cave and this i mean for a signal to fall if that any creature should climb upward into the cave while that we do sleep and surely you to know this plan for i do it before as you to have learn and the maid sit near to I and eat she tablet very quiet and with a demure naughtiness but yet to be also in wonder and to gaze outward at the great fire-hill and to be in awe as i do know and i put my half-anger and my play from I and tell she of mine outward journey and how i do go by these same mighty fire-hill that do seem as mighty torch to light I in my search and to have hold a new strangeness and wonder over my path and she still to be silent but yet to look at I twice or thrice with a very dear and loving way though she do hide she eye in a moment when that she see that i perceive she and soon the maid spread the cloak for we sleep and while that she do this i lookt well about for any creature that might be anigh and i have a especial thought unto the humpt man but indeed there be naught living unto my sight and nowhere do i see anything to put I in fear for we life and truly i have a great viewing from that place for we do be in a upward rock that stand in a high part and the cave to be twenty good foot aloft as i have tell so that all make to set we in a lofty place and the cave to look toward the two mountain that do rise upward no more than twelve good mile off from we as i do think and the country between to be somewise as a mighty park for it be spread much about the foot of the great fire-hill and do be bare in this place and that as that rock do make the earth naked there or the fall of some later fire to have work thus and between the bare part there go strange and romantic wood see mistily and in part the gleaming of water as that hot lake do be half show among the broken forest and presently the land do go upward with a monstrous sweep and be then in great terrace in the height and tree to grow very plentiful upon the mountain in sundry part and so those two mighty hill to go upward to meet the everlasting night and presently to show strange upland that do be see very wondrous and queer in the light that do glow from the vast glowing of the fire that do be a crown upon the hill that do seem in verity to be that they burn halfway between that known world and the lose olden world that be mayhap two hundred great mile above in the everlasting night and eternity of darkness and i lookt upward for awhile and be much hold by the mighty upland that do be on high yet do lie utter far below the burning crest of the mountain and show vague and sombre and dreadful seeming because that they do be so lose upward and to have the mystery of the red shine and of the shadow upon they and to seem to slope far under the great fire but yet to be a place where no life should ever come because that they do be so monstrous a way upward beyond the great shoulder of the hill the which do be themselves a huge way up and truly i should give you somewhat of the affect of those grim and unknown upland if that i say they do seem to my fancy to be a place where a sorrowful thing might wander lose forever but why i to think this thing how shall i say and do tell it to you only because that it doth seem to hold in the think the grimness and utter desolation of those high and lonesome land and by this i be do look and turn I about and so do find that mine own do stand silent and wait that i come to my slumber and surely i lookt at she but she do have she lid something downward when that she see I turn and so in the end i say naught but go to my sleep and have the disko very handy as ever beside I and i then to know that mine own do lie down beside I to my back as alway and this to gladden I as you shall think for i perceive afresh how thin do be the crust of she naughtiness and i to be alway stir and touch in the heart by she loving naturalness that do need alway that she be near to I save when she do play this naughtiness upon I along the way and i see that she have no mind to be perverse whilst that i do slumber but must now be nigh unto I and quietly loving though nowise truly cease from she naughty act that i do be as a hard slave master because that i have whipt she yet she to have somewhat a truce with I as my heart do know but indeed she not to kiss I good-night upon the mouth in she dear usual and sober fashion and surely i do lie awhile and ponder upon the maid and upon all she way and i perceive that she kist I not only because that she do not be able to break utter from she perverseness that do come from the stir of she nature and truly i do love she and be half mind that i turn about to she and take she a moment into mine arm but yet to abide from this because that i be set that i wait awhile and to bring she to I thiswise mayhap and presently i know that the maid kist mine armor very quiet and shy because that she must kiss I yet to be intent that i have no knowledge of this pretty act but indeed i do know in all my being and do be newly tender unto she yet to say naught and to wait and thus i know presently that she breathing do go easy so that i perceive that she be all content and go over unto slumber somewise as a little child that doth be weary and doth sleep without care and with happy assurance and in verity do a man ever to have so sweet and gentle a maid that do be in the same time so troublous and perverse and i to lie yet awhile and to note the constant tremble and shake of the rock that do be under we and this to be alway thus as i do lie and to be the more plain because that i do be quiet in thought and this as i conceive do come from the earth-shaking that be make by the inward fire of the world the which do make a vague trouble in all that part of the land and then in a little i be go over into sleep and wake not for seven good hour and then to hear the fizzing of the water very brisk and cheerful and so to have mine eye open in a moment and to know by my time-keeper or dial that be somewhat like to a watch of this age that i have slumber through seven good hour but this to be learn after that i have lookt to see whether mine own do be well and whether that the boulder do balance in the mouth-part of the cave and surely there do be nothing in harm for the boulder be there as i do put it and the maid a little off from I and do make ready the water and the tablet that we eat before we journey and i rise then and in the same moment i do know that my mouth have be kist whilst that i sleep and the know to come to I vague as that i have be kist in my dream and i lookt over toward the maid but she to have she lid something down upon she eye and to seem very demure so that i see she naughtiness be come again upon she yet truly i could not bear that i not to have she into mine arm for indeed she perverseness do seem as that she do the more tempt I unto she and thus i come to she in a moment but she neither to resist I nor to give herself unto I but only to be still in mine arm and to do no more than submit very quiet and because of this i loost she unkist and be silent and a little to be anger even whilst that my heart perceive the way of the working of she heart yet truly i ached now that she come back to she dear natural fashion and i eat my tablet and drink some of the water and the maid to do likewise and afterward i lookt well from the mouth of the cave but do nowhere see aught to put I in trouble for we safety though truly as presently i see there go a herd of strange creature afar off in the northwestward part which do be that way of the country beyond the foot of the mountain toward the in-land now when that i be something assure of the safeness of the way i gat the disko to my hip and the maid to have the scrip and the pouch ready to my back and she bundle to she hand and so all to be ready and i go downward from the cave when that i be girt and give aid to mine own and so to be soon upon the journey and surely as we go onward and i to look about I with different-seeing eye from my look on mine outward way i to see how wondrous this part of the land do be and how that it do be truly like a great and wondrous park that do be make of the skill and labor of godlike thing and truly this to show my feeling as i lookt all-way and all that part do be breed of the inward force of the world and do be burn clear in this place and upheave in that and make to a hot lake in another part and odd while there to go a great steam fountain that do whistle a lonely song forever and anon there to be a small wood and again a wood and oft the quietness of great and strange tree that do stand alone and here and in that part a little fire-hill that do be surely no greater than a house and we to pass seven of these in but three hour and two to glow very steadfast and to make no vigor of burning but the five other do burn very strong and send out a smoke and ash and make a small desolation all about they and of these five there do be one that cast stone oft and again so that they go upward with a strange loud noise and fall in this place and that all about so that we come downward more nigh to the shore that we be a good way off and here as i do mind there be a strangeness in that there do be many tree that have stone set in the branch and this to be plainly the work of the little fire-hill and i to think it but something new come else surely there have be no tree within all that space that it do throw but yet mayhap i be wrong in this for all thing do seem that they grow very easy in that country and indeed this to be for surprise to I only that i see it with mine own eye as we do say and alway as we do go there be sign of inward life and force so that we but to stand quiet to feel that the earth do tremble gently in many part and presently there sound for a great while a low and dull booming sound and this we find to be from a place amid certain great rock toward the mountain for there come thence a mighty up-spouting of boiling water that go so high as a hundred foot and oft to be thrice so high and belch a great steam and there go up in the jet of the water a great rock that be so big as a house and do dance and play in the might of the water as that it have be no more than a thing very light and easy and when that the water fall as it do oft the rock to go downward with the dull boom that we do hear and i mind how that i have hear the booming upon mine outward way but have be then something more to the shore so that it have be less plain to mine ear as you shall suppose neither have it be then to my sight as now it do be to we because that we be come mayhap the half of a mile more toward the in-land of the country and truly we lookt awhile at this huge great fountain and up-boiling and come nearer unto it but yet to be a large space off because of the way that it do throw out a spattering of small stone odd while and surely the thing do cough and roar in the deep earth and anon to gruntle gently and to sob and gurgle and lo to come forth in a moment with a bellow very hollow and strange and the great rock to go spin upward and all a-shine in the light from the volcano and be so round as a monstrous ball and polish by the fret of the water so that i see it have surely dance in the great jet through a weary time and anon the jet to cease and to go downward with a great soughing and thundering of water and the dancing rock to fall downward from that height which do show very huge now that we do be come so near and the rock surely to fall backward into some deep pit whence come the water and as it fall there be again the dull booming but why the rock brake not i could not perceive save that it do alway fall into a boil up of water and have no hurt from the rock of the place whence it be come and the maid and i both to have stand a while that we stare at this thing for it do be more strange than i have make you to know but now i do make to we journey again and do think the maid follow but lo in a moment when that i lookt she be to my back and go toward the great boiling fountain then i stopt very swift and call to she but she do take no heed of I and go onward very naughty unto the danger of the great boil of the jet and the constant fly out of the stone that you do know now even as i stand and lookt the maid draw nigh to the place where the water do thunder and the jet in that moment to bellow so that i know it come upward again and i run then after the maid and she to see I and begin likewise to run from I toward the monstrous fountain and surely i do think that i have do well if that i have whipt or beat she proper before this time for truly it do be as that she naughtiness have go nigh unto somewhat that do be near to a wayward madness so that as i do perceive all she nature do surely work in she toward some deed that should be for regret and this to come because that she do be something pusht from she dear balance by she loving and by the acting of my manhood upon she so that she nature both to be in rebellion against I and to need I and all in the same time and this-way she to be in a inward turmoil and to be ready foolishly that she put in danger she beloved life if only thereby she to make I something adrift and in the same moment to have some ease of she perverseness and in verity you to know all this because that i have show the working of she heart to you before this time now i catch the maid among the great rock which do stand all about and before she there do be a monstrous pit whence come the upbursting of the water and the water to go upward before we face in a mighty column so that it do be as that a sea shoot up on end into a pillar of live water and go upward forever as it do seem in that moment and how we should be save i know not for the water do be as that it overhang we and should come down upon we and smother we in one moment forever and the roar be in we ear and shake all the air of that place with sound as of a harsh and dreadful thunder and there be a scalding of beaten water as fine as a haze all about we and i have the maid in one instant into mine arm and i run very swift with a fierce run that i have she away speedy and so make forlorn trial that i save she life and lo as i go from under that huge and dreadful overhang of the great water there come downward from the height a great stone that have be cast by the jet and it burst upon the rock to my back and certain of the flinder do strike and ring upon mine armor and make I to stagger as i run but i hold the maid crowd safe against my breast and she do not be hurt and truly i be yet able to run and do save mine own and bring she out from under that grim spouting and i put the maid down then to she foot and she not to know how near that she have give we to death neither of the way that the fragment do strike I for she laugh very naughty and gleeful but truly i laugh not for my heart have be nigh husht with terror for she so that i do be yet sick in my spirit and mayhap also something shake by the blow that i gat from the broken stone and in verity i to have mean that i flog she very sharp if that there be no other way that i might bring she to reason for in surety as you to see she to be act so wild as a child and so unreasoning as only a maid-in-love and i to know that she do have to be bring back from this way of spirit even though i have to hurt she pretty body that i bring she again to she dear natural wiseness yet indeed i could not whip she then because that she do laugh so joyous though with a naughty heart and do look so wondrous dainty so that even she defying do but seem that which my heart desire and you mayhap to have be something likewise in the love-day yet i pled and reason with she to be a wise maid but indeed she only to make a gleeful mock of all that i do say now i go forward again for i be not harm by the stone only that i do be shake as you shall think and the maid to go offward from I and to sing and do oft dance naughtily as she go but truly i do be silent with she for i be but human and do lack that she come to mine arm and love I because that i have pluckt she safe from that place and indeed this to be but a natural desiring and you to have understanding with I and to know that you also to have this lack and need if that you to have do aught for love of you maid and she to deny you a word of loving tenderness yet in verity i to be even then able to perceive with mine inward sens how that the maid do have a wondrous up-pouring of love for I but yet do be so perverse and the more so mayhap because that she love do so urge she unto loving admitting that i do be she man and she maybe to have mean that she be the more humble presently but yet to go naughtily awhile more and not indeed to have have the power within she at that time to have come unto I and cast off she waywardness and askt that she be in mine arm as all my heart do desire and so as i have tell i go silently and mayhap with a little dullness that do be part of anger and part of hurt and part of that same strange love-foolishness from which the maid do suffer and truly this doth be very contrary-seeming only that you have see my heart and all indeed the more human that it doth be so contrariwise to the brain-reason and all to be desire else do a man be no better than a ant or a weariful machine and this to be truth and wholesomeness as you shall perceive if that you look deep enough and do modify reason with heart-understanding for in verity how shall that which we call reason bring any to the full and the great knowledge and this doth be a power of holy thing and doth be a child that be bear of love and reason and in the one to hold the two and to know all thing be the gift of this power so that no man may walk truly that have only the first neither any man do utter wise that have only the second and surely i to cease from these thought and to my telling and you to you harking and dear sympathy now when the sixth hour do be come we make a halt and eat and drink and afterward go onward again and so come presently clear of the two monstrous fire-hill and they great noise to be presently to we rear and likewise that quiet country that do be round they foot and do seem so utter husht and strange and doubly so because of the upward noise of the mountain and because of the slow and subtle earth-shaking that do be so constant and because of all those thing that i have tell now when we have make halt the maid have do she hair very uncomely upon she head and have lookt slyly to see whether i do note but truly i take no heed so that in the end she have it again in a pretty fashion and do sing naughtily and with a heart of mischief as she do shape it loose and wondrous nice about she head and i still to have no word for she neither to show that i do watch she with love and somewise a quaint pleasure of she perverseness even whilst that i do strive by silence and a aloofness that i bring she to my side as she do be in the first day for truly i do ache that she be near unto I and to cease from she waywardness that do put a distance of spirit between we as you to perceive and so we do go forward again as i have tell and the maid do strive that she make I to give attention to she naughtiness for she do walk alway offward from I and do sing aloud and truly they do be song strange unto I but yet to be of love and much as the song of this age for truly there doth be but one song upon all the earth and she but to sing it in diverse way and she do oft to make little glancing toward I and do pout very pretty and in a moment come something toward I as that she do be humble and would be forgive but all to be in a naughty mockery so that in verity i lookt not at she save odd while but do go forward alway and make as that i have no heed of she doings and surely this do presently to stir she to a new defy and to a pretty anger for she do sing other song of impudence that she do fit very clever about I and this way to have a constant impertinence and so we do go and i never to speak with the maid but to wonder when that she cease or how long it should be ere that i do run swift to she and have she into mine arm that i shake she and kiss she all as my heart do desire and when that the twelfth hour do be come we make halt again and eat and drink and the maid to serve I very intent and hand I the water the while that she go down upon she knee as a slave but when i would have laugh gently at she mocking and take she into mine arm she go from I very sudden and cold and be afterward silent and do sit apart from I now i also do be silent and in the first because that i be a little pained and also because that i do be new touch with the love-foolishness that do trouble mine own but afterward i cease from these feeling and do be intent to another matter for it do seem to my spirit that there be some danger anigh to we and i have a thought of the humpt man and lookt well about and do beckon the maid to come nigh because that the tree do be plentiful thereabout to hide any creature but mine own come not over to I so that i loose the disko from mine hip and go that i be nigh to she and she make that she see I not but do set the gear together and have it presently a-ready for the journey the while that i do look all-way among the tree but indeed i see naught and when that i have the gear upon I and the maid she bundle we go forward again and i to be very wary and bid the maid keep close to my side but indeed she would not obey and go offward among the tree so that i be all an-haunted with dread for she and run and catch she and talkt wisely with she but indeed she do not hark to I but do run off in the moment that i loost she and i catch she again and i take one of the strap from around the scrip and the pouch and set it about she pretty waist and the end i hold in my hand and so have she to obey I in this thing which do be needful to she safety and the maid to go with I very husht for two great hour and i alway to look well about and in the end of that time the maid do begin to sing impudently and i do ask she that she be a quiet maid lest that she bring danger upon we but she to be the more impudent and lo as i do strive that i look all-ways lest any harm do come upon we and in the same moment to reason mine own from she pretty folly she do grow very husht so that i lookt round upon she in a instant and truly she have cut the strap with she belt-knife and do run away very swift among the tree and surely my heart do slow a little in my breast because that there do seem something a-move in the dark of the shadow where the tree do grow thick and the maid do run that way in she foolishness and waywardness and i run hard after the maid and do call she not over-loud lest i bring somewhat upon she but she to have no heed and to run very light and swift so that i catch she not for the half of a minute as it might be for she be go ahead and i do be a little cumbered with mine armor and lo when i catch she i shake she and point inward among the tree for it do seem even then to I that something move there but she to struggle in my hand a moment and afterward to be still and to ask with a insolence and a defiance whether that i do mean to flog my chattel the which she do call herself in she naughtiness and in verity ere i do know she have twist from I and do run with a true wickedness straight toward that place where somewhat have seem to be a-move and i run then with all my strength and with a fearful and a anxious heart and because i put all my strength to the matter i catch the maid in a moment ere she do be go any way and she again to fight to be go from I but i take she into mine arm very strong and i run outward from that place where the tree make a darkness and surely when i be come again to where the tree do be more spare i see that i be come nigh to that river which i crost on the raft as you shall mind and truly i do be glad and to feel safe in a moment yet i be firm now to my purpose for i set the maid to the earth upon she foot and keep my hold very sure upon she for i do mean that i whip she before that she love-foolishness bring she needless unto death and i take the belt from she pretty waist for it do be but a light strap and i whipt she very sharp over she shoulder with the belt and truly she do make to nestle unto I in a moment as that other time when that i whipt she but i stay she from this and i set the belt thrice more across she shoulder very sharp so that she to learn wisdom at once and i to be free for ever of this need to pain she which do hurt I very strange and the maid to stand very quiet now that i do keep she from come unto I and she head do be something bent so that i know not whether i do mayhap have flog she over-hard for i do be something lack in knowledge whether that a maid be very easy hurt and i stooped and lookt into she face and lo she do be smile naughtily and kist I in a moment very saucy upon the mouth ere i do be aware and afterward she laugh and make try to make a bitter mock upon I and askt when that i should be please to cease from whipping my chattel for that then she should run away immediately into the wood and to trust the humpt man that they protect she from I and surely i lookt at she very grave for i perceive that she do not truly jest but make to anger I and do be half in a strange anger herself and something adrift for she have not be whipt enough but only to stir she rebellion utterly and i see that if she be not set right then ere she leave my hand she to be like to have some new foolishness that should take she unto she death even as she have come overnear already as you to know and this to be because that she nature do be stir so that she natural wiseness be all overset and she to be that she do aught of unwisdom that should come to she because of she pretty love-foolishness which do now be make the more strong by reason of the half-rising of she anger and this way as i have know i perceive that for she dear sake i should not let my lovingness weaken I in that moment and in verity i shift my hand and loose the fastening of she garment so that she pretty shoulder do be bare and she face to change sudden and she lookt up at I a instant with a little gasp so that i know she do be all unbroken as be mine intent but she do not yet have learn deeply in she heart all that i be mind that she to learn for even in that moment she make a sound that show she do try to mock I but truly she do not know in that instant whether to mock or to weep though she do try to suppose that she have yet a heart for mockery and i set the belt thrice across she pretty shoulder where they do be bare and surely the blow do be very stern and sharp and lo in one moment mine own break into a utter weep so that i take she instant into mine arm and do hold she strong and gentle against mine armor and she to be as a child in mine arm and do sob very strange and bitter as that she do be all undo in the heart and presently she do be quiet in mine arm though i to feel how she do yet tremble and she do cling tight unto I and she face to be against mine armor and afterward when that she have cease to tremble i kist she and surely she mouth do be very humble and she lid to be downward and she to be something pale and she then to be awhile more in mine arm very quiet and so to come unto she dear self and lo presently she to want to kiss I of she own accord and she put up she lip very sweet and as a loving maid that i kiss she and surely i kist she with a humble and a masterful love and a strange pain to be about my heart as you shall suppose but yet my heart and my reason both to approve mine action and the maid to be but the more mine own and to have come again to she dear natural wisdom yet as you shall know there to be for a long while a strange and mixed pain in my bosom both dreadful and tender because that i have be so stern with mine own maid so that even while that my heart and my reason do approve I my heart to make somewhat of reproach and this to have be someway of foolishness but yet human of we nature and a wholesome trouble to the spirit if that this troubling be not allow to shape we action to any harmful weakness now in a while the maid do come to composedness and to be very gentle and sweetly natural and she make presently that she would have I to loose she and afterward she turn she back to I even as a dear child that i fasten she garment again upon the shoulder and she do be both shy and glad and humble and in dainty pride of submission and utter mine own and surely as i do this thing for she i perceive that she lookt with a great shyness at the belt which do be yet in my hand and when that i have make a end of fasten she garment she do nestle unto I for a while and afterward stand away and make shyly to show I that i put she belt again about she pretty waist and i see that she do be somewhat a-lack yet that she touch the belt because that i have whipt she with it and truly you to perceive how she heart do be in this matter but if you not to know then how shall i to tell you and do but bid you ask you own maid though in verity she to be like that she but laugh at you and leave you so wise as you be now for the way of the heart of a maid doth be most hide to the maid and she but to know the desire and to lack the end but truly she doth know when that a man shall set the truth of she heart before she now when i have buckle the belt very nice again about mine own we go backward a space until that we find the bundle which she have dropt when that she run off from I and i saw also the portion of the strap which she cut and so all to be find and we go then at a good speed toward the river for i be still mind regard the seeming of movement which there have be among the tree and very wishful that we have a raft make with haste so that we might come to the little island where i do sleep before upon the outward way as you shall remember and i think to have we slumber again in that place and to make that day 's journey something short because that the island be near and a good and safe place for we sleep and i tell the maid concern the island and she to be in great delight and interest because that it do be one of those halt of mine outward go and do be all eager as a child when that i say we should truly have need of a raft to come to the island and we come downward to the shore of the river and indeed there do be those two same tree that have be my raft there upon the shore of that place and i show these to mine own and truly she do nigh to weep upon they because of she dear emotion and love and do cut a small branch therefrom with she belt-knife and put the branch where she do put the piece of bark and this to be for a remembrance and a after-delight and ponder now we lookt well in all part that we find some other small tree that should be fall and the maid do climb a rock that do be near with a flat top so that she might search out around and presently she cry out to I that there do be a tree to we purpose and but a hundred pace away and she to go with I to show I and to aid if need be but indeed i carry the tree very easy and have it with the other and afterward we go about again for branch and these i cut from live tree use the disko with care and wiseness and with these branch to be for cross-piece and we belt and the strap for binder i set the tree together into a raft and make it pretty good for we need and so that no monstrous thing in the river should have chance to snap upward between the tree at my dear one and when the raft be do i gat it to the water and the maid do lend she strength for the thing be heavy as you shall think and when this be do i push a sharp branch downward into the shore and i hookt a branch of the raft about this mooring and so do be nigh ready for the voyage but first i do need a pole to push the raft and do wonder now where the other do be go that i cut upon the outward way for i have set the pole with the two tree as i do mind have some vague thought that mayhap i should live to come that way again and i have a little strange unease that the pole do be go but scarce to know that i do be trouble yet to set I to a new haste and i bid the maid put the scrip and the pouch and she bundle secure upon the raft and in that time i lookt well about for a sapling tree that should do my purpose and i see that there grow a odd one a little to the side of the flat-topt rock that the maid have lookt from and whilst that i cut it the maid do come to watch and make pretty chatter in the time that i trim the branch away and lo whilst that i do be part divide in mine attention between she dear talk and my work and a haste that do be bear of that little unease that be come upon I my spirit to seem to be aware that there come a danger anigh to we and the maid to have this same know for she cease she speech and lookt at I with somewhat of trouble and lo in that moment as i balance the pole in my hand there come the noise of a sudden bound to we backward part where the tree do grow something anigh and i turn instant and lookt and behold there do be upon we a humpt man very lumpish and mighty and he stretch out he hand and run at I and i have no time to the disko which do be upon the earth to my foot and i smote the humpt man with the point of the pole that do be in my hand and the point take he very strong and horrid in the breast and enter in so that the humpt man give out a strange howl that do be half seeming of a animal and half of a human and he clutch at the pole that do so hurt he and i stoopt very swift for the disko and have it in a moment and the humpt man tear the pole out of he breast and in the same instant i ript he from the head downward so that he do be nigh in two half for i have no mercy in mine act even though my heart do be something sorry now even as the man die there do be a sound of run in the wood before I and lo i turn very speedy to the maid and she be there to my back and have she belt-knife draw in she hand for she have it in she bosom where she have put it when that i take she belt for the raft and i catch the maid about the waist with my left arm and be come with she to the top of the rock in two great hounding and i set she there upon the rock and turn again to the way i come and swing the disko free for indeed i have see that there do come a number of the humpt man among the tree and there come run from the wood mayhap a great score of the humpt man so that it do seem to I that we do be go to die for how should one stand against so many and they so quick and strong as you shall mind yet in verity i have no despair but do be mixt in the heart with a great fear for mine own and a strange and exulting gladness that i should do that day some deed for mine own maid and truly this to be the pomp of love and the heart-cry of the barbarian as you shall say and this maybe but truly i do be proper human and to make no excuse because that i be natural neither have i hide anywhere aught that i do think and feel and whether that you approve or not if that you condemn I you to condemn all humanity and to have vain word and vain regretting for these thing that be name for fault do but be the complement of we virtue and if that you slay the first you may chance to wither the last for now i speak of thing as they be now and as they do be then and nowise of lovely ideal that do live chief in the mind and so much in mine as any as you to know if that you have go with I all along my way and surely i must cease from my thinking and go forward with my tell for the humpt man do come forward at a wondrous quick run and do swarm upward on to the rock as that they do be panther and they make no outcry but come silent to the killing and i see that they do be something smaller than he that i have but then slay and in verity i do be all knit in that moment with speed and cleverness for i split the head of three with but quick turn of my wrist as i do wield the disko and i kick the face of another in the same time with my metal boot so that he die for there do be all my strength and all my skill work then for we salvation now all this to have be do in but a few beat of the heart as i might say and these man to have be in the front of the attack yet there do be no space to have breath for there leap three more of the man upon the rock and one smite I with a great piece of rock that he carry so that mine armor do seem as that it crackt and i to be drive backward upon the maid yet have slay one of the humpt man even in that moment and surely my dear one catch I in she arm behind and steady I so that i fall not and i slew the humpt man with the rock even in that moment whilst mine own hold I as he come again to strike I and i then to be firm again upon my foot and do spring at the third of the humpt man and surely there be no room that he should be able to avoid I even do that be he intent and he come at I with a great leap and i stand strong look clearly to my work and i swing the disko with both my hand and the blow take the humpt man in the middle part and split he whilst that he do be yet leap and in that instant there reach over the edge of the rock two of the humpt man and gat I by the foot so that i be pull sudden to my back very hard and bitter and this to be do even whilst that the body of the humpt man do be yet in the air and the body come forward over I and do be utter dead already and fall down upon the rock beyond I and roll horridly and go over the edge of the rock and i do be all shake and something bemused by the hardness of my fall and the hand of the two humpt man pluckt I sharp to the edge of the rock the while that i do strike vaguely to wind they but do only chip the rock and fortunate that i harm not the weapon and lo in the moment that they have be like to have I downward to the earth into they midst i to make a good stroke for i cut the shoulder of one very dreadful so that he loose I and immediately i kick very fierce with my free foot and surely i nigh crush the hand of that other with my metal boot and he likewise to cease from drag upon I and immediately i know that mine own do be help I that i get instant to my foot again for i be yet something daze and there come then a rush of the humpt man up the rock and truly it do be a glad thing for we life that they might come up only upon but one side for the other side do be utter steep and smooth worn and this to have be unto we saving as you shall think and i stand up to the rush of the humpt man and do smite hard at they with a quick circling of the disko so that the great weapon do glow and roar and they give back from the blaze and the sound of the disko and surely then i run in upon they whilst that they do be something bewildered and i gat the foremost man full upon the head so that he do be dead before he do know what thing happen yet in verity this do be a dread moment to I for the humpt man leap in at I upon every side in a instant of time and i do be strike upon my head-piece and upon my back and breast with the stone that certain of they do carry so that i rockt as i stand and do near to swoon and mine armor to be all dint and bent upon I and i truly to seem that i have come to the time of my die and lo in that moment of time there do come to my dazed sense a low and bitter cry of anguish from the maid and this to set all my life aglow in I and in verity there go a strange greyness of fury before mine eye and i then to fight as i do never fight before and i do smite as it do seem forever and the greyness do ease from mine eye and the maid do have she arm about I as i stand and the dead man to lie heapt upon the rock and mine own to steady I for i do be near slay and the blood do go from I and mine armor be all break upon I by the smiting of the sharp stone and i lookt something slowly upon mine own and she to know that i would ask whether that she do be harm anywise and she to be very brave with I and to tell I that she do be well and she to be all slay in the heart because that i do be so hurt but truly i have fight a good fight and do lack only to know that she come to no harm now my wit do come back into I very soon but i do be utter weak and scarce to stand so that i do mind only that i get mine own safe unto the raft and to put off then from the shore and i walkt slow to the edge of the rock and lookt well about that i learn whether the humpt man do be all go away and the maid do steady I and lo there come up in that instant the last of the humpt man and they be five and do creep very stealthy that they have I in surprise and i loost from the maid for i see that i must come upon they whilst that i have any strength leave in my body and they now to leap upward unto I so that i gat the first upon the head and he to go backward dead but truly i do be more weak than i know for i sway upon the edge of the rock and sudden i go downward to the earth and do be there upon my knee and my back to the rock and in verity the humpt man do come in upon I very swift yet do they give back from the disko which i swing to and fro so speedy as i might for my weakness which do be so utter that i could nowise come to my foot to stand and mine own come down swiftly from the rock and run past the humpt man and i to make that i shout to she to go to the raft but truly i have no voice in my body and do be dumb and weak and do know that i should be go forever from mine own in a little moment and she to have none to protect she neither to know the way of we journey save by reason and behold mine own do shout to the humpt man and i perceive that she make to draw they after she for she run to and fore and do shout continually but indeed the humpt man have no heed of she but do make alway to come at I and surely in that moment one of the humpt man reach I and smite I so shrewd that sure he nigh crackt he monstrous hand upon mine armor and do drive I backward upon the rock and to make I bleed afresh so that i be all in a daze and near swoon away and the humpt man catch at the disko yet in verity he loost it on the instant for it do burn and shake he very sore and immediately he smite I again and so make to end I and lo in that moment the maid run right in among the humpt man and she strike the man that strive with I and drive she belt-knife once and again through he arm very savage and determine and surely the man turn upon she and he catch she by she garment and he ript she two garment utter from she so that they come away and she do be free and behold mine utter despair for she do give I a new strength so that i shout to she that she run instant to the raft and i cut the humpt man in twain and do fall back then into a part swoon against the rock and lo the maid run out from the humpt man but they neither to know whether that they follow she or that they come in upon I and as they do pause she to call to they and to try that she tempt they from I toward the wood for she have no thought of she life but only that she free I and save I and i too weak even to have power to command she to the raft and she truly to have no heed to such command even do i thus to call again and there i do be half-go out from this life and lookt at she with eye that do scarce wot save as in a dream and lo the humpt man cease sudden that they heed she and the three that do be leave come very sly unto I and with slowness and cunning for they wott not whether i do be dead or but a-wait for they and the maid perceive that they come not after she and she let out a great cry that do be distant-seeming in my dull ear and come back naked and run very swift and she run by I as death should run white and silent and she face set unto despair and she eye utter intent and she strike she belt-knife into the shoulder of the near humpt man and the man howl and turn and she do leap to the side and the humpt man run at she but lo she leap again this way and that and utter silent and so quick as a light doth seem to dance all way in a moment and the two other man do join with the first that they catch she and behold she go about and do run right away among the tree and the three man do come after she run very lumbersome yet with a great speed and the maid have the knife in she hand and i know that she do mean to slay herself presently when that she could run no more and in that moment it seem that my heart burst for that i should never more see mine own maid forever and there come some power of movement into I and i come forward from the rock and fall over upon my face and i gat again to my knee and begin that i creep after the maid and i do shout in whisper for my voice have no more power to call and the maid go from my sight among the tree as a far white figure that do run very swift and be presently lose utter to my sight and the humpt man do go after yet even in my weakness i perceive that two do go something clumsy as that they have be hurt in the fight and they to be the rearward of the chasing but he that the maid do cut with the knife be to the fore and do run very strong and surely they be all go inward of the tree with a dreadful speed and be lose from I and the world do become sudden a emptyness and a great horror and there be no sound in all the earth as it do seem and i know that i be come to my foot and do run toward the tree and the disko do trail from mine arm by the hold-buckle and the ground do be as that it move and shift under I and i not to feel where i trod but do only peer desperate and lose among the tree and as i to know now i hear my voice call strangely and afterward there be a thunder in mine ear and i come downward upon my face and i do know presently that i be alive and there to be some dreadful terror at my heart and surely i do remember and sicken and gat my head from the ground and i lookt among the tree but there do be nothing and everywhere there do be a strange silence and a dimness of unreal seeming and i know that mine own be go from I and have surely die and the earth do be all stain about I with my blood and i do be utter glad for i to need death and i swoon again and be lose to my pain but do live presently to know and there be a little strength come into I and i gat my head up somewhat from the ground and do peer among the tree and my head do be too heavy and my face come against the earth once more and because that i could not hold up my head i roll my head a little until that my cheek do be to the ground and i to look thiswise so well as i might but there do be nothing and afterward i roll my head again to the other cheek and so to stare very weak and desperate and not able to look proper to my front and lo there go something among the tree and do show white in the gloom of the wood and do come through the tree and i not to believe in the first that i do truly see aught and sudden i to know that i see somewhat and behold my heart do bind in I so that all my body do waken for i know that mine own maid do run slow and staggering toward I through the wood and i do be now upon my knee and upon my hand and do begin again to creep and to bleed and do make little calling to mine own that have no sound and mine own draw nigh and do rock and stagger and do strike anon against the trunk of the tree as that she do be go near blind with she running and in a moment she see I and that i do yet live and do come unto she and she make a strange and loving cry unto I with a great gladness and with a utter weakness and she come run and be lose with faintness and do sway this way and that stumble and she go sudden to the earth and do be still and i creep onward so speedy as i might and the earth to seem alway as that it move from my hand and to slide and this-seeming to be of my weakness for my hand and my knee go everyway and my head to be that it keep nod forward very stupid to the earth and lo as i come anigh unto the maid where she do lie so quiet i see that something move in the wood and be run and truly it do be a humpt man and come forward very silent and with a quick slyness as that he do track the maid secretly for he lookt alway to the earth and i perceive that he be that one of the humpt man which the maid have cut with the knife for the blood do show upon the shoulder and the breast and this bleeding mayhap to have slow the man so that mine own do be like to have suppose she have come utter free yet he to have find she by track as i perceive and i strave to my foot that i should come to the maid before the humpt man and surely i gat upright and go with a strange running and do roll and lo i fall immediate ere i be come to she and the humpt man to run also and surely it do be a dreadful race for i go creep and do be weak and as that i be of lead and the humpt man come very swift and brutish but i come the first to mine own maid and i rise up at the humpt man upon my knee and i swing the disko and the great weapon do roar in my hand as that it do know and do live and the humpt man run in upon I but i smote he truly with the disko and he run past I all blunder and fall and die upon he face a little way off and lo my wound have brake out into a great bleeding and my head do roll upon my shoulder and i lookt down dull yet with a utter great love upon mine own and there do be no proper wound upon she but yet be she all bruise and knockt and mark with the tree and where she do fall in she running and she do be there very still and dear and i to have brake my heart with love for she but that i do be so dull as i have tell and i fight that i should be strong a little while more against my weakness and i strove that i set mine ear gently upon she breast that i should listen for she heart but my head do go downward something clumsy and heavy upon she and i then to hearken and surely she do live and she heart do beat though in verity mine ear do have at first a thunder but afterward a quietness in they that make the sound of she pulsing to seem a utter long way off and very faint it do be and surely in that moment even as i hark i be go over into a deadness and have no more know neither to have even a knowledge that i do be slipt from my sens and behold the maid do lie swoon and i to be there in my broken armor and my head upon the breast of mine own and likewise to know naught and about we the quietness of that country and the far noise of the great fire-hill that do sound through eternity xiv on the island now i come unto my sens and do be in pain and a great forgetfulness and bewilderment and i strove that i rise but do be hold by a strange force that do be surely my weakness as i to know afterward and i be upon my back and a little sound do be near I as that something do pant and i turn my head very slow because that i do so lack of strength and lo i see that the maid do be anigh to I and do be yet naked and do pant and pusht hard and desperate with a great pole which do be surely that one which i have cut when that the humpt man come upon we and therewith i remember all and perceive that i do be upon the raft and the maid to push the raft along with the pole and at that i make a little sound with my mouth but the maid not to hear I for she do look backward as i should think to the shore and she face do be very set and anxious and there to be a far noise of howl that i know to be the voice of the humpt man and so to perceive that the maid have come unto she sens and have gat I somewise to the raft whilst that i do yet be swoond and thus to save I ere the humpt man have come but in verity how she do this thing i never to learn neither she to know but only that she love do give she a great and desperate strength that she save I that do be she man and afterward mine own maid do tell I how that she have come into she sens and do be there upon the earth and somewhat do be upon she breast and she see that it be my head which do be heavy upon she and i to be surely go out from this life for i be so still and she come from under I and do ease I out upon the earth and she heart nigh brake because that i be so be-bled and my blood to have stain all that do be near but when she have gat I restful she see that i do surely live and a great hope to spring in she heart and oft as she have ease I she have lookt about and there do be naught to the sight save the body of the humpt man anigh and the other dead about and upon the flat-topped rock as you to mind and she run then very speedy to the raft and bring water from the river in my headpiece and she dasht the water upon I but i to have no power to come unto my sens and lo in that moment she to know by some subtile tell of the spirit that there come some danger anigh and she then to make that she save I or that we die both of we together and she strave with I and do carry and draw I that weariful way unto the raft and she gat I on to the raft and she run then for the pole that do be beside the rock and whilst that she take the pole she perceive she tear garment that do be yet in the hand of the humpt man even as she have slipt they to escape he and she catch the garment very hasty from the hand of the man and run then to the raft and she pusht the raft out from the shore and leap aboard and behold as she make to use the pole there come a sound out of the wood and there run from the wood the two humpt man that do yet live and they to have trackt she after that she do run from they and they run downward to the shore very silent and intent upon she but she to work with a utter despair and to have the raft a good way out ere they do be come and surely they either to have no power of swimming or to know that there do be a dread in the water for they make not to come after but do stand and stare very stupid and afterward to howl and this howling i do hear when that i be come unto myself upon the raft as you do know and by this tell you to be so wise as i for more i know not save odd thing that i do learn afterward that do but set my love more holy unto mine own maid and these to have be but small matter of love-thought that we do have together and scarce clear unto my remember and lo even as i hark unto the howling of the humpt man the sound do grow more faint and far off for the maid work very desperate with the pole and i do feel that i would help she but yet be so a-lack and surely even as i do mean to rise i be go again utter from my sens and that dear naked one do pilot I safe and loving unto the safe harbour of the little island that you do mind and have no thought unto herself but only that she save I and i to be there scarce offward from my death and to have no know of aught and no more power to help or to be a shield unto mine own but do be only a helpless man that have surely die save for the care of my beloved yet do i fight a good fight and have alway a great joy in the remember now i mind nothing very clear after this for a great time but only of pain and weariness and of half waking and time when i do know naught and other when that i do be awake yet do have no realness either in myself or in any land or place and all to come back strange and vague yet with a constant know that there go love about I and a great and gentle watchfulness so that i be ease when that the black mist of my weakness do uprise about I to swamp I and i be make to know hope when that unknown despair do live stealthy within I and lo there come a time when i wake and do be free of uncertain burdening and peculiar woe and that still haze through which great aching do come constant upon I and surely i be lay very nice upon somewhat that do be soft and there go a sweet quietness about I and a healthful drowse do grow in my bone and slowly i perceive that the maid do kneel beside I and do look upon I with so great a love and gladness that it do be as that i drink in health and a drowsy joy and peace and surely she stoopt and kiss I with a utter gentle love upon my mouth and she tear to go sweet upon my face and truly i kist she again with a utter content and she take my head in the comfort of she arm and give I somewhat that i drink and when i have drunk she kiss I once again so light as that a pretty wind do blow hushed upon my lip and my head she make easy and lo i be go over unto sleep even as she tend I and thrice do i mind that this to happen and at the third time i know that my strength be come something into I again and i move my hand a little this way and that and she to know that i do need she to hold my hand and she to do this and i to go into sleep again even while that i look sleepy yet with all my love into she eye and when i wake for the fourth time i do whisper that i love she and surely she break into a sudden weep and do hold my hand very dear against she breast and when i wake for the fifth time i to know how thing do be about I and that i do lie naked in the cloak and do be all bandage about my body and the bandage as i do know afterward do be from the tear garment of the maid and i look at the maid and know that she do be drest again and do be in the garment that i do give to she as you to mind which do be that one and the inner that the humpt man tear from she and which she have slipt that she escape from the man and afterward i find that she have make a very cunning mend of the garment whilst that she do sit so utter long beside I to tend I for she have get thread from she torn garment and have make needle from thorn that do grow on the little bush of the island and the thorn do brake oft and she then to have another and so to persist a hundred time and this way she do be drest very nice and dainty and mine own maid perceive how that i lookt with interest at she and do mind very natural how that i last to have see she and she then to blush gently and do kiss I that she have she pretty face something from mine eye and truly i to wish the more that i be strong that i kneel in a glad reverence unto she for this way do be my love and ever so and you likewise that have truly love now i do begin that i grow very steady unto my strength again and mine own maid do tend I alway and she give I a broth of tablet and the water at set time by the tell of my timepiece and oft she washt I and do change the bandage and do wash and dry the bandage that she use they over again for we do be so lack for such matter as you to know and on the fifth day i be come utter to ease and do be wondrous happy and mine own to make pretty talk unto I but have I to be alway quiet because that i do be yet so weak and on the sixth day i to be let answer mine own and to say how great i do love she the which mine eye have say alway while that i do lie in silence and i to be assure by the maid that she do be in health and recover but indeed i see that she be go very thin and that she eye do be weary even while that they have so great a love and a gladness to I and i make mine own to bring she tablet by I as she do alway and when that i have kist they and she to have eat and drunk i bade she to make I the broth ready and when she have make the broth i askt that the disko be set anigh to I and afterward i bid she to my side and have she to lie by I and i take she pretty head upon mine arm and tell she that she to lie thus and to sleep and to have no fear that she weary I for that i to be but the more rest to have she so beside I and she in the first to trouble that she be too heavy for mine arm but truly i show that my strength be something come back to I for i prest she gentle unto I and she then to nestle content and to be go into a utter sleep and to have be in a sore need of the same and mine own do sleep for twelve great hour and have scarce any life in all that time save when once she do make a little and gentle moaning and do afterward set she pretty face more nigh to I in she sleep and surely i have neither weariness nor lonesomeness but do lie with a utter content and do look downward upon the maid where she do sleep in the hollow of mine arm and truly she do be most wondrous lovely and dainty and the goodness of she face do seem as that it make a holiness about my heart so that my spirit be uplift in a quiet and constant glory of love and i drink a part of the broth at the third hour and at the sixth hour and at the ninth hour when that i finish it and my right arm do be free to this purpose and to the disko and surely i do twice and thrice set my hand upon that great weapon as to a true comrade and in verity i could think the weapon do know and do love I and this think to be because i do be so uplift as i have tell yet truly the disko do be a strange and wondrous thing and do be alway thought to have a oneness with the man that do use it and in the twelfth hour the maid awake sudden and come upward out of mine arm all in a sweet haste that she know that i do be well and she do be ease wondrous when that she see how i laugh with a quiet joy but to see she dear eye and she pretty trouble yet do she be in reproach to herself when that she lookt to find how the hour have past but indeed i do make a mock sternness with she and forbid that she even to say one little word more upon this matter but to be glad that i do be so utter happy and she likewise and truly when i have say this that impudent maid do set she little fist against my nose and to threaten I and in verity i laught so hearty that the maid do be in fear i should set my wound again to bleed and do reproach herself again but in truth i come to no harm and when that i could speak i askt the maid whether that there have be brother to she because that she do play so natural and this i askt not think and lo in a moment i perceive my thoughtlessness but say naught save to take the hand of mine own that she know utter that i do not be heartless and she to nod very quiet and afterward kist my hand and slipt from I and i know that she be go a little way off lest she weep and i do be in trouble for she and for mine a-lackness but truly i could do naught only that i call very gentle unto she and she to return soon and do smile loving and cheerful upon I but indeed i see that she cover she weep whilst that she have make I new broth yet before i would take the broth i would have she to mine arm and she to submit very glad and happy but to keep she pretty weight from I lest she hurt my wounding and afterward we both to eat and be happy in glad talk and presently i do sleep but would have she to be nigh to I even though she do be wakeful and so we to be utter content together now the seventh day as it might be call be a wondrous happy time and when i wake the maid do be sleep as a child to my side and she face nestle against I and she to waken in a moment for thus have she drowse and watch through all the hour whilst that i have sleep and we then to eat and to drink together after that mine own have make I easy with a gentle wash and care and i now to be allow that i have my tablet whole and the water afterward as when that i do be well and this to please I as you shall think for i do ache that i be strong very speedy that i have power to guard mine own maid again and to go forward with we journey that i have the maid unto the safeness of the mighty pyramid and surely now that i have my tablet whole i to feel that i do grow near unto fitness again and moreover they do satisfy my hunger the better than the broth and the maid to give I my tablet oft so that i eat a great many and i do make she to count and surely there do be sufficient if that i get strong pretty quick and so i make no refusing of the tablet for i do need they that i make blood again within I else should i be lack when that there come any need anigh and we kist each the tablet of the other and do drink from the same cup and do be utter happy and do be part like child but also to be man and maid and presently the maid do shift my bandage as alway and washt I proper and have I into comfort but she do keep I alway very low-lying and truly i scarce to mind for i be not get enough of my strength to give I to feel irk and further as you shall think there do be that lovely one with I alway and do make sweet quip unto I and talkt and do laugh and oft do come into singing for she do be so sweetly joy that i be in life and do mend so proper and afterward she go off from I a little to she toilet but i to ask that she be so swift as might be and she to promise very merry and she come back in a little while and she hair to be in a lovely cloud about she shoulder and she pretty foot yet to be bare from she bath which she have in a pool beyond some bush and she to say that i do be so impatient a man that she to be force that she do the half of she dress with I but truly she come thiswise only because she to know how i do delight in she thus and to watch the way that she set up she abundance of hair and she to be hungry also that she be with I and to love I that i watch she even while that there do be oft a little and quaint stir of shyness in she dear heart and i have she to come beside I and to sit anigh to my hand and i make presently that i do scold she because that she have no proper care to she pretty foot and i bid she to set she foot toward I that i look the more close at they and she to be a pretty rogue and do think i to mean to kiss they -- and truly not to think alway wrong -- but i then to have another planning for i have pluckt a hair very sly from she head and she but to have say a oh to I and to have think no more but indeed when that she give she foot to I i hold they so strong as i might and i bind she pretty toe together with the hair and surely she do be a captive unto I and we to laugh as that we to be both child and afterward she steal back she foot from I but in verity i know that she have a wondrous heed that she brake not the hair that bind she but do sit beside I bind in that pretty way but yet to hide from I that she do not brake the hair and she then to do she hair upon she head very lovely and afterward i put up my hand and take it down again and she then to kiss I and to ask how that she should ever have it proper upon she head if that i do alway so tease she and she then to take she hair and do set the abundance of it upon both side of my face and then to kiss I as i do look up at she from out of so much beauty and afterward she cut a lock of my hair and a lock from she own dear head and she do plait the two lock together so that we hair do blend and be together and afterward she hide it in she bosom but i do be then out of content and would have do likewise only that it do so weary I to uphold my hand and she to cut a second lock from my head and a second tress of she own most lovely hair and she make I to kiss the hair that do be from she and she then to kiss the hair that do be from I and afterward she do plait they together and give they to I and i set the hair for that time under the great bandage that go over my heart and truly she do be then the one that lackt content for she to say that the second plaiting do be kist and the first to lack but i to refuse to exchange so that we make up a quarrel and do presently have to be kist unto forgiveness and truly have you not likewise know such glad foolishness when that you be in the love-day and she then to make I to be quiet and to keep my hand downward from she hair because that the uplifting do prove overmuch to I and she take my great hand then and do threaten how dreadful she use I if that i be not humble and truly i say that i do be a humble man and she then to hold my hand with but one small one and surely she hand do be so small that she not able to hold I save by the thumb and she then with she free hand to cover mine eye so that i might not see and whilst that she do hold I thus so utter helpless she to kiss I very dainty and impudent upon the mouth and afterward she loost I and do be demure and we do be then silent a space and presently i put forth my hand that do be very great yet to be go white and to tremble because that i do lack so utter of blood and the maid to know what i do mean and she clench she hand into two fist and set they both into my one hand and surely they do be little fist and i then to be happy for this do be a wondrous pleasure alway unto I and she to have she lid a little downward upon she eye and to be quietly happy and truly how i mind it all so plain and afterward i do plague she very gentle that she to be all a-lack if that she do try to use she hand to aught because that they do be so small and she in a moment to have she two arm very dear about my neck and do kiss I with a utter love and tenderness upon the mouth and afterward go from I lest that she have I to overset myself and i do then to make she to sit by I and i do tell she a tale how that a young man do once live in the olden day and do meet with the one maid upon all the earth and how that they love and do be marry and she to die and of the utter and desperate madness of grief that nigh destroy the man and how that he sudden to wake into the future of the world in a new time and do come to learn that he own do also to live in that time and he then to make that he find she and do truly come unto she and how she do be different in she beauty but yet to be utter lovely and the man do hold a utter reverence to the maid that have be he wife in the olden dream-day so that he reverence of love do live in he like a constant pain and anguish of sweetness and trouble and of holy thought that do be breed of she lovely companionship and of he memory but in truth i gat not further in the tale than this for mine own do have come sudden into weep and have get to she knee and do hold my hand against she breast and do put she hand gentle upon my lip and in a moment she to whisper somewhat through she tear and there to be dear motherhood within she face and a sudden shine of memory in she eye that have be near dreadful only that it do seem to be to she as that she be part dream and the strange and solemn pain do come also unto I through the part-open gateway of my memory and i to remember very clear and with a anguish in that moment and i tell mine own how that the babe have go onward after that the beloved have die and there do be then a utter quiet upon we and lo sudden the maid do bend unto I and i to take she into mine arm out of the vague dreaming of she memory-dream but ere she do be come outward entire from the haze of the past she to try to set somewhat into word concern this memory-vision of the babe but someway to be strangely dumb and i do be silent likewise because of all those thing that do be between we forever and forever and presently she kist I and be herself again and she go from I to attend unto we food now that do be truly a lovely day for i to have gat sufficient of strength that i do be able to have interest and talk with mine own maid and she now to be well rest and to have ease in she dear heart concern I and surely we oft to laugh and do make jest utter glad and foolish and indeed i do mind how that i askt mine own a olden puzzle that do come out of the vagueness of my memory-dream and she to be like a person that doth hear a strange familiar thing and lo sudden she to say as that she gat knowledge from beyond eternity that it do be when that he be a little hoarse and you to know the jest and to have trouble it oft at school but in verity it do be a strange thing to have from we memory out of all the deep of time and we in truth never in that age to have see or to have know that ever there do be a horse or to mind the likeness of one and this to be but a little matter yet of strange and peculiar interest as you to agree and indeed we do both to look one at the other when that we have end and do wonder what a horse do be yet in the same time do have a vague inward know and so we to look ever backward through dim age and surely we gat presently from jest unto solemnness and the maid to be nigh again unto tear and in truth i then to bring we thought and we speech forward from the abyss of the year and do cease from memory-dreaming for that time and so to have the maid again in joy yet mayhap something wistful odd while and presently i to tell the maid a hundred thousand thing concern the mighty pyramid of which i have so oft say somewhat but never to have gat so great a chance as this unto a plenty of time and so nice a oneness in the way that we mind do go and surely the maid do be eager in a moment and do be husht and again to ask constant concern all matter and in verity there go a great while this way and the maid to have a utter wonder and excitement of all that i to tell for truly it do be as that a man of this age should come downward from a great star in the heaven and to tell of wonder and new thing and you to understand how she do feel and of all thing that do most have a happiness unto the maid i to perceive that the great life and humanness of the million to dwell within she imagining as a cloud of warmth and quiet joy for i do show this thing to she so well as i be able and in truth you shall tell I in honesty whether that i have make the same likewise clear-seen unto you and she as you shall mind do be a maid that have grow all she life in a refuge that do be shake with haunting because that it lackt the power of the earth-current to protect and with a people that do be weak-conceive through great thousand of year and where love do bloom something fade even in youth and youth to have lack of the life-blood of a utter joy such as do be ours and likewise to many that do be of the mighty pyramid though truly there do go million then as now that do never to know love though the name do be in they mouth and they to have belief that the sweet kernel do be in they heart but in verity this to be love that you life shall bind in you with abundance and joy dwell round you and you spirit to live in a natural holiness with the beloved and you body to be a sweet and natural delight that shall never be lose of a lovely mystery that doth hold a perfect peace each unto the need of the other and all to be that there go round about you a wonder and a splendor all the day and the night that you shall be -- the man with the woman the woman with the man and shame to be unborn and all thing to go natural and wholesome out of a utter greatness of understanding and the man to be a hero and a child before the woman and the woman to be a holy light of the spirit and a utter companion and in the same time a glad possession unto the man and lo if one to die then the soul of the other shall fail and that one never to have full life again in that bitter parting and this doth be the true human love and all else that be not like to this with the man and with the woman doth be but a borrowing of the name of love for that quiet desiring which be but a endurance beside love which doth be between they that be not mate both in they soul and in they body and this tell to take no heed to those base joining that be make for purpose of wealth or desire or other piteous end for in verity these to have no more dealings with the thing that i do tell upon than have the merchanting of goods or the _ need _ of a glutton but the thing that i do have upon my heart doth be that dear and uplift power of love which i to set forth in this mine own story for in truth i to have know love and to need death when that i be part from mine own now surely mine own do come twice and thrice unto weep as i do tell of this thing and that which do set she memory backward unto the way of the lesser redoubt and presently i do cease from my telling because that she do so be go into pain of she memory but indeed she then to beg I that i go forward again for truly she to need in the heart that she know and to strive to be no more in grief for the tell and i then to say on and do tell upon the might and wonder and great olden delight of the underground field that be below the great redoubt as you do know and i tell how that they go downward a hundred strange mile that do be dig of the labor of million and of the year of eternity and i set out unto mine own concern that there do be wondrous village spread through that great and hidden country that do be in the underground and how that great million of the people do live there and make a constant labor in those deep land and country that do be truly so monstrous in all as a huge continent and i show mine own how that there do be wondrous process that do be learn in the age and how that water do be make in chemistry and truly she to nod to this because that she do mind upon the powder that we do use but truly the powder to have to be make in the first as you shall think and we but to advantage ourselves of that which do result and i to speak to she of the making of the powder rather than of the way that it afterward to make chemistry with the air unto water and i tell the maid how that there do be mighty underground pipe that go across the night land and do be mayhap oft so much as twenty great mile deep in the world and do come upward into the sea of the land and all to have be make secret and hide from the monster of the land as i to know from much reading of the history and mine own then to tell I that they do lack to have any such great wonder below the lesser redoubt but that there do be utter monstrous cavern where that there have be alway a strange and uncouth country of husbandry and light from the earth-current and they also there to bury they dead and all have be a-lack through great thousand of year as she do know of they record and have grow dim-lit and lonesome and a land of deepness to starve the spirit with a utter strangeness and discomfort where that the man go quietly as ghost through many age and all a place in dire want of sound and laughter yet this all to have be surely different a monstrous age go when that the earth-current do be a power in the lesser redoubt and the human to be in plenty and of good and natural health and courage of life and truly to mind upon that place doth alway to set a fresh wonder in I that mine own do be so lovely and wholesome of spirit and wise and in knowledge and good force of she being but so it do be with she and she to have be surely alway that one that do be mine own and i then to tell mine own maid concern the lowest field which do be the country of silence and be the place of memory unto all the great million where do linger and bide the ghost of a hundred billion grief and the drift thought of sorrowful heart and there to live a great hallowedness and a mystery of silence and a holiness and a greatness as that it do be the expressing of all that doth be noble and everlasting that ever do come out of the heart of man and all the lose dead of eternity so that the spirit of a man do seem to go on great wing unto lovely and splendid resolving if that he but to walk lonely awhile in that country that surely do be never lonesome unto the spirit and lo the maid do be all husht as i do speak and do look downward unto I with she eye very bright and lovely with the thinking and tear that do stir within she and sudden she to ask whether that i do make my resolve to my journey whilst that i walkt in that place and she to look very intent and beautiful upon I as she do question and indeed i see that she to mean a lovely praise unto I as you to perceive and truly i do feel a little strange as that i do be both glad and shy in the same moment and she then to ease I of any answer for she gat upward upon she knee and she put she two hand to the side of my face and bid I to look into she eye and to know that she love I with she soul and with all that do make she to be and afterward she kist I very gentle upon the forehead and do be then husht awhile as that she to be in thought yet oft she do look downward at I and do have a beauty of love and honor within she eye so that they alway to shine as she do look at I and presently the maid do sit again beside I and slipt she two hand into the one of mine as do be ever my desire and she to love that she give I this delight and likewise she to have joy to herself in this lovingness and we then again to have talk and i do tell mine own somewhat of the history of the olden world and she do have dim memory as in dream of the day of light yet scarce that she could believe it of truth but she to have knowledge of the olden love day within she spirit and to mind that there do be alway as it do be a lovely and golden light upon the world but she not to know truly whether this to be but the holy glamour-light that memory doth set about a past loveliness and to have no remember of the sun but yet to be make ready by she memory unto believe and i to know of certainty but yet even i that do tell this my tale do but perceive the day of the light as in a far and vague dream and to remember it but in the chief by the glory of lose sunset that have cast a holiness upon my heart and of the hush of dawn that have make ready my spirit in the go age to look quietly unto my death and surely you to go with I in all this thing and to have feel within you own spirit that uplift wonder that doth shake the soul with the lose beginning and with the unknown end when that you have lookt through the sorrow of the sunset and stand silent before the quiet voice that doth make promise in the dawn but in verity we that have near lose we memory of the surety of these great wonder do have memory of love and this to be most beautiful unto my heart for it but to show the more how that love doth live forever and doth make a holiness in all place and doth give companionship and satisfy so that to have love be to have all and to have escape this wonder be to have miss to have live and i to find then that mine own do have no knowledge of the way that the world do be in that future age and do lack to know that there abide mightily above we in the everlasting night the dead starkness of the world where do be -- mayhap two hundred great mile above we -- snow and the eternal desolation of a lost world that do be once the lovely world of the olden day which do be now give over unto night and silence and mayhap there do wander upward there memory and do go companion by grief but indeed i to delight to think that hope and love do build house of joy about the dead and there to be no true death but only the die of day yet surely this doth be sorrow enough unto the heart and the soul if that they do be day when love do make a mystery of light about the spirit and the beloved to have be anigh to make ever a sweet wonder unto the heart but i to cease from these thought for we to face we life brave and wise and to take both the sorrow and the joy unto we develop and to hold up the face with courage when that grief doth come anigh and to see that we grow not to bitterness but unto sweet wholesomeness and there to be joy again and we then the better able to have that delight into we heart for how shall joy ever to come truly again to that heart which bitterness have make a place for the abode of sorrow and truly i to cease from these thinking also for my story to wait upon I and these thing that i do say do be plain unto you and to have no need to the tell and so do i tell mine own maid of the thing that i do learn from the little metal book and she to be in a constant wonder and delight and with a awe and newness upon she and sudden there do some olden memory stir within she for she askt I in one instant whether that i do remember when that the city do move alway unto the westward but truly i have no remember of this thing and do look at she awhile with somewhat of a trouble upon I for that there should be aught lack in my memory of those time that we do be together upon this world be a fear unto I and a vague sorrow alway if that i do but to let my thought go that way though indeed i do ever strive to wiseness and do have knowledge that there doth be a heart-wearing and despair and needless trouble in vain regret but yet these to be natural unto the spirit if that you to know love and do be but the complement of the love-joy and mayhap to have a use unto the sweetening of the spirit if that they be not let to over-ride the reason and whilst that i do look unto mine own that she help I to remember she do strive with she memory but in the end do fail to come unto aught of clearness save that she do see as in a far dream yet very plain a great metal roadway set in two line that go forever unto the setting sun and she then sudden to say that she do see in she memory the sun and she to have a strange and troubled amazement upon she and there do be city upon the great road and the house do be strange-seeming and do move forward eternally and at a constant speed and behind they the night do march forever and they to have a even pace with the sun that they live ever in the light and so to escape the night which pursue forever as she do tell and a dread and terrible chill that do live in the night and there do be city far forward in the morning sunshine that do have go before at speed and set the husbandry of the world and to be finish and go forward again ere that certain of the latter city do come to that place to the reap and the night to come presently to that place but this not to be for some part of a year after that the crop be take but how long this might be she not to remember and all this the maid do say to I as out of a strange dream and i to have set it down and to have make it so clear to you as she to have tell it and surely it doth be plain then that she to speak of a time when that the day do be grow to a monstrous length because that the world do turn but slow and weary and it to be a sureness as you shall perceive that but to stand still in that age of which naani tell be to be leave presently in a utter night and chill that should last mayhap a great and weary year and in verity it doth seem that all humanity do travel forever in that strange age when that to stay be to die unprepared in the bitter night and to go forward be to be forever in the sun and truly this doth be so strange seem to I as to you and much i question the maid and do have a hurt within my heart and a pain of jealousy and sadness to grow in I for surely she do speak of some life that she do live when that i do be elsewhere either in life or unknowing and in verity what man then should have teach mine own to love he and she then mayhap to have have no remember of I and truly i question very desperate and the more so because that i be yet weak and lack my strength to be compose but she neither to remember I nor any other man of that time and to have no memory save these bare thing that she to have speak out so strange and which do come sudden unto she out of all the deepness of the year and the lose sorrow and joy and wonder of that which doth make a world of human and surely my questioning bring a distress upon mine own both because that she do be trouble by the way that my love do bring I to this strange anguish and because that she also to have pain and a sudden fear that there do be ever a time when she not to have know I or to have permit the arm of another and she do then strive that she be both wise and strong and to give help unto I and to take reason unto she own easing and truly she to show how that she do be all unknowing of any love in that far backward time but it to be possible in reason that she to have go to another in natural course the while that she heart do yearn alway in vague trouble unto she own that she spirit do mayhap never to have forget and truly this doth be the way of life and a bitter thing and a sorrow to joyous love to think upon yet i here to be set to the telling of truth and to have heed to all that reason doth show to be but mine own do also have we both to remember that there do be equal right to think that she have die mine own maid in that life for that it do be not out of reason to think that she have be void-hearted unto all man because that she have know in she spirit that she do once to meet she own and do be thereafter untuned unto all other man that ever do live and this all to be in a mist and we to go vainly and of she will she do think that no man do ever to have possess she save i yet this to be mayhap only the prompt of she love and she then to kiss I and to say that there do be no surety in aught but only that we do have be together before and have bear a love so great that it do live through eternity and we to be now together and maybe all else to be but dream and truly i do have a fierce hope that this be so and the maid likewise so to hope yet to be less bitter with rebellion than i though in pain upon the thought for she do be so utter and dreadful glad and in happy thankfulness that we do be now come together again in the end and do mean that she conquer all that should be like to set a greyness upon we joy and to be steadfast unto this end and i afterward to be likewise in wisdom when that i be come the more to strength and to mind that i suffer vainly for that which do have no surety as i have show and moreover i do have no power upon the past either to learn aught or to mend aught so that i do go the way of a human and do shake free from these brooding and strive unto forgetfulness which in truth doth be both a terror and a mercifulness as doth chance and i kist mine own maid with somewhat more of the year within my love and she to kiss I very sober and dear and to desire only for my happiness and to be utter mine own now we then to eat and to drink and the maid to see I unto comfort in all thing and my bandage all right and she then to make that she have on she footgear and she hair to be bind but indeed i bid she that she to dare do this thing when that she to know how i do delight that she little foot be bare to mine eye and she hair most lovely upon she shoulder and she to be very happy that i so to have a utter pleasure in she dear beauty and do sit beside I again and set she foot very sly where they do be anigh to my hand for she to know that she do be mine own and i to be she master and she to have joy that she to have to render she beauty unto I for she do be that true complement unto I that the heart of a man doth ache for eternally and so presently do end that lovely day of quiet speech and togetherness and the maid do prepare I for my slumber and she then to lie anigh to I and she head to rest gentle beside I so that she pretty face do be near unto my breast upon the right side and she to give I at the first a loving and sober kiss that do be somewise to set a guard upon she tenderness and afterward do sleep content and gentle as that she do be in the same moment a child and a woman and i also to come unto slumbering yet do know vaguely how that mine own do rise a little upon she elbow this time and that and look very loving into my face that she have assurance of my comfort and well-being and once i do waken proper and lookt at she and she then to kiss I gentle upon mine eyelid and bid I to sleep and so do come herself unto she sweet slumber now when that i do come to my proper wakening i to hear the fizzing of the water and to know that the maid do be rise a good while and have make she toilet as i perceive in a moment when that she come unto I for she hair do be in a lovely cloud upon she shoulder all comb and make ready against my waking and she to have bath as i suppose in some warm pool that do be among the bush upon the island and she now to slip she foot-gear that she foot be bare unto I as i do love and to stand a moment and she eye to twinkle gently and i lookt at she with love and honor in mine eye as you shall know and she to have dancing of sweet pleasure in she heart that i so to look upon she with holiness and with natural love and surely the last doth be unnatural if that it do lack the first but my love do burn upward out of my be so that the flame of my spirit do light the fire of my heart and my reason to add coal unto that fire that have live for ever and doth be as that it shall be never quench and mine own in a moment do kneel beside I and truly someway in she deep intenseness unto I for we love do make all the world holy and she to be both uplifted and as that she must give all the humbleness of she heart unto the greatness of my love and this she to feel and she deep and utter love to make it as that she do be all a passion of humbleness unto I so that in she soul i do rise in that moment upon the wing of my love and to seem that i do be all the world and all time and all place and all that ever she do need unto she and she put out she arm to I and she eye do shine with those tear that do never be shed and lo in a moment she do be upon my heart and we two to be husht together in content for we need do be in the other and truly where there do be two together with love there doth be neither lack nor need but eternal fulfilment and in verity this to be my hope for that which doth come afterward -- that all doth be lead unto so glad a joy as this and that all pain and grief and all that doth make the shaping of life doth be but a process by which we be eternally perfect from live unto living unto each fulfilment that doth be but the doorway unto greater fulfilment in the beloved and presently mine own maid do loose herself gentle from I and washt I and tend I and very husht and tender and something down-ridded of she dear and lovely eye and we then to eat and to drink together and joy so great and quiet do be upon we that it do be as that we have go into a eternity of peace and a utter content and surely as the thought do stir in I it do be of beauty that we do be both of we true unto the other in that life and i never to have kist a maid until that i kist mine own and she to have be likewise and to have fend all man from she because that they do be stranger unto she inwardness and so we two to be so utter together both in that we spirit do be knit be each the complement of the other and because that we have no secret pain of remembered thing to set any apartness between we heart and in verity i to think back then upon my jealousy that i have tell and to know that mine own do never to have give herself lightly to any neither to have take lightly and she spirit to have be alway mine through all the everlasting and mayhap this to be how all people shall come to be in the length of time only that to we have come the great wonder that we do early meet though this also to bring that utter pain which doth seem to slay when that once you have know the beloved and to be part and so i to think and do presently ponder with a great and strange pity upon they that do not yet have meet the beloved and they mayhap not to have keep all for the beloved but to have be light with that which doth be the treasure because that love have not come to show they that they do unknowingly squander the strange and holy glory which doth be the possession of they that shall come to the beloved and say all that be thine have i keep for thee and the beloved to know and to have peace in the remember but what doth be the peculiar sorrow of they that have go over-lightly when that they shall meet the beloved for then shall there be a constant and inward regret as a thorn in the heart that they not to have observe alway that holy care of all which doth pertain unto love and they nigh to moan in the spirit _ if they have but know if they have but known _ yet in the end of they pain shall they grow unto all loveliness if that now they have truly come upon love and to live with love for this to be the especial glory of love that it doth make unto all sweetness and greatness and doth be a fire burn all littleness so that do all in this world to have meet the beloved then do wantonness be dead and there to grow gladness and charity dancing in the year and there to be yet one thing upon which mayhap i not to have think sufficient for it doth be this that they who do err as i have show shall be the greater for they _ pain _ and let this be to cheer you if that you have do foolishly and think not upon that day when the beloved shall come for pain be but the voice of development or destruction and truly you to suffer the first if that love doth work in you but truly the more that you have lack the greater shall be you pain for the more change there doth need be in you and so would i have you now to think and to know that the beloved shall come and so shall you live in glad care of all you be that you be able to come unto the beloved in that day and to say with beauty and human joy in you heart even as i have say and thus shall you miss that bitter pain but yet truly you to be like to heed not this until that love doth come upon you and i therefore to cease from this vain setting of mine inward reasoning but truly when that day be come as i have tell you to know how that there go alway with I in this mine own story which i tell the simplicity of truth and how that i do be mind only that you to know and thereby that you have gentle wisdom that you lay not up pain for that day yet if you do lack to go with I you to need that develop which shall then come upon you and so shall you perceive how my thought do go to and fro as i do eat with mine own and so in the last i to find that i do think very serious and i then to cast from I this ponder and to have that utter joy which do be upon we and to seem that it do fill all that strange country of sea and lo after we do be do of eating and drinking which do be but a little time as you shall think the maid do ease I to a upward sit and have my back very nice to a olden stump which do be light and she to push unto I and mine own do sit then beside I so that mine arm do come most natural about she and she there to be nestle all gleeful and content so that my heart do be doubly tender unto she and i take the abundance of she hair and set it about my neck and upon my breast so that it do near to cover I in the upward part and we both then to laugh as that we do be two child because that love do make we so utter young in the heart and we hand to be hide under the beauty of the maid 's hair and i to have she then that she explain just how great she do love I and you that go with I do know how that this doth be a delight that be never do neither to be set only into word and all that day we do be wondrous happy save once when we see that there be humpt man upon the shore about the flat-topt rock where do be the fight but what they do there we not to be able to see only that presently they go away and indeed seem to have no thought unto we neither any knowledge and so do be go again into the forest and we see no more of they after that time and afterward we to be lose utter in happiness now upon the tenth day i do be so come into health that i to walk a little way to and fore upon the island and mine own do go with I and so i to pace a good while and afterward to rest again and mine own then to bring mine armor to I which she have scour very nice but truly the armor do be sore break and bent and do be jag inward this place and that with the monstrous strength of the humpt man when that they do strike I with the great sharp stone and in verity how i should ever come again to wear this protection i to be in doubt yet truly it have be a wondrous suit of strength that have keep my life within I when that i have be so deadly beset and i to know that it to be yet like to save both we life if that we could someway straighten it and ease the broken jag from wound I afresh and i think a time and the maid with I and afterward we gat that stump upon which i have lean and have this to be for a anvil and we find then smooth stone of different size and these to be for hammer and we work all that day with resting upon the armor and surely we beat it into a very good shape from the inward and the broken part we beat smooth so that they should not wind and in the end to have mine armor fit to go upon I and i by now as you shall think to be drest part in my garment but not all for there do be yet some of the bandage upon my body so that for the main i do wear the cloak that the bandage be easily come at and all that day do be utter happy whilst that we workt for we to be together and on the morrow as we do say which be the eleventh wakening upon the island the maid and i to talk long and oft whilst that we yet work upon the armor and we to ponder the best way that we continue to we journey for indeed i be not come to my strength yet be i very earnest that we go forward early but in the same time i do fear lest that we meet with aught of danger and i to be a-lack because that i be yet weak and presently the maid and i both to think upon the same thing for she to cry out concern the raft and i to have the same word in my mouth and in verity this to be a great thought for then should we be able alway to be free of the humpt man and to have frequent rest when that we be weary and to sleep with a ease in the mind and indeed i to hope that the labor of oar should be something less than to go upon the foot and surely we talkt upon this a good while and afterward we leave the armor and go over to the raft and so to learn whether we should have power to make it something more stable and that we have some way that we should put a solid matter between we body and any monster that should chance to swim under we and we go then together over all the little island for i do search for some bush that should have a long tendril in plenty and supple and so to suit for binding but truly there do be no such bush in all the island and this to put I in trouble as you shall suppose yet be there a sufficient plenty of small and upright tree that do seem very good for any purpose of structure and when we have go all about the island and find naught that should bind the maid to say with a pretty jest that we should cut she hair and plait it to be for cord and surely even as the word do come from she they to set I upon the thing that should supply we need for i stoopt sudden to the grass that do grow oft and plenty in this place and that and be so tall as my thigh and to my head in the middle of the dumping where it do sprout and lo it be wondrous tough and the maid to have likewise perceive the think almost at that moment but i to have be the first this time and so to tease she for truly we have grow that we do nigh alway to discover all thing in the same instant as you mayhap to have see but i do surely be first this time and must kiss she as we do kiss little one that they be ease in they dismay and disappointment and she to see how i do mock she and she to pretend to weep and surely how could she even to pretend when that she do not be able to keep she pretty mouth from search with laughter unto mine but must be kiss full and plenty in we constant joyfulness and we cut then a good arm-load of the grass use the knife and have those to we camp for we do be homely now unto that place as you shall think and the maid then to show I plait and how that we could work in the grass piece by piece so that we should plait unto any length that we to need and all that day we workt and do be very happy together but when that we come to the time of we slumber the maid have do twice and thrice so much as i and surely she come over to I and kist I very grave that i should be not to fret even as i do kiss she with gentle mocking concern the think about the grass and so do she make level with I by this impudence and quaint sweetness and on the next day which do be the twelfth i take the disko and on that day i cut down six of the tree and alway the maid do bring she plaiting that she be near I and when i have cut the six tree she have I to cease lest that i risk to open any wound and truly they to have heal very wonderful and afterward we to plait all that day and do also finish the armor and do be content and utter happy and on the thirteenth day i count the tablet and find that we yet to have sufficient if that we come unto the mighty pyramid within any reasonable time but i insist that i should eat no more now than do be my usual way and though mine own do beg and to coax I and even to try whether that a naughty and loving anger should do aught to shift I i not to alter from my decide which be base upon my reason and upon my intention that mine own should never to go in hunger-danger whilst that there do be life in my body and when that the maid do show this dear and pretty anger i to take she into mine arm and to tell she how i do reverence and love she and that she do be all beauty unto I and i but to love she the more because that i do know the reason for she dear shape of anger unto I and she then to kiss I and yet to beg again that she have she way in this thing but presently i do show she that my reasoning be sound in this matter though i say not that my strongest thought do be unto she own need and she to have to agree with I in she brain even whilst that she heart do ache to feed I and truly i to love she but the more as you shall think and this way shall you ever to manage a dear and sensible woman that doth both love you and have reason in she for the wise man and he that have a heart unto bigness doth be never hasty to command but indeed i speak not now of the way that you shall go with a woman that have the love-foolishness upon she for this to be a different matter as you do know and a woman then to require a double wit and tenderness in the govern but also to need to be command mayhap with sternness yet with the more love now when that we waken on we fourteenth day upon the island we gat to work so soon as we have washt and eat and drunk and mine own to see how my scar do go and i cut seven more tree that day which make thirteen in all and afterward i trim the tree very nice and when this be do i cut twelve good sapling-tree and two more very thin that i do mean to be for paddle the raft upon the water and mine own maid do sit near I alway and never to be cease from she plaiting and whilst that the maid do plait and make gentle and happy talk with I i presently to sit beside she and have she belt-knife to my need and therewith when i have cut bark from a tree i make a foot-long cross-piece of wood which i do fasten with peg and some lash unto the end of one of the paddle-shaft and i take then a piece of the bark so big mayhap as would cover my thigh and shaped broad one end and thence to a point and when i have make hole in the piece of bark i lasht the broad end to the crosspiece and the end that do be narrow i lasht secure to the shaft and likewise make hole down the length of the bark and lasht it also thereby to the shaft and thiswise i have a pretty good paddle that do be about ten foot long in the clear shaft and the head to be somewise two foot more mayhap and when this be do i shape the handle so small as might come into the grasp of the maid and do jest she very loving and gentle that she give I so great a work because that she have she hand so little and truly she presently to stop I of my mocking for she put she pretty hand upon my mouth and i then to have to mumble and to laugh and so she to go forward again with the plaiting and when i have make the one paddle i make also the other but something more rough and heavy and suit unto my strength and so do be very well pleased for they do be make more of my reason than of memory yet have i use somewhat of the kind upon the quiet lake which do be in the country of silence and we then to join in the plaiting and thus with happy talk and we time of eat until that we do be come again to we slumber and on the fifteenth day when that we have get up and washt and eat and drink the maid do look unto my bandage and do consider that i be heal very good if but that i not to overstrain my body and we then to dance half in play and half in victory but gentle and afterward she to come with I that she give I aid that we get the tree unto the water and in six hour we roll the tree down to the shore and do begin then that i lash the sapling across the tree and thiswise to hold they secure into a raft and the midmost tree i put something more forward than the next and so until that which do be the front be shaped somewise like to the bow of a ship and the sapling to hold the tree thiswise when that i have set the lashing about every sapling and every tree where the sapling do go across and all that day i work pretty constant and steady until that mine own have I to cease awhile lest that i bend overmuch and so to put strain upon my scar and i to be reasonable but yet to go forward again with the work only that i do rest now this time and that and so do all to prosper and on the morrow which do be the sixteenth day upon the island i make a end of lash the sapling across the raft and i set up also two rest for the paddle so that we might row if we stand upon the raft and afterward be ready we gat together we gear and set all upon the raft and i put the pole that the maid have use also upon the raft and loose the strap from that first raft and have the strap for we requirement as heretofore and mine armor we make safe on the raft but the disko i have to my hip as ever and so do we be ready to leave that little island of refuge where we have be so near to sorrow but yet have come utterly upon joy and surely mine own do take I by the arm and she to stand a little and to look with I unto that bed of soft herbage where she have lay I when that i do be so nigh unto death and she then to kiss I very sweet and loving and gentle and all a-tremble with the tear and love that do stir in she and i to set mine arm about she in love and so we to turn and to put off then in the raft xv past the house of silence now it be in the tenth hour of that day that we put off in the raft and surely we find the paddle to go very easy and with somewhat of balance in the rest which i have set up as you do mind and the raft to go forward with not overmuch of labor so that we stand the maid to the fore paddle and i do be to the hinder one and we pusht very steady upon the paddle and have the raft presently to a speed something less than we should walk over the rough way of the land and about the twelfth hour we stopt and eat and drunk and go on again with we easy labor and truly when that we gat set to the movement we scarce to wot that we do aught more than rock something fore and back upon we foot and so the hour to pass and we to have a constant gentle speech one with the other and the maid oft to look back unto I with love and to set she lip that she tempt I but yet to shake she head most dear when that i would leave my paddle that i go forward unto she and when that the eighteenth hour of that day be come we to draw inward we paddle and the maid set the cloak very nice to be we bed and afterward we eat and drink and so presently to we slumber and do have sleep very sound and happy all in a moment as it to seem and eight good hour after we do waken both of we together and lo we scarce to mind where we do be for a little moment but afterward to know and to perceive that we do be safe and naught to have come unto we in we sleep and surely we laught each in the face of the other for we do be so joyous to be waken each unto the knowledge of the other and after that we have kist we washt somewhat in the water of the sea and so to we food and when we have eat and drunk we make again to the paddling and go forward thus along the coast very peaceful and content all that day now in all that voyaging do talk four good day of four-and-twenty hour each for we make no great haste or labor but go easy that i have time to gather my strength and naught to happen in all that time save that once we do see a great beast to come upward lumbersome out of the sea on to the shore and there do eat and browse upon the herbage in that part or so it do seem to we though truly we do be over far off to have surety and this beast not to put we into any horror but only to make we glad that we be afar off from it and by this say i to mean that it do seem unto we a natural thing and nowise to have a odour of aught monstrous to trouble we spirit and this way do be all the creature of that country and truly i do think the early world do be somewise like to it and this to seem to make true that olden say that extreme thing do meet as doth be over-apparent for thus doth it be somewise to we knowing as you shall perceive by you reasoning upon olden day and by the showing of this mine own story for that deep world to have put forth natural creature that do be even as might be those that do live in the beginning though i to make no point of this but only that it doth occur to my thought and all to seem that it do be breed of circumstance and condition yet this to have no say whether that there to be a spiritual-force something deeper than the circumstance for this to be outside of any surety but not offensive unto my reason but this thinking also neither to offend I that although much -- and mayhap all -- doth be modify and shapen diverse way by the circumstance and the condition yet doth there be a inward force that doth be peculiar each unto each though mayhap to be mixt and make monstrous or diverse by foul or foolish breeding -- as you to have knowledge of in the body of those dread monster that do be both man and beast yet also i here to say that maybe all diverse breeding not to be monstrous but this to be beside my point for i to be now set to tell as i have tell that it not to offend I to suppose that there to be this inward force peculiar to each shaping of all body that do hold that wondrous quality of life and if that you ask I that i give example to make clear my thought i to say that it doth be reasonable to suppose that the force or spirit of the human doth be peculiar to the human whether that it to be a cause of life or the result of that which have be evolve out of a condition and whether it to be the one way or the other you to know that where this force or spirit be find untainted there be man and i to be not oppose to think that man doth be constant alway in matter of fundament and neither to have be ever truly different though something modify in the body and surely in the first all undeveloped in the lovely thing of the spirit because that there to be no call to these yet presently they likewise to come and to act upon the flesh with refining and likewise mayhap there to be some act of the flesh upon the spirit and so to the state of this age of this we day and to that far age of which i do tell but development never to make the human other than the human for the development to have limit peculiar to the human and surely it doth appeal to I that the development of man doth lie between two point that be not wondrous wide apart and man to have power that he arrive very speedy from one unto the other and likewise that he go back so quick or even the more hasty yet even do it be ever prove that man once to be a fish i to have no cause to abate the first part of mine argument but to have the more need of the thought that i gain power to accept the fact for i still then to have no occasion that i think man to have be truly a fish or aught truly different from a man but only that he do be once modify physically to he need and to be still possess of the man-spirit though all lackt of development yet truly i to be less offend in my reason if that it be show that man do be ever somewise in he present shape though mayhap so brutish as the humpt man but yet i do be ready to consider all matter and do build no wall about my reason yet neither i to have a over-ready acceptance of aught but to need that my reason shall approve and you to perceive surely that i here not to speak of that which may be afterward when that all this we life be do for who shall say how much or how little we then to go forward unto loveliness and i at this point to tell you that i do have a wondrous hope of beauteous thing and of sweet and mighty uplifting and furtherance unto that glad world which we have behold the shore of when that we have stand in holiness with the beloved and in verity i now once more to my story and to be glad that i be do at this small setting forth of a matter which do need word because that it do have root in this mine own story and to be grow of it and from it now there do be one other thing of note beside the sea beast whilst that we do be upon the sea and this do be the strangeness of a great fire-hill which do stand in the sea and we to pass very nigh unto it and surely the sea do boil about it yet not in all place and there do be a score great jet that do go upward a monstrous way and do roar very plain to we across the sea between and there do come strange grunting from the sea about the base of the fire-hill and these i to conceive to be make by the upbursting of gas in this place and that and surely it all to make we to know of the great energy that do be wakeful in that deep country and we yet to stare backward upon that hill of fire and force for a great while after that we have come past now beyond this there to be naught except that we have a certain care as we do come to that place where the great sea do be break to smaller sea but all to be knit with passage of water which let we through upon we way and surely i do show mine own maid those two place where i do sleep when first i be come into that country and she to be sweet in interest and alway to have somewhat that she would learn of this and that and so when that we do be four good day upon the water as i have tell we to come to the land upon a flat place of the shore where the country do slope upward unto the mouth of the first gorge of which you do mind and this to be in the tenth hour of that day and we likewise to have begin that voyage in the tenth hour as you do remember and surely it to have be a sweet and peaceful water-journey and i to have be happy if that all that do be yet before we to hold so much of pleasantness and safe going but indeed there to be much danger yet to come as you do know and we to have we heart set in courage and to go forward to conquer for surely if that we to conquer and to come safe into we mighty home there to be then that we have all we life together in loveliness and this to be truly a worthy prize and a glory of the heart to end and to repay we stress and surely the maid and i do presently strand the raft so well as we might and do then to wonder whether any should evermore to behold it through all eternity and we lookt a little each at the other and the maid then to cut free a small piece of the wood of the raft to be for a after remembrance and so we to have we gear upon the shore and the maid then to give I aid that i get once more into mine armor and so i presently to have the scrip and the pouch again to my back and the disko in my hand and all in readiness and the maid with she bundle -lrb- that be now grow small -rrb- and she belt about she body that she have she knife unto she hand and surely the maid then to kneel and to kiss the raft for memory do gather upon she and she there to have one more breaking from all that do be the first part of she life and you to give you understanding and so to have a quiet sympathy and to perceive that she heart do be like that it should stir with a strange trouble of sorrowing in that moment and surely i stoopt then very gentle and loving and have mine own to she foot and i lead she from the raft and she to need that she be near I and so we to go forward and to make upward unto the dark mouth of the great gorge and there to be some mile unto we right that grim and utter huge mountain whereon afar upward in the monstrousness of the night do be perch those four fire-hill of which i have tell and below they there to go upward the great hill of ash that have be cast down throughout eternity and this thing have the maid lookt upon for a great time and do be never do of she wonder neither i nor any human that ever should have sight of so great a wonder and so we to have come presently upward into the high mouth of the gorge and do go onward then into the gloom a little space until that we be come to the place where the gorge do bend sharp unto the leave into darkness and lo we make pause here and turn again unto the country of sea that we have a last outward look over all that deep and living land that do be hide so far downward in the everlasting night of the world and in verity it do be a solemn thing to know that we mayhap to be the last of the olden human that should ever to look upon that country and i to wonder in that moment whether that the humpt man should ever to develop in some far eternity unto the full sweetness of the spirit of humanity which i do think to be inward of they and this to be both a odd and a natural thought to have then as i do see but at that time i only to think it and not to wot or to trouble whether that it do be odd or otherwise and i to think that country do be somewise as the olden time renew but truly we to look upon early thing with new eye and we yet to look awhile and to be husht and to hark in those last moment unto the far mutter of the great fire-mountain and the fire-hill and the noise of life which do go over that land and we even then to be but a few short pacing off from the silence of the great gorge which should lead we presently toward the eternal strangeness which do be in the night land and the maid do hold mine arm very close as we lookt we last into the red light of that deep and hide country of the world where in verity we have come so utter nigh to we death and presently i turn and the maid slipt she hand into mine and the tear do go silent down she face because of all that do be prest upon she heart but yet not to be all of sorrow for there to be both sorrow and happiness and also there do be somewhat of vague emotion that she never more to look upon that dear island where she have nurst she man again unto life and well-being and she to be in mind of all those place where she to know that in after-life she memory to wander and she to have oft-told tale mayhap unto she child of that country that they never to see but only to be for a wonder to they for ever and we past then round the mighty corner-place of the gorge and go forward somewhat stumble into the gloom now we go sixteen hour very steady and with naught save the great darkness to trouble we and we by this to have be twenty and six hour since last that we have sleep and surely this do be a foolishness because that i to need that i come into my full strength ere we reach the night land and it to be a folly that i should over-tire myself and the maid to have say so much and indeed then we come to a safe place for we slumber and whilst that we eat and drunk we make count from my noting of the outward way and so do decide that we go no more than sixteen hour ' journey each day through the gorge and to sleep alway for eight good hour and this we to do both then and until that we do be come out of the great gorge which do take we in all so much as five day thiswise and surely when that we be come into the light place of the gorge we to be more cheer as you shall suppose yet oft do we be half smother with the horrid gas that come upward in this part and that as you do mind and my strength do grow constant as we journey yet would the maid never suffer that i carry she but go alway very light and clever and be grow in truth set unto this constant wander and at this place and that i to make pause that i show mine own those place where i do slumber and she alway to need that she come unto the very part and that she stand for a little moment where i do lie so lonesome as i go outward unto that despairful search and alway she then to be utter tender with I and to be something lack of speech because of the calling of she heart and surely mine own do be alway now to ask I when that we should be come unto the night land and to require how far it should be and to be take with a grow of excitement very dear and natural and in verity i to be almost so much so as she and to wonder what she to think of the mighty redoubt and of all that strange and monstrous land and above all these i to be shake unto my very heart that i have the maid speedy unto safety lest after all even though we to have come so far there somewhat to happen of woe and all this do make it a hard thing that we not to begin to race and to exceed the hour that we do set but truly we have wisdom in this matter and slumber alway after the sixteenth hour and we never to see aught of life in all that great and desolate gorge for there do be only the gas-burning and the boulder and the stark rock and oft the rank smelling of the gas and alway a utter and everlasting quiet save when some lonesome gas-fire do oddly to moan or to whistle and the whistle to sound very dree across the great waste of the gorge and likewise the moan to be but a thing to make the loneliness to be feel in the heart and the maid to feel thus with I and alway as i do know she to think in she heart that i do come through that place alone to make a search for she into the unknown land of the world and surely i do be but a natural man if that i be something happy in my heart that mine own so to ponder and to remember for thereby do she love seem ever to grow and likewise a man doth be glad in he spirit and natural pride that he maid to know that he have do wholesomely of he best for she need and you but to think upon the love-day and to hear the echo of those dear proud thought that do so to swell in you and doth not all to go so strangely with familiar pain in the old way now it be upon the fifth day in about the seventh hour that i hear oddwhile a sound in this place and that of the gorge as that the rock make husht and strange sound at we and i to have the maid instant very nigh to I and the disko to my hand and we then to go onward with a great caution and thrice we do pass place where gas-fire do burn and dance and make oft a low moaning and somewhile a little whistling and the other sound yet to come oddly from the rock in this place and that very strange and unthought of yet to be something familiar and sudden it do come to I that there to be a far-away noise in these sound though they to seem to come from this place and that almost to mine elbow as you should say and lo i know then that i hark unto little echoing that do be catch by the near rock and to come from some far and mighty sound and this should be surely the monstrous piping of the great gas fountain that you do well mind and in verity i tell mine own in a moment and she to be all eager with I because that this do be both a wondrous thing and to be also a landmark to show that we do be nigh to come out of the gorge and we journey to come the more near unto a end and surely we lookt ahead very earnest and there to be so many strange and leap fire to we front that we not to be very sure which do be the far and monstrous dance of the great gas fountain for truly it to be yet so distant that the near gas-fire do make more upon the eye up all of a weary length of the gorge than do the great dance of the far-off fire that be now so small by the distance and presently when that we be go onward something more we to see that there go a lighten and a darkening afar along the gorge so that the background of the night be make to lose somewhat of the intensity of its darkness as with constant shudder of light and this to be surely the far away dance of the flame of the great gas fountain and we then to watch alway as we journey and to see how that the vague shuddering of light do grow in the distance of the night and do merge and become known presently in a strange uplifting and fall of a far away blue flame and the sound now to come more steady and to grow in a long while into a monstrous piping very great and wonderful and have a constant change in the note and we to come past the last of the lesser fire and to be in that part of the gorge which do be fireless save for the great upward dance of the gas fountain which do now to be grow huge and plain-seen and do make a quake light over all the gorge and so in the end we to be come very nigh to the dance of the monstrous flame and do be half stunned by the noise which do be now a utter and furious roaring as you shall remember and the maid and i do stand as but two lonesome stranger in the mouth-part of that deep and desolate gorge and do stare voiceless unto the great flaw and mine arm do be about the maid and she to stand very nigh to I and neither to speak and surely how should we anywise for the noise do be so huge and after that we have stare a great while we turn that we look each at the other and we kist very sober there in the light from the monster flame and afterward we do stare again at the flame and soon turn and lookt all way and do marvel to see the great throw of the light go blue and spreading and strange unto great distance and a while we do be watch the way that the far-off side of the gorge do come plain to sight when that the flame do leap and truly that do seem a far and lonesome place as that a lose and forget world of desolate mountain do be there and lo we now to look that we should see somewhat of the way that we journey to go and surely naught to be clear show save when the flame do rise oddwhile to a monstrous height and this to be because of the huge rock that do stand about the flame yet something i be able to show the maid of the bottom part of the mighty and utter monster slope that do be the last way of we journey ere we be come to the night land and we then to go onward for about a good mile that we be not so deafen by the noise of the gas fountain and it do be now beyond the seventeenth hour so that we eat and drunk and make we rest in a secure place among the great boulder and lo when that we wake we eat and drunk again and do be something silent as we to gaze at the flame dancing monstrous and lonesome and all set about with the stark and mighty rock which do be like unto giant of silence that do watch forever and presently we have we gear upon we and we go forward toward the utter dark of the mighty slope and we begin that huge climb that should last through day in a eternity of night and oft in the first hour do we turn about from we blind stumbling and gaze downward out of the long height unto the loom of the flame that do shudder far below in the night and make a quake light in that far darkness and so do we leave it to dance forever through eternity in that deep and lose place of the world and we bent all we will and we strength unto the climb and this way go we stumble for sixteen great hour and by that time have come to a pace proper for that task and to be something numbed and seeming grown unreal because of the affect of the darkness and lo for eight day then do we go upward forever through that most dreadful night and after the first day we creep alway upon we hand and we knee and i to go in the front and have the disko ready upon my hip and i take two of the strap from the pouch and the scrip and so have a certain length and i set they from the waist-belt of the maid unto mine own belt and so do know ever that she come close after I and we make journey sixteen hour long and do eat and drink at the sixth and the twelfth hour and likewise we eat and drink ere we sleep and again upon we waking and we slumber-time to go alway somewhere about eight good hour for thus do i be heedful that we have all we strength for that dreadness of the journey which do be yet before we across the fear and horrid terror of the night land and oft at this time and that i be utter sicken and a-wearied of reach forward and upward forever and make blind fumbling that i find a way about great boulder and the rock and hole that do be in we path in the dark for it to seem that we go lose from all life and know in a blackness that should be never slacken from about we and i these time to make a pause and to call softly unto mine own that she creep up nigh unto I and i then to take she into mine arm out of the utter blackness of that night and so to give and to have comfort and surely mine own do whisper once unto I that she do be stun with love and wonder in the heart for she to never cease to know that i do adventure through this great night that i find she and this thing do make I very warm in my heart as you shall think but yet i to stop she speech with a gentle kiss and she then to know that she be dumb concern she thought in this matter yet she never to cease from remember it and do be the more stir with the trouble of she lovely secret worship for in verity she to have I to be for she hero and this to make I in the same moment both something shame and greatly proud and so we to be together and after such pause to go forward again with a new courage and surely it do be a great comfort to I to think that because we to go upward and not downward we be not like to fall over any hide cliff in the night for i to have now some little know of the slope from mine outward journey yet to remember upon that monstrous pit that i then to escape and so to go with care and indeed upon the second day i have mine own to creep more nigh with I and i then to have but one strap between we and the other i set a stone into and do cast the stone alway before we as upon the outward way and you to mind you of this if you but to think a little minute and oft in those weary day in the darkness do i make gentle whispering through the blackness unto mine own that i give cheer unto she and she alway to answer very sweet and loving yet ever husht as i do be and in verity it do be as that we could not set we voice loud upon that mighty slope lest some enchantment come upon we as it might be say and indeed each time that i cast the stone the noise of the stone to make a little trouble and dismalness in mine ear for all do be so quiet and desolate and lose in night that it to make we to need to be likewise so quiet and to desire that we might go upward so silent as shadow now surely i must tell here how that the maid to have alway at wake that same awaredness that i do have upon the outward way that somewhat do be nigh to we and to seem to have be concern with we waking and i likewise to have also the same knowledge as before and oft as we do go i to feel that somewhat do go near to we and this to put something of a fear upon I because that i be ever anxious for mine own and i to have she to be alway the more nigh to I and do set the strap from she to I even when that she sleep so that she not to be touch and i to lack to know yet she to have no fear concern this thing but to feel in she spirit that it do be a force that have no evil intent unto we but more neither she nor i to know and i in truth to come in the end use to it save that i do be as i have tell anxious in all that do concern the life and well-being of my beloved and so do we go onward through those eight day and it soon to be grow cold so that we both to need the cloak over we in we slumber but in the journey-hour to need naught for the upward-going do surely heat we very well and there also to be come presently a change and a seeming of thinness into the air and the maid to remark upon this and likewise that the water-powder now to be that it not to fizz so plentiful and we go upward as it do seem forever and journey very husht and steadfast and likewise do halt at set time that we eat and drink and do alway sit then very close and quiet and in love and so alway to go never beyond sixteen hour ' journey each day and very weariful even so much for it to be a sore and constant labor of climb and i to learn the hour alway by a little shine of the disko upon my time-dial which i have tell do be somewise as the watch of this we present age yet truly i also to learn that i make somewhat of a constant number of forward-throw of the stone in a hour and the maid to be the first to discover this as she do creep behind I and hark steadfast and quiet unto the clatter of the stone each time that i cast it and she sometimes to call low to I that it now to be this time or that time and i to look at my dial as i have tell and oft to find that she do be curiously right yet otherwhile we to have no thought to count but make a constant husht talk one to the other and do grow odd time that it do seem to we that we do be two spirit there in a everlasting darkness that have quiet speech one to the other and to be seeming go from we body and we then to need that we look each at the other that we know truly that we yet to live and to be indeed with the beloved and i then alway to make the disko spin a little yet something more than when i should see the hour and in verity we face then to show pale and strange seeming in that luminous glowing of the great weapon in the darkness and we to look very eager and a hunger of love each at the other and so to need that we be hold loving by the beloved and so to have comfort and assuredness and afterward to have peace to go onward again and it do be one such time as these that mine own to give I a love name she have call I in those olden day of _ this _ age and which surely i have not hear since mirdath die and in verity you to have dear understand with I how that i then to be all trouble with vague trouble and ghostly love-ache in the heart and likewise i do be all set about in a moment by the olden enchantment and speechless glamour that do be so long hide and lose in the space of memory where surely the spirit doth wander such oddwhile husht unto a dumb tearlessness and to know in the same moment both agony and the voiceless glory and lose delight of the hath-been so that it doth be as that you wander in the spirit between the sorrowful pain of the sunset and the promise of the dawn which doth be build upon the need and hope of the soul and doth also to have a essence of pain within it because that these do be knit with longing which doth be the essential pang of memory and so mayhap you to have go with I for you to have also strange thought that do come out of the year and do hurt the heart even whilst that the heart doth hunger of that which doth so pain yet truly mine own do be now with I as you do know so that i have joy all about my heart yet do all the year of my lose delight and of my pain be in the space of my memory and mine own now to have stir all so that no word that do be ever shape of man should help I to have ease in speech and mine own maid to know how it do be with I and she to have say the thing scarce wotting even as she spirit do set it through she lip and she before then to have forget so utter as i and now she to be stir likewise with I so that in verity we to hold hand in the great darkness upon the slope and to wait till the pain and strange trouble do go somewhat from we heart and we to have power again to know truly that we do be again together in sweet verity after a mighty eternity and thus do we go and even in that strange night to have a everlasting come together so that surely we two spirit to be nigh make one somewise and this to be that sweet and holy thing which i do name love and it to be my glory and astonishment that love have come unto I and with you that have love i be as a brother in holy delight but with all that have not know love or to have miss love i be a mourner and my heart to pray that they to know this wonder ere they die for else shall they die so green and bitter as they be bear and to have grow nowise unto ripeness which doth be charity -- the end of life and the crown of humanity and surely i to go forward again now with my tell and you to know that on the eighth day upon the slope about the end of the ninth hour there to be a upward seeming of light afar before we in the darkness and do show as a dull and vague sheen above we in the night and truly i to know that we do be come at last a-near unto the night land and we go upward then very eager through the dark and the dim shine do grow ever so that we soon to see it very plain as a loom of light afar upward and we ever to climb and to go onward and lo in the fourteenth hour of that day we come up slowly out of the night upon the slope and stand at the ending of that strange road where the silent one walk and surely it do be as that i be come home and to have set my foot again upon familiar land and this to bring to you how far off i do seem to have go and now to be come again to a known place and we go upward upon the road until that we do truly have topt the slope and at last to look out over all the wonder and mystery of that land and i never to be rid of the utter gladness of know that i be come there again after so strange a journey and that mine own have i bring with I out of all the unknown world yet truly i also never to have forget that this familiar land of strangeness do be the last test and the greatest dreadfulness of we journey and anxiousness do hang upon I for i now to have to take the preciousness of mine own among and beyond all that danger of horrid force and of monstrous thing and beast man and the like and truly i do be like to trouble and in verity i do stare with a fierce eagerness unto the far-off place in the middle part of the night land where do be the mighty pyramid and surely it there to shine in the midst of the land and do be mine home where never have i dare hope i should return and i set mine arm very swift and eager about the maid and point so that she see quickly the wonder and safe mightiness of that which do be we refuge for all we life to come if but that we to win unto it and the maid to look with a great and earnest soberness and a lovely gladness and utter soul and heart interest unto that place that bare I and where i to have come from and now to take she and long and long she lookt and sudden come round unto I and set she arm quick about my neck and burst unto a strange and happy weep and i to hold she gentle to I and let she cry very natural until that she be something unpent and lo when that she be ease she to stand close beside I and to look again unto the mighty pyramid and afterward as she to steady she to ask a hundred question so utter eager and so to thrill with joy and excitement as that she do be a glad child and a hundred question i answer and show she new thing and wonder uncounted and of all strangeness that she then to see there do none so to shake she in the spirit with terror as do that dreadful and horrid house which do be the house of silence and it be as that she very be do know and be repulse of some horror that do concern and be in that house so that she to want to hide in the bush that do be anigh to the road and truly i to think this wise and to remember and to be ware suddenly that we do be indeed come now into the power of monstrosity which do be utter and forever abroad in that land and surely we go then in among the bush that do grow clumpt upon the side of the road as you to remember and afterward i calm this new fear that have come so quick upon mine own and she then to peer forth with I from the bush and to have renew sight over the land and the house of silence to stand upon that low hill of which you do know and do not be a very great way off somewise toward the right yet as you shall have remember it do take I some long and bitter hour upon mine outward way ere i do be come from under the shadow of it as we do say unto the top-part of the mighty slope but this to have be in the main because of the utter care that i do need to bring I safe past the house for i to have go long and weary upon my hand and knee among the bush as you remember and oft to pause and to be so still as death lest that the power of the house to have become aware of my passing and truly we to need again so utter a care when that we make to go past unto we mighty home and this to be heavy upon my heart and i to be in the same moment anxious that we have haste to the trial and yet very willing if it might be that we not make it forever and indeed after that we have peer a good while from the bush i to consider that we do well to eat now and afterward to have a safe place for we slumber so that we go fresh to the horrid danger and dreadfulness that do be before we upon we way and we then to look about and soon to find a great boulder that do be set with the bush and we make we place for sleep against the boulder and the bush go all around so that we do be complete hide and in verity we to be very cold as we have be those two past day whilst that we make toward the top of the mighty slope and now we to have the full chill of the night land and do be very glad to have the cloak so that we eat and drink whilst that we sit together and the cloak round we and afterward the maid set the cloak about we for we sleep and we then to kiss very sober and i with anxiousness in the heart but she with less because she to have rest in I and so we lay down to we sleep and the disko ready in my hand and my spirit wakeful against any terror that should come anigh to we in we slumber and the maid i warn to be likewise wary and surely we sleep and wake and there have go eight good hour and naught be come anigh to we to harm we and we eat and drink and do hark oft and lookt out from among the bush but there do be naught abroad to set dread upon we spirit and so we do be more content and well rest and a-ready for the further journey now i have the maid to wear the cloak because of the chill of the land but she in the first to refuse save i also to have it in my turn but truly i do feel that it should smother I and that i need all my freedom of my body lest there come any thing sudden upon we and all this i show mine own and also that we should have weary work and to creep much so that i should be warm by my labor of go and she likewise mayhap and she then to consent because she see that i do be earnest and to burn with anxiousness yet have I to promise that i take the cloak if that the chill of the land gat I anywise bitter now we make a pause when that we have we gear upon we and we lookt well out over the land and surely alway we eye do gaze in the end upon that far wonder of light and safeness which do be the mighty pyramid and i to be never cease from tell mine own this thing and that thing concern the great refuge and she to be constant stunned unto silence and delight of wonder and anon shake unto a multitude of questioning so that truly we do be as that we never to have do make known one unto the other now as you have knowledge the house of silence stand upon a low hill and the road do bend about the bottom of the hill and this way do i come when that i be on mine outward way yet now there to be a new plan of journey come into my mind for as you do remember i do take somewise of eleven great day from the pyramid unto the top-part of the mighty slope because that i have go diversely and round about to the north-west of the plain of blue fire and surely as now i lookt it do seem that we should try a short passage and thereby be come free out of all danger in but a space of four or five day if only we to succeed and i stand a good while very husht and anxious and do consider this new way and do presently point it out to the maid how that we see the mighty redoubt straight to the back of the low hill where stand the house of silence and mayhap we might chance to find a safe go that way and that i do ponder thatwise for indeed as you do know we must go _ nigh _ past the house even do we return by the long journeying and this to be because that the bush do make a cover only near to the road and all to be a country of bare rock beyond the bush on that side of the road which do be to the north and west now presently i have form my intention regard we way and tell all to mine own and how that we to have alway a utter caution and the danger i make so plain to she as i do know it and she then to beware in she heart the need there to be of care and wiseness forever as we do go and we then to make forward into the night land and to be go from the top-part of that great deep in which there to be hide strange land as you do know and surely it to be like that none should ever to go that way again for a eternity or maybe forever and so go we forward with a new caution and we come out from among the bush upon the north-west of the road and crost unto the eastward side and here the bush to grow very plentiful so that i lead on with a cheerfulness of hope within my heart and alway i go so far to the south-east as the bush would give we they cover and this way i make that we should scarce to pass within a great mile of the dread and horrid house though in verity this to be most dreadful close and we walk then for six hour and go sometimes creep and oft stoopt and ever with a great caution and in the sixth hour we make a rest and eat and drink and afterward go forward again and in the tenth hour be we come something nigh unto the house for truly we to be off from the road where the silent one walk and so to go more straightly and alway to save distance and we keep so far outward from the house as we might but could pass it not more than a great mile off because that the bush do have they margin near upon we leave as we go and there to be barenness of rock beyond and fire-hole in this part and that amid the starkness of the rocky space that should be like to show we very plain if that we come outward from the bush and moreover there go upward into the everlasting night one of those tower of silence which do be in this part and that part of the land and be think to hold strange watcher and the tower stand great and monstrous afar off in the midst of the naked rock show very gray and dim save when the flare of some great fire do beat upward in the land and send huge and monstrous light upon it and we to have need alway now to remember this tower and to keep the more so to the sheltered hiding of the bush yet in verity we to have little thought of aught save of the grim and threatening terror and monstrousness which do stand forever upon that low hill and do be the house of silence and in the eleventh hour we do go creep from bush unto bush and do be as shadow that go in the mixt greyness and odd shining of that land and the grim and dreadful house do be now unto we right and do loom huge and utter silent above we in the night and the light of the house do shine steadfast and deathless with a noiseless shine as that they shine out of the quiet of some drear and unnatural eternity and there do a seeming of unholiness to brood in the air and a sense of all and deathly knowledge so that surely we hiding do seem but a futile thing unto we spirit for it be to we as that we do be watch quiet and alway by a power as we slipt gentle from bush unto bush and when the twelfth hour do be nigh we to begin to draw clear of the house and surely there to come somewhat of ease into my brain and heart for it do be as that we should come clear of all harm and i turn to the maid that i whisper gentle and loving encouragement unto she and lo in that moment mine own give out a sudden low sobbing and be go still upon the earth and truly my heart do seem to die in I for i know that there do be direct a force out of the house of silence which do be aim unto the spirit of mine own maid and i catch the maid instant into mine arm and i set my body between she body and the dreadness of the house and surely my spirit to perceive that there beat out at she a dreadful force which do have in it a utter silence and a bleakness of desolation and lo i saw in a moment that the force have no power to slay I but do surely make to slay the maid and i set my spirit and my will about she for a shield if this might be and i have she to mine arm as that she do be mine own babe and i stand upright for there do be no more use to hide and i know that i must walk forever until that i have mine own to the shelter of the mighty refuge or to walk until i die for only with speed might i save she from the dread and horrid malice of that force and i set free the disko from my hip and have it in mine arm beside the maid and i stride forward out of the bush and put forth my strength that i journey with a utter speed and ever my spirit do know of that monstrous force which do be direct upon we to the destruction of mine own maid and odd while as i walkt i call mine own by she olden love name and by the new name of naanus but never do she move or seem even that she live and surely my heart sicken within I with a mighty despair so that a constant madness do begin to thrill in I and to make I something monstrous in strength with my fierce agony and intentness to save and one hope only have i that i bring she yet live into the shelter of the mighty refuge and so swift to the care of the doctor and lo i do strive to be wise in my despair for i make a quick halt soon and i warm a broth of the tablet and water upon a hot rock and strove that i set some of the broth between the closed lip of mine own maid yet do it be useless as i to have know before in my heart and alway i keep my body and my will and my spirit and my love between the maid and the dreadfulness of the house and i make some of the water and dasht it upon the face of mine own and i chafe she hand but truly it to have no use neither do i truly to think it should be like to and i wipe she face then and hark to she dear heart and surely it do beat very slow and husht and afterward i wrapt she in the cloak and i force myself then that i eat some of the tablet and i drink a great lot of the water for a fever do seem to burn in I and moreover i to mean that i lack not for strength to my task and i set my gear upon I very speedy and i lift mine own beloved that do be now so husht that once have be so merry and dearly naughty and surely i nigh choke as the thought uprase in I but i set it back and do but go the more furious and surely no man do ever go so fast and constant upon he foot through a eternity for i be come again to my strength and there do be a madness of intention and despair upon I and i go on forever and at each sixth hour when i stopt very brief to eat and to drink i make to bring mine own to she sens yet she never to come and alway she heart to grow the more feeble so that in the end i do utter fear to hark and do but set food and drink into I and onward again with a utter fierceness and why there come not any sweet power of goodness to help I in my strait i never to know but do call desperate upon all good thing to aid I as i go to save mine own but there naught to come so that i have grow into cursing but that i do not to lose my wisdom to any useless foolishness and alway as i go i to see the land blindly and oft vague and gray as that i do look at naught real and again with strange flashing of light and the glare of fire and anon to see the land as it do be and all odd while to have now to I the feel of a dread and monstrous dream and surely i speed forever through the dreadful hour and go neither to the right nor to the left neither do i strive to hide in the bush nor to evade aught for i know that the maid die slowly in mine arm and there to be no more gain in life save by speed that i have she swift to the mighty pyramid to the care of the doctor and a great and despairing madness grow ever within I and thrice i to have a vague memory that there come creature at I from the dark of the land but surely i slew they with the disko and have no remember thereof only that mine anger do boil in I and i to know once that the disko do run blood in my hand and lo there to come sudden unto my spirit the knowledge that the aether of the world do be stir and indeed i do be surely sight by the great million of the mighty pyramid and they to have see I come forward into the sight of the spy-glass and that i do bring a maid in mine arm out of all the night of the world and truly as i do after learn the dear master monstruwacan have discover I great hour before for there have be a steadfast watch keep in the tower of observation for my return if that ever i should return and the might of the great spy-glass have show I plain a good while go and that i do carry somewhat that be surely the maid that i do go to find yet have the master give a order that no word be set abroad to the people of this discover lest that the emotion of the million to tell overmuch unto the evil power of the land but now have the million also come unto knowledge for many have cease not to watch through they spy-glass and the news to travel very speedy through the city and surely now there do be a constant spiritual noise in the night to be hear only of the spirit yet to suffice to wake and to warn all that land and truly as i after to learn the master monstruwacan do know by the instrument that there come a force out of the house of silence and this to trouble he greatly so that he set the word through the pyramid by the hour-slip that all the people strive to contain they emotion lest they bring a harm and a destruction upon I by warn the land with the greatness of they feeling yet in verily this do be useless for the people do be very human and could nowise check they gladness and great wonder and excitement for it be to they so great a wonder almost as we should suffer if that a man in this age should go beyond death in search of he beloved and afterward to come backward unto the living and surely in such case how mighty should be we amazement and this to be somewise how they do be yet with it also a sweet and natural gladness and strong welcome which doth be the true beat of the human heart unto the wanderer and presently and through all the time that i come forward across the land there do be mayhap a hundred million that do never cease to watch I from the embrasure from the view-table and from all vantage yet for a long while only they which possess strong spying-glass do be able to see I truly for i be a great way off and million do but stare vainly unto that part where i be say to be and the hour-slip to come out four time in the hour and to tell aught that do be know and so shall you perceive that humanity do but have grow the more human and in verity i go forward with all my strength and do drive heedless through the mile and the night and scarce conscious of aught because of the ache madness of despair that do grow ever within I for i know that mine own maid die alway in mine arm as i do carry she and later a monstrous space of hour it to seem i know that i be come to that part of the road where it do bend somewhat unto the vale of red fire and this do be something anigh to that wilderness where the youth do fight with the giant-men and i come over the road and urge my body utter furious across the land and surely in that moment when i cross the road great number of the million do see I that have not see before and there go a shake in the aether of the world because of the sudden emotion of so mighty a multitude and lo it do be as that in that moment the land be at last wake for there come from far away unto the eastward a faint and dreadful laughter as that a monstrous be laught unto itself in some lose and dreadful country and the laughter pass over the land and do echo strangely as it do seem in this part and that part and presently to go roll round in the far and hide west land and to be as that it wander awhile amid the far mountain of the outer land and be presently lose from my hearing and my heart chill a little maybe but yet do i not care over-much for i to lack all if that i lackt death if that i not to be give power to save mine own yet do i make a little pause so that i gat the knife from the belt of the maid and do also to bare the capsule for if that there come a destruction upon we i to make instant sure that mine own maid be safe unto death and i then to go quickly with the capsule and afterward i again upon my way and ever upon each sixth hour i do stop that i eat and drink and do onward again even as a machine for i command myself to this duty of victual that i lack not my strength unto the saving of the maid yet truly i do seem to choke alway as i strove with the tablet and lo ever as i go forward do the land awake and my spirit to know that great force do be abroad restless and the monster to begin wild roaming because that they also to know of the unrest that do be come into the land and there to go presently odd roaring across the land from night unto night and i to go forward the more desperate and to step neither to the right nor to the left but to make direct unto my mighty home and the vale of red fire do be soon afar off unto my right and the bulk of the watcher of the north-east to be somewise unto my leave before I and the great back to be toward I and truly i lookt at the brute-force and it do be as that i draw nigh unto a mountain of watchfulness and above it in the everlasting night do be the blue shine of the luminous ring and the ring shed a light downward over the monster-force and the shoulder do be huge and humpt even as two small hill and it lookt forever from I through eternity unto the pyramid and this to be plain though i do be a great way off from it and sudden as i go there come somewhat out of a bush unto my left and rise up at I very long and tall and surely it do be some kind of a man and come at I and my fury and my despair come inward upon I in a moment so that i trouble not to set down the maid but leap at the thing where it do be yet half hide in the dark and lo it die in piece and the disko do roar to content my heart a instant and i then onward again the more savage so that my heart do be a dreadful thing within I and a great while i go then and do have a vague remember that this time and that there come thing at I from out of the dark but surely they to have die very speedy that i not to remember more and the hour do pass in space of time that do be make of terror and numbness and a utter and evergrowing fury of despair and i do be at last as that i do burn inward with a grim and dreadful energy and to seem to grow the less tired and to come over the land with a stronger ease and somewhat as that i do desire thing to come unto I that i have something to ease my heart for lo mine own maid do be die in mine arm as i carry she and i to be in a bleak and sickened dread so that i lack all courage now to listen unto she heart as i have tell and go burning and dry and hot in the eye and ever there sound the roaring across the land and there do be add presently lower and more horrid and dread noise and later i hear a far thud of the earth and in a little there go past I a great man run so heavy that he do make a shake as he past I yet in verity by a sweet mercy he see I not and be go onward in a moment and lose utter into the night and the aether of the world to be full of the trouble of the people as the man past I and afterward there to be a stir of glad thankfulness and truly alway my spirit do know strangely as in a dream that the million set they sympathy and pity and help about I and do gird I about with human love and with encouragement and with uplifted thought yet in verity do all be as water beside the fierce wine of my love and despair which do urge I onward in a natural lack of all dread save for mine own and truly this doth be the way of love and shall make fearless the heart of the weakest and there to be prayer in the night and all the aether to be surge with the spiritual trouble and calling and crying of the million so that indeed if that my spirit so to hear these thing it to be conceive that these do pass outward into the everlasting and to break upon the shore of eternity in a anguish even as a visible foam of supplication and surely the unity of love of the million do make a natural force about I for in verity the force that do come from the house to seem to be somewhat ease from the maid yet there to be no surety in this for all do be desperation and turmoil in my heart and i to have but one thought in my brain that i bring mine own swift across the land unto the mighty pyramid and so unto the doctor and lo there steal presently from afar the deep and dreadful baying of the hound so that i know we do be surely dead save that a miracle should happen and i askt in my heart in a fierce and mad fashion why that they do not to rig one of the olden shooting weapon that they shoot from the pyramid and so to give I some aid in mine extremity and behold even as i do be so bitter there go afar upward in the everlasting night where do shine the last light the sharp flashing of the set speech and i do warm in my heart a little with hope for the master monstruwacan do see that i be now all discover and there to be no more use for silence and do speak straight and helpful unto I and i make to read the set speech but mine eye have be mad and near blind with lose hope but in a moment i see clear and behold the dear master monstruwacan bid I to keep good my courage for that they do have make ready three of the olden weapon and moreover they to save I even if that they have to turn loose the earth-current over the land and he commend I with honor and that i strive forward yet a little while for that a hundred thousand man do be prepare and do even then go downward in they armor by the lift and surely as you shall think my heart ease a little in I and there burn somewhat of a hope in my spirit that i yet to bring mine own unto the doctor ere it be too late and the baying of the hound do grow nearer in the night and there to grow ever the roaring over the land and a sense of evil and monstrousness to be abroad in all the night and lo i to have come by this so that the watcher of the north-east do be backward upon my left and i lookt keen and fearful now at the monster-force and behold the great bell-ear do quiver continually so that i see the monster make somewhat know unto all the land and the monster do look as ever unto the pyramid and do be a great and silent hill of life that do lean toward the pyramid and the light from the ring come downward upon the monstrous hide which do be set in vast fold and wrinkle upon it and the monster to know of I yet never to move neither to show life save that the ear do quiver so horridly and i know that they make some great preparation in the pyramid for we defense for all the night do begin now to shake and to quiver with the mighty beat of the earth-current xvi in the country of silence and lo i do be come something nigh unto the mighty pyramid and my great home go up vast into the everlasting night as a very mountain of sweet life and safety and have surely amaze I afresh with the utter bigness of it only that despair and weariness do have too grim a hold upon my heart for I to care of aught save to have mine own maid within the safe wonder of the huge refuge and it do be still afar off from I and i to go forward across the land with a strong going and lo as i past a hollow place where do burn a fire-hole there come something out of the hollow and the thing gat upward from crawl and do be a great and haired man and the man lookt at I and afterward come unto I and do put he hand forward very eager as he come and i do see the hand plain in the light from the fire-hole and the hand be monstrous and do be arm brutish with horrid claw so that the man should have be able to rip aught even as a wild beast and i put mine own very swift to the earth and surely i care not for life or aught for this thing do make to delay I and i to be fierce with despair that aught should halt I and lo i leap very furious and with cold anger at the giant and i smote at the monstrous brute but he unto the side in a instant of time and so escape the blow and he fling forth he monstrous arm out of the half-dark of a shadow that do be cast by the dance of the fire-hole and catch my head-piece and pluckt it from I so strong and brutish that he cast I nigh a dozen foot on to my back yet i be not harm in the life but only sore shaked and bruised and i to be up in a moment and come in upon the giant and the disko do roar and blaze in my hand as i swing the weapon and i gat the giant above the middle part and the disko do glut itself and go through the giant as that he do be naught though so huge and monstrous and girt with strength and he to have surely turn he shoulder as he die for the upper part of the giant-man go horrid to the earth and the leg and the trunk stand plain in the light of the fire-hole and the blood go upward as a fountain in the night and i make no pause but leap unto the maid and have she in a moment to mine arm and onward again past that dead thing that do only then to fall with a horrid sound and surely the night do be full of a astonishment and upliftedness of the million so that they spiritual crying do go all about I and do tell I that they have perceive this thing and do cast they love and delight unto I and a vast excitement to be upon they and lo i scarce to have go a great mile more but there come two vague thing out of a dark place where certain rock do upstand and i smote they with the disko and go onward but what they do be i never to know and surely after that i do seem to go smite forever for there to come time and oft strange thing out from the bush and the rock as that all the land do be a-crawl with foul and monstrous life and i to go smite as in a dream and to speed forward ever with a more fierce despair for surely the end of we life do be come and i not to be give power to save mine own maid and all the land do be full of grim and monstrous roaring and odd-wise lower sound very deadly and once i do hear the noise of giant run and all the night to be evil and in verity how i do not be slay by some dread force i not to know unless that i do be burn free of all weakness that a evil power should have chance to harm I through for indeed i have be deal a bitter training a monstrous time and lo there to be again the deep and dreadful baying of the night-hounds unto the south-east and to be nearer and i to know now that no strength of mine should serve to protect mine own and lo from the upwardness of the night where do be the last light there sudden to come downward a strange blue flash that smite downward into the land unto the south-east and again the flash to come and mayhap a score time after and there to come down out of the height a peculiar crackling sound that do be less than the thunder of this age yet more loud than any other sound that you ever to hear and lo i know that the human do begin to fight for I that i bring mine own safe unto home and behold it do be as that all the wakefulness of the land that have be do be but as sleep beside the wakefulness that now to come for surely the night now to seem to rock with the roaring of the monster and with the be-stirring of great force and ever there to go over the land the yowling of that strange and dreadful laughter which do come from that hide country in the night of the lose east and lo there arise constant now the hoarse and dreadful baying of the hound and make know that a mighty pack do be out and they to seem to be no more maybe than a good mile unto the south-east and i to be all alone save for the die maid that i hold in mine arm and i lookt vainly and with despair for the hundred thousand that do be prepare and have come downward as you do know unto mine aid but truly there do be naught to see anywhere save the strange light and shadow of the land and the movement of monstrous life in this place and that place and the hound to come nearer with every moment of time so that indeed i know that death do be very nigh and i cease not from my stride but go forward and do begin to run for the pyramid be not a huge way off in the night and the shine of the circle about it to be plain see save here and there where it do be hide strangely and i to have a despairing hope that i come yet with mine own into the safety of the circle and the baying of the hound to come ever the more near and surely it do be a doubly hideous bitter thing that i lose my dear one so nigh unto home and the great mountain of my home to go upward before I into the night and to seem so near that surely i do be almost there but yet mayhap two great mile off even then and behold i call out in vain despair and to no end why that none come to give I aid in this extremity for the hound do bay now but the half of a great mile upon my left and do surely have scent of I by the way of they dreadful baying and truly the million to have a anguish of sympathy for I for the spiritual noise of they emotion do be plain unto my spirit and they surely to have see and to have interpret the way that i do look about I and appear to call out in despair for there come all about I in a moment the companioning of a great and sweet spiritual force which do be breed of they quick go with I in they understanding and love and they to have perceive how that i do be unto the end of hope and the hound to be almost upon I and in this moment there come afresh to my hear the shake beat of the earth-current so that i know the human to take desperate means to save and there come to my view a vast pack of the hound unto my left and they come run at a great pace and they head do be low and they to be so great as horse and see plain and again in shadow all in the same moment as they do come and in verity i know that we two to be dead indeed ere a minute be go if that the human not to haste and i stand where i do be for there be no more use to run and i lookt from the hound unto the mighty pyramid and again to the hound and again i lookt with my hope go unto the pyramid for the hound do be scarce two hundred fathom off from I and there do be hundred of the mighty beast and lo even as i lookt that last time unto the pyramid there brake out a monstrous burst flame that do rush downward from the seal lower part of the mighty pyramid and the flame smite downward upon the land where the hound do run and all the night to be lose from my sight in the brightness and strangeness of that mighty flame so that i see no more the pyramid or aught but only the shine and dreadful glory of that flame and the flame make a blast in the night and a hotness that do seem to wither I even where i do be from it and i perceive that the human have truly turn loose the earth-current upon the hound that i be save and there go a constant great thundering over the land because that the earth-force do rend and split the air and do tear up the earth and the roaring of the monster do be husht and lose in that mighty sound and i to see no place where the hound do be but only flame and broken land where the earth-force do strike and great rock do be hurl all whither with a vast noise and truly it do be a mercy that i be not slay a hundred time if this might be by the failing and bursting of great rock and boulder and lo in a moment the human do cut off the earth-force and have it again to they control and there to seem now a great silence upon the land and a utter dark save that flame and noise come from that part where the current do strike and i very speedy to come free of the dazedness that have I and make again to my run for in truth it to seem now that i should yet be let to win unto safety with mine own and mine eye do grow presently unto they accustom use and i to look all way about I lest there come somewhat upon I even then to work we death and for a good time there to be naught that i do see anywhere neither there to be the wakeful sound of the land save only the grim and horrid laughter from afar in the dead east and oft as i do run i to stare hungry hearted upward at the mighty pyramid and surely it alway now to seem to be less bright than before and in the first i to set this to the count that mine eye do be yet daze by the great flame of the earth-force but soon i to perceive that it do be otherwise and that there do be truly a less brightness of the light that do shine throughout all the mighty redoubt and this lack i conceive have owe to that great use of the force and power of the earth-current that have be loose to save we and i to have this new thing cold upon my heart for truly if that the force of the current to be make over low there to be a danger for all the human that do live even for all the great million of the mighty refuge and this do be surely know by the master and they to have no more power to aid I with the current until it flow strong again lest that they destroy all the people of the earth and all this to be plain to I in a moment as i run and i to be but the more desperate to come unto instant safety with the maid and surely i to be yet in expect of the hundred thousand to come unto I but they not to come and all about I the land to begin again to give out the noise of the monster and to send forth new and peculiar noise as that there do be more awake in the land than do be ever hear by I before and presently i see that there go living thing creep between I and the light of the circle and i to know that i yet to have to fight bitter if that i would bring the maid safe and i swing the disko free and run on and sudden my spirit to know that i do be warn of some new peril and i to look upward into the night that the master monstruwacan should mayhap to tell I the danger by the set speech but in truth there come not the quick flashing of the set speech but only a upward stillness and a dimness of the light of the mighty pyramid and afterward i to learn that the dear master monstruwacan make to warn I of danger but that all the instrument of the tower of observation to fail to work and likewise all the machinery of the pyramid to cease even unto the moving of the great lift and the moan of the air pump and all to have be this way for nigh a great hour until that the earth-current do flow again more full and surely this doth show that death do nigh to come unto all the million because of the great trial that do be make to save we but truly my spirit do be warn by the trouble of the million and because the master monstruwacan call vaguely with he brain-element so that i go ever more warily and do look all way and lo sudden i to stare above I into the night and there to be a pale circle very quiet and steadfast that do go alway over the twain of we and i see that this do be surely one of those sweet power of holiness that do stand between we soul and some dread power that come anigh to work we destruction and i to have no over-fear but do put my trust in the force of holiness and go forward run warily and surely i come mayhap so nigh as to within four hundred pace of the circle and i to think that i yet to win mine own safe and undelayed within the guard of the circle and the light of the circle do burn dim so that i have sudden fear whether that it be any more use for a guard until that the earth-current to come more free and all this as i run swift and wary and utter anxious and lo in that moment in a dim place there rise up three beast-men from the earth and come at I growl and the first do be so close that i have no room to the disko but beat in the head of the man with the haft-part and i leap unto the side then and swing the disko and do be utter mad yet chill with fury so that the maid do be no more than a babe in the crook of mine arm and i come in sudden to meet the two beast-man as they run at I and i cut quick and light with the great weapon and do have that anger upon I which doth make the heart a place of cold and deadly intent so that i have a wondrous and brutal judgement to the slaying and truly i slew they as that they have be no more than mouse and i have no harm neither so much as a touch from they and behold in that moment there come a great shout of wonder and of welcome from within the circle and i lookt swiftly and begin again to run for there do be man in gray armor all within the circle yet come they not to mine aid and lo in a moment i know why that the hundred thousand do have hold off from I in mine extremity for behold there do be monstrous black mound all along without of the circle and do rock and sway with a force of strange life that do set a horror into my soul as i run for truly they do be the visible sign of monstrous force of evil and do any human have venture outward beyond the circle then have that man be destroy in the spirit and lose utterly so that none have dare to come neither have it be of use if any have make themselves to be a sacrifice to aid I for truly they to have be of no use when dead as you shall say and there come a constant shout from the hundred thousand to I that i haste and indeed to haste and truly i do haste with all my strength and i lookt unto the dear circle of holiness that do be above we twain and it to go steadfast over we so that i see we to be surely save and lo i to be no more than a hundred pace now from the glowing of the circle and behold even in that instant there must come brutal thing to destroy we for there come a herd of squat and brutish man all about I in a moment from the shadow where they have be hide and they catch at I and catch at the maid to tear she from mine arm and truly it do be as that they surely to have success for i could nowise in a moment free myself and yet to guard the maid and to use the disko and lo i kickt with my metal boot and give from they and turn all way in a moment and wrench free and i leap back and the herd of horrid brute after I and now i to have space for the disko and a grimness in my heart and i come round very sudden and run in among the man smite and i hit very swift both from the right and the left and to and fro with a constant quick circling and the disko do spin and roar and make a strange light upon the face of the man and they to have tusk like to the tusk of pig and surely i do rage through they smite and they to strike I a thousand time with great stone so that mine armor ring and be all fresh burst and i near to sicken under the blow and new wound but they not to harm the maid for i carry she above they squat and brutish reach and the brute-man to seem without end but i make alway forward unto the glowing of the circle and the night to be full in that place of the fierce shouting of the hundred thousand and many -- as i do learn -- to have try to come unto I but that they comrade hold they from so useless a die and in verity i to be now scarce fifty pace from the glowing of the circle and do be nigh to fall for i do be so utter daze and wound with the fight and ill with a vast weariness and the despair and madness of my journey and moreover as you do know i not to have sleep but to have carry the maid forever through day and night and to have fight oft and lo the hundred thousand stand just within the circle and they that be to the front do swing each man the disko and they hurl each the disko in among the herd of the tuskt man that do make to slay I and surely this to save I for the herd do thin to my front and i to gather my strength and to charge with despair and to smite and never be cease of smite so that there do be dead creature all about and behold i brake through the herd with mine own and do be upon the circle and lo i stept over the circle that do scarce now to give out a resistance and a thousand hand do come forward to give I help yet do none touch I but give back from I for there do be that about I which hold they off as with a little awe for i to be strange unto they and i stand there in a great silence and the disko in my hand run blood to the haft and maybe i rockt as i stand for many again do put out they hand as to hold I and again draw back and be silent and i lookt unto they and they lookt back at I and i do gasp awhile and be strangely dazed and do try to tell they that i have need of the doctor for the life of mine own maid that do be die in mine arm and behold in that moment there do be a sound of giant run out in the night and some then to cry out different matter to aid I and to beware of the giant and to bring the doctor to attend I on the instant and other voice do call that the holy light be go from above and likewise the black mound from the outer part of the circle and there do be a monstrous noise of roaring in the land and all to come bewildered unto my brain which do surely fail now with the grim and utter stress which have be mine so long and there to be also a constant noise that come from near and from upward and truly i to know as in a dream that it do be make of the shouting of the great million that do make a eternal and vague roaring-sound upward in the night that do come down from the upper height no more loud than a strange and continual murmur out of the lofty mile and surely i to find my voice in a little minute and do ask a near man whether there be any doctor with the man and in that moment there come forward a master of the disko which doth be as a commander of this age and he make the salute of honor with the disko and would have ease the maid from I but i to ask again very slow whether that there be a doctor a-near and he on the instant to give a order and the great thousand to begin to shape and do make a mighty lane unto the great gateway of the mighty pyramid and the master of the disko make a sign to certain that do be near and they stand about I as i to know dully lest i fall but they not to touch I for i do be as that i must not be lay hand upon for i do near to choke with despair lest i to have come home too late and surely also the man to seem as that i do be strange unto they and there go order swift and constant this way and that and lo in a little while there come two big man of the upward city run and they have a little man between they upon a sling and the little man do be a master of the doctor and he aid I gentle to lay mine own maid upon the earth and the master of the disko make a sign and the man that do be near turn each he back and the doctor to make examination for the life of mine own and there to come about that time a seeming of silence in the land and truly the hundred thousand do be utter quiet and a great quiet in the mighty pyramid for in truth all to know by this that there to be a fear that the maid i do bring out of the night do be slay by the evil force and sudden the little man that do be the master doctor lookt up quiet and piteous at I so that i know in a moment that mine own maid do be dead and he to see that i know and he cover the face of mine own and stand up very speedy and he call softly to the man that do be to my back and he sign to they that some to support I and some to lift mine own maid and bear she unto the great gateway and he lookt keen at I and i to fight a little that i breathe and afterward do make with my hand that the man not to come near I neither to touch mine own and the master doctor to understand that i do be truly strong until i die and do beckon the man from I and from the maid and i stoopt in a little and i lift mine own maid into mine arm for that last journeying and i come down the mighty lane of the hundred thousand all in they gray armor and they do make silent salute with the disko reverse each man as i pass he and do be utter silent and i scarce to wot of aught save that all the world do be quiet and empty and my task to have fail and mine own to lie dead in mine arm yet truly do it to have fail utter for i have surely save mine own from the terror of the second night land and she not to have come alone and with madness unto she death but to have die in mine arm and she surely to have be comfort within she spirit because that my love do be so utter about she and i to think vaguely and terribly on a hundred sweet love action that she to have show unto I and sudden i do remember with a dreadful pain how that i never to have wake to discover mine own maid kiss I in my sleep as i to have mean and a madness of anguish do flash sudden through the numbness upon my brain so that i do be blind a little and surely go crooked in my walk for i to know sudden that the master doctor steady mine elbow for a moment but afterward do leave I be as i to have again control of my spirit and lo as i draw nigh unto the great gateway the light of the pyramid to begin to glow again more strong and the machinery of the lift and the air pump to work because that now the earth-current do grow once more to natural strength and they to have power now to open the great gate which do be do by great machine and there to come forth to meet I a number of the master of the mighty pyramid and the dear master monstruwacan do come before they all so eager as that he do be mine own father and he to have hear somewhat vaguely that there to have be a fear for the life of the maid that i do bring and surely he do be tell by one near to the gateway that the maid do be dead in mine arm for he and all the master do pause and stand silent for I to go by and do reverse each he disko and this to have be a honor show than which there do be scarce any greater and there go a constant murmur up in the night which do be the speech of the million question and the news that the maid do be dead go upward through the mile and my spirit to know as in a dream of the spiritual noise which do go outward through all space and do be the grief of the multitude as they do hear this thing yet truly there do nothing comfort I anywise neither i proper yet to know the verity of my loss for i do go stunned and i come in through the great gateway and the full watch do stand there silent in they armor and they make the salute of honor and i go onward with the dead maid that i do bring out of eternity and presently they that be around do guide I with the maid in mine arm unto the great lift and i take mine own maid into the great lift and the master come with I and do be in they armor and none do speak to I and the master monstruwacan and the master of the doctor stand silent to the side of I and there do be everywhere great multitude that i do see vaguely but my spirit not to wot of they and lo i stand very quiet and dumb as we do go upward through the mile and the million of the city stand about the great lift and there do be a great silence upward and downward through the strange mile save for the weep of woman in dear sympathy that do sound far and low and constant and presently i to know that the master monstruwacan and the master of the doctor do look one to the other and i to be aware sudden that i stand in my blood for i do be wound in a hundred part and the blood to go alway from I yet do the master doctor be slow to do aught for I because that he to perceive that i do be slay in the heart and there to be no pain so dreadful as that he should be like to wake I unto if that he go hastily yet presently there do come whirling into my head and someone do surely make to ease mine own maid from mine arm but i hold she dumbly and the blood to go the more from I and they not to know what should be do and i to look at they and the dear master monstruwacan do be say somewhat unto I that i do have no power to hear but only to know that he face do be very human and there go a strange noise all about I and the master monstruwacan to seem to hold I up and to beckon to some that do be to my back and lo there come a blackness and the gentleness of arm about mine armor and i to come presently to quietness and to half-dream and do alway to seem that i carry mine own maid in mine arm but truly there do pass three great day whilst that i do be thus and i all that while to be lay quiet and to be tend by the master doctor and aid by all knowledge that do be know of human and on the third day as it might be call i to come full unto my sens and the pain to take I in the breast and the master of the doctor do be with I and they that nurst I and the master doctor watch I very keen and gentle and i do be in a bed of the health room of mine own city and i gat from the bed and the doctor to say naught but only to watch I and i walkt to and fro a little and he alway to watch I and presently he give I somewhat to drink and i drink and i be go soon from all knowledge and i to come again unto a know that i yet to live and there go a certain strength in my body and lo the first that i do see be the master of the doctor and i to perceive in a moment that he have waken I and have nurst my strength for that moment that i live through the burial for he to be very wise and to have know from that first see of I that i not to live after that mine own do die and there be bring to I a loose garment but i to refuse the garment dumbly and do look about I very trouble and forget and the master doctor lookt alway at I and lo in a moment he call one and give a order and there be bring in then my broken armor and a garment to wear below and i then to know that i do be content in this matter and the doctor alway to watch I and they drest I in my broken armor and surely as they drest I my spirit to hear the sorrow and sympathy of the multitude and do know that they go downward by million unto the country of silence and lo in that moment when i near to be in mine armor i to mind sudden again that i never to have wake to discover mine own maid kiss I in my sleep and the pain gat I in the breast so that i have surely end then but that the master doctor set somewhat to my breath that ease I and give something of dullness unto my sens for a while and i do be carry then in a sling unto the great lift and there do be a bed in the lift and the doctor to have I to lie upon the bed and i to know that he also to know that i never to need a bed any more neither should i ever to come upward again in the lift and truly the mighty pyramid do be a emptyness for there do seem to be leave only the stress master that do arrange the moving of the million and the stress master do stand about the lift as we dropt downward through the great mile unto the underground field and we come downward in the last unto the country of silence which do lie a hundred mile deep in the world and do be a hundred mile every way of silence unto the dead and they that be with I gat I from the lift and do mean to carry I in the sling unto the last road but i stand upon my foot and make that i should walk and i hold out my hand for the disko which one do carry and the master doctor sign that they should obey I as my spirit to know and i walkt very steadfast down the way that do lead unto the last road and the master doctor walkt behind I a little space off and surely there do be all the people of the world in that great country and the people do be spread out forever so far as my see do go and they to have sight of I and all the aether do be stir with the humanness of they sorrow and they kind sympathy and there grow a murmur which do be like to a low rolling thunder and do be the voice of the people and the rolling of that great husht sound go to and fro across that mighty country of quiet and there to be afterward a utter silence and i see below I the place of the last rest where do be the beginning of the last road and there do lie there a little figure cover with a white robe that do glimmer with the beauteous work of woman that have stitcht love and honor into that last garment and surely i to rock upon my foot and to steady myself with the disko and the master doctor to be unto my side in a moment and give I again something that i breathe-in but indeed i to refuse after that i have take one breath of the drug for i to be able to bear my pain the little time that i now to have to live and i to mean that i have no dimness of my sens for those short minute that i should have yet near unto mine own and truly the master doctor do not press I anywise but have a perfect understanding and go quiet again to the rearward and i come soon to that place where mine own dead one do lie and the master monstruwacan stand to she foot and do be clothe in gray armor and have the disko reverse and this to be for a honor unto my dead maid and there kneel two maid in white one to the right and one to the left of mine own and they to be for faithfulness and do be maid because that they watch by a maid and have likewise be matron if that the dead have be wife unto any and the place at the head of the last rest do be empty and do be for I and he that stand to the head do be for love for it do be the chief and do hold dominion over and do make to live both faithfulness and honor and this to be the way of the burial alway and lo i take my courage into my heart and i stand to the head of mine own maid and i lookt down upon the wondrous white glory of the garment which do be white because that mine own do be a maid yet do be work with yellow flower of weep as we do call they because that she have die in love and i to know that no hand have toucht that wonderful garment save the hand of maiden and behold as i stand there from far away over the land there do come a far and faint sound and the sound do come more nigh so that i know that afar off beyond the hill of the babe the million do begin to sing the call song where million do call husht unto million and the sound do come onward toward where we do be and do go over we and pass onward in a husht and wondrous breathing of sound as that all the love that do be ever in this world do call in a low anguish unto a lose beloved and the sound to pass away and away over that mighty country in the deep earth and do hush and hush unto a great and utter silence save for a faint murmur of countless woman weep that do be in the air of that land of quiet and there to be a space of silence and again the silence to be break by a far sound and there to come again from beyond the far hill of the babe a strange and low sound and do be as of a wind wander through damp forest and the sound grow and come across the hill of the babe and do be breathe forth by million after million so that in a little i to hear the song of weep sing very low and sorrowful by the multitude and the song come onward over all that great country and past over we and go onward into the far land beyond the dome and do be catch by the voice of million that do be hide in great distance and so to go onward forever and to die at last unto a mighty silence and the master monstruwacan lookt at I from the foot of mine own maid and i to know that the moment do be come when i to part from the maid naani forever and forever even though i to live in some strange future and to find she soul in some other sweet child and i stoopt and lay the disko beside mine own maid there upon the last rest and the two maid draw back the light wonder of the garment and show I the face of mine own and she to sleep there forever so sweet and husht as a child and as oft i to have see she to sleep and i lookt a little while and the pain of my heart do be sufficient so that i know i die as i lookt and once more i lookt and i set my soul about mine own and i fight with myself and stand upward and the maid do cover the face of mine own maid and the master monstruwacan commend naani unto eternity and he raise the disko reverse and lo the road do begin to move upward unto the dome and mine own maid do be upon the road and i to fight that i keep breathing so that i not to die before she be lose utter to my sight and there do rise now a sound from all that country that have no order in it and do be like to a low moan that do fill all the air of the land and there to be also a constant sound as of a little whistling dree wind that do be in all that country of quiet and truly this to be more than any singing for it to be the true weep of multitude that do sorrow from the heart with the grief of this thing that do be and i stand utter still and do draw my breath very even and lookt unto that small form that do be now afar off where it do lie upon the move roadway and i gaze as that my soul and all my be do have no power else even as a man that die doth set all he strength to a last movement and i not to wot that the master monstruwacan and the two maid do hold I up because they to perceive that i do be die for i only to see mine own little one lie afar off upon the moving of the last road and the maid in that moment to come to the place where the road do pass into the strange and luminous vapor of the earth-current which do lie all about the base of the dome and the vapor to be only as a faint shine smoke scarce see yet to be enough to give something of uncertainty to the dead when that they do have past inward of it and i stare with all that do be leave of my strength for mine own to be go utter and forever in but a little minute and the uncertainty of the luminous vapor do cling about she and to make she to seem unreal to my gaze for the vapor do be in constant movement and to give a seeming of shift to and fro of all that do be in it and behold as i do stare with my dreadful pain there do be sudden a strange hoarse noise from the nearer million and lo in a instant there come a mighty shout out of all that country and the shout do be make again and do grow into a mighty hoarse roar from the million so that all that great country do be fill with the monstrous sound and in verity i to have see the thing likewise but to have set it to the madness of longing of my heart and to that desperate and dreadful pain which do make I to be craze and lose from all sane thinking and the thing that i do see have be that the maid do seem to move there upon the last road where she do lie but indeed this to have appear only to be the stir of the luminous vapor of the earth-current which do seem to make thing shift as i have tell and lo i now to see truly that the maid do move where she be lay afar off upon the road and i now to know and to believe that she do indeed live and my life come into I with a bound yet do my heart seem to be a moment still in my breast and the master monstruwacan to have sign already that the roadway be stopt and bring backward but i to be now upon the last road and do run as a madman shout vainly upon the name of mine own and i to learn afterward that there to have be a dreadful peril that all the near million to rush toward the last road and so mayhap to have cause the death of many and to have be like to have crusht mine own but this danger to have be ease because that the watch master do act very prompt and set the great regiment of he man to keep back the million and do send a signal abroad over all the country that there to be calmness for that the maid should be succoured and alway whilst this to be i do run staggering most strangely upward of the last road and surely that great roof do ring and boom with the constant and mighty shouting of the million and there do run other also along the road to my back but i to have be the first and to make a good speed though i do stagger and rock so strange upon my foot and the road alway to be move backward under I and so i to be come wonderful soon unto where the maid do be and she to be upon she back and to have pusht the garment from she face and do be lie with she eye open and a look of gentle wonderment upon she dear face and she then to see I and she eye do smile at I very glad and quiet for there to be yet a utter weakness upon she and lo i come with a fall beside she and i gat upon my knee and upon my hand and my heart do shake my lip to dry whispering and she to look weak and steadfast unto I and i to look forever at she and i do alway try to say thing unto she but my mouth to refuse I and understanding do come into she as a light and she to know in that instant that she to be truly come into the mighty pyramid and i to have gat she there somewise and she to wake sudden in she body and set she hand forth all a-trembling from the garment and in dreadful trouble and i to see then that the blood do go from I constant and the maid to have perceive this thing so that she be wake the more proper in a moment from she death-swoon and surely i do bleed very dreadful for all my wound do be open with my run and i to have sudden power with my lip and do say unto she very simple that i love she and she to be all in a haze from I and i to know that she to have come likewise unto she knee and do have my head upon she breast and there to be a utter shake of the air with some great sound and a mighty spiritual stir of the aether of the world and there to be then the voice of the master monstruwacan very dull in mine ear and the low voice of the master doctor but i never to hear what they do be say and do know only that mine own maid do live and i not to mean to die but to fight unto living and even whilst that i make this resolve i be go into a utter blackness xvii the love day now when that i gat back unto life i to know that i go upward in the lift and do be upon that same bed where i to think i never to need a bed any more neither to come upward again from out of the country of silence and i to know vague and strange that there rise up from out of the mighty depths of the world the deep thunder of the underground organ and do sound as that they make a strange and utter distant music beyond death and there to go alway a rolling chaunting as that multitude do sing beyond far mountain and the sound to be somewhile as a far-blowing wind low in the deep and again to come clear and to be that great olden melody of the song of honor and i know as in a dream that the million in that deep country make a honor and a rejoice over this wonder of joy which do be come but yet all to be faint and half hide from I and mine eye to be as that they have no power to open and i to seem to be lift alway upon strange water of unrealness and there to be sweet and lovely odour and these to be of reality and to come from the great field where the flower do alway to grow about the passage way of the lift for the lift even then to be go upward through the great mile and mayhap i move a little for there come the voice of the master doctor low and gentle to I and bid I rest for that all do be well with the maid and surely afterward i do be go into a haze and there to be then a seeming of day in which i half to live and half to sleep and to wonder without trouble whether i do be dead and then there to come day when i lay very quiet and have no thought of aught and the master doctor oft to bend over I in this hour and that hour and to look keen into my face and in the end after strange space there bent over I another and there lookt down upon I the dear and lovely face of mine own and the eye do speak love into my soul yet do she be calm and husht and i to begin again to live in my body and i make mayhap a little fumble with my hand for she to take and to hold they and life to come from she to I and she to be ever wordless and gentle and contentment to grow in I and presently a natural slumber and there come a day when i do be let rise and they that tend I carry I to one of the quiet garden of the pyramid and they set I there and do seem to leave I alone and there come one then around a bush and lookt at I a moment as with a half shyness only that the love that do shine in she eye make the shyness to be a little thing and truly i know that it do be mine own maid but i never before to have see naani drest pretty as a maid and i lookt to she and know that she do be more dainty than even i to have know and sudden i make that i rise to come unto she but she to run quick to I that she stop I of this natural foolishness and she then to sit beside I and to take my head against she breast and she not to deny I she lip but to be both a maid and a mother to I in the same moment and afterward she have I to be very still and we to sit there in a utter dumb happiness until they that do attend I be come again and the master of the doctor do be with they and i to see that there go something of satisfaction in he face and after that day i see mine own maid every day and i gat better unto health with a wondrous quickness for love do mend I and soon i do be let go downward unto the field but yet to go by private way because that the multitude should be like to follow I alway and i to need to be quiet and the maid to be with I for the master monstruwacan and the master of the doctor do agree upon this matter and have a officer of marriage to wed we and we to be marry very quiet and simple for i yet to be over-weak for the public marriage which we to have later when truly the million make we a guard of honor eight mile high from the top unto the bottom of the mighty pyramid but this to have be later as i do tell and do be a ceremonial of the people because that they not to be deny that they give I a honor and surely the maid to be with I alway and do be now my wife and my strength to come alway upon I and mine own to grow again unto a perfect health and in verity we do be now in the love day which do be the most beauteous if that the love to be true and we do wander through the mighty field at we will and walkt in the love path of the field which do be alway anear to those place where do be the village and i to hide we name lest we to be beset by any out of natural curiousness and kindliness for we to need to be utter together and quiet and we to choose those place for we slumber where beauty of flower do be most wondrous and we to carry somewhat of food with we but also to eat when we come unto the village which do be here and there in the field which be truly so huge as country and mine own do make good she promise a hundred time as you shall say and do prepare I a great and hearty meal and do tease I utter that i do be a glutton as i do eat and kist I lest that i have ever a chance to say aught in mine own defense and truly she do be all that my heart and my spirit do desire and she to have companion I with love and to have enter my spirit into joy and once we to go downward unto the country of silence but not to stay very long at that time because that my memory do return upon I yet in the after time we to wander there oft with memory and holiness of great thinking and with love which doth hold all and as we to leave that country i to tell mine own how that when she have be suspend of she life by the horrid force of the house i to have mind I with a dreadful pain that i never to have wake to discover she kissing I when that i do sleep and surely mine own dear one do blush most lovely and have never know that i do be aware of she sweet naughtiness and she then to have all think for mine agony when that she do be dead ere the vapor of life of the earth-force do set she spirit free of the silence and she to come unto I in dear understand and she then to tell I that the doctor to say that she have be as it be stunned and freeze of the spirit and all she being and life suspend and the great life-force of the earth-current to have wake she spirit and she body then to live and she blood to flow proper again and the doctor have talkt much and search much of late in the olden record of they work and they to have find somewhat of one such happen in the olden time but truly naught such to have be ever through a mighty age of year and whilst that we to wander and to rest in the field i oft to tell mine own of this matter and that matter and i to know that she have learn somewhat of odd thing ere i do be come to health but not overmuch for she also to have be utter alack as you shall think and to have come from she bed when that i do lie so still for the master doctor to have ordain this because he to fear that i to be go truly to die if that he not to do somewhat to awaken my spirit and in verity you shall think upon the deepness of my love as i to know that she do have hold my hand so brave and gentle whilst that she to have scarce power to she foot and i to say a little holy praise of mine own and so do i come to mine end and have but one more thing that i tell and this to happen a while later after that mine own and i have go through the second marriage which do be the public marriage for it do be that one day my wife that do be mine own do take I with a sweet cunning unto the hall of honor and surely when i be come there i to see that many of the people do be in that great hall and do stand about in a silence yet as that they have no meaning to do aught but yet to be that they do wait upon somewhat and my wife do go forward with I unto the center place of the hall and sudden i see why that she do bring I so cunning sweet for there do stand in the midst of the hall of honor in the place of honor a statue of a man in broken armor that do carry a maid forever and i do be dumb and how of this age shall you to know the honor that this to mean in that for it do be a honor that be give only to the great dead and i to be but a young man and do be so utter far off from greatness save that i to love with all my heart and with all my spirit and therefore death to be but a little thing before love and you to know how love doth make sweet and brave the heart and to have understanding with I in my humbleness and my wonder and my natural pride that there do any so think to honor I and mine own do be weep with joy and honest pride of she man beside I and there to be a utter silence of dear sympathy in all the great hall of honor and they that do be there to let I go in quietness with mine own which do be a lovely thing of understanding and i to go loving and thoughtful with mine own wife and she to be very nigh to I and i to have gain honor yet to have learn that honor doth be but as the ash of life if that you not to have love and i to have love and to have love be to have all for that which doth be _ truly _ love doth mother honor and faithfulness and they
