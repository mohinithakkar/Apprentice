poor hand he declare but i be willing to play it out if maggie will sit opposite I and be my partner i have only one gift -- i be handy with card and i can deal myself three out of the four ace -- but that be not much good to a man who try to earn a honest living i be willing to try work -- it may be all right for anything i know if maggie will take I i 'll promise to leave card alone and i 'll do whatever she think i ought to do maggie and she mother take a few day to consider on one point they mind be very clear if maggie take he he could not keep any of the money he have win gambling -- he would have to start honest mr corbett have fortunately arrive at the same conclusion himself so that point be easily dispose of it be not for we to be hard on anyone that be tryin ' to do better say

be not the rash promise of a eager lover for mr corbett be never rash and the subsequent year show that he purpose be honest to fulfil it to the letter maggie be many year he junior could not think of address he by he first name and she feel that it be not seemly to use the prefix so again she follow she mother 's example and address he as she mother do murphy senior as da it be in the early eighty that maggie and john corbett decide to come farther west the cry of free land for the asking be come to many ear and at maggie 's table it be daily discuss they sell out the contents of they house and purchase ox and a covered wagon they make the long overland journey on the bank of black creek they pitch they tent and before a week have go by maggie corbett be give meal to hungry man cooking bannock fry pork and make coffee on she little sheet-iron camp-stove no bigger than a biscuit - box the next year when the railroad come to brandon and the wheat be draw in from as far south as lloyd 's lake the black creek stop - house become a far-famed and popular establishment chapter ii _ the house of bread _ across the level plain which lie between the valley of the souri and the valley of the assiniboine there run at this time three trail there be the deeply-rutted old hudson bay trail over which go the fabulously heavy load of fur long ago -- grass-grown now and break with badger hole there be the trail hard and firm in the full pride of present patronage defy the invasion of the boldest blade of grass and by the side of it faint and shadowy like a rainbow 's understudy run the new trail strong in the certainty of be the trail in time for mile across the plain the man who follow the trail watch the steep outlying shoulder of the brandon hill for a landmark when they leave the souri valley the hill be blue with distance and seem to promise wooded slope and maybe leap stream but a half-day 's journey dispel the illusion for when the traveller come near enough to see the elevation as it be it be only a rugged bluff bald and bare and blotched with clump of mangy grass with a fringe of stunt poplar at the base after round the shoulder of the hill the thick line of poplar and elm which fringe the bank of black creek come into view and many a man and horse have suddenly brighten at the sight for in the shelter of the tree there stand the black creek stopping-house which be the half-way house on the way to brandon hungry man have smell the bacon fry when more than a mile away and it be only the man who follow the trail who know what a heartsome smell that be the horse too tired with the long day point they ear ahead and step livelier when they see the whitewashed wall gleam through the tree the black creek stopping-house give not only food and shelter to the man who team the wheat to market -- it give they good fellowship and companionship in the absence of newspaper it keep its guest abreast with the time event great and small be discuss there with impartial deliberation and often with surprising result action and event which seem quite harmless and even heroic when discuss along the trail often change they complexion entirely when mr maggie corbett let in the clear light of conscience on they for even on the very edge of civilization there be still to be find finger - post on the way to right living mr maggie corbett be a finger-post and more for a finger-post merely point the way with its wooden finger and then figuratively retire from the scene to let you think it over but maggie corbett continue to take a interest in the case until it be decide to she entire satisfaction black creek on whose wooded bank the stopping-house stand be a deep black stream which make its way leisurely across the prairie between steep bank here and there throughout its length be little shallow stretch which show a golden braid down the center like any peaceful meadow brook where child may with safety float they little boat but black creek with its precipitous hole be no safe companion for any living creature that have not webbed toe or a guardian angel the bank which be of a spongy black loam grow a heavy crop of coarse meadow grass intersperse in the late summer with the umbrella - like white cluster of water hemlock \* \* \* \* \* about a mile from the stopping-house there stand a strange log structure the present abode of reginald and randolph brydon late of hm navy but now farmer and homesteader the house be build in that form of architecture know as a red river frame and the corner be finish in the fashion call saddle and notch whatever can be do to a house to spoil its appearance have be do to this one there be a join in each side which be intend and a bulge which be accidental and when the sailor brother be unable to make a log lie comfortably beside its neighbor by use the axe they resort to long iron spike and when these split the log as be usually the case they overcome the difficulty by use rope what have bring the brydon brother to manitoba be a matter of conjecture in the black creek neighborhood some say they probably be not want at home other with deeper meaning say they probably _ be _ want at home and indeed they bushy eyebrow they fierce black eye the knife which they carry in they belt and they general manner of live give some ground to this insinuation the brydon brother do not work with that vigor and zeal which bring success to the farmer they begin late and quit early with numerous rest in between they show a delightfully child-like trust in nature and she method for in the springtime instead of plant they potato in the ground the way they see other people do it they sprinkle they around the fireguard believe that the bird of the air strew leave over they or the rain wash they in or in some mysterious way they make a bed for themselves in the soil they buy a cow from one of the neighbor but before the summer be over bring she back indignantly declare that she would give no milk randolph declare that he know she have it for she have plenty the last time he milk she and that be several day ago -- she should have more now it come out in the evidence that they only take from the cow the amount of milk that they need reasoning that she have a better way of keep it than they have the cow 's former owner exonerate she from all blame in the matter say that rosie be all right as a cow but of course she be no bloomin ' refrigerator there be only one day in the week when the brydon brother could work with any degree of enjoyment and that be on Sunday when there be the add zest of wickedness to drive the oxen up and down the field in full view of a astonished and horrified neighborhood seem to take away in large measure from the beastliness of labor and then too the sabbath calm of the black creek valley seem to stimulate they imagination as they discourse loudly and elaborately on the present and future state of the oxen consign they without hope of release to the remotest and hottest corner of gehenna but the complacent old ox graduate in the school of hard knock and mosquito wink solemnly switch they tail and drowse along unmoved the sailor have be do various odd job around the house on sunday ever since they come but have not work openly until one particular Sunday in may all day they hope that someone would come and stop they from work or at least beg of they to desist but the hot afternoon wear away and there be no movement around any of the house on the plain the guardian of the moral of the neighborhood mr maggie corbett have take notice of they all right but she be a wise woman and do not use militant method until she have try all other and she believe that she have other means of teach the sailor twin the advantage of sabbath observance about five o'clock the twin grow so uproariously hungry they be compel to quit they labor but when they reach they house they be horrify to find that a wander dog who also have no respect for the sabbath have deplete they grub-box overlook nothing but the tea and sugar which he have upset and spill when he find he do not care to eat they then it be the ox 's turn to laugh for the twin ' wrath be all turn upon each other everything that they have say about the ox it seem be equally true of each other -- each of they have confidently expect the other one to lock the door there be nothing to do but to go across to the black creek stop - house for supplies mr corbett baked bread for they each week reginald with a gun on he shoulder and roll more than ever in he walk stroll into the kitchen of the stopping-house and make know he errand he also ask for the loan of a neck-yoke have break he in a heated argument with the starboard ox mr corbett with a black dress and white apron on sit with fold hand in the rocking-chair da corbett with he other clothes on and he glass far down on he nose sit in another rocking-chair read the life of general booth peter rockett the chore boy in a clean pair of overalls and with hair-oil on he hair sit on the edge of the wood-box twang a jew 's - harp and the tune that he play bear a slight resemblance to pull for the shore randolph feel the Sunday atmosphere but nevertheless make know he errand the bread be yours say mr corbett sternly you may have it but i can not bake any more for you w ' y not ask reginald feel all at once hungrier than ever of course i be not say you can help it mr corbett go on ignore he question i suppose maybe you do the best you can i believe everybody do if we only know it and you have not have a very good chance either piratin ' among the black heathen in the island of the sea but the bible speak plain and old captain coomb often tell we not to be unequally yoke with unbeliever and i can not encourage sunday-breakin ' by cookin ' for they that do it we be not breakin ' really we be only back-settin ' interpose reginald quickly i do not wish to encourage sabbath-breakin ' repeat mr corbett raise she voice a little to prevent interruption by bakin ' for people who do it or neighborin ' with people who do it of course there be some who say that the amount of work that you and you brother do any day would not break the sabbath here she look hard at she man john corbett who stir uneasily but there be no mistakin ' you meanin ' and besides mr corbett go on we have other besides ourselves to think of -- there be the child indicate the lanky peter rockett the child thus allude to close one eye -- the one farthest from mr corbett -- for a fraction of a second and keep on softly tease the jew 's - harp now you need not glare at I so fierce you twin mr corbett 's voice be still full of Sunday calm i do not know which one of you you be but anyway what i say apply to you both now take that look off you face and stay and eat i 'll send something home to you other one too have deliver she ultimatum on the subject of Sunday work mr corbett become quite genial she heap reginald 's plate with cold chicken and cream potato and mellow by they and the comfort of she well-appointed table he be prepare to renounce the devil and all he work if mr corbett give the order chapter iii _ the sailor ' rest _ when reginald reach home he find he brother in a state of mind border on frenzy but when he shove the basket which mr corbett have fill for he toward randolph with the unnecessary injunction to stow it in he hold the lion 's mouth be effectively close when he have finish the last crumb reginald tell he mr corbett 's decree regard Sunday work and find that randolph be prepare to abstain from all form of labor on all day in the week if she wish it that night after the twin have wash the accumulate stock of dish and put patch on they overalls with piece of canvas and a sail needle and perform the many little odd job which by all accept rule of ethic belong to Sunday evening 's busy work they sit beside the fire and indulge in great depression of spirit she can not live forever reginald break out at last with apparent irrelevance but there be no irrelevance -- he remark be perfectly in order he be refer to a dear aunt in bournemouth this lady who be possess of fund have once tell she loving nephew -- the twin -- that if they would go away and stay away she might -- do something for they -- by and by she have urge they so strongly to go to canada that they could not under the circumstance do otherwise aunt patience brydon share the delusion that be so blissfully prevalent among parent and guardian of wayward youth in england that to send they to canada will work a complete reformation believe that canada be a good kind wilderness where iced tea be the strongest drink know and where no more exciting game than draught be ever play aunt patience though a frail-looking little white-haired lady have it seem a wonderful tenacity of life she 'll slip she cable some day reginald declare soothingly she can not hold out much longer -- you know the last letter say she be failin ' fast failin ' fast randolph break in impatiently it be we that be failin ' fast and maybe when we have wait and wait and stay away for ` er she 'll go and leave it all to some old cat ' ` ome or old hen ' roost or some other beastly charity i do not trust ` er -- ` any woman that ` old on to life the way she do -- ` er with one foot in the grave and ` er will all make and everything ready well she can not last always reginald declare hold firmly to this one bit of comfort the next news they get from bournemouth be positively alarming she be get better then the twin lose hope entirely and decide to treat aunt patience as one already dead -- figuratively speak to turn she picture to the wall let she live as long as she like reginald declare if she be so jolly keen on it when they decide to trust no more to the deceitfulness of woman they turn to another quarter for help for they be at this time uncommonly low in fund it be randolph who get the idea one day when he be sit on the plow handle light he pipe wot 's the matter with we gettin ' out fred for we farm pupil he be get some money -- they say he marry a rich man 's daughter -- and we have get the experience he be only a ` alf-brother say reginald at last reflectively that do not matter one bit to I declare randolph generously i 'll treat he just the same as i would you reginald shrug he shoulder eloquently what about he missus ask reginald after a silence she can come randolph say magnanimously we 'll build a piece to the house the more they talk about it the more enthusiastic they become under the glow of this new project they feel they could hurl contempt on aunt patience and she unnatural hold on life i do not know but what i would rather take ` elp from the livin ' than the dead anyway reginald say virtuously that night before they go to bed they be more h ` apt to ask it back just the same object randolph i be just goin ' to say reginald begin again that i would just as soon take ` elp from the livin ' as the dead especially when there be not no dead they begin at once to write letter to they long-neglected brother fred enthusiastically set forth the charm of this new country they dwell on the freedom of the life the abundance of game and the view they make a great deal of the view and certainly there be nothing to obstruct it for the prairie lay a dead level for ten mile north of they only dot here and there with little weather-bleached wart of house like they own where other optimist be try to make a dint in the monotony the letter which go east every mail be splendid production in they way write with ease and eloquence and utterly untrammeled by any regard for fact they brother respond just as they hope he would and the twin be greatly delighted with the success of they plan event of which the twin know nothing favor they project and make fred and he wife glad to leave toronto evelyn grant have bitterly estrange she father by marry against he wish so the proposal from randolph and reginald that they come west and take the homestead near they seem to offer a escape from much that be unpleasant besides it be just at the time when so many people be hear the call of the west at the suggestion of he brother fred send in advance the money to build a house on he homestead but the twin not wish to make any mistake or to have any misunderstanding with fred build it right beside they own fred send enough money to have a frame building put up but the twin decide that log be more romantic and cheaper it be a remarkable structure when they be through with it stick against they own house as if by accident and resemble in its irregularity the growth of a freak potato cable be freely use binder twine serve as hinge on the door and also as latch they give as a reason for stick the new part against they own irregularly that they intend to use the alcove for verandah they agree to put in fred 's crop for he -- for a consideration to put up hay to buy ox indeed so many kindly office do they agree to perform for he that fred have advance they in all nearly two thousand dollar the preparation be watch with great interest by the neighbor and the probable outcome of it all be often a topic of conversation at the black creek stopping-house chapter iv _ farm pupil _ June in manitoba when the tender green of grass and leaf be bath in the sparkling sunshine when the first wild rose be spilling they perfume on the air and the first orange lily be lift they glad face to the sun when the prairie chicken intent on family care run cautiously beside the road and the hermit thrush from the thicket drive they sweet note into the quiet evening it be a time to remember lovingly and with sweet gratitude a time when the love of the open prairie overtake we and bind we fast in golden fetter there be no hint of the cruel winter that be wait just around the corner or of the dull autumn drizzle closer still there be nothing but peace and warmth and beauty as the old cheyenne the only sidewheeler on the assiniboine churn the muddy water into creamy foam make its way to the green shore at curry 's landing fred and evelyn brydon standing on the narrow deck feel the grip of the place and the season even the captain 's picturesque language as he direct the activity of the rouster who pull the boat ashore seem less like profanity and more like figure of speech the twin have make several unfruitful journey to the landing for they brother and he wife for they begin to go two day before the cheyenne be expect and have be go twice a day since all of which have be carefully enter in they account book they appearance as they stand on the shore sneer at the captain 's direction to he man from the superior height of they nautical experience be warlike in the extreme although they be clothe in the peaceful overalls and smock of the farmer and also have submit to a haircut at the earnest instigation of mr corbett who threaten to cut off all bread-making unless she wish be comply with evelyn who have never see she brother-in-law look upon they now in wonder and she could see they appearance be somewhat of a surprise to fred who have not see they for many year and who remember they only as the hero of he childhood day they greet fred hilariously but to he wife they speak timidly for brave as they be in face spanish pirate they be timid to the point of flight in the presence of woman as they drive home in the high-boxed wagon the twin endeavor to keep up the breezy enthusiasm that have characterize they letter they rave about the freedom of the west they go into fresh rapture over the view and almost derange they respiratory organ in they praise of the air they breathe in deep breath of the ambient atmosphere chew it up with loud smack of enjoyment and then blow it out snort like whale evelyn who be not without a sense of humor would have enjoy it all and laugh _ at _ they even if she could not laugh with they if she could have forget that they be she husband 's brother but it be very hard to see the humorous in the grotesque behavior of those to whom we be bind by the tie of duty if not affection a good supper at the black creek stopping-house and the hearty hospitality of mr corbett restore evelyn 's good spirit she notice too that the twin tame down perceptibly in mr corbett 's presence mr corbett insist on fred and he wife spend the night at the stopping-house do not go to you own house until morning she say thing look a lot different when the sun be shine and out here you see mr fred we have to do without and forget so many thing that we bank a lot on the sun you people who live in city you have get gas and big lamp and i guess it do not bother you much whether the sun rise or do not rise or what he do you be independent but with we it be different the sun be the best thing we have get and we go by he considerable providence know how it be with we and let we have lot of the sun winter and summer evelyn gladly consent to stay mr corbett observe evelyn 's soft white hand decide that she be not accustom to work and the wonder of how it would all turn out be heavy upon she kind irish heart as she say goodbye to she next morning a big basket of bread and other provision be put into the wagon at the last minute maybe you stove will not be drawin ' just right at the first say maggie corbett apologetically as she watch evelyn 's hat of red rose fading in the distance she say softly to herself : sure i do hope it be true that he temper the wind to the shear lamb tho ' there be some that say that be not in the bible at all but it sound nice and kind anyway and yon poor lamb need all the help he can give she he and I we 'll have to do the best we can for she mr corbett go over to see she new neighbor two or three day after in response to she knock on the rough lumber door a thin little voice call to she to enter which she do on the bare floor stand a open trunk from which a fur-trimmed pale pink opera cloak hang carelessly beside the trunk in a attitude of homesickness huddle the young woman hair dishevelled eye red she dress of green silk embroidered stocking and beaded slipper look out of place and at variance with she primitive surroundings when mr corbett enter the room she spring up hastily and apologize for the untidiness of she house she chatter gaily to hide the trouble in she face and mr corbett wisely refrain from any apparent notice of she tear and help she to unpack she trunk and set the house to rights mr corbett show she how to make a combined washstand and clothes press out of two soap box how to make a wardrobe out of the head of the bed and set the twin sailor at the construction of a cookhouse where the stove could be put when mr corbett leave that afternoon it be a brighter and more liveable dwelling come home along the bank of black creek she be trouble in mind and heart for she new neighbor this be June she say to herself and wild rose be crowdin ' up to she door and the meadow lark be sittin ' round all over blinkin ' at the sun and she have she man with she and she be not tire with the work and she hand be not crack and sore and she have not be there long enough to dislike the twin the way she will when she know they better and there be no mosquito and she have not be leave to stay alone and still she cry god help we what will she do in the long drizzle in the fall when the wheat 's spoilin ' in the shock maybe and the house be dark and she man 's away -- what _ will _ she do mr brydon spend many happy hour that summer at the stopping-house and soon mr corbett know all the event of she past life the sympathetic understanding of the irish woman make it easy for she to tell many thing she mother have die when she be ten year old and since then she have be she father 's constant companion until she meet fred brydon she could not understand and so bitterly resent she father 's dislike of fred not know that he fond old heart be tear with jealousy she and she father be too much alike to ever arrive at a understanding for both be proud and quick-tempered and imperious and so each day the breach grow wider just a word a caress a assurance from she that she love he still that the new love have not drive out the old would have set he heart at rest but with the cruel thoughtlessness of youth she could see only one side of the affair and that she own at last she run away and be marry to the young man whom she father have never allow she to bring to see he and the proud old man be leave alone in he dreary mansion brooding over what he call the heartlessness of he only child mr corbett with she quick understanding be sorry for both of they and at every opportunity endeavor to turn evelyn 's thought towards home once at she earnest appeal after she have get the young woman tell she about how kind she father have be to she when she mother die evelyn consent to write he a letter but when it be finish with a flash of she old imperious pride she tear it across and fling the piece on the floor then hastily gather they up and put they in the stove one half sheet of the letter do not share the fate of the remainder for mr corbett intercept it and hastily hide it in she apron pocket she might need it she think chapter v _ the prairie club-house _ the tender green of the early summer deepen and ripen into the golden tinge of autumn as over the black creek valley the mantle of harvest be spread only a small portion of the valley be under cultivation for the oldest settler have be in only for three year but it seem as if every grain sow have fall upon good soil and give promise of the hundredfold across john corbett 's ten acre of wheat and forty acre of oats the wind run wave of shadow all day long and the pride of the land-owner thrill maggie corbett 's heart over and over again not that the lady of the stopping-house take the time to stand around and enjoy the sensation for the busy time be come on and many traveller be move about and must be feed but while she scrape the new potato with lightning speed or shell the green pea all of she own garden she thought be full of that peace and reverent gratitude that come to those who plant the seed and see it grow it be a glittering day in early August a light shower the night before have wash the valley clean of dust and now the hot harvest sun pour down he ripening ray over the pulsating earth to the south the brandon hill shimmer in a pale gray mirage over the tree which sheltered the stopping-house a flock of black crow circle in the blue air croak and complain that the harvest be go to be late on the wire-fence that circle the haystack sit a row of red-winged blackbird like a string of jet bead patiently wait for the oats to ripen and indulge in low-spoken but pleasant gossip about all the other bird in the valley within door mr corbett serve dinner to a long line of stopper many of the boy she have not see since the winter before and while she work she discuss neighborhood matter with they the please sizzle of egg fry on a hot pan make a run accompaniment to she word the guest at mr corbett 's table be a typical pioneer group -- homesteader speculator machine man journey through the country to sell machinery to harvest the grain not yet grow the farmer have ever be well endowed with hope and the machine business flourish mr corbett could talk and work at the same time she sudden disappearance from the room as she replenish the table merely serve as punctuation mark and not interfere with the thread of the story at all when she be compel by the exigency of the case to be present in the kitchen and therefore absent in the dining-room she merely elevate she voice to overcome distance and drop no stitch in the conversation new neighbor be it you be sayin ' tom ` deed and i have and she the purtiest little trick you ever see -- diamond ring on she and silk skirt and plume on she hat and hair as yallum as gold when she come over here i can not be doin ' my work for lookin ' at she she be bring up with slather of money this come back from the cheek of the dure where mr corbett be empty the tea leave from the teapot but the old man beyant be not be please with she since she marry this fred chap -- he would not ever look at fred nor let he come to the house and so she run away with he and no one could blame she either for that and now she and the old man do not write at all at all -- reach I the bread plate in front of you there jim -- and there be bad blood between they i can see though she and the old man be fond o ' one another be she man anything like the twin pirate ask sam moggey from oak creek because if he be i do not blame the old man for be mad about it sam be help himself to another quarter of vinegar pie as he speak mr corbett could not reply for a minute for she be put a new bandage

think he be think he be wonder what trick it be that rance belmont have show jimmy peters chapter vi _ the counter-irritant _ when fred brydon make the discovery that he two brother spend a great deal of they time in the pleasant though unprofitable occupation of card-playing with two or three of the other impecunious young man of the neighborhood he remonstrate with they on this apparent waste of time when he later discover that they be become so engross in the game that they have but little time to plant sow or reap or do any of the thing incidental to farm life he become very indignant indeed the twin naturally resent any such interference from they farm pupil they tell he that he be there to learn farming and not to give advice to he elder nearly everyone agree that card playing be a pleasant and effective way of kill time for people who wait for a long delay train at a lonely wayside station this be exactly the position in which the twin find themselves so while aunt patience of bournemouth tarry and procrastinate she loving nephew across the sea thinking of she night and day wait with as good grace as they could and play the game unlike the twin fred brydon like hard work and apply himself with great energy to the work of the farm determine to disprove he angry father-in-law 's word that he would never make a success of anything the fact that the twin be play for money give fred some uneasy moment and the uncomfortable suspicion that part of he money be be use in this way keep grow upon he he do not mention any of these thing to evelyn for he know it be hard for she to keep up friendly relation with reginald and randolph and he do not want to say anything that would further predispose she against they however evelyn with some of she father 's shrewdness be arrive at a very correct estimate of the twin without any help from anyone the twin have enjoy life much better since the come of they brother and he wife they quite enjoy look out of the fly-specked window at they brother at work with the ox in the field then too the many flattering remark make by they friend in regard to they sister-in-law 's beauty be very grateful to they ear one day in harvest time when something have go wrong with they binder and fred have send to brandon for a new knotter the twin refuse to pay for it when it come tell he that he could pay for it himself fred pay for it and work all afternoon without say anything but that evening he come into they part of the house and tell they he want a detailed statement of how he money have be spend the twin be thoroughly hurt and indignant do he think they have cheat he and they ask each other over and over again do anybody ever hear of such ingratitude the next day evelyn make a remark which quite upset they she tell they that if fred do all the work he should have more than half the crop the twin do not like these occurrence instinctively they feel that a storm be come they begin to wonder what would be the best way to avoid trouble the prairie-dweller have a way of fight a prairie fire which be very effective when they see the blue veil of smoke lie close to the horizon or the dull red glare on the night sky they immediately start another fire to go out and meet the big fire some such thought as this be struggle in the twin ' brain the day that rance belmont come over from the stopping-house and in he graceful way ask mrs brydon to go drive with he a invitation which fred urge she to accept when the drive be over and rance come in to the twin ' apartment and on they invitation have a game with they and lose they be suddenly smite with a idea they begin to see how it might be possible to start another fire chapter vii _ lady ' day at the stopping-house _ the glory of the summer pale and fade the crimson and gold of the harvest day have flee before the cold wind of autumn and now the tree along the bank of the creek stand leafless and bare tremble and sway as if in dread of the long winter that would soon be upon they the harvest have be cut and gather in and now when the weather be fine the industrious hum of the threshing-machine come on the wind for many mile and the column of blue smoke which proclaim the presence of a mill shoot up in all direction at the black creek stopping-house the real business of the year have begin for every day heavily-loaded wheat wagon wind slowly over the long trail on they way to brandon and the stopping-house become the foregathering place of all the farmer in the settlement at noon the stable yard present a lively appearance as the boy unhitch they steam team and lead they to the long straggle straw-roofed stable the hay that john corbett have cut on the meadow of black creek and stack beside the stable be carry in miniature stack which completely hide the man who carry they into the manger while the creak windlass of the well proclaim that the water-trough be be fill the cattle who forage through the straw stack in the field near by always make the mistake of think that they be include in the invitation much to the disgust of peter rockett the chore boy who drive they back with appropriate remark inside of the stopping-house the long dining-room call the room be a scene of great activity the long oilcloth-covered table down the center of the room be full of smoking dish of potato and ham and corn beef and pile high with bread and bun tin teapot be at each end of the table and be pass from hand to hand there be white bowl fill with stewed prune and apricot and pitcher of goldendrop syrup at interval down the table table etiquette be fairly well observe -- the person who take the last of the potato be in duty bind to take the dish out to the kitchen and replenish it from the black pot which stand on its three leg on the back of the kitchen stove the same rule apply to the tea and the bread also when one have finish he meal the correct plan of procedure be to gather up he plate knife and fork and cup and saucer and carry they out to the kitchen where mr corbett or peter rockett hastily wash they to be ready for the next one when enter the black creek dining-room with the purpose of have a meal there be certain small convention to be observe if a place be already set the newcomer could with impunity sit down and proceed with the order of business if there be no place set but room for a place to be set the hungry one come out to the kitchen and select what implement he need in the way of plate and knife and proceed to the vacancy if there be not a vacant place at the table the newcomer retire to the window and read the _ northern messenger _ or the _ war cry _ which be present in large number on the sewing-machine but before leave the table conversation zone it be consider perfectly legitimate to call out in a loud voice : some eat fast some eat long and some eat both way or some such bright and felicitous remark it be a bitter cold day in November -- one of those dark cold day with a search wind just before the snow come in mr corbett 's kitchen there be a unusual bustle and great excitement for the woman from the tiger hill be there -- three of they on they way to brandon mrs corbett say it always make she nervous to cook for woman you can not fool they on a bad pudding by put on a good sauce the way you can a man but mr corbett admit it be good to see they anyway there be mrs berry and she sister miss thornley and mr smith they have ride fifteen mile on a load of wheat and have yet another fifteen to go to reach they destination in spite of a long cold and very slow ride the three lady be in splendid condition and as soon as they be thaw out enough to talk and long before they tooth stop chatter they begin to ask about mr corbett 's neighbor young mr brydon in such a way that as mr corbett afterwards explain to da corbett you could tell they have hear something we lad see she over at the orangeman 's ball in millford and they say rance belmont be with she more than she own man say mr berry as she melt the frost from she eyebrow by hold she face over the stove oh well mr corbett say i guess all the young fellow be makin ' a lot of she but sure there be no harm in that miss thornley be too busy examine she foot for possible frostbite to give in she contribution just then but after she have put she coldest foot in a wash-basin of water she say i do not see how any woman can go the length of she toe with rance belmont but young mr brydon go to brandon with he last week for my sister 's husband hear it from somebody that have see they i do not know how she can do it mr corbett be mash potato with a gem-jar and without stop she work she say : oh well miss thornley it be easy for you and I to say we would not go out with rance belmont but maybe that be mostly because we have never have the chance he be get a pretty nice way with he rance have and i guess if he come along now with he sorrel pacer and say to you ` come on miss thornley ' you would get on that boot and stock in two jiffy and be off with he like any young girl miss thornley mumble a denial and a angry light shone in she pale blue eye mr smith be also full of the subject and while she twist she hair into a small nub about the size shape and color of a peanut she express she view it be not decent for she to be goin ' round with rance belmont the way she do and they say at the dance at millford she never miss a dance since rance have get he money from england he have not do a thing but play card with they twin and take she round i do not see how she man can put up with it but he be a awful easy-goin ' chap -- just the kind that would not notice anything wrong until he would come home some night and find she go i have not one bit of respect for she oh now mr smith you be too hard on she she be young and pretty and like a good time mr corbett be give she steel knive a quick rub with ash out of deference to the lady stopper it be easy enough for folk like we wave she knife to include all present to be very respectable and never get ourselves talk about for nobody 's askin ' we to go to dance or fly around with they but with she it be different do not be hard on she she be not goin ' to do anything she should not but the lady be loath to adopt mr corbett 's point of view all they life nothing have happen and here be a deliciously exciting possible scandal and they cling to it they say the old man grant be nearly a millionaire and he be get lonely for she and be pretty near ready to forgive she and fred and take they back would not it be awful if the old man should come up here and find she would go with rance belmont mr berry look anxiously around the kitchen as if search for the lose one oh do not worry declare mr corbett she be not a quitter she 'll stay with she own man they be happy as ever i see two people if she do go miss thornley say sentimentally if she do go do you suppose she would leave a note pin on the pin-cushion i think they mostly do when the lady have go that afternoon and while mr corbett wash the white ironstone dish she be not nearly so compose and confident in mind as she pretend to be do not it beat the band how much they find out i often wonder how thing get to be know i do wish she would not give they the chance to talk but she be not the one that will take tellin ' -- too much like she father for that -- and still i kind o ' like she for she spunky way rance be a divil but she do not know that it be pretty hard to tell what ought to be do this be surely work for the almighty and not for sinful human being that night mr corbett take she pen in hand mr corbett be more at home with the potato-masher or the rolling-pin but when duty call she she follow even though it involve the use of unfamiliar tool she write a lengthy letter to mr robert grant care of the imperial lumber company toronto ontario : dear and respect sir mr corbett write i take my pen in

look - glass which hang over the oilcloth-covered soap box on which stand the wash-basin and soap saucer she call to he to come into the pantry and while she hurriedly peel the potato she plunge at once into the subject rance she begin you go to see mr brydon far too often and people be talk about it rance shrug he shoulder now do not tell I you do not care or that it be none of my business though that may be true i would never be so lack in politeness however true it might be he answer roll a cigarette mr corbett look at he a minute then she break out oh but you be the smooth-tongued gent -- you would coax the bird off the bush but i want to tell you that you be not do right hang around mr brydon the way you do do she object he ask in the same even tone as he slowly strike a match

weatherbeaten and gray and toughen -- she be not make for it -- she be intend for diamond ring and drawing-room and silk and satin rance belmont look at she still smile he inexplicable smile i can

leave they alone rance they be doin ' fine before you come along do one good turn rance and take yourself off you ask too much mr corbett i find mr brydon very pleasant company and mr fred do not object to my presence but he would if he know how the people talk about it that be very wrong of they and entirely unavoidable rance answer calmly but the opinion of the neighbor have never bother I yet he continue why should it in this instance mr corbett 's eye flash ominously do you know what i would do if it be my girl you be after she ask pause in she work and fix she eye on he something very unpleasant i should say by the tone of you voice -- and by the way you be point you potato knife at I -- mr corbett with a effort control she temper i believe mr corbett you would do I bodily injury what a horrible thought and you a former officer in the salvation army rance be smile again and enjoy the situation what a thrilling headline it would make for the brandon _ sun _ : ` the black

interest I a great deal i be so fond of all of you you be a divil rance mr corbett repeat again but you be not goin ' to do that bless girl any harm -- she be goin ' to be save from you some way who

i be askin ' he to save she and i have get I answer he will do it there be a gleam in she eye and a white glow in she face that make rance belmont for one brief moment tremble but he light another cigarette and with a bow of exaggerated politeness leave the room the day that follow be anxious one for mr corbett many stopper sit at she table as the christmas season draw near and many time she hear allusion to she young neighbor which fill she with apprehension she have carefully count the day that it would take she letter to reach its destination and although there have be time for a reply none come chapter viii _ shadow of the night _ it be a wind-swept chilly morning in late November and evelyn brydon alone in the silent little house stand at the window look listlessly at the dull gray monochrome which stretch before she the unaccustomed housework have roughen and chap she hand and the many failure in she cooking experiment in spite of mr corbett 's instruction have leave she tired and depressed for a failure be always depress even if it be only in the construction of the thing which perish this dark morning it seem to she that she life be as gray and colorless as the bleached-out prairie -- the glamor have go from everything she and fred have have they first quarrel and fred have go away daze and hurt by the thing she have say under the stress of she anger he be at a loss to know what have go wrong with evelyn for she have seem quite contented all the time he do not know how the many little annoyance have pile up on she how the utter loneliness of the prairie with its monotonous sweep of frost-killed grass the deadly sameness and the perpetual silence of the house have so work upon she mind that it require but a tiny spark to cause a explosion the spark he have supply himself when he have try to defend he brother from she charge all at once evelyn feel herself grow cold with anger and the uncontrolled hasty word bitterer than anything she have ever think utterly unjust and cruel spring to she lip and fred sting to the quick with the injustice of it have go away without a word it be with a very heavy heart that he go to he work that day but he have to go for he be help one of the neighbor to thresh and every dry day be precious and every man be need all day long evelyn go about the house try to justify herself a great wave of self-pity seem to be engulf she and blot out every worthier feeling the prairie be hateful to she that day its dull gray stretch cruel and menacing and a strange fear of it seem to possess she all day she try to busy herself about the house but she work to no purpose take up thing and lay they down again forget what she be go to do with they strange whisper voice seem to sound in the room behind she try to tell she something -- to warn she -- and it be in vain that she try to shake off they influence once or twice she catch a glimpse of a black shadow over she shoulder just a reflect vanish glimpse and when she turn hastily round there be nothing there but the voice mock and gibber be louder than ever she wish fred would come she would tell he that she have not mean what she say as the afternoon wear on and fred do not make he appearance a sudden deadly fear come over she at the thought of staying alone of course the twin occupy the other half of the house and to-night at least she be glad of they protection suddenly it occur to she that she have hear no sound from they quarter for a long time she listen and listen the silence grow more and more oppressive until at last overcome she fear she go around and try the door even the voice of she much - despise brother-in-law would be sweet music to she ear the door be lock and there be no response to she knock a old envelope stick in a sliver in the door bear the entry in lead - pencil go duck shooting to plover slough for it be the custom of the twin to faithfully chronicle the cause of they absence and they probable location each time they leave home to make it easy to find they in the event of a cablegram from aunt patience 's solicitor evelyn turn away and run back to she own part of the house she hastily bar the door the short autumn day be soon over the sun break out from the dull gray mountain of cloud and throw a yellow glare on the colorless field she stand by the window watch the light as it fade and pale and die and then the shades of evening quickly gather turn again to replenish the fire the darkness of the room startle she there be a shadow under the table like a cave 's mouth unaccustomed sound smite she ear the log in the house creak uncannily and when she walk across the floor muffle footfall seem to follow she she put more wood in the stove and try to shake off the apprehension which be choke she she light the lamp and hastily draw down the white cotton blind and pin it close to keep out the great pitiless stare outside which seem to be peer in at she with a dozen white mocking merciless face in the lamp 's dim light the shadow be blacker than ever the big packing-box throw a shadow on the wall that be as black as the mouth of a tunnel in a mountain she notice that she stock of wood be run low and with a mighty effort of the will she open the door to bring in some from a pile in the yard stop a minute to muster up she courage she wait at the open door suddenly the weird cry of a wolf come up from the creek bank and it be a bitter lonely insistent cry she slam the door and come back into the room sink weak and tremble into a chair a horror grow upon she until the bead of perspiration stand upon she face she hand grow numb and useless and the skin of she head seem stiff and frozen she ear be strain to catch any sound and out of the silence there come many strange noise to torment she overstrained sens she think of mr corbett at the stopping-house and try to muster courage to walk the distance but a terrible fear hold she to the spot the fire die out and the room grow colder and colder but huddle in a chair in a panic of fear she do not notice the cold she tooth chatter spot of light dance before she tightly-shut eye she do not know what she be afraid of a terrible nameless fear seem to be clutch at she very heart it be the living wake counterpart of the nightmare that have make horrible she childhood night -- a grip overwhelming fear of what might happen suddenly something burst into the room -- the terrible something that she have be wait for the silence break into a thousand scream voice she slip to the floor and cry out in a agony of terror there be a loud knock on the door and then through the horrible silence that follow there come a voice call to she not to be afraid she stagger to the door and unbar it and hear someone speak again in bless human voice the door open and she find herself look into the face of rance belmont and she fear-tortured eye give he a glad welcome she seize he by the arm hold to he as a child fear-smitten in the night will hold fast to the one who come in answer to he cry rance belmont know how to make the most yet not too much of a advantage he soothe she fear courteously gently he build up the fire he make she a cup of tea there be that strange and subtle influence in all that he say and do that make she forget everything that be unpleasant and be happy in he presence a perfect content grow upon she she forget she fear -- she loneliness -- she quarrel with fred she remember only the happy company of the present under the intoxication of the man 's presence she cease to be the tired discourage irritable woman and become once more the evelyn grant whose vivacity and wit have make she conspicuous in the brightest company she try to remind herself of some of the unpleasant thing that neighborhood gossip say of rance belmont -- of mr corbett 's dislike of he -- but in the charm of he presence they all fade into vague unreality there be flattery clever hidden flattery which seem like adoration in every word he speak every tone of he voice every glance of he coal-black eye that seem in some way to atone for the long gray monotonous day that have weigh so heavily upon she spirit be you always frighten when you be leave alone he ask she every word be a caress the tone of he voice imply that she should never be leave alone the magnetism of he presence assure she that she would never be leave alone again i be never leave alone in the evening before she say i think i be very brave until to-night but it be horrible -- it make I shudder to think of it do not think he say gently fred think the twin would be here i know or he would not have stay away evelyn say wish to do justice to fred and feeling indefinitely guilty about something the twin be jolly good company -- oh i say laugh rance in tone so like she brother-in-law that evelyn laugh delightedly it be lovely to have someone to laugh with but where be the heavenly twin to-night i suppose they see a flock of duck go over or hear the honk-honk of wild goose she answer it do not take much to distract they from labor -- and they have a soul above it you know rance belmont need not have ask she about the twin he have meet they on they way to the plover slough and have give reginald the loan of he gun he have learn from they that fred too be away but if dear aunt patience will only lift she anchor all will yet be well and the dear twin will not need to be bother with anything so beastly as farm-work he tone and manner be so like the twin that evelyn applaud he effort then he tell she the story of the cow and of how the twin endeavor to follow the example of some of the canadian whom they have see lock they wagon-wheel with a chain when go down the souri hill have make a slight mistake in the location of the chain and hobble the ox with disastrous result when he look at he watch it be nine o'clock i must go he say hastily rise it would hardly do for I to be find here what do you mean she ask in surprise what do you suppose you husband would say if he come home and find I here evelyn flush angrily my husband have confidence in I she answer proudly i do not know what he think of you but i know what he think of I and it would make no difference what company he find I in he would never doubt I i trust he in the same way i would believe he word against that of the whole world she hold she handsome head high when she say this rance belmont look at she with a dull glow in he black eye i hope you be right he say watch the color come in she face i be right she say after a pause daring which she have look at he defiantly he be wise enough to see he have make a false move and have lose ground in she regard i think you have better go she say at last i do not like that insinuation of yours that you presence here might be misconstrue yes i want you to go i be glad to see you i be never so glad to see anyone i be paralyze with fear but now i be myself again and i be sure fred will come home there be a sneering smile on he face which she understand and resent in that case i have better go he say that be not the reason i want you to go i tell you again that fred would not believe that i be untrue to he he believe in I utterly she draw herself up with a imperious gesture and add : i be worthy of he trust rance belmont think he have never see she so beautiful i will not leave you he declare forgive I for speak as i do i judge you husband by the standard of the world i might have know that the man who win you must be different from other man it be only for you sake that i say i must go i care nothing for he fury if it be the fury of a hundred man i would stay with you just to be near you to hear you sweet voice to see you be heaven to I evelyn spring to she foot indignantly as he arise and come towards she just at that moment the door open and fred brydon have hear the last word stand face to face with they both chapter ix _ he evil genius _ when fred brydon go to he work that morning smart from the angry word that evelyn have hurl at he everyone he meet notice how gloomy and burden he seem to be how totally unlike he former easy good - nature and genial cheerfulness be he strange air of reserve they think they know the cause and tell each other so when he be not listen when he come into the kitchen to wash himself at noon he hear one of the man say to another in a aside : he 'll be the last one to catch on he pay no particular attention to the sentence at the time but it stick in he memory the day be fine and dry and the thresher be run at the top of its speed one more day would finish the stack and as this be the last threshing to be do in the neighborhood the greatest effort be put forth to finish it before the weather break they urge he to stay the night -- they would begin again at daylight -- the weather be so uncertain he think of course that the twin be safely at home and evelyn have often say that she be not afraid to stay he

inside the fire burn bright in the box - stove and a interested and excited group sit around the table where rance belmont and john corbett play the game peter rockett with he eye bulge from he head watch he grave employer cut and deal and gather in the stake with as much astonishment as if that dignified gentleman have walk head downward on the ceiling yet john corbett proceed with the game as grave and solemn as when he ask a blessing at the table sometimes he hum snatch of army tune and sometimes rance belmont swear softly and to the anxious ear which listen at the stovepipe-hole above both sound be of surpass sweetness chapter xi _ the blizzard _ when the door close behind rance belmont and evelyn fred sink into a chair with the whole room whirling dizzily around he why have the world go so suddenly wrong he head be quite clear now and only the throbbing hurt on the back of he head remind he of reginald 's cowardly blow but he anger against he brother have fade into apathy in the presence of this new trouble which seem to choke the very fountain of he be one terrible fact smite he with crush force -- evelyn have leave he and go with rance belmont she say she hope she would never see he again -- that she be do with he -- and she eye have blaze with anger and hatred -- and she have step in between he and the miserable villain whom he would have so dearly love to have beat

give up everything for he -- for he sake she have defy she father renounce all share in he great wealth suffer the hardship and loneliness of the prairie all for he she workbag lay on the table partly open it seem to call and beckon to he he take it tenderly in he hand and from its fold there fall a crumpled sheet of paper he smooth it out and find it partly write on in evelyn 's clear round hand he hold it to the light eagerly as one might read a message from the dead who be evelyn write to _ when you ask I to leave my husband you ask I to do a dishonorable and cowardly thing fred have never _ -- the write cease abruptly fred read it again aloud then spring to he foot with a smother exclamation only one solution present itself to he mind she have be write to rance belmont try to withstand he advance try to break away from he devilish influence she have try to be true to herself and to he fred remembered then with bitter shame the small help he have give she he have wrong she when he strike rance belmont one overwhelming thought rise out of the chaos of he mind -- she must be set free from the baneful influence of this man if she be not strong enough to resist he herself she must be help and that help must come from he -- he have swear to protect she and he would do it there be just one way leave to he now fred 's face whiten at the thought and he eye have a unnatural glitter but there be a deadly purpose in he heart in he trunk he find the smith and wesson that one of the boy in the office have give he when he leave and which he have never think of since he hastily but carefully load it and slip it into he pocket then reach for he snowy overcoat which have fall to the floor and put the lamp in the window more from habit than with any purpose he go out into the night

forward at a brisk walk occasionally break into a run he have but one thought in he mind -- he must yet save evelyn he have desert she in she hour of need but he would yet make amends the wind which

the stove yesterday and to-day be separate by a gulf as wide as death itself he have go about three mile when he hear a faint halloo come down the wind it sound two or three time before the real significance of it occur to he so intent be he upon he own affair but louder and more insistent come the unmistakable call for help a fierce temptation assail fred brydon he must not delay -- every minute be precious -- to save evelyn he wife be surely more he duty than to set lose traveller on they way again besides he tell himself it be not a fiercely cold night -- there be no great danger of any person freezing to death and even so be not some thing more vital than save people from death which must come sooner or later then down the wind come the cry again -- a frightened cry -- he could hear the word -- help help for god 's sake something in fred brydon 's heart respond to that appeal he could not hurry by unheed guide by the call he turn aside from he course and make he way through the choke storm across the prairie the cry come nearer and fred shout in reply -- word of impatient encouragement no rescuer ever go to he work with a worse grace a large dark object loom faintly through the drive storm what be the matter call fred when he be within speak distance i be catch -- tangle up in some devilish thing come back the cry fred hurry forward and find a man almost cover with snow huddle beside a haystack he clothing securely hold by the barb of the wire with which the stack be fence you be stick in the barb wire say fred as he remove he mitten and with a good deal of

the ground beneath they foot and the faint murmur of the river below as it slip over its pebbly bed come faintly to they ear in the sky above they wild goose with flash white wing honk away toward the south and a meadow lark that jolly fellow who come early and stay late on a red-leafed haw-tree pour out he little heart in melody you see mr shaw maud be say it do not look right for grandma to be

at a early hour in the morning it be a bitterly cold dark winter morning the wire overhead sing dismally in the wind and even the cheer of the big coal fire that glow in the rusty stove be dampen by the incessant mourning of the storm along the wall on the bench sit the trackman in they sheepskin coat and fur cap with earlap tie tightly down they be tired and sleepy and sit in every conceivable attitude expressive of sleepiness and fatigue a red lantern like a evil eye gleam from one dark corner in the middle of the floor be several green lamp turn low and over against the wall hang one bar lantern whose bright little gleam of light remind one uncomfortably of a small live mouse in a cage catch and doom but undaunted still the telegraph instrument click at interval two man wrap in overcoat stand beside the stove and talk in low tone about the way real estate be increase in value in winnipeg the door open and a big fellow another snow shoveller come in hurriedly let in a burst of fly snow that sizzle on the hot stove it do not rouse the sleeper from the bench neither do the new-comer 's remark that it be a deuce of a night bring forth any argument -- we be one on that point the train be late the night agent tell we that when he come out to shovel in more coal -- she be delay by the storm i lean back and try to be comfortable after all i think it might easily be worse i be go home after a pleasant visit i have many agreeable thing to think of and still i keep think to myself that it be not a cheerful night the clock of course indicate that it be morning but the deep black that look in through the frosted window the heavy shadow in the room which the flicker lantern only seem to emphasize be all of the night and bear no relation to the morning the train come at last with a roar that drown the voice of the storm the sleeper on the bench spring up like one man seize they lantern and we all rush out together the long coach that i enter be fill with tired sleepy-looking people who have be sit up all night they be curl up uncomfortably make a brave attempt to rest all except one little old lady who sit upright look out into the black night when the official come to ask the passenger where they be go i hear she tell he that she be a canadian and she have be down in the state with annie and now she be bring annie home and as she say this she point significantly ahead to the baggage car there be something about the old lady that appeal to I i go over to she when the official have go out no she be not tire she say she have be up a good many night

dave johnston -- annie 's man that be -- he drink you know -- the old lady 's voice fall and she tired old face seem to take on deeper line of trouble as she sit silent with she own sad thought i express my sorrow yes annie have she own trouble poor girl she say at last and she be a good girl annie be and she deserve something better she be a tender-hearted girl and gentle and quiet and never talk back to anyone to dave least of all for she worship the very ground he walk on and marry he against all we wish she think she could reform he she say it sadly but without bitterness be he good to she i ask people draw near together in the stormy dark of a winter 's morning and the thought of annie in she narrow box ahead rob my question of any rudeness he be good to she in he own way annie 's mother say try to be quite just but it be a rough way she have a fine big brick house to live in -- it be a grand house but it be a lonely house he often go away and stay for week and she not know where he be or how he would come home he worry she always the doctor say that be part of she trouble -- he worry she too much do he ever try to stop drink i ask i want to think better of he if i could

they get he go again annie never could bear to mention about he drinkin ' to anyone not even I -- it would ha ' be easier on she if she could ha ' talk about it but she be not one of the talkin ' kind

but it mean a lot to we and to he too poor fellow annie do not want to do it but he insist sick folk know how to be kind to sick folk i tell you the dawn begin to show blue behind the frost fern on the window and the lamp overhead look pale and sickly in the gray light annie have she operation on Monday she go on after a long pause she be lookin ' every day for a letter from dave and when the doctor tell she they would operate on she on Monday morning early she ask he if he would mind put it off until noon she think there would be a letter from dave for sure on that morning 's mail the doctor be very kind to she -- they understand a lot they mayo -- and he do put it off in the ward with annie there be a little woman from saskatchewan that be a very bad case she talk to we a lot about she man and she four child she have a real good man by what she say they be on a homestead near quill lake and she be so sure she would get well the doctor be very hopeful of annie and say she have nine chance out of ten of get better but this little woman 's be a worse case dr will mayo tell she she have just one chance in ten -- but dear I she be a brave woman she speak right up quick and say she ` that be all i want i 'll get well if i have only half a chance i have get to jim and the child can not do without I ' jim be she man when they come to take she out into the operating room they could not give she ether some way she grab the doctor 's hand and say she kind of chokin ' up all at once ` you 'll do you best for jim 's sake will not you ' and he say say he ` my dear woman i 'll do my best for you sake ' busy and all as they be they be the kindest man in the world and just before they begin to operate the nurse bring she a letter from jim and read it to she and she hold it in she hand through it all and when they wheel she back into the ward after the operation it be still in she hand though she have faint dead away do annie get she letter i ask she my companion do not answer at once but i know very well that the letter have not come she do not ask for it at the last she just look at I before they put the gauze thing over she face i know what she mean i have be down to see if it have come and they tell I all the mail be in for the day from the west she just look at I so pitiful but it be like annie not to ask a letter from dave would have comfort she so but it do not come though i wire he two day before tell he when the operation would be annie be wonderful cheerful and calm but i be tremble like a leaf when they be givin ' she the ether and when they wheel she out all so stiff and white i just seem to feel i would lose my girl i take the old lady 's hand and try to whisper word of comfort she return the pressure of my hand she eye be tearless and she voice do not even waver but the thought of poor annie go into the valley unassured by any loving word give free passage to my tear do dave write or wire i ask when i could speak no not a word he be likely off on a spree the old lady speak bitterly now everybody be kind to my annie but he and it be a word from he that would have cheer she the most dr mayo come and sit beside she just a hour before she die and say he ` you still have a chance mr johnston ' but annie just thank he again for he kindness and sort o ' shake she head the little woman from saskatchewan do not do well at all after the operation and dr mayo be afraid she would not pull through she ask he what chance she have and he tell she straight -- the mayo always tell the truth -- that she have only one chance in a hundred she be so weak that he have to bend down to hear she whisperin ' ` i 'll take that one chance ' and do she i ask eagerly she be still live when i leave she will get better i think she have a very good man by what she be tellin ' we and a woman can stand a lot if she have a good man the old lady say with the wisdom bear of experience i have nurse around a lot and i have always notice that

smitten with the idea mr bank often say afterwards she do not know how she come to be think about the convention of the art and craft at all although she be the secretary the idea be so compelling that mr bank rush down town to tell mr bank -- she feel she could not depend on the telephone ted she cry when she open the door of the office i have a idea theodore raise he eyelid mr bank be flush and excite and look well mrs bank be a handsome woman any time and to-day she vivacity be quite genuine you know the convention of the art and craft -- which begin on the twentieth i have hear of it -- somewhere well it just come to I teddy what a perfectly heavenly thing it would be to invite that little mr dawson who write review for one of the papers here -- you remember i tell you about she -- she be awfully clever and artistic and good-looking and live away off from every place and she husband be not she equal at all -- perfectly illiterate i hear -- uncultured anyway what a perfect joy it would be to she to have she come and meet with people who be she equal she be a ottawa girl originally i believe and she do write the most perfectly sweet and darling thing -- you remember i have read they for you of course she be probably very shabby and out of date in she clothes by this time but it do not really matter what one wear if one have heap of brain it be only dull woman really who have to be so terribly careful about what they wear and spend so much money that way dull woman theodore murmured oh be that why i never really know she laugh at he look of enlighten surprise when mr bank laugh there be three dimple plainly show which do not entirely discourage she merriment and you know teddy there be such a mystery about she marriage she will really be quite a acquisition and we 'll have she on the program what mystery mr bank ask oh well not mystery maybe but we all suppose she be not happy how could she be with so few of the real pleasure of life and still she stay with it and actually go place with she husband and seem to be keep it up and you know ted she have either three or four child be it as bad as that he ask solemnly oh ted you know well enough what i mean -- do not be such a owl just think of how tie down and horrible it must be for she out there in that desolate alberta with no neighbor at all for mile and then only impossible people i should think it would drive she mad i must try to get she on the program too she will at least be interesting on account of she personality most of we speaker be horribly prosy at least to I but of course i never listen i just look to see what they have on and then go straight back to my own thinking i just think i would ask you advice teddy dear before i ask the committee and so now i 'll go to see mr trenton the president so glad you approve dear and really there will be a touch of romance in it ted for bruce edward know she when she live in ottawa -- it be he who tell I so much about she he simply rave about she to I -- it seem he be quite mad about she once and probably it be a lover 's quarrel or something that drive she away to the west to forget -- and now think of she meeting bruce again be not that a thriller if i think bruce edward have brain enough to care for any woman i would say it be not right to bring she here say mr bank but he have not oh of course mr bank agree he be quite over it now no doubt thing like that never last but he 'll be awfully nice to she and give she a good time and take she around -- you know what bruce be like -- he be so romantic and cynical and such a perfect darling in he manners -- always ready to open a door or pick up a handkerchief i be sure he would -- if he need the handkerchief theodore put in quietly oh ted you be a funny bunny you have never like bruce -- and i know why -- and it be perfectly horrid of you just because he have always be particularly nice to I -- he really can not help be dreamy and devoted to any woman he be with if she be not a positive fright \* \* \* \* \* mr trenton the president of the art and craft receive mr bank ' suggestion cautiously mr trenton always ask be it right be it wise be it expedient it be mrs trenton 's extreme cautiousness that have bring she the proud distinction of be the first president of the art and craft where it be consider necessary to temper the impetuosity of the younger member and besides mr trenton never carry she doubt and fear too far she raise all possible objection mention all possible contingency but in the end allow the younger member to carry the day which they do with a clear and shriven conscience feeling that they have be very discreet and careful and deliberate mr bank introduce she subject by tell mr trenton that she have come to ask she advice whereupon mr trenton lay aside the work she be do and signify she gracious willingness to be ask for counsel when mr bank have carefully lay the matter before mr trenton dwelling on the utter loneliness of the prairie woman 's life mr trenton call the vice-president miss hasting who be a oil painter by profession and a lady of large experience in matter of the heart mr trenton ask mr bank to outline she plan again when she have finish mr trenton ask : be it wise -- be it kind she have choose she life why bring she back it will only fill she heart with vain repining this man illiterate though he may be be she lawful husband -- she owe he a duty be we just to he maybe she be perfectly happy miss hasting say there be no accounting for love and its vagary perhaps to she he be clothe in the rosy glow of romance and all the inconvenience of she life be forget i have read of it she add in explanation when she notice mr trenton 's look of incredulity mr trenton sigh a long sigh that undulate the black lace on she capacious bosom it have be write -- it will continue to be write but to-day marriage need to be aid by modern -- she hesitate and look at mr bank for the word method mr bank supply promptly housemaid cook auto theater jewelry and chocolate you put it so aptly my dear mrs trenton smile as she pat she pearl bracelet mr trenton 's last offering on the hymeneal altar it require -- she pause again -- mr trenton 's pause be a very important asset in she conversation -- it require -- collateral say mr bank miss hasting shake she head i believe in marriage -- all the same she say heroically now how shall we do it mr bank be anxious to get the preliminary over you have decide to invite she of course mr trenton nod i feel we have no choice in the matter she say slowly she be certainly a woman of artistic temperament -- she must be or she would succumb to the dreary prairie level i have follow she career with interest and predict great thing for she -- have i not miss hasting we should not blame she if in a moment of girlish romance she turn she back on the life which now be we as officer of the art and craft must extend we fellowship to all who be worthy this join of we rank may show she what she lose by she girlish folly but it be better for she to know life and even feel regret than never to know better have a scarlet thread run through the dull gray pattern of life even if it make the gray all the duller say miss hasting who work in oils and so it come about that a invitation be send to mr jame dawson auburn alberta and in due time a acceptance be receive from the time she alight from the pacific express a slight young woman in a very smart linen suit she be a constant surprise to the art and craft the principal cause of they surprise be that she seem perfectly happy

and poet who would attend the convention several of the enthusiastic member anxious to advertise effectively have interview the newspaper reporter on the subject with the result that long article be publish in the woman 's section of the city daily deal principally with the loneliness of the life on a alberta ranch kate dawson be credit with a heroic spirit that would have make she blush have she see the flattering allusion robinson crusoe on he lonely isle before the advent of Friday be not more isolate than she on she lonely alberta ranch accord to the advance notice luckily she have not see

first open night of the convention and the auditorium be crowd the air be heavy with the perfume of many flower and pulsed with dreamy music mr trenton in billow of black lace and glint jet preside with she usual graciousness she introduce mr dawson briefly whatever the attitude of the audience be at first they soon follow she with eager interest as she tell they in she easy way simple story of the people she know so well and so lovingly understand there be no art in the tell only a sweet naturalness and a apparent honesty -- the honesty of purpose that come to people in lonely place she story be all of the class that magazine editor call homely heart-interest stuff not deep or clever or problematical -- the commonplace doings of common people -- but it find a entrance into the heart of man and woman they find themselves look with she at broad sunlit space where struggle heart work out noble destiny without any thought of heroism they see the moonlight and its drift shadow on the wheat and smell again the ripening grain at dawn they hear the whirr of prairie chicken ' wing among the golden stubble on the hillside and the glamor of some old forget afternoon steal over they man and woman country-born who have forget the voice of they youth hear they call across the year and hear they too with open heart and sudden tear there be one pathetic story she tell they of the lonely prairie woman -- the woman who wish she be back the woman to whom the broad outlook and far horizon be terrible and full of fear she tell they how at night this lonely woman draw down the blind and pin they close to keep out the great white outside that stare at she through every chink with wide pitiless eye -- the mock voice that she hear behind she everywhere day and night whisper mock plot and the awful shadow black and terrible that crouch behind she just out of sight -- never come out in the open it be a weird and gloomy picture that but she do not leave it so she tell of the new neighbor who come to live near the lonely woman -- the human companionship which drive the mock voice away forever -- the come of the spring when the world awake from its white sleep and the thousand joyous live thing that come into be at the touch of the good old sun at the reception after the program many crowd around she express they sincere appreciation of she work bruce edward fully enjoy the distinction which he former acquaintance with she give he and it be with quite a air of proprietorship that he introduce to she he friend mr trenton mr bank and other member of the art and craft at a

himself the night before the election the committee sit in the committee room and go carefully over the list they be hopeful but not hilarious -- there have be disappointment desertion lapse billy weaver loyal to the cause but of pessimistic nature testify that sam cowery have be talkin ' pretty shrewd about reciprocity by which billy do not mean shrewd at all but rather crooked and adverse however there be no mistaking billy 's meaning of the word when one hear he say it with he inimitable down-the-ottaway accent it be only the feeble write word which require explanation george burn be report to have say he do not care whether he vote or not if it be a wet day he might but if it be weather for stack he would stack you bet this be a gross insult to the president of the conservative association whose farm he have rent and live on for the last five year during which time there have be two election at both of which he have vote right the president have not think it necessary to interview he at all this time feeling sure that he be within the pale but now it seem that some trifler have tell he that he would get more for he barley and not have to pay so much for he tobacco if reciprocity carry and it be report that he have be hear to say with picturesque eloquence that you could hardly expect a man to cut he throat both way by vote against it these and other kindred report fill the committee with apprehension the most unmoved member of the company be the redoubtable tom himself who stretch upon the slippery black leather lounge hoarse as a frog from much address of obdurate elector be endeavor to sing just before the battle mother hit the tune only in the most inconspicuous place the secretary with the list in he hand go over the name : jim stewart -- jim 's solid he do not want reciprocity because he send to the state once for a washing-machine for he wife and smuggle it through from st vincent and when he get it here he wife would not use it abe collin -- abe 's not right and never will be -- he see sir wilfrid once -- john thomas green -- say how about jack surely we can corral jack he be work for you milt be not he address one of the scrutineer leave he to I say milt with a air of mystery there be no one have more influence with jack than I no he be not with I just now he be over with my brother angus but when he come in to vote i 'll be

be brother there be a tense silence milt take he pipe from he mouth my brother angus he begin dramatically gird himself for the effort -- for milt be a orator of twelfth of July fame -- angus kennedy my brother breed and rear and rear and breed in the principle of conservatism as my poor old father often say have go over -- have desert we banner have steep himself in the false teaching of the grits angus my brother he conclude impressively be -- not right what be wrong with he ask jim grover who be of a analytical turn of mind too late to discuss that now break in the secretary we can not trace angus 's downfall but we can send out and get in john thoma we need he vote -- it be just as good as anybody 's jimmy rice volunteer to go out and get he jimmy do not believe in leave anything to chance he have be run a auto all week and would just as soon work at night as any other time big jack moore another enthusiastic conservative agree to go with he when they make the ten-mile run to the home of the apostate angus they meet he come down the path with a lantern in he hand on the way to feed he horse they be plain blunt man unaccustomed to the amenity of election time and not know how to skilfully approach a subject of this kind simply announce that they have come for john thoma he be not here say angus look around the circle of light that the lantern throw be you sure ask jame rice after a painful pause yes say angus with exaggerated ease affect not to notice the significance of the question jack go to nelson to-day and he be not back yet he go about three o'clock go on angus endeavor to patch up a shaky story with a little interesting detail he take over a bunch of pig for I that i be shippin ' into winnipeg and he be goin ' to bring back some lumber i be in nelson to-day angus say john moore sternly just come from there and i do not see john thomas angus though fall and misguided be not entirely unregenerate a lie sit awkwardly on he honest lip and now that he feeble effort at deception have miscarry he feel himself adrift on a boundless sea he wildly feel around for a reply and be greatly relieve by the arrival of he father on the scene who see the light of the auto in the yard have come out hurriedly to see what be the matter grandpa kennedy although near he ninetieth birthday be still a man of affair and what be still more important on this occasion a lifelong conservative grandpa know it be the night before the election he also have see what he have see grandpa might be get on but he could see as far through a cellar door as the next one angus glad of a chance to escape go on to the stable leave the visit gentleman to be entertain by grandpa grandpa be a diplomat he want to have no hard feeling with anyone good-night boy he cry in he shrill voice he recognize the occupant of the auto and he quick brain take in the situation do not it beat all how the frost keep off this remind I of the fall ` leven year ago -- we have no frost till the end of the month i ripen three bushel of golden queen tomato all this be deliver in a very high voice for angus 's benefit -- to show he if he be listen how perfectly innocent the conversation be then as angus 's lantern disappear behind the stable the old man 's voice be lower and he give forth this cryptic utterance : _ john thoma be in the cellar _ then he gaily resume he chatter although angus be safe in the stable but grandpa know what he know and angus 's woman might be listen at the back door much election talk in town boy he ask breezily they answer he at random then he voice fall again angle 's dead against brown -- will not let you have john thoma -- put he down cellar soon as he see yer light angie 's woman be sittin on the door knittin ' -- she be wor 'n he -- do not let on i give it away -- i do not want no word with she -- yes it be grand weather for threshin ' will not you come on away in i guess yer horse will stand the old man roar with laughter at he own joke john

the sheet and come down from a upstairs window tom be not allow to finish he narrative though for it be feel that the case be not similar no one seem to be particularly anxious to go back and interrupt mr angus 's knitting then there come into the assembly one of the latest addition to the conservative rank william batter a convert and reform liberal he have be a active member of the liberal party for many year but at the last election he have be entirely convince of they unworthiness by the close-fisted and niggardly way in which they dispense the election money he hear the situation discuss in all its aspect milton kennedy with inflamed oratory bitterly bewail he brother 's defection -- not only wrong himself but leadin ' other and they innocent lamb -- but he do not offer to go out and see he brother the lady who sit knit on the cellar door seem to be the difficulty with all of they the reform liberal have a plan i will go for he say he angus will trust I -- he do not know i have turn i 'll go for john thoma and angus will give he to I without a word thinkin ' i be a friend he conclude brazenly look at that now exclaim the member elect say boy you would know he have be a grit -- no honest open-faced conservative would ever think of a trick like that there be nothing like experience to make a man able to see every side say the reform one with become modesty a hour later angus be rouse from he bed by a loud knock on the door angus have go to bed with he clothes on know that these be troublesome time what be the row he ask when he have cautiously open the door row exclaim the friend who be no longer a friend you be the man that be makin ' the row the conservative have ` phone in to the attorney-general 's department to-night to see what be to be do with you for standin ' between a man and he heaven-born birthright keepin ' and confinin ' of a man in a cellar own by and close by you this have something the air of a summons and angus be duly impressed i do not want to see you get into trouble angus mr batter go on and the only way to keep out of it be to give he to I and then when they come out here with a search-warrant they will not find nothin ' angus thank he warmly and go upstairs rouse the innocent john from he virtuous slumber he have some trouble persuade john who be a profound sleeper that he must arise and go hence but many thing be strange to he and he rise and dress without very much protest angus be distinctly relieve when he get john thoma off he hand -- he feel he have have a merciful deliverance on the way to town rouse by the night air john thomas become communicative they lad in the automobile they want I pretty bad you bet he chuckle with the conscious pride of the much-sought-after but gosh angus fix they he just slam down the cellar door on I and say he ` not a word out of you jack you have as good a right to vote the way you want to as anybody and you 'll get it too you bet ' the reform liberal knit he brow what be this simple child of nature drive at john thomas ramble on : tom brown can not fool people with brain you bet you -- angus 's woman explain it all to I she say to I ` do not let

do not let on to milt or any of he folk or grandpa but vote the way you want to and that be for hasting ' when they arrive in town the reform liberal take john thoma at once to the conservative hotel

hasting i can not put a dint in he -- he think i be a grit too he be only get one idea but it be a solid one and that be ` vote for hasting ' the secretary yawn sleepily i 'll not go near he it be I for sleep you can go and see if any of the other fellow want a job they be all down at a ball at the station get one of those wakeful spirit to reason with john the conspirator make he way stealthily to the station from whence there issue the sound of music and dancing not wish to alarm the grits many of whom be join in the festivity and who would have be quick to suspect that something be on foot if they see he prowl around he creep up to the window and wait until one of the faithful come near gently tap on the glass he get the attention of the editor the very man he want and in pantomime give he to understand that he presence be request the editor plead a terrific headache say good-night or rather good-morning to he hostess and withdraw from he fellow-worker who wait in the shadow of the tree outside he learn that john thoma have be secure in the body but not in spirit the newspaper man readily agree to labor with the err brother and hope to be able to deliver he soul alive once again be john thomas rouse from he slumber and not by a familiar voice this time but by a unknown vision in evening dress the editor be a convincing man in he way whether upon the subject of reciprocity or apostolic succession but john be plainly bore from the beginning and though he offer no resistance he repeated i know that that be what i say be more disconcerting than the most vigorous opposition at daylight the editor leave john and he really have the headache that he have feign a few hour before then john thomas try to get a few wink of unmolested repose but it be election day and the house be early astir loud voice sound through the hall innumerable people it seem mistake he room for they own jack rise at last thoroughly indignant and disposed to quarrel he have a blame good notion to vote for brown after all after the way he have be treat when he have hastily dress himself discuss he grievance in a loud voice he endeavor to leave the room but find the door securely lock then he anger

and come downstairs to peel the potato she mention casually to the bartender that whoever he have in number 17 be smashin ' thing up pretty lively the bartender go up and liberate the indignant voter who by this time have he mind make up to vote against both brown and hasting and furthermore to renounce politics in all its aspect for evermore however a good breakfast and the sincere apology of the hotel people do much to restore he good humor but a certain haziness grow in he mind as to who be who and at time the disquieting thought skid through he murky brain that he might be in the enemy 's camp for all he know angus and mr angus have say do what you think be right and vote for hasting and that be plain and simple and easily understand but now thing seem to be all mix up the committee be ill at ease about he the way he wag he head and declare he know what be what you bet be very disquieting and the horrible fear haunt they that they be perchance cherish a serpent in they bosom the
