's game and play of the chesse the first book print in england this be the general opinion of bibliographer before the investigation of mr blade dibdin although he seem to have have some doubt pronounce in favor of that view yet it be clearly erroneous the only material for judgment be those afford by the colophon and the prologue to the second edition with the silent but eloquent testimony of typography caxton end the first edition with the word : -- fynysshid the last day of marche the yer of we lord god a thousand four hondr and lxxiiii the word fynysshid as mr blade observe have doubtless the same signification here as in the epilogue to the second book of caxton 's translation of the history of troy ` begonne in brugis contynued in gaunt and finyssh in coleyn ' which evidently refer to the translation only the date 1475-6 have be affix because in the low country at that time the year commence on easter-day this in 1474 fall on April 10th thus give as the day of the conclusion of the translation 31 march 1475 the same year be the earliest possible period of its appearance as a print book then there be caxton 's own racy account of the circumstance under which the book first appear : -- and emong alle other good werky it be a werke of ryght special recomendacion to enforme and to late vnderstonde wysedom and vertue vnto they that be not lernyd ne can not dyscerne wysedom fro folye th -lrb- = e -rrb- ne emonge whom there be a excellent doctor of dyuynyte in the royame of fraunce of the ordre of thospytal of saynt john of jherusalem which entend the same and have make a book of the chesse moralysed whiche at suche tyme as i be resident in brudgy in the counte of flaundre cam into my hande \/ whiche whan i have redde and ouerseen \/ I seme ful

cause thy sayd book be ful of holsom wysedom and requysyte vnto euery astate and degree \/ j haue purpose to enprynte it \/ shewyng therin the figure of suche person as longen to the playe it be clear from this that both the translation and printing belong to the period of caxton 's residence in bruge from the use of the instrumental form dyde doo sette en enprynte it might be think that caxton employ the service of some printer but although commonly so employ there be instance which will not bear this interpretation of its intention -lrb- 5 -rrb- he either employ a printer or make some partnerfhip with one and there be various indication that confirm mr blade ' theory that the book come from the press of colard mansion the second edition be undoubtedly the work of we first english printer explicit per caxton be the unambiguous statement of the colophon it be a much more advanced specimen of typography than the first edition it have signature of which _ a b c d e f g h i _ be quaternion _ k _ and _ l _ be terternion make in all eighty-four leaf of which the first be blank there be no title-page and the type use be that which mr blade reckon as no 2 \* the line be space out to a even length there be twenty-nine line to a full page and the full line measure 4-7\/8 inch the prologue begin on _ a ij _ and the table of chapter begin on the next page the text begin on the recto of _ a iii _ the text end on the recto of _ l _ 6 the last page be blank there be sixteen woodcut in the volume which be use twenty-four time there have be some diversity of opinion as to the year in which this game of the chesse come from the press of caxton the book be not date dibdin think it one of the printer 's earliest effort figgin regard it as the earliest issue of the westminster press and further believe that it be print from cut metal type this be not the view of mr blade who say : a examination of the work however with a typographical eye do not afford a single evidence of very early workmanship all caxton 's early book be uneven in the length of they line -- this be quite even not one of the early work have any signature -- this be sign throughout these two feature alone be quite sufficient to fix its date of impression at least as late as 1480 when caxton first begin the use of signature but when we find that every know copy of this edition of the ` chess-book ' present a thicker and more worn appearance than any one copy of any other book there be good reason for suppose that this may have follow the ` tullus ' of 1481 and have be the last book for which type no 2 \* be use -lrb- 6 -rrb- mr blade describe nine known copy so that even fewer exemplar remain of the second edition than of its predecessor the copy in the king 's library in the british museum be imperfect want several leaf and be mend in many place the copy in the pepysian collection at cambridge want one-half of the last leaf trinity college cambridge have a perfect copy but a bad impression the bodleian copy be defective in not have the last leaf st john 's college oxford have a copy from which one-half of _ d iii _ have be tear away the imperial library at vienna have a imperfect copy the duke of devonshire 's copy be perfect but it be a poor impression and slightly stain the earl of pembroke 's copy be very imperfect earl spencer 's be only slightly imperfect the price fetch by the second edition have a sufficiently wide range in 1698 at dr bernard 's sale a copy fold for 1 6d farmer 's copy in 1798 fetch # 4 4 ratcliffe 's copy be buy at he sale for # 16 by willett and when he book come to the hammer in 1813 it be purchase by the duke of devonshire for # 173 5 -lrb- 7 -rrb- it be interesting to know that the copy of the second edition in the bibliotheca spenceriana formerly belong to laurence sterne who buy it for a few shilling at york -lrb- 8 -rrb- in the present reprint the text follow be that of the first edition transcribe from the copy in the british museum but the variation alteration and addition make in the second issue be all record in footnote the reader have therefore before he the work in all its fulness the same reason that have lead to the adoption of this course have also decide the publisher to include facsimile of the curious woodcut which appear in the second edition these although necessarily reduction in size reproduce the quaint vigor of the original caxton we have see translate the game of the chesse from the french there be in effect two if not three from which he may have take he version one of these be by jean faron perron or feron -lrb- as the name be variously spell -rrb- a monk of the order of st dominic of whom the notice be exceedingly scanty -lrb- 9 -rrb- la croix du maine style he de l'ordre des frères prescheurs ou jacobin du paris la monnaye say that the translation be make from the latin of cessole and be begin in the year 1347 it have not be print -lrb- 10 -rrb- the translation be consider a literal version of the latin of cessole the prologue of perron 's version be as follow : -- chy ensuit le geu des eschas moralisé ouquel a plusier exemple bien à noter a noblehomme bertrand de tarascon frere jehan perron de l'ordre des freres precheurs de paris son petil et humble chappelain soy tout le sainte escripture dit que dieux a fait a chascun commandement de pourchassier à tous nos prochain leur sauvement or est-il ainsi que nos prochain ne sont pa tout un ain sont de diverse condicion estas et manieres sy comme il appert car les uns sont noble les aultres non : les aultres sont de cler engin les aultre non : les aultres sont enclin a devocion les aultres non et pour ce affin que le commandement de dieu soit mis à execution bien convenablement il convient avoir plusier voye et baillier à chascun ce qui lui est plus convenable et ainsi pourroit il le commandement de dieu accomplir pour tant je vostre petit chappelain à vostre requeste que je tieng pour commendement vous be volu translata de latin en français le gieu des eschas moralisé que fist l'un de nos freres appelé frere jaques de cossoles maistre en divinité si que vous l'entendés plus legierrement et à exemple des nobles hystoires qui y sont notteés veuillés maintenir quant à vous honnestement et quant aux autres justement or prenés do ce petit present comencié le 4 ' e jour de may l'an 1347 -lrb- 11 -rrb- that caxton make use of perron 's version be clear thus mr blade mention the description of evilmerodach as un homme joly san justice as peculiar to ferron whose version he regard as the basis of the first and third chapter of caxton 's work dr van der linde mention a number of mss in some the date be give as 1357 and in one as 1317 this version remain unprinted but there be mss of it in the bibliotheque nationale at aosta cambraus at brussels in the british museum chartre at bern and at stockholm -lrb- 12 -rrb- dr van der linde also describe a m on parchment of the fifteenth century form part of the national library at pari which contain the game of chess in verse mès si d'esbat te prent tallant pren ton esbat déuement mès si à jouer vieulx attendre un noble jou te faulte attendre c'est des echecs qui est licite et à touz bien les gen incite the author have conceal he name with a ingenuity that have so far defy penetration nommez mon nom et mon surnom je ey escript tout environ a vingt et dous lettre san plus serum trouvé cy au dessus en enscript et sans plus ne moins on this it be only necesiary to quote the remark of a french critic : -- ou ne nous dit pas si c'est dans la suite même de la phrase ou seulement en acrosticke que se trouvent les vingt-deux lettres de ces nom mystérieux nous ne saurions former aucun nom avec les initiales des trente vers qui précèdent ceux que nous venons de citer et le merite de l'ouvrage ne nous encourage pas à faire des longue recherch pour découvrir un nom que l'auteur a pri plaisir à nous cacher -lrb- 13 -rrb- the bulk of caxton 's work be undoubtedly from the french translation of jehan de vignay whose dedication to prince john of france have simply be transform into a similar address to the duke of clarence he style de vignay a excellent doctor of the order of the hospital of st john 's of jerusalem this be the only authority we have for suppose de vignay to be connect with that order he style himself hospitaller de l'ordre de haut pa which be situate in the faubourg st jacque of pari it be curious that two member of the same order -- for ferron be also a jacobin -- should independently have occupy themselves with the same work the version by de vignay be probably the later of the two and it be also the most popular for whilst ferron 's be still unprinted that of de vignay have be frequently re-issue from the press the work be dedicate to jean de france duc de normandie who become king in 1350 it will be see from this that these two french version be practically contemporaneous the prologue to the book be as follow : -- a tre noble & excellent prince jehan de france duc de normendie & auisne filz de philipe par le grace de dieu roy de france frere jehan de vignay vostre petit religieux entre les autres de vostre seignorie \/ paix sante joie & victoire sur vos ennemis treschier & redoubte seign ` r \/ pour ce que jay entendu et scay que vous veez & ouez volentier chose

ouure \/ jay ordene que les chappitres du liure soient escrip & mis au commencement afin de veoir plus plainement la matiere de quoy le dit liure pole -lrb- 14 -rrb- it will be see that this be the foundation of caxton 's dedication of the chess-book to the earl of warwick the golden legend print by caxton in 1484 be in effect a translation from la legende dorée make before the year 1380 by jehan de vignay who in he prologue mention that he have previously translate into french le miroir des hystoire du monde at the request of ma dame jehanne de borgoigne royne de france -lrb- 15 -rrb- this preface caxton as usual adopt with some change of name and other alteration amongst which be a reference to the book of the chesse as one of he work the legenda aurea of jacobus de voragine be of course the original source of de vignay 's legende dorée and caxton 's golden legend ferron and de vignay be avowedly translator they original be jacques de cessole the name of this author have be tortured into so many fantastic form that one may almost despair of recover the original cæsolis cassali castuli casuli cesoli cessole cessuli cesuli cezolus de cezolis de cossoles de courcelles sesselis tessalis tessellis de thessolus de thessolonia and de thessolonica be different manners of spell he surname and the two last be certainly masterpiece of transformation prosper marchand have amuse himself by collect some vain speculation of previous writer as to the age country and personality of jacque de cessole some count he a lombard some a italian whilst other again boldly assert that he be a greek he live towards the end of the thirteenth or beginning of the fourteenth century and have join the dominican order be a maître en théologie of that brotherhood at reim various work be attribute to he and he learning and piety have many eulogist it be more than probable that he name would have be much less widely known but for the happy accident that turn he attention to the game of chess it be a popular diversion and in the moralize spirit of the age he see in it a allegory of the various component of the commonwealth the man who be merely kill time be perhaps flatter at the thought that they be at the same time learn the mode of statecraft then as now the teacher of morality feel that a song might reach he who a sermon fly and they do not scruple to use in the pulpit whatever aid come handy the popular story wise saw and modern instance be common enough on the lip of the preacher and such collection as the gesta romanorum show what a pitch of ingenuity in unnatural interpretation they have reach a appropriate instance be furnish by it in the follow quaint fashion of moralize the chess play : -- antonius be a wys emp_er_our regnyng in the cite of rome

c it be not therefore surprising to learn that jacque de cessole find text for sundry sermon on the game that form so favorite a diversion of clergy and laity the favor with which these discourse be receive no doubt gratify the worthy dominican father at the request of some of those who hear they he begin to write down the substance of he sermon the result be the liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium ac popularium super ludo scachorum which immediately attain great popularity this be show by the bibliography of dr a van der linde in a striking manner for he have describe two hundred codex to be find in the various public library of europe -lrb- 16 -rrb- the difficulty in the way of form any clear conception as to the life and personality of cessole ferron and de vignay be well show in a article by mc leber -lrb- 17 -rrb- dr ernst köpke who have reexamine the evidence as to cessole hold that he be a lombard -lrb- 18 -rrb- the chief source from which cessole take he material be the treatise de regimine principum of egidius romanus he be of the great neapolitan family of the colonna and he christian name appear to have be guido but he designation have undergo some curious transformation bear at rome 22nd sept 1216 guido colonna go at a early age to pari where from the name of he birthplace he become know as ægidius romanus with the french form of gille de rome he be a ardent and enthusiastic disciple of st thoma aquina and he familiarity with that great doctor of the church lead he to desire admission to the dominican order but a difficulty intervene from the circumstance that he have already contract tie which bind he to the order of st augustine to this untoward accident may probably be attribute no little of the extension of the philosophical doctrine of aquina for colonna unable or unwilling to be relieve of the vow that bind he to the augustinian preach eagerly amongst they the thomist speculation of he friend and master in the controversy with the franciscan those whom he have indoctrinate be valuable ally to the thomist for they aid come from a independent organization appear to carry the weight of impartiality and to be unassailable on the plea of partisan interest in the year 1287 there be a general convocation of the order of st augustine at florence and at this assembly it be decree that the doctor of the order should teach in conformity with the decision arrive at by colonna to he be largely due the success of the thomist scheme of which he be a able persistent and vigorous exponent many tract by he remain in print and m on these subject the fame he have thus acquire gain he the name of _ doctor fundamentarius _ and _ doctor fundatissimus _ he lecture at paris attract to he the attention of philippe le hardi who think he a fitting person to be entrust with the education of he son who be afterwards know to hiftory as philippe le bel it be whilst occupy with this royal youth that the thought of composing or compile -- and the term be in practice interchangeable in those day -- occur and the result be the treatise de regimine principum librus iii philippe le hardi if not a educate man himself -- and there be doubt as to whether he could write he own name -- be laudably anxious that he heir should have the best instruction that could be obtain it can not well be claim that the able handsome and unscrupulous philippe be any great credit to he preceptor the despotic and perfidious character of the king probably owe more to the influence of nogaret and other defender of the right divine of king to govern wrong than to the soberer precept of colonna that philippe have some tincture of literary feeling may be infer from he employment of jehan de meung to translate the military treatise of vegetius flavius renatus a compilation of the second century of the present era which be so popular in the middle age that it be translate by caxton into english still better evidence be the translation make for the king by the same poet of boethius whose stoical philosophy must have have a special appropriateness for those time of political storm and stress when the fickleness of fortune must have be a matter of only too common repute guido colonna be elect by he admire brethren the general of the order in 1292 and take up he residence at bourge its metropolitan seat in this honorable office he continue he literary labor and to this period be assign the greater part of he numerous work he die at avignon in 1316 he body be translate to pari where he effigy in black marble with he epitaph remain until the french revolution -lrb- 19 -rrb- it would be superfluous to enumerate he philosophical writings for they would have no interest in the present day he commentary on aristotle de anima it may be observe be dedicate to edward i he name be now chiefly remember because he work on the rule of prince form the basis of the treatise in which jacques de cessole moralize the fashionable game of the chess one interesting instance of the popularity of colonna 's work be the translation of it make into english verse by thoma occleve -lrb- 20 -rrb- he write it in 1411 or 1412 and its object be to obtain the payment of a annuity from the exchequer which have be grant to he but the payment of which be very irregular the book be dedicate to the prince of wale after mention he purpose to translate from the -lrb- apocryphal -rrb- letter of aristotle to alexander and gyle of regement of prynce he proceed : -- there be a booke jacob de cessole of the ordre of prechor make a worthy man that the chesse moralisede clepede be in whiche i purpose eke to labor ywi and here and there as that my litelle witte afforthe may i thynke translate it and al be it that in that place

of speculation and conceive amid the pedantry of a cloister it be probably recommend to occleve 's notice by have be translate into english by john trevisa a celebrated translator about the year 1390 -lrb- 21 -rrb- have thus trace the stream back to its fountain we return to caxton the story of he life have be tell by mr blade and only the most essential fact of he busy and useful career need be recapitulate here he be bear in the weald of kent and it have be conjecture that the manor of causton near hadlow be the original home of the family he be apprentice to alderman robert large a mercer who be afterwards lord mayor the entry in the book of the mercer ' company lead to the inference that caxton be bear about 1422 probably on the death of large in 1441 caxton go abroad for he tell we that in 1471 he have be resident outside england for thirty year about 1462 or 1463 he be governor of the english nation or merchant adventurer at bruge this be a position of great influence and it be think to have enable the loyal mercer to give good service to edward iv who be a exile in 1470 caxton 's marriage be not much later than 1469 and it be conjecture that this lead he to enter the service of the duchess of burgundy she have literary taste and at she request he translate the recuyell des histoires de troye of raoul le fevre it be the demand for copy of this that exhaust caxton 's calligraphic patience and lead to he employment of a printer the incident may have be casual but it lead to great result it have be say that he learn the printer ' art at cologne but mr blade suppose that he enter its mystery at bruge under colard mansion with whom he appear to have have some partnership probably towards the end of 1476 caxton return to england he have the favor of edward iv and of he sister duchess of burgundy and the friendship of the king 's brother-in-law earl river ninety-nine distinct production issue from caxton 's press he be printer publisher translator and something of author as well he set in good earnest about the work that be still go on -- of make the best accessible literature widely and commonly know this useful career be only end by he death the exact date be not know but it be probably late in 1491 he leave a married daughter caxton be a good business man he be also a sincere lover of literature and he be at he favorite work of translation only a few hour before the final summons come the quality of caxton as a translator be not a matter of much doubt it may be that the archaic form give a additional flavor to he style since they present few difficulty to the modern reader and yet sound like echo from the earlier period of the language generally he be content to follow he author with almost plod fidelity but occasionally he make addition which be eminently characteristic he author have remark : -- il nest a jour duy nulle choose quus tant grieue rome ne ytalie com ~ e fait le college des notaires publique car ilz ne sont mie en accort ensemble -- caxton improve the passage thus : -- for ther be no thynge at this day that so moche greueth rome and italye as doth the college of notary and aduocate publicque for they ben

and play of the chess be a interesting specimen of mediæval english literature it be so near we own time that the language prefent few difficulty in spite of its many gallicism and yet it be so remote as to seem like the echo of a unknown world the distinctly dogmatic portion of the book be but few and they paucity be indeed a matter of some surprise since it be in effect a detailed treatise on practical ethic and be in part if not wholly systematize from the discourse of one distinguished preacher who have borrow much of he matter from another eminent ecclesiastic the author aim not at the enforcement of doctrine but at the guidance of life though he no doubt assume that he hearer be all faithful and orthodox son of the church -lrb- 22 -rrb- the ideal of the commonwealth of the middle age find a interesting expression the sharp line of demarcation between class and class be state with the frankness that come of a belief that the then exist social fabric be the only one possible in the best of world there be no doubt in the author 's mind as to the rightful position of king and baron of bishp and merchant the rights of man have not be invent apparently and the maxim that the king reign but do not govern would have perplex the soul of cessole and he translator they have no more doubt as to the divine right of the monarch than the thibetan have of the divine right of the grand lama the buddhist think he have secure the continuous re-appearance of supernatural wisdom in human form and the regular transmission of political ability in the same family be the ideal for which the devotee of mediæval despotism have to hope nothing could be further from the aspiration of we author than a race of mere palace king seek enjoyment only in self-indulgence the king be to be the ruler and leader of he people the relation and interdependence of the several class be emphatically proclaimed and the claim of duty be urge upon each the book enable we to gauge the literary culture of the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth century poor as it may now seem it belong in those day to the literature of power and have great influence the form be one which lend itself readily to poetic and historic illustration and indeed demand such treatment the author and translator be chiefly learn and distinguifh ecclesiastic caxton the representative of the new time when literature be to be the common heritage be fill to overflow with the best literature then accessible a writer of the present century probably borrow he sentiment have define originality to be undetected imitation such refinement be unknown to cessole and he contemporary a writer take whatever suit he purpose from any and every source that be open to he a quotation be always as good as a original sentiment and sometimes much better why should a man take the trouble of laboriously invent fresh phrase about usury or uncleanness when there be the very word of st augustine or st basil ready to hand why seek modern instance when the great storehouse of anecdote of valerius maximus be ready to be rifle very frequently the author be give mostly it may be imagine from a sense of the value of the authority of the name thus cite whatever the intention of the writer the effect be to show we what be the author know study and quote in the middle age the author name be : -- saint ambrose -lrb-

maximus who have point many of the moral enforce in this book it may perhaps be doubt if the writer have more to work from than valerius seneca and st augustine with occasional quotation such as memory would supply from other source the verification of all these quotation would not repay the labor it would involve but in most case where the experiment have be try the result have be fairly creditable to the old author the biblical allusion may be take as typical there be reference to the bible holy scripture ecclesiaste and canticle there also occur the name of adam eve abel cain noah ham lot david abner joab abishaus solomon isaiah evilmerodach belshazzar darius cyrus tobia john the baptist and paul the citation be not all literally exact solomon have not a very good opinion of he

be compare with the translation in the wicliffite verfion make by nicholas de hereford a d 1380 this passage be render : he left hond be vndur myn heed and he ri3t hond shal biclippe I -lrb- song of

: all scripture be give by inspiration of god and be profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness -lrb- 2 tim iii 16 -rrb- in the reference to the athenian -lrb- p 16 -rrb- we seem to hear a echo of the word : for all the athenian and stranger that be there spend they time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing -lrb- act xvii 21 -rrb- the most curious reference to a biblical personage be that relate to evilmerodach -lrb- p 10 -rrb- cessole seem to have be the first to associate the name of the son of nebuchadnezzar with the invention of the game of chess the biblical reference to evilmerodach be few they throw no light on the reason of he selection by the mediæval scribe for a bad pre-eminence of parricide the epithet of _ jolus _ apply to the king have a odd effect follow as it be by the narrative of he most unfilial conduct dr van der linde show how widely the legend spread lydgate evidently hesitate between the divide authority of guido -- that be colonna the author of the troy book -- and cessole whom he quote through jacobus de vitriaco -lrb- 23 -rrb- amongst the author not identify be crete -lrb- p 133 -rrb- and diomede -lrb- p 10 -rrb- the account of the origin of chess attribute to the last be amplify a little further on the legend that palamede invent a game of this kind at the siege of troy be emphatically reject by we author who pin he fame on xerx a greek philosopher this become the receive opinion as may be gather from the unhesitating language of polydore vergil in a passage which be thus render by john langley : -- the chesse be invent the year of the world 3635 by a certain wise man call xerx to declare to a tyrant that majesty or authority without strength assistance & help of he subject be casual feeble & subject to many calamity of fortune he intent be to break the fierce cruelty of he heart by fear of such danger as might come to passe in the life of man -lrb- 24 -rrb- the curious treatise which contain the suppose conversation of king bocchus and the philosopher sidrac -lrb- p 171 -rrb- be a favorite science book of the middle age it be probably of oriental origin but there be edition in latin french german flemish dutch italian and english by way of question and answer very decide statement be make on a wide variety of topic of which the author be profoundly

-rrb- the reference to the first book of the truphe of the philosopher by figure do not convey a very definite idea as to the particular work intend it must have be somewhat miscellaneous in character for one extract describe the fountain of the syren -lrb- p 122 -rrb- and the other be a anecdote which though tell here of julius cæsar -lrb- p 71 -rrb- be really the story of the soldier who have

be very slight on a longtemps ignoré le nom de l'auteur de cette compilation mai un passage du 68 ^ e dialogue du livre intitulé ` dialogus creaturarum ' nous le révele par ce mots : _ elimandus in

have be catalogue as a version of the gesta the reference cite by brunet be to the chronique of helinand -lrb- 29 -rrb- many of the story and anecdote be the commonplace of ancient history such as the friendship of damon and pythia the sword of damocle the chastity of scipio the magnanimity of alexander the fable of the dog and the shadow & c other current in the middle age have great popularity and even in we own day occasionally renew they youth the story of john of ganazath -lrb- p 48 -rrb- be to be find in occleve 's translation of colonna mr thoma wright remark : this story under

following form in the popular collection know as the percy anecdote : -lrb- 32 -rrb- -- a eminent trader at lyon who have acquire a easy fortune have two handsome daughter between whom on they marriage he divide all he property on condition that he should pass the summer with one and the winter with the other before the end of the first year he find sufficient grounds to conclude that he be

property during life among they child -- a practice to which they be in general little addict -lrb- 33 -rrb- there be yet another verfion of the story in john of bromyard 's summa predicantium after describe the discovery of the club it say in quo anglice scriptum erat -- wyht fuyle a betel be he smetyn that al the werld hyt mote wyten that gyfht he sone al he thing and goht hym self a beggyn mr

-rrb- be in the gesta romanorum the anecdote how a son induce he father to become a monk -lrb- p 81 -rrb- which be quote from the vita patrum be also in the gesta romanorum and have so much of the buddhist flavor as to give rise to the suspicion that it come from a oriental source -lrb- 35 -rrb- the story of two merchant quote from petrus alphonsus be also in the gesta romanorum it be the foundation of lydgate 's two friend and be beyond doubt a eastern importation in a m of the speculum laicorum describe by prof ingram the writer have transform one of the merchant into a englishman -lrb- 36 -rrb- the story quote from paul the historiagraph of the lombard -lrb- p 46 -rrb- be also give in the gesta romanorum mr herrtage say it be evidently found on the classical legend of tarpeium the narrative in the chess-book be take from paulus diaconus -lrb- 37 -rrb- the stratagem by which deposit money be recover from a dishonest trustee -lrb- p 114 -rrb- be tell by petrus alphonsus and be also in the gesta romanorum the story of the danger of drunkenness -lrb- p 129 -rrb- be a favorite with we forefather it be give by john of bromyard and be the subject of a fabliau which be give by meon -lrb- 38 -rrb- the somewhat violent remedy record as have be adopt by demosthene -lrb- p 103 -rrb- will remind some reader of a passage in the life of st franci of assisus he have give up say mr oliphant without hesitation as would appear all the indefinite sweetness of youthful hope but nevertheless he be still young still a man with human instinct and wish the tenderest nature and a imagination full of all the warmth and grace of he age and he country it do not appear that he ever put into word the musing which catch he unaware -- the relic of old dream or soft recollection which now and then would steal into he heart but one night suddenly he rise from the earthen floor which be he bed and rush out into the night in a access of rage and passion and despair a certain brother who be pray in he cell peer wonder through he little window see he heap together seven mass of snow in the clear moonlight ` here be thy wife ' he say to himself ` these four be thy son and daughter the other two be thy servant and thy handmaid and for all these thou art bind to provide make haste then and provide clothing for they lest they perish with cold but if the care of so many trouble thee be thou careful to serve we lord alone ' bonaventura who tell the story go on with the true spirit of a monkish historian to state how ` the tempter be vanquish depart and the holy man return victorious to he cell ' the piteous human yearning that be underneath this wild tale the sudden access of self-pity and anger mixed with a strange attempt not less piteous than the longing at self-consolation -- all the struggle and conflict of emotion which still themselves at least for a moment by that sudden plunge into the snow and wild violent bodily exertion be either lose upon the teller of the tale or perhaps he fear to do he master injustice by reveal any consciousness of the possibility of such thought but it be a very remarkable peculiarity of franci 's history that whereas every saint in the calendar from antony downward be sometimes trouble with vision of voluptuous delight only franci in he pure dream be tempt by the modest joy of wife and child -- the most legitimate and tenderest love -lrb- 39 -rrb- the reader must not expect any historical exactitude or critical spirit from we author for he purpose a narrative be just as useful whether true or false but it probably never occur to he to question the exact truth of any statement that he find write in a book the murder of seneca -lrb- p 9 -rrb- be certainly not the least of the many crime which stain the memory of nero but the circumstance of he death be not exactly describe by the mediæval scribe whether the philosopher and former tutor be implicate in the conspiracy of piso may be doubt but some ambiguous phrase he have use be report to the emþeror whose messenger demand a explanation of they mean the reply of seneca be either unsatisfactory or the tyrant have decide to be rid of he former guide as in more recent time in japan the condemn man be expect to be he own executioner and seneca open he vein and allow the life to ooze from they with a stoicism that be certainly heroic if not untainted by theatrical display the character of seneca will ever remain one of the puzzle of history for the grave moralist be accessory to the murder of agrippina and not unsuspected of licentiousness and of the accumulation of a enormous fortune of three hundred million sestertius by injustice and fraud the statement of dion cassius as to the misdeed of the philosopher must be weigh against the absence of any condemnation of he proceedings in the page of tacitus the theodore cerem name on p 12 be theodorus cyrenaicus who be probably a native of cyrene and a disciple of aristippus he be banish from the -lrb- suppose -rrb- place of he birth and be shield at athen by demetrius phalerus whose exile he be assume to have share whilst in the service of egypt he be send as a ambassador to lysimachus whom he offend by the directness and plainness of he speech the offended monarch threaten he with crucifixion and he reply in a phrase which become famous threaten thus you courtier for it matter not to I whether i rot on the ground or in the air -lrb- 40 -rrb- the king 's threat be not execute as theodorus be afterwards at corinth and be believe to have die at cyrene that he be condemn to drink hemlock be a statement cite from amphicrate by diogene lærtius -lrb- _ aristippus _ xv -rrb- the anecdote of he colloquy with lysimachus would easily be pervert into a belief that he have be put to death for the freedom with which he exercise he bite wit the democreon mention at pp 12 and 16 be democritus of abdera of whom the anecdote be tell he be a man whose knowledge and wisdom win even the respect of timon the universal scoffer the tradition that he deprive himself of sight with a view to philosophic abstraction be mention by cicero aulus gellius and other but it be hardly necessary to account for a too uncommon calamity by a supposition so remarkable the transformation of some of the name be peculiar at p 12 we read of deforte the philosopher disguise under this strange name appear to be socrate the story be tell in the apology of socrate attribute to xenophon the person to whom the say be address be not xanthippe but be a disciple name apollodorus whose understanding be not equal to he admiration the statement that didymus voluntarily blind himself be make both by jerome -lrb- _ ep _ 68 -rrb- and in the ecclesiastical history of socrate -lrb- iv 29 -rrb- didymus be bear 309 or 314 and become blind at the age of four as the result of disease he learn the alphabet by wooden letter and by application and force of character become learn in all the learning of he time be this a real anticipation of the use of raise letter for the blind what would be the use of a knowledge of the alphabet so acquire in obtain that skill in geometry rhetoric arithmetic and music for which he be famous he owe to athanasius he position as head of the catechetical school of alexandrium the reader of cymbeline will remember the passage in the conclude scene : -- the piece of tender air thy virtuous daughter which we call _ mollis ær _ and _ molli ær _ we term it _ mulier _ which mulier i divine be this most constant wife : who even now answer the letter of the oracle unknown to you unsought be clipp would about with this most tender air this quaint piece of etymology will be find at p 123 of the present volume there be a interesting personal reference in the following passage which have not it be believe be point out : -- and also hit be to be supposyd that suche as haue theyr goode comune & not propre be most acceptable to god \/ for elly wold not thise religious man as monke freri chanon obseruante & all other auowe hem & kepe the wilfull pouerte that they ben professid too \/ for in trouth i haue my self ben conuersant in

church wold neuer suffre hit in religion this description by the busy merchant of the best life might serve to point anew the distinction between the real and the ideal and perhaps not to the advantage of the latter nothing have yet be say as to the place of this book in the history of chess and indeed it must be confess that it have very little practical bearing on the game the learn dream by which the chess of to-day be connect with the _ latrunculus _ and with the amusement say to have be invent by palamede have be dissipate by the cool air of modern criticism the student of the history of chess may now follow its fortune under the safe guidance of dr van der linde who reject unhesitatingly the claim make for it and admit even by forbe of a antiquity of 5000 year -lrb- 41 -rrb- the game of chess which whilst remain a amusement have acquire the dignity of a science be one that europe owe to india where it be probably invent not earlier than five century before christ the triumphant progress of islam aid in the extension of this oriental pastime it be know at the court of nicephorus at conftantinople and he contemporary haroun-al-rashid at bagdad one would like to add that charlemagne also be acquaint with it but there be no good evidence for that legend it be know in spain in the tenth century since the library of the learn caliph hakam ii of cordova contain some arabic mss on the game by the middle of the eleventh century it be common in the western world in 1061 a florentine bishop be say to have be order by cardinal damianus to expiate the offence of play chess in public by three recitation of the psalter by wash the foot of twelve poor person and by give they liberal alms the gradual development of the game in europe be illustrate in detail by dr van der linde chess in its prefent form be comparatively modern and refult from the enlargement of the power of the queen -lrb- originally the vizier or minister -rrb- and of the bishop -lrb- formerly the alfil or elephant -rrb- the greater power of these piece come into play between 1450 and 1500 but the period of transition be prolong to a much later date in some cafe and the portuguese damiano may be regard as the founder of the modern school the player of to-day on consult the elementary direction give in this book -lrb- p 159 _ et seq _ -rrb- will see how greatly the present play exceed in complexity and scientific interest the move that excite the enthusiasm of jacobus de cessole and lead he to the composition of the book of the chess which have have such long and widespread popularity incidentally he book be a monument in the history of chess but it be never intend to make its primary object that of teach the game the author 's aim be almost exclusively ethical it be to win man to a sober life and to the due performance of individual and social duty that the preacher exhaust he store of learning and invoke alike the reproof of the father of the church the history and legend of chronicler pagan and christian and the word of prophet and poet as a memorial of the literature and learning of the middle age it must always possess a permanent value from it we may learn and always with interest what be the literary taste and social ideal of the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth century there be doubtless ample room for dissatisfaction with that ideal but it be not without some bright aspect possibly there be modern realm that be not any happier now than they would be if govern in strict accordance with the rule lay down by the earnest author of the game and

philosopher \/ he meruaylle gretly of the beaulte and nouelte of the playe \/ and desire to playe agaynst y' e philosopher \/ the philosopher answerd and sayd to hym that hit myght not be doon but yf he first lern the playe \/ the kynge say hit be reson and that he wold put he to the payne to lerne hit than the philosopher begin to teche hym and to shewe hym the maner of the table of the chesse borde and the chesse meyne \/ and also the maner and condicion of a kynge of the noble and of the comun peple and of theyr office and how they shold be touchid and drawen and how he shold amende hymself & become vertuous and whan this kynge herde that he repreuyd hym \/ he demand hym upon payne of deth to tell hym wherfore he have founden and make this playe \/ and he answerd my ryght dere lord and kynge \/ the grettest and most thinge that i desire be that thou haue in thy self a gloryous and vertuous lyf and that may i not see \/ but yf thou be endoctrine and well manerd and that have \/ so mayst thou be belouyd of thy peple thus than i desire y' t thou haue other gouernement than thou hast have \/ and that thou haue upon thy self first seygnorye and maistrye suche as thou hast upon other by force and not by right certaynly hit be not ryght that a man be mayster ouer other and comandor \/ whan he can not rewle ner may rewle himself and that he vertue domyne aboue he vice \/ for seygnourye by force and wylle may not longe endure \/ than thus may thou see oon of the cause why and wherfore i haue founden and maad thy playe \/ whyche be for to correcte and repent the of thy tyrannye and vicyous lyuynge \/ for alle kynges specyally ought to here she corrygeor or corrector and she correction to hold and kepe in mynde \/ in lyke wyse as valerius reherceth that the kynge alixandre have a noble and renomed knyght that sayd in repreuynge of alixandre that he be to moche couetous and in especyall of the honor of the world \/ and sayd to hym yf the godde have maad thy body as greet as be thy herte alle the world coude not holde the \/ for thou holdest in thy right hand alle the oryent \/ and in thy lyfte hande the occident \/ syn than hit be so \/ or thou art a god

and than thou shalt doo noon euyll \/ yf thou be nought forgete thy self \/ ther be no thynge so stronge and ferme \/ but that somtyme a feble thinge casteth doun and ouerthrowe hit how well that the lyon be the strengest beste \/ yet somtyme a lityll birde eteth hym \/ the seconde cause wherfore this playe be founden and maad \/ be for to kepe hym from ydlenesse \/ whereof senecque saith unto lucylle ydlene wyth oute ony ocupacion be sepulture of a man lyuyng \/ and varro saith in he sentence that in lyke wise as man goo not for to goo \/ the same wyse the lyf be not gyuen for to lyue but for to doo well and good \/ and therfore secondly the philosopher fonde this playe for to kepe the peple from ydlene \/ for there be moche peple whan so be that they be fortunat in worldly goode that they drawe they to ease and ydlene wherof cometh ofte tyme many euylly and grete synne and by this ydlene the herte be quenchid wherof cometh desperacion \/ the thirde cause be that euery man naturelly desireth to knowe and to here noueltee and tydynge for this cause they of atthene studye as we rede \/ and for as the corporall or bodyly fight enpessheth and letteth otherwhyle the knowleche of subtyll thinge \/ therfore we rede that -lrb- 48 -rrb- democrion the phylosopher put oute he owen eyen \/ for as moche as he myght haue the better entendement and understondynge \/ many haue ben make blynde that be grete clerki in lyke wyse as be dydymus bisshop of alixandrye \/ that how well that he sawe not yet he be so grete a clerk \/ that gregore nazan & saynt ierome that be

gretly displesid that he be blynde and sawe not and he answerd that he be gretly abasshid for that he supposid not that he be not displesid in that he have lose he sight \/ and saynt anthonye answerd to hym i meruayle moche that hit displesith the that thou hast lose that thynge whiche be comyn betwene the and beste and thou knowest well that thou hast not loste that thynge that be comyn bitwene the and the angelli and for thise cause forsayd the philosopher entend to put away alle pensisnes and thoughtes \/ and to thinke only on this playe as shall be say & appere in this book after book ii -lrb- illustration -rrb- _ the seconde tractate \/ the first chapiter treteth of the forme of a kynge of he maner and of he estate _ the kynge must be thus maad for he must sitte in a chayer clothe in

what shall we doo to we enemye that hate we \/ certaynly this be thanswer of a noble & debonair prynce that suffr that villonye don to he doughter and to hymself yet more this prince have also a frende that be name arispe that sayd on a tyme as moche villonye unto the prynce as ony man miht saye and that might not suffise hym \/ but he scracchid hym in the visage \/ the prynce suffryd hym paciently in suche wyse as thowh he have doon to hym no vilonye but curtoysye and whan he sone wold haue auengid this vilonye \/ he comand they that they shold not be so hardy so to do the next day

he cam to hym and sayd ne doubte the nothynge and swear to hym by he fayth \/ that also well he be and shold be he frende fro than forthon as euery he have ben to fore yf he wold and thus he respite hym of he deth by he debonairte and in lyke wyse rede we of the kynge pirre to whom be report that they of tarente have say grete vilonye of hym for whiche cause he maad alle they to come to fore hym and demand of they yf they have so sayd than oon of they answerd and sayd \/ yf the wyn and the candelly have not fayllyd \/ thy langage have ben but a iape \/ in regarde of that we have think to haue doon \/ than the kynge begin to lawhe \/ for they have confessid that suche langage as be sayd and speak be by dronkenship \/ and for this cause of debonairte the peple of tarante toke for a custome that the dronken man shold be puuysshyd \/ and the sobre man preyfe the kynge than thus ought to loue humylyte and hate falsite after the holy scripture that speketh of euery man generally \/ for the kynge in he royame representeth god \/ and god be verite \/ and therfore hym ought to saye no thynge but yf hit be veritable and stable valerius reherceth that alixandre wyth alle he ooste rood for to
