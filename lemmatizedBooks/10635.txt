of the nobleman who go to meet the emperor frederick the third on he way to ferrara when duke borso of modena entertain he in that city two year afterwards borso who have be only marquis of ferrara receive its ducal title from the pope and on go to rome to be invest with he new honor the name of we poet be again find among the adorner of he state a few day after he return home this prince die and boiardo favor as he have be by he appear to have succeed to a double portion of regard in the friendship of the new duke ercole who be more of he own age during all this period from he youth to he prime we author vary he occupation with italian and latin poetry some of it address to a lady of the name of antonium caprara and some to another whose name be think to have be rosa but whether these lady die or he love be divert elsewhere he take to wife in the year 1472 taddea gonzaga of the noble house of that name daughter of the count of novellara in the course of the same year he be suppose to have begin he great poem a popular court-favourite in the prime of life marry and commence a great poem nearly at one and the same time present a image of prosperity singularly delightful by this lady boiardo have two son and four daughter the younger son francesco marium die in he childhood but the elder camillo succeed to he father 's title and leave a heir to it -- the last i believe of the name the reception give to the poet 's bride when he take she to scandiano be say to have be very splendid in the ensue year the duke he master take a wife himself she be eleonora daughter of the king of naple and the newly-married poet be among the nobleman who be send to escort she to ferrara for several year afterwards he time be probably fill up with the composition of the _ orlando innamorato _ and the entertainment give by a splendid court he be appoint governor of reggio probably in 1478 at the expiration of two or three year he be make captain of the citadel of modena and in 1482 a war break out with the venetian in which he take part for it interrupt the progress of he poem in 1484 he return to it but ten year afterwards be again and finally interrupt by the unprincipled descent of the french on italy under charle the eighth and in the December follow he die the _ orlando innamorato _ be thus leave unfinished eight year before he decease the author publish what he have write of it up to that time but the first complete edition be posthumous the poet be write when the french come : he break off with a anxious and bitter notice of the interruption though still unable to deny himself a last word on the episode which he be relate and a hope that he should conclude it another time mentre che io canto o dio redentore vedo l'italium tutta a fiamma e foco per questi gallus che con gran valore vengon per disertar non so che loco : però vi lascio in questo vano amore di fiordespina ardente poco a poco un ' altra volta se mi fia concesso racconterovvi il tutto per espresso but while i sing mine eye great god behold a flaming fire light all the italian sky bring by these french who with they myriad bold come to lay waste i know not where or why therefore at present i must leave untold how love mislead poor fiordespina 's eye -lrb- 2 -rrb- another time fate willing i shall tell from first to last how every thing befall besides the _ orlando innamorato _ boiardo write a variety of prose work a comedy in verse on the subject of timon lyric of great elegance with a vein of natural feeling run through they and latin poetry of a like sort not indeed as classical in its style as that of politian and the other subsequent reviver of the ancient manner but perhaps not the less interesting on that account for it be difficult to conceive a thorough copyist in style express he own thorough feeling mr panizzus if i be not mistaken promise the world a collection of the miscellaneous poem of boiardo but we have not yet have the pleasure of see they in he life of the poet however he have give several specimen both latin and italian which be extremely agreeable the latin poem consist of ten eclogue and a few epigram but the epigram this critic tell we be neither good nor on a fitting subject be satirical sally against nicolò of este who have attempt to seize on ferrara and be behead boiardo be not of a nature qualify to indulge in bitterness a man of he chivalrous disposition probably misgave himself while he be write these epigram perhaps he suffer they to escape he pen out of friendship for the reign branch of the family but it must be confess that some of the best-natured man have too often lose sight of they higher feeling during the pleasure and pride of composition with respect to the comedy of _ timon _ if the whole of it be write as well as the conclude address of the misanthrope -lrb- which mr panizzus have extract into he page -rrb- it must be very pleasant timon conceal a treasure in a tomb and think he have baffle some knave who have a design upon it he therefore take leave of he audience with the follow benediction pur ho scacciate queste due formiche che raspavano l' oro alla mia buca or vadan pur che dio le malediche cotal fortuna a casa li conduca che lor fiacchi le gambe al primo passo e nel secondo l'osso della nuca voi altri che ascoltate giuso al basso chiedete se volete alcuna cosa prima ch ' io parta perchè mo vi lasso benchè abbia l'alma irata e disdegnosa da ingiustus oltraggus combattuta e vinta a vous già non l'avrò tanto ritrosa in I non è pietade al tutto estinta faccia di voi la prova chus glus pare sino alla corda the mi trovo cinta gli presterò volendosi impiccare so i have get rid of these two creep thing that fain would have scratch up my bury gold they be go and may the curse of god go with they may they reach home dust in good time enough to break they leg at the first step in door and neck i ' the second -- and now then as to you good audience -- groundling -- folk who love low place you too perhaps would fain get something of I ere i take leave -- well -- angered though i be scornful and tear with rage at be ground into the dust with wrong i be not so lose to all concern and charity for other as not to be still kind enough to part with something near to me-something that be wound about my very self here sir mark this -- _ -lrb- untie the cord round he waist _ let any that would put I to the test take it with all my heart and hang themselves the comedy of _ timon _ which be chiefly take from lucian and one if not more of boiardo 's prose translation from other ancient be write at the request of duke ercole who be a great lover of dramatic version of this kind and build a theater for they exhibition at a enormous expense these prose translation consist of apuleius 's _ golden ass _ herodotus -lrb- the duke 's order -rrb- the _ golden ass _ of lucian xenophon 's _ cyropædia _ -lrb- not print -rrb- emilius probus -lrb- also not print and suppose to be cornelius nepo -rrb- and riccobaldo 's credulous _ historium universali _ with addition it seem not improbable that he also translate homer and diodorus and donus the bookmaker assert that he write a work call the _ testamento dell ' anima _ -lrb- the soul 's testament -rrb- but mr panizzus call donus a barefaced impostor and say that as the work be mention by nobody else we may be certain that it never exist and that the title be a forgery of the impudent priest nothing else of boiardo 's writing be know to exist but a collection of official letter in the archive of modena which accord to tiraboschus be of no great importance it be difficult to suppose however that they would not be worth look at the author of the _ orlando innamorato _ could hardly write even upon the driest matter of government with the aridity of a common clerk some little lurk well-head of character or circumstance interesting to reader of a later age would probably break through the barren ground perhaps the letter go counter to some of the good jesuit 's theology boiardo 's prose translation from the author of antiquity be so scarce that mr panizzus himself a learn and miscellaneous reader say he never see they i be willing to get the only advantage in my power over a italian critic by say that i have have some of they in my hand -- bring there by the pleasant chance of the bookstall but i can give no account of they a modern critic quote by this gentleman -lrb- gamba _ testus di lingua _ -rrb- call the version of apuleius rude and curious -lrb- 3 -rrb- but add that it contain expression full of liveliness and propriety by rude be probably mean obsolete and comparatively unlearned correctness of interpretation and classical nicety of style -lrb- as mr panizzus observe -rrb- be the growth of a later age nothing be tell we by he biographer of the person of boiardo : and it be not safe to determine a man 's _ physique _ from he writings unless perhaps with respect to the greater or less amount of he animal spirit for the able-bodied may write effeminately and the feeblest supply the defect of corporal stamen with spiritual portrait however seem to be extant mazzuchellus discover that a medal have be strike in the poet 's honor and in the castle of scandiano -lrb- though the hall where knight and lady listen to the adventure of the paladin be now turn into granary and orlando himself have nearly disappear from the outside where he be paint in huge dimension as if entrust with the wardenship -rrb- there be a likeness of boiardo execute by niccolo dell ' abate together with the principal event of the _ orlando innamorato _ and the _ æneid_but part of these painting -lrb- mr panizzus tell we -rrb- be destroy and part remove from the castle to modena to save they from certain loss and he do not add whether the portrait be among the latter from anecdote however and from the poet 's writings we gather the nature of the man and this appear to have be very amiable there be a aristocratic tone in he poem when speaking of the sort of people of whom the mass of soldier be wont to consist and foscolo say that the count of scandiano write like a feudal lord but common soldier be not apt to be the _ elite _ of mankind neither do we know with how goodnature a smile the mention of they may have be accompany people often give a tone to what they read more belong to they own mind than the author 's all the account leave we of boiardo hostile as well as friendly prove he to have be a indulgent and popular man accord to one he be fond of make personal inquiry among its inhabitant into the history of he native place and he requite they so generously for they information that it be customary with they to say when they wish good fortune to one another heaven send boiardo to you house there be say to have be a tradition at scandiano that have try in vain one day as he be ride out to discover a name for one of he hero expressive of he lofty character and the word _ rodamonte _ come into he head he gallop back with a pleasant ostentation to he castle cry it out aloud and order the bell of the place to be ring in its holior to the astonishment of the good people who take rodamonte for some newly-discovered saint he friend paganellus of modena who write a latin poem on the _ empire of cupid _ extol the governor of reggio for ranking among the deity 's most generous vassal -- one who in spite of he office of magistrate look with a indulgent eye on error to which himself be liable and who be accustom to prefer the study of love-verse to that of the law the learn lawyer he countryman pancirolus probably in resentment as panizzus say of this preference accuse he of a excess of benignity and of be fitter for write poem than punish ill deed and in truth as the same critic observe he must have be consider crazy by the whole tribe of lawyer of that age if it be true that he anticipate the opinion of beccarium in think that no crime ought to be punish with death the great work of this interesting and accomplished person the _ orlando innamorato _ be a epic romance found on the love of the great paladin for the peerless beauty angelica whose name have enamour the ear of posterity the poem introduce we to the pleasantest path in that track of reading in which milton have tell we that he young foot delighted to wander nor do he forsake it in he age such force meet not nor so wide a camp when agrican with all he northern power besiege albracca as romance tell the city of gallaphrone from whence to win the fairest of she sex angelica _ paradise regain _ the _ orlando innamorato _ may be divide into three principal portion : - the search for angelica by orlando and she other lover the siege of she father 's city albracca by the tartar and that of pari and charlemagne by the moor these however be all more or less intermingled and with the greatest art and there be numerous episode of a like intertexture the fairy and fairy-garden of british romance and the fabulous glory of the house of este now proclaim for the first time be add by the author to the enchantment of pulcus together with a pervade elegance and have the poem be complete we be to have hear again of the traitor gan of maganza for the purpose of exalt the imaginary founder of that house ruggero this resuscitation of the helen of antiquity under a more seduce form be a invention of boiardo 's so be the subjection of charle 's hero orlando to the passion of love so besides the heroine and she name be that of other interesting character with beautiful name which afterwards figure in ariosto this inventive faculty be indeed so conspicuous in every part of the work on small as well as great occasion in fairy-adventure and those of flesh and blood that although the author appear to have have both he love and he fairy suggest to he by we romance of arthur and the round table it constitute next to the pervade elegance above mention he chief claim to we admiration another of he merit be a certain tender gallantry or rather a honest admixture of animal passion with spiritual also the precursor of the like ingenuous emotion in ariosto and he furthermore set he follower the example not only of good breeding but of a constant heroical cheerfulness look with faith on nature pulcus have a constant cheerfulness but not with so much grace and dignity foscolo have remark that boiardo 's character even surpass those of ariosto in truth and variety and that he angelica more engage we feeling -lrb- 4 -rrb- to which i will venture to add that if he style be less strong and complete it never give we a sense of elaboration i should take boiardo to have be the healthier man though of a less determine will than ariosto and perhaps on the whole less robust you find in boiardo almost which ariosto perfect -- chivalry battle combat love and grace passion enchantment classical and romantic fable eulogy satire mirth pathos philosophy it be like the first sketch of a great picture not the worse in some respects for be a sketch free and light though not so grandly color it be the morning before the sun be up and when the dew be on the grass take the story which be translate in the present volume and you might fancy they all write by ariosto with a difference the _ death of agrican _ perhaps with minuter touch of nature but certainly not with greater simplicity and earnestness in the _ saracen friend _ there be just ariosto 's balance of passion and levity and in the story which i have entitle _ see and believe _ he exhibition of triumphant cunning during the life of pulcus and boiardo the fierce passion and severe ethic of dante have be gradually give way to a gentler and laxer state of opinion before the progress of luxury and though boiardo 's enamoured paladin retain a kind of virtue not common in any age to the hero of warfare the lord of scandiano who appear to have recite he poem sometimes to he vassal and sometimes to the ducal circle at court intimate a smile suspicion that such a virtue would be consider a little rude and obsolete by he hearer pulci 's wander gallant uliviero who in dante 's time would have be a scandalous profligate have become the prototype of the court-lover in boiardo 's the poet however in he most favorite character retain and recommend a truer sentiment as in the instance of the love of brandimart and fiordelisa and there be a graceful cheerfulness in some of he least sentimental one which redeem they from grossness i know not a more charming fancy in the whole loving circle of fairy-land than the female 's shake she long tress round mandricardo in order to furnish he with a mantle when he issue out of the enchanted fountain -lrb- 5 -rrb- but boiardo 's poem be unfinished : there be many prosaical passage in it many lame and harsh line incorrect and even ungrammatical expression trivial image and above all many lombard provincialism which be not in they nature of a significant or graceful sort -lrb- 6 -rrb- and which shock the fastidious florentine the arbiter of italian taste it be to avoid these in he own poetry that boiardo 's countryman ariosto carefully study the tuscan dialect if not visit florence itself and the consequence be that he greater genius so obscure the popularity of he predecessor that a remarkable process unique in the history of letter appear to have be think necessary to restore its perusal the facetious bernus a tuscan wit full of genius without omit any particulars of consequence or add a single story except of himself re-cast the whole poem of boiardo alter the diction of almost every stanza and supply introduction to the canto after the manner of ariosto and the florentine idiom and unfailing spirit of this re-fashioner 's verse -lrb- though what be very curious not till after a long chance of its be overlook itself and a posthumous editorship which have leave doubt on the authority of the text -rrb- gradually efface almost the very mention of the man 's name who have supply he with the whole staple commodity of he book with all the heart of its interest and with far the greater part of the actual word the first edition of bernus be prohibit in consequence of its contain a severe attack on the clergy but even the prohibition do not help to make it popular the reader may imagine a similar occurrence in england by suppose that dryden have re-write the whole of chaucer and that he reconstruction have in the course of time as much surpass the original in popularity as he version of the _ flower and the leaf _ do up to the beginning of the present century i do not mean to compare chaucer with boiardo or dryden with bernus fine poet as i think boiardo i hold chaucer to be a far finer and spirited and in some respects admirable as be dryden 's version of chaucer they do not equal that of boiardo by the tuscan dryden do not apprehend the sentiment of chaucer in any such degree as bernus do that of he original indeed mr panizzus himself to whom the world be indebted both for the only good edition of boiardo and for the knowledge of the most curious fact respect bernus 's _ rifacimento _ declare himself unable to pronounce which of the two poem be the better one the original boiardo or the re-modelled it would therefore not very well become a foreigner to give a verdict even if he be able and i confess after no little consideration -lrb- and apart of course from question of dialect which i can not pretend to look into -rrb- i feel myself almost entirely at a loss to conjecture on which side the superiority lie except in point of invention and a certain early simplicity the advantage in those two respects unquestionably belong to boiardo and a great one it be and may not unreasonably be suppose to settle the rest of the question in he favor and yet bernus 's fancy during a more sophisticate period of italian manners exhibit itself so abundantly in he own witty poem he pen at all time have such a charming facility and he prove himself in he version of boiardo to have so strong a sympathy with the earnestness and sentiment of he original in he gravest moment that i can not help think the two man would have be each what the other be in they respective time -- the lombard the comparative idler give more to witty than serious invention under a corrupt roman court and the tuscan the originator of romantic fiction in a court more suit to he than the one he avowedly despise i look upon they as two man singularly well match the nature of the present work do not require and the limit to which it be confine do not permit I to indulge myself in a comparison between they corroborate by proof but it be impossible not to notice the connexion : and therefore beg the reader 's pardon for the sorry substitute of affirmative for demonstrative criticism i may be allow to say that if boiardo have the praise of invention to himself berni thoroughly appreciate and even enriched it that if boiardo have sometimes a more thoroughly charming simplicity bernus still appreciate it so well that the difference of they time be sufficient to restore the claim of equality of feeling and finally that if bernus strengthen and adorn the interest of the composition with more felicitous expression and with a variety of lively and beautiful train of thought you feel that boiardo be quite capable of they all and might have do precisely the same have he live in bernus 's age in the greater part of the poem the original be alter in nothing except diction and often -lrb- so at least it seem to I -rrb- for no other reason than the requirement of the tuscan manner and this be the case with most of the noblest and even the liveliest passage my first acquaintance for example with the _ orlando innamorato _ be through the medium of bernus and on turn to those story in he version which i have translate from he original for the present volume i find that every passage but one to which i have give a mark of admiration be the property of the old poet that single one however be in the exquisitest taste full of as deep a feeling as any thing in its company -lrb- i have notice it in the translate passage -rrb- and then in the celebrated introduction to he canto and the addition to boiardo 's passage of description and character -lrb- those about rodamonte for example so admire by foscolo -rrb- if bernus occasionally spew a comparative want of faith which you regret he do it with a regret on he own part visible through all he jest lastly the singular and indignant strength of he execution often make up for the trustingness that he be sorry to miss if i be ask in short which of the two poem i should prefer keep be i compel to choose i should first complain of be force upon so hard a alternative and then with many a look after bernus retain boiardo the invention be he the first earnest impulse the unmisgiving joy the primitive morning breath when the town-smoke have not polluted the field and the bird be sing they wood-note wild besides after all one can not be _ sure _ that bernus could have invent as boiardo do if he could he would probably have write some fine serious poem of he own and panizzus have observe with striking and conclusive truth that without bernus the _ orlando innamorato _ will be read and enjoy without boiardo not even the name of the poem remain -lrb- 7 -rrb- nevertheless this conclusion need not deprive we of either work bernus raise a fine polished edifice copy and enlarged after that of boiardo -- on the other hand the old house thank heaven remains and we best way of settle the question between the two be to be glad that we have get both let the reader who be rich in such possession look upon bernus 's as one of he town mansion erect in the park-like neighborhood of some metropolis and boiardo 's as the ancient country original of it embosome in the wood afar off and beautiful as the enchanted castle of claude -- lone sit by the shore of old romance \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- footnote 1 : the material for the biography in this notice have be gather from tiraboschus and other but more immediately from the copious critical memoir from the pen of mr panizzus in that gentleman 's admirable edition of the combined poem of boiardo and ariosto in nine volume octavo publish by mr pickering i have be under obligation to this work in the notice of pulcus and shall again be so in that of boiardo 's successor but i must not a third time run the risk of omit to give it my thanks -lrb- such as they be -rrb- and of earnestly recommend every lover of italian poetry who can afford it to possess himself of this learn entertaining and only satisfactory edition of either of the

wit mr stewart rise have give a prose abstract of bernus 's _ orlando innamorato _ with occasional versification but it be hardly more than a dry outline and be indeed intend only as a introduction to he version of the _ furioso _ a good idea however of one of the phase of bernus 's humor may be obtain from the same gentleman 's abridgment of the _ animalus parlantus _ of castus in which he have introduce a translation of the tuscan 's description of himself and of he way of life out of he addition to boiardo 's poem the verse in the prohibit edition of bernus 's _ orlando _ in which he denounce the corruption of the clergy have be publish for the first time in this country in the note to the twentieth canto of mr panizzus 's boiardo they have all he peculiar wit together with a _

in mr rise 's prose abstract of the _ innamorato _ -rrb- the adventure of angelica argument angelica daughter of galafron king of cathay the most beautiful of womankind and a possessor of the art of magic come with she brother argalium to the court of charlemagne under false pretence in order to carry away he knight to the country of she father she immediate purpose be defeat and she brother slay but all the knight orlando in particular fall in love with she and she herself in consequence of drinking at a enchanted fountain become in love with rinaldo on the other hand rinaldo from drink a neighbouring fountain of a reverse quality find he own love convert to loathing various adventure arise out of these circumstance and the fountain be again drunk with a mutual reversal of they effect the adventure of angelica it be the month of may and the feast of pentecost and charlemagne have ordain a great joust which bring into paris a infinite number of people baptise and infidel for there be truce proclaim in order that every knight might come there be king grandonio from spain with he serpent 's face and ferragus with he eye like a eagle and balugante the emperor 's kinsman and orlando and rinaldo and duke namo and astolfo of england the handsomest of mankind and the enchanter malagigus and isoliero and salamone and the traitor gan with he scoundrel follower and in short the whole flower of the chivalry of the age the greatest in the world the table at which they feast be on three side of the hall with the emperor 's canopy midway at the top and at that first table sit crown head and down the table on the right sit duke and marquis and down the table on the left count and cavalier but the saracen noble after they doggish fashion look neither for chair nor bench but prefer a carpet on the floor which be accordingly spread for they in the midst high sit charlemagne at the head of he vassal and he paladin rejoice in the thought of all the great man of which they consist and hold the infidel cheap as the sand which be scatter by the tempest to each of he lord as they drink he send round by he page gift of enamelled cup of exquisite workmanship and to every body some mark of he princely distinction and so they be all sit and hear music and feast off dish of gold and talking of lovely thing with low voice -lrb- 1 -rrb- when suddenly there come into the hall four enormous giant in the midst of whom be a lady and behind the lady there follow a cavalier she be a very lily of the field and a rose of the garden and a morning-star in short so beautiful that the like have never be see there be galerana in the hall there be alda the wife of orlando and clarice and armellina the kind-hearted and abundance of other lady all beautiful till she make she appearance but after that they seem nothing every christian knight turn he face that way and not a pagan remain on the floor but arise and get as near to she as he could while she with a cheerful sweetness and a smile fit to enamor a heart of stone begin speak the follow word : high-minded lord the renown of you worthiness and the valor of these you knight which echo from sea to sea encourage I to hope that two pilgrim who have come from the end of the world to behold you will not have encounter they fatigue in vain and to the end that i may not hold you attention too long with speak let I briefly say that this knight here uberto of the lion a prince renowned also for he achievement have be wrongfully drive from out he dominion and that i who be drive out with he be he sister whose name be angelica fame have tell we of the joust this day appoint and of the noble press of knight here assemble and how you generous nature care not to win prize of gold or jewel or gift of city but only a wreath of rose and so the prince my brother have come to prove he own valor and to say that if any or all of you guest whether baptise or infidel choose to meet he in the joust he will encounter they one by one in the green meadow without the wall near the place call the horseblock of merlin by the fountain of the pine and he condition be these -- that no knight who chance to be throw shall have license to renew the combat in any way whatsoever but remain a submissive prisoner in he hand he on the other hand if himself be throw agree to take he departure out of the country with he giant and to leave he sister for prize in the hand of the conqueror kneel at the close of these word the lady await the answer of charlemagne and every body gaze on she with astonishment orlando especially more than all the rest feel irresistibly draw towards she so that he heart tremble and he change countenance but he feel ashamed at the same time and cast he eye down he say to himself ah mad and unworthy orlando whither be thy soul be hurry i be draw and can not say nay to what draw I i reckon the whole world as nothing and now i be conquer by a girl i can not get she sweet look out of my heart my soul seem to die within I at the thought of be without she it be love that have seize I and i feel that nothing will set I free -- not strength nor courage nor my own wisdom nor that of any adviser i see the better part and cleave to the worse -lrb- 2 -rrb- thus secretly in he heart do the frank and noble orlando lament over he new feeling and no wonder for every knight in the hall be enamoured of the beautiful stranger not except even old white-headed duke namo charlemagne himself do not escape all stand for awhile in silence lose in the delight of look at she the fiery youth ferragus be the first to exhibit symptom in he countenance of uncontrollable passion he refrain with difficulty from go up to the giant and tear she out of they keep rinaldo also turn as red as fire while he cousin malagigus the enchanter who have discover that the stranger be not speak truth mutter softly as he look at she exquisite false creature i will play thee such a trick for this as will leave thee no

whole court of france into cathay prisoner in she hand such malagigus discover be the plot of the accursed infidel hound king galafron -lrb- 4 -rrb- meantime the pretended uberto have return to he station at the horseblock of merlin he have have a beautiful pavilion pitch there and under this pavilion he lay down awhile to refresh himself with sleep he sister angelica lay down also but in the open air under the great pine by the fountain the four giant keep watch : and as she lay thus asleep with she fair head on the grass she appear like a angel come down from heaven by this time malagigus bear by one of he demon have arrive in the same place he see the beauty asleep by the flowery water and the four giant all wide awake and he say within he tooth -- brute scoundrel i will take every one of you into my net without a blow malagigus take he book and cast a spell out of it and in a instant the whole four giant be bury in sleep then draw he sword he softly approach the

be then turn against he and the place be suddenly fill with a crowd of he own demon every one of they cry out to angelica what commandest thou take this man say angelica and bear he prisoner to the great city between tartary and indium where my father galafron be lord present he to he in my name and say it be i that take he and add that have so take the master of the book i care not for all the other lord of the court of charlemagne at the end of these word and at one and the same instant the magician be convey to the foot of galafron in cathay and lock up in a rock under the sea in due time the enamoured knight accord to agreement come to the spot for the purpose of joust with the suppose uberto each anxious to have the first encounter particularly orlando in order that he might not see the beauty carry off by another but they be oblige to draw lot and thirty other name appear before he the first of which be that of astolfo the englishman now astolfo be son of the king of england and as i say before he be the handsomest man in the world he be also very rich and well breed and love to dress well and be as brave as he be handsome but he success be not always equal to he bravery he have a trick of be throw from he horse a fail which he be accustom to attribute to accident and then he would mount again and be again throw from the saddle in the boldest manner conceivable this gallant prince be habit on the present occasion in arm worth a whole treasury he shield have a border of large pearl he mail be of gold on he helmet be a ruby as big as a chestnut and he horse be

salutation the two combatant rush together but the moment the englishman be touch with the golden lance he leg fly over he head curse fortune cry he as he lay on the grass this be out of all calculation but it be entirely owe to the saddle you can not but acknowledge that if i have keep my seat the beautiful lady would have be mine but thus it be when fortune choose to befriend infidel -lrb- 6 -rrb- the four giant who have by this time be disenchant out of they sleep by angelica take up the english prince and put he in the pavilion but when he be strip of he armor he look so handsome that the lovely stranger secretly take pity on he and bid they shew he all the courtesy that captivity allow he be permit to walk outside by the fountain and angelica from a dark corner look at he with admiration as he walk up and down in the moonlight -lrb- 7 -rrb- the violent ferragus have the next chance in the encounter and be throw no less speedily than astolfo but he do not so easily put up with the mischance cry out what be the emperor 's engagement to I he rush with he sword against argalium who be force to defend himself unexpectedly dismount and set aside he lance and get so much the worse of the fight that he listen to proposal of marriage from ferragus to he sister the beauty however not feel a inclination to match with so rough and savage-looking a person be so dismayed at the offer that hastily bid she brother meet she in the forest of arden she vanish from the sight of both by means of the enchanted ring argalium see this take to he horse of swiftness and dash away in the same direction ferragus in distraction pursue argalium and astolfo thus leave to himself take possession of the golden lance and again issue forth -- not indeed with quite he usual confidence of the result but determine to run all risk in any thing that might ensue for the sake of the emperor in fine to cut this part of the history short charlemagne find the lady and she brother go order the joust to be restore to its first intention and astolfo who be as ignorant as the other of the treasure he possess in the enchanted lance unhorse all comer against he like so many child equally to they astonishment and he own the paladin rinaldo now learn the issue of the fight between ferragus and the stranger and gallop in a loving agony of pursuit after the fair fugitive orlando learn the disappearance of rinaldo and distract with jealousy push forth in like manner and at length all three be in the forest of arden hunting about for she who be invisible now in this forest be two enchanted water the one a run stream and the other a build fountain the first cause every body who taste it to fall in love and the other -lrb- so to speak -rrb- to fall _ out _ of love say rather to feel the love turn into hate to the latter of these two water rinaldo happen to come and be flush with heat and anxiety he dismount from he horse and quench in one cold draught both he thirst and he passion so far from loving angelica as before or hold she beauty of any account he become disgusted with its pursuit nay hate she from the bottom of he heart and so in this new state of mind and with feeling of lofty contempt he remount and ride away and happen to come on the bank of the run stream there entice by the beauty of the place which be all sweet meadow-ground and bower of tree he again quit he saddle and throw himself on the ground fall fast asleep unfortunately for the proud beauty angelica or rather in just punishment for she contempt she palfrey conduct she to this very place the water tempt she to drink and dismount and tie the animal to one of the tree she do so and then cast she eye on the sleep rinaldo love instantly seize she and she stand root to the spot the meadow round about be all full of lily of the valley and wild rose angelica not know what to do at length pluck a quantity of these and with she white hand she drop they on the face of the sleeper he wake up and see who it be not only receive she salutation with a change of countenance but remount he horse gallop away through the thickest part of the forest in vain the beautiful creature follow and call after he in vain ask he what she have do to be so despise and entreat he at any rate to take care how he go so fast rinaldo disappear leave she to wring she hand in despair and she return in tear to the spot on which she have find he sleep there in she turn she herself lay down press the spot of earth on which he have lie and so weep and lament yet blessing every flower and bit of grass that he have touch fall asleep out of fatigue and sorrow as angelica thus lay the good or bad fortune of orlando conduct he to the same place the attitude in which she be sleep be so lovely that it be not even to be conceive much less express the very grass seem to flower on all side of she for joy and the stream as it murmur along to go talk of love -lrb- 8 -rrb- orlando stand gaze like a man who have be transport to another sphere be i on earth think he or be i in paradise surely it be i myself that be sleep and this be my dream but he dream be prove to be none in a manner which he little desire ferragus who have slay argalium come up rage with jealousy and a combat ensue which awake the sleeper terrify at what she behold she rush to she palfrey and while the fighter be occupy with one another flee away through the forest fast flee the beauty in the direction take by rinaldo nor do she cease travel by one conveyance or another till she reach she own country whither she have send

a spirit into a enchanted barque which he find on a sea-shore and which convey he without any visible pilot into joyous palace -lrb- for so the island be call -rrb- the whole island be a garden fifteen mile in extent it be full of tree and lawn and on the western side close to the sea be the palace build of a marble so clear and polished that it reflect the landscape round about rinaldo not know what to think of he strange conveyance lose no time in leap to shore upon which a lady make she appearance who invite he within the house be a most beautiful house full of room adorn with azure and gold and with noble painting and within as well as without it be the loveliest flower the purest fountain and a fragrance fit to turn sorrow to joy the lady lead the knight into a apartment paint

astonish a repast ensue consist of viand the most delicate and wine as fragrant as they be fine drunk out of jewelled cup and when it draw towards its conclusion harp and lute be hear in the distance and one of the lady say in the knight 's ear this house and all that you see in it be yours for you alone be it build and the builder be a queen and happy indeed must you think yourself for she love you and she be the greatest beauty in the world she name be angelica the moment rinaldo hear the name he so detest disgust and wretchedness fall upon he heart notwithstanding the joy around he he start up with a change countenance and in spite of all that the lady could say break off across the garden and never cease hasten till he reach the place where he land he would have throw himself into the sea rather than stay any longer in that island but the enchanted barque be still on the shore he spring into it and attempt instantly to push off for he still see nobody in it but himself but the barque for a while resist he effort till on he feel a wish to drown himself or to do any thing rather than return to that detest house it suddenly loose itself from its mooring and dash away with he over the sea as if in a fury all night do the pilotless barque dash on till it reach in the morning a distant shore cover with a gloomy forest here rinaldo surround by enchantment of a very different sort from those which he have lately resist be entrap into a pit the pit belong to a castle which be hang with human head and paint red with blood and as the paladin be call upon god to help he a hideous white-headed old woman of a spiteful countenance make she appearance on the edge of the pit and tell he that he must fight with a monster bear of death and desire be it so say the paladin let I but remain armed as i be and i fear nothing for rinaldo have with he he renowned sword fusberta -lrb- 10 -rrb- the old woman laugh in derision rinaldo remain in the den all night and next day be take to a place where a portcullis be lift up and the monster rush forth he be a mixture of hog and serpent larger than a ox and not to be look at without horror he have eye like a traitor the hand of a man but claw a beard dabble with blood a skin of coarse variegated color too hard to be cut through and two horn on he temple which he could turn on all side of he at he pleasure and which be so sharp that they cut like a sword rise on he hind-leg and open a mouth six palm in width this horrible beast fall heavily on rinaldo who be nevertheless quick enough to give it a blow on the snout which increase its fury return the knight a tremendous cuff it seize he coat of mail between breast and shoulder and tear away a great strip of it down to the girdle leave the skin bare every successive rent and blow be of the like irresistible violence and though the paladin himself never fight with more force and fury he lose blood every instant the monster at length tear he sword out of he hand the paladin surely begin to think that he last hour be arrive look about to see what might possibly help he he observe overhead a beam stick out of a wall at the height of some ten foot he take a leap more than human and reach the beam with he hand succeed in fling himself up across it here he sit for hour the furious brute continually try to reach he night-time then come on with a clear starry sky and moonlight and the paladin could discern no way of escape when he hear a sound of something he know not what come through the air like a bird suddenly a female figure stand on the end of the beam hold something in she hand towards he and speak in a loving voice it be angelica come with means for destroy the monster and carry the knight away but the moment rinaldo see she desperate as seem to be he condition he renounce all offer of she assistance and at length become so exasperated with she good office especially when she open she arm and offer to bear he away in they that he threaten to cast himself down to the monster if she do not go away -lrb- 11 -rrb- angelica say that she would lose she life rather than displease he descend from the beam and have give the monster a cake of wax which fasten up he tooth and then catch and fix he in a set of noose she have bring for that purpose take she miserable departure rinaldo upon this get down from the beam himself and have succeed though with the greatest difficulty in beating and squeeze the life out of the monster deal such havoc among the people of the castle who assail he that the horrible old woman whose crime have make she the creature 's housekeeper and lead she to take delight in its cruelty throw herself headlong from a tower the paladin then take he way forth turn he back on the castle and the sea-shore angelica return to the capital of she father 's dominion albracca and the pertinacity of other in seek she love be as great as that of hers for rinaldo she find king galafron in a short time besiege there for she sake by the fierce agrican king of tartary in a short time a jealous feud spring up between the loving friend rinaldo and orlando and angelica tear with conflict emotion from she dread on she father 's account as well as she own and she aversion to every knight but she detester be at one time compel to apply to orlando for assistance and at another be afraid that he would have the better of rinaldo in combat to send he away on a perilous adventure elsewhere with a promise of accept he love should he succeed -lrb- 12 -rrb- orlando go but not before he have slay agrican and deliver albracca circumstance however again take he with she to a distance as the reader will see ere he could bring she to perform she promise and the paladin in general have again be scatter abroad it happen that rinaldo a second time find himself in the forest of arden and here without expect it he become a altered man for he now taste a very different stream from that which have give he he hate for angelica namely the one which have make she fall in love with himself he be lead to do this by a very extraordinary adventure in the thick of the forest he have come upon a mead full of flower in which there be a naked youth singing in the midst of three damsel who be naked also and who be dance round about he they have bunch of flower in they hand and garland on they head and as they be thus delight themselves with face full of love and joy they suddenly change countenance on see rinaldo behold cry they the traitor behold he villain that he be and the scorner of all delight he have fall into the net at last with these word they fall upon he with the flower like so many fury and tender as such scourge might be think every blow which the rose and violet give he every fresh stroke of the lily and the hyacinth smite he to the very heart and fill he vein with fire the flower in the band of the nymph be exhaust the youth give he a blow on the helmet with a tall garden-lily which fell he to the earth and so take he by the leg and drag he over the grass he conqueror go the whole circuit of the mead with he the nymph take the very garland off they head and again scourge he with they white and red rose -lrb- 13 -rrb- at the close of this discipline which leave he more exhaust than twenty battle he enemy suddenly develop wing from they shoulder the feather of which be of white and gold and vermilion every feather have a eye in it not like those in the peacock 's feather but one full of life and motion be a female eye lovely and gracious and with these wing they poise themselves a little and so spring up to heaven -lrb- 14 -rrb- the paladin more dead than alive lay helpless among the flower when a fourth nymph come up to he of inexpressible beauty she tell he that he have grievously offend the naked youth who be no other than love himself and add that he only remedy be to be penitent and to drink of the water of a stream hard by which he would find run from the root of a olive-tree and a pine with these word she vanish in she turn like the rest and rinaldo drag himself as well as he could to the olive and pine stoop down and greedily drink of the water again and again he drink and wish still to be drink for it take not only all pain out of he limb but all hate and bitterness out of he soul and produce such a remorseful and doating memory of angelica that he would fain have gallop that instant to cathay and prostrate himself at she foot by degree he know the place and look round about he and prepare to remount he horse he discern a knight and a lady in the distance the knight be in a coat of armor unknown to he and the lady kneel and drink at a fountain which be the one that have formerly quench he own thirst to wit the fountain of disdain alas it be angelica herself and the knight be orlando she have allow he to bring she into france ostensibly for the purpose of wedding he at the court of charlemagne whither the hero 's assistance have be call against agramant king of the moor but secretly with the object of discover rinaldo rinaldo behold be discover but the fatal averse water have be drunk and angelica now hate he in turn as cordially as he detest she in vain he accost she in the humblest and most repentant manner call himself the unworthiest of mankind and entreat to be allow to love she orlando disclose himself fiercely

understanding that she be to be the prize of the warrior who should best deserve she in the approach battle with the infidel -lrb- this be the last we hear of angelica in the unfinished poem of

the knowledge of he maker the man that be without it be no better than a stock or a stone or a brute beast neither without study can he reach anything like a due sense of the depth and divineness of the contemplation learn or not learn say agrican you might skew yourself better breed than by endeavor to make I talk on a subject on which you have I at a disadvantage i have frankly tell you what sort of person i be and i dare say that you for you part be very learn and wise you will therefore permit I if you say anything more of such thing to make you no answer if you choose to sleep i wish

despair and bewail the hour she be bear what on earth be i to do cry the wretched lady death itself be no remedy for a case like this since it be only another mode of break my word to think that prasildo should return from the garden of medusa who could have suppose it possible and yet in truth what a fool i be to suppose any thing impossible to love o my husband little didst thou think what thou thyself advisedst I to promise the husband be come that moment towards the room and overhear he wife grieve in this distract manner he enter and clasp she in he arm on learn the cause of she affliction he feel as though he should have die with she on the spot alas cry he that it should be possible for I to be miserable while i be so dear to you heart but you know o my soul that when love and jealousy come together the torment be the greatest in the world myself -- myself alas cause the mischief and myself alone ought to suffer for it you must keep you promise you must abide by the word you have give especially to one who have undergo so much to perform what you ask he sweet face you must but oh see he not till after i be dead let fortune do with I what she please so that i be save from a disgrace like that it will be a comfort to I in death to think that i alone while i be on earth enjoy the fond look of that lovely face nay conclude the wretched husband i feel as though i should die over again if i could call to mind in my grave how you be take from I iroldo become dumb for anguish it seem to he as if he very heart have be take out of he breast nor be tisbina less miserable she be as pale as death and could hardly speak to he or bear to look at he at length turn she eye upon he she say and do you believe i could make my poor sorry case out in this world without iroldo can he bear himself to think of leave he tisbina he who have so often say that if he possess heaven itself he should not think it heaven without she o dearest husband there be a way to make death not bitter to either of we it be to die together i must only exist long enough to see prasildo death alas be in that thought but the same death will release we it need not even be a hard death save we misery there be poison so gentle in they deadliness that we need but faint away into sleep and so in the course of a few hour be deliver we misery and we folly will then alike be end iroldo assent clasp he wife in distraction and for a long time they remain in the same posture half stifle with grief and bathing one another 's cheek with they tear afterwards they send quietly for the poison and the apothecary make up a preparation in a cup without ask any question and so the husband and wife take it iroldo drink first and then endeavor to give the cup to he wife utter not a word and tremble in every limb not because he be afraid of death but because he could not bear to ask she to share it at length turn away he face and look down he hold the cup towards she and she take it with a chill heart and tremble hand and drink the remainder to the dregs iroldo then cover he face and head not daring to see she depart for the house of prasildo and tisbina with pang bitterer than death leave he in solitude tisbina accompany by a servant go to prasildo who could scarcely believe he ear when he hear that she be at the door request to speak with he he hasten down to shew she all honor lead she from the door into a room by themselves and when he find she in tear address she in the most considerate and subdue yet still not unhappy manner take she confusion for bashfulness and never dream what a tragedy have be meditate find at length that she grief be not to be do away he conjure she by what she hold dearest on earth to let he know the cause of it add that he could still die for she sake if he death would do she any service tisbina speak at these word and prasildo then hear what he do not wish to hear i be in you hand answer she while i be yet alive i be bind to my word but i can not survive the dishonor which it cost I nor above all the loss of the husband of my heart you also to whose eye i have be so welcome must be prepare for my disappearance from the earth have my affection not belong to another ungentle would have be my heart not to have love yourself who be so capable of loving but -lrb- as you must well know -rrb- to love two at once be neither fitting nor in one 's power it be for that reason i never love you baron i be only touch with compassion for you and hence the misery of we all before this day close i shall have learn the taste of death and without further preface she disclose to he how she and she husband have take poison prasildo be strike dumb with horror he have think he felicity at hand and be at the same instant to behold it go for ever she who be root in he heart she who carry he life in she sweet look even she be sit there before he already so to speak dead it have please neither heaven nor you tisbina exclaim the unhappy young man to put my best feeling to the proof often have two lover perish for love the world will now behold a sacrifice of three oh why do you not make a request to I in you turn and ask I to free you from you promise you say you take pity on I alas cruel one confess that you have kill yourself in order to kill I yet why never do i think of give you displeasure and i now do what i would have do at any time to prevent it i absolve you from you oath stay or go this instant as it seem best to you a stronger feeling than compassion move the heart of tisbina at these word this indeed reply she i feel to be noble and truly could i also now die to save you but life be flit and how may i prove my regard prasildo who have in good earnest resolve that three instead of two should perish experienced such anguish at the extraordinary position in which he find all three that even she sweet word come but dimly to he ear he stand like a man stupify then beg of she to give he but one kiss and so take he leave without further ado only intimate that she way out of the house lay before she as he speak he remove himself from she sight tisbina reach home she find she husband with he head cover up as she leave he but when she recount what have pass and the courtesy of prasildo and how he have exact from she but a single kiss iroldo get up and remove the cover from he face and then clasp he hand and raise it to heaven he kneel with grateful humility and pray god to give pardon to himself and reward to he neighbor but before he have end tisbina sink on the floor in a swoon she weaker frame be the first to undergo the effect of what she have take iroldo feel icy chill to see she albeit she seem to sleep sweetly she aspect be not at all like death he tax heaven with cruelty for treat two loving heart so hardly and cry out against fortune and life and love itself nor be prasildo happier in he chamber he also exclaim against the bitter tyrant whom man call love and protest that he would gladly encounter any fate to be deliver from the worse evil of he false and cruel ascendency but he lamentation be interrupt the apothecary who sell the potion to the husband and wife be at the door below request to speak with he the servant at first have refuse to carry the message but the old man persist and say it be a matter of life and death entrance for he into he master 's chamber be obtain noble sir say the apothecary i have always hold you in love and reverence i have unfortunately reason to fear that somebody be desire you death this morning a handmaiden of the lady tisbina apply to I for a secret poison and just now it be tell I that the lady herself have be at this house i be old sir and you be young and i warn you against the violence and jealousy of womankind talk of they flame of love satan himself burn they say i for they be fit for nothing better do not be too much alarmed however this time : for in truth i give the young woman nothing of the sort that she ask for but only a draught so innocent that if you have take it it will cost you but four or five hour ' sleep so in god 's name give up the whole foolish sex for you may depend on it that in this city of ours there be ninety-nine wicked one among they to one good you may guess how prasildo 's heart revive at these word truly might he be compare to flower in sunshine after rain he rejoice through all he be and display again a cheerful countenance hastily thank the old man he lose no time in repair to the house of he neighbor and tell they of they safety : and you may guess how the like joy be theirs but behold a wonder iroldo be so strike with the generosity of he neighbor 's conduct throughout the whole of this extraordinary affair that nothing would content he grateful though ever-grieving heart but he must fairly give up tisbina after all prasildo to do he justice resist the proposition as stoutly as he could but a man 's power be ill second by a unwilling heart and though the contest be long and handsome as be customary between generous nature the husband adhere firmly to he intention in short he abruptly quit the city declare that he would never again see it and so leave he wife to the lover and i must add -lrb- conclude the fair lady who be tell the story to rinaldo -rrb- that although tisbina take he departure greatly to heart and sometimes feel as if she should die at the thought of it yet since he persist in stay away and there appear no chance of he ever do otherwise she do as in that case we should all do we at least that be young and kind and take the handsome prasildo for second spouse -lrb- 3 -rrb- part the second the conclusion of this part of the history of iroldo and prasildo be scarcely out of the lady 's mouth when a tremendous voice be hear among the tree and rinaldo find himself confront a giant of a frightful aspect who with a griffin on each side of he be guard a cavern that contain the enchanted horse which have belong to the brother of angelica a combat ensue and after win the horse and subsequently lose the company of the lady the paladin in the course of he adventure come upon a knight who lay lament in a green place by a fountain the knight heed nothing but he grief do not perceive the new comer who for some time remain look at he in silence till desirous to know the cause of he sorrow he dismount from he horse and courteously beg to be inform of it the stranger in he turn look a little while in silence at rinaldo and then tell he he have resolve to die in order to be rid of a life of misery and yet he add it be not he own lot which grieve he so much as that of a noble friend who would die at the same time and who have nobody to help he the knight who be no other than tisbina 's husband iroldo then briefly related the event which the reader have hear and proceed to state how he lead traverse the world ever since for two year when it be he misfortune to arrive in the territory of the enchantress falerina whose custom it be to detain foreigner in prison and daily give a couple of they -lrb- a lady and a cavalier -rrb- for food to a serpent which keep the entrance of she enchanted garden to this serpent he himself be destine to be sacrifice when prasildo the possessor of he wife tisbina hearing of he peril set out instantly from babylon and ride night and day till he come to the abode of the enchantress determine that nothing should hinder he from do he utmost to save the life of a friend so generous save it he do and that by a generosity no less devoted for have attempt in vain to bribe the keeper of the prison he succeed in prevail on the man to let he substitute himself for he friend and he be that very day perhaps that very moment prepare for the dreadful death to which he would speedily be bring i will not survive such a friend conclude iroldo i know i shall contend with he warder to no purpose but let the wretch come if they will by thousand i shall fight they to the last gasp one comfort in death one joy i shall at all event experience i shall be with prasildo in the other world and yet when i think what sort of death he must endure even the release from my own misery afflict I since it will not prevent he from undergo that horror the paladin shed tear to hear of a case so piteous and affectionate and in a tone of encouragement offer he service towards the rescue of he friend iroldo look at he in astonishment but sigh and say ah sir i thank you with all my heart and you be doubtless a most noble cavalier to be so fearless and good-hearted but what right have i to bring you to destruction for no reason and to no purpose there be not a man on earth but orlando himself or he cousin rinaldo who could possibly do we any good and so i beg you to accept my thanks and depart in safety and may god reward you it be true reply the paladin i be not orlando and yet for all that i doubt not to be able to effect what i propose nor do i offer my assistance out of desire of glory or of thanks or return of any kind except indeed that if two such unparalleled friend could admit I to be a third i should hold myself a happy man what you have give up the woman of you heart and deprive yourself of all joy and comfort and you friend on the other hand have become a prisoner and devote to death for you sake and can i be expect to leave two such friend in a jeopardy so monstrous and not do all in my power to save they i would rather die first myself and on you own principle i mean in order to go with you into a better world while they be talk in this manner a great ill-looking rabble upward of a thousand strong make they appearance carry a banner and bring forth two prisoner to die the wretch be arm after they disorderly fashion and the prisoner each tie upon a horse one of these hapless person too surely be prasildo and the other turn out to be the damsel who have tell rinaldo the story of the friend have be deprive of the paladin 's assistance she subsequent misadventure have bring she to this terrible pass the moment rinaldo behold she he leap on he horse and dash among the villain the sight of such a onset be enough for they cowardly heart the whole posse flee before he with precipitation all except the leader who be a villain of gigantic strength and he the paladin at one blow clove through the middle iroldo could not speak for joy as he hasten to release prasildo he be force to give he tear instead of word but when speech at length become possible the two friend fervently and with a religious awe declare that they deliverer must have be divine and not human so tremendous be the death-blow he have give the ruffian and such winged and contemptuous slaughter he have deal among the fugitive by the time he return from the pursuit they astonishment have rise to such a pitch that they fall on they knee and worship he for the prophet of the saracen not believe such prowess possible to humanity and devoutly thank he for the mercy he have shew they in come thus visibly from heaven rinaldo for the moment be not a little disturbed at this sally of enthusiasm but the singular good faith and simplicity of it restore he to himself and with a smile between lovingness and humility he beg they to lay aside all such fancy and know he for a man like themselves he then disclose himself for the rinaldo of whom they have speak and make such a impression on they with he piety and he attribute what have appear a superhuman valor to nothing but he belief in the christian religion that the transport friend become convert on the spot and accompany he thenceforth as the most faithful of he knight \* \* \* \* \* the story tell we nothing further of tisbina though there can be no doubt that boiardo mean to give we the conclusion of she share in it for the two knight take a active part in the adventure of they new friend rinaldo perhaps however the discontinuance of the poem itself be lucky for the author as far as this episode be concern for it be difficult to conceive in what manner he would have wind it up to the satisfaction of the reader -lrb- footnote 1 : the hero and heroine of the famous romance of _ tristan de leonois _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : mr rise observe that medusa may be design by boiardo as the ` type of conscience ' and he be confirm in he opinion by the circumstance mention in this canto -lrb- 12 lib i stan 39 -rrb- of medusa not be able to contemplate the reflection of she own hideous appearance though beautiful in the sight of other i fully agree with he -- panizzus _ ut sup _ vol iii p 333 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : tisbina say panizzus in a note on this passage very wisely act like emilium -lrb- in chaucer -rrb- who when she see she could not marry arcita because he be kill thought of marry palemone rather than ` be a mayden all hire lyf ' it be to be observe that although she regret very much what have happen and even faint away she do not however stand on ceremony as the poet say in the next stanza but yield immediately and marry prasildo this at first i think to be a somewhat inconsistent but on consideration i find i be wrong tisbina be wrong because have lose iroldo she do not know what prasildo would do but so soon as the latter offer to fill up the place she nobly and magnanimously resign herself to she fate -- _ ut sup _ vol iii p 336 it might be think inconsistent in tisbina notwithstanding mr panizzus 's pleasantry to be so willing to take another husband after have poison herself for the first but she seem intend by the poet to exhibit a character of impulse in contradistinction to permanency of sentiment she can not help shew pity for prasildo she can not help poisoning herself for she husband and she can not help take he friend when she have lose he nor must it be forget that the husband be the first to break the tie we respect he more than we do she because he be capable of greater self-denial but if he himself prefer he friend to he love we can hardly blame she -lrb- custom apart -rrb- for follow the example -rrb- see and believe argument a lady have two suitor a young and a old one the latter of whom win she against she inclination by practise the artifice of hippomane in he race with atalanta be very jealous he lock she up in a tower and the youth who continue to be she lover make a subterraneous passage to it and pretend to have marry she sister invite the old man to he house and introduce he own wife to he as the bride the husband deceive but still jealous facilitate they departure out of the country and return to he tower to find himself desert this story like that of the _ saracen friend _ be tell by a damsel to a knight while ride in he company with this difference that she be the heroine of it herself she be a damsel of a nature still lighter than the former and the reader 's sympathy with the trouble she bring on herself and the way she get out of it will be modify accordingly on the other hand nobody can respect the foolish old man with he unwarrantable marriage and the moral of boiardo 's story be still useful for these enlighten time though convey with a air of levity in addition to the classic the poet have be to the norman fabler for he story the subterranean passage have be more than once repeat in romance and the closing incident the assistance give by the husband to he wife 's elopement have be imitate in the farce of _ lionel and clarissa _ see and believe my father -lrb- say the damsel -rrb- be king of the distant island where the treasure of the earth be collect never be greater wealth know and i be heiress of it all but it be impossible to foresee what be most to be desire for we in this world i be a king 's daughter i be rich i be handsome i be lively and yet to all those advantage i owe my ill-fortune among other suitor for my hand there come two on the same day one of whom be a youth name ordauro handsome from head to foot the other a old man of seventy whose name be folderico both be rich and of noble birth but the greybeard be count extremely wise and of a foresight more than human as i do not feel in want of he foresight the youth be far more to my taste and accordingly i listen to he with perfect good-will and give the wise man no sort of encouragement i be not at liberty however to determine the matter my father have a voice in it so fear what he would advise i think to secure a good result by cunning and management it be a old observation that the craft of a woman exceed all other craft indeed it be solomon 's own say but now-a-days people laugh at it and i find to my cost that the laugh be just i request my father to proclaim first that nobody should have I in marriage who do not surpass I in swiftness -lrb- for i be a damsel of a mighty agility -rrb- and secondly that he who do surpass I should be my husband he consent and i think my happiness secure you must know i have run down a bird and catch it with my own hand well both my suitor come to the race the youth on a large war-horse trap with gold which curvett in a prodigious manner and seem impatient for a gallop the old roan on a mule carry a great bag at he side and look already tire out they dismount on the place choose for the trial which be a meadow it be encircle by a world of spectator and the greybeard and myself -lrb- for he age give he the first chance -rrb- only wait for the sound of the trumpet to set off i hold my competitor in such contempt that i let he get the start of I on purpose to make he ridiculous but i be not prepare for he pull a golden apple out of he bag and throw it as far as he could in a direction different from that of the goal the sight of a curiosity so tempting be too much for my prudence and it roll away so roundly and to such a distance that i lose more time in reach it than i look for before i overtook the old gentleman he throw another apple and this again lead I a chase after it in short i blush to say that resolve as i be to be tempt no further see that the end of we course be now at hand and my marriage with a old man instead of a young man be out of the question he seduce I to give chase to a third apple and fairly reach the goal before I i weep for rage and disgust and meditate every species of unconjugal treatment of the old fox what right have he to marry such a child as i be i ask myself the question at the time i ask it a thousand time afterwards and i must confess that the more i have torment he the more the retaliation delight I however it be of no use at the moment the old wretch bear I off to he domain with a ostentatious triumph and then he jealousy misgive he he shut I up in a castle on a rock where he endeavor from that day forth to keep I from the sight of live be you may judge what sort of castle it be by its name -- _ altamura _ -lrb- lofty wall -rrb- it overlook a desert on three side and the sea on the fourth and a man might as well have fly as endeavored to scale it there be but one path up to the entrance very steep and difficult and when you be there you must have pierce outwork after outwork and pick the lock of gate after gate so there sit i in this delicious retreat hopeless and burst with rage i call upon death day and night as my only refuge i have no comfort but in see my keeper mad with jealousy even in that desolate spot i think he be jealous of the very fly my handsome youth ordauro however have not forget I no nor even give I up luckily he be not only very clever but rich besides without which to be sure he brain would not have avail he a pin what do he do therefore but take a house in the neighborhood on the sea-shore and while my tormentor in alarm and horror watch every movement and think he come if he see a cloud or a bird ordauro set people secretly to work night and day and make a subterraneous passage up to the very tower guess what i feel when i see he enter assuredly i do not show he the face which i shewed folderico i die with joy this moment to think of my delight as soon as we could discourse of any thing but we meeting ordauro concerted measure for my escape and the greatest difficulty be surmount by the subterraneous passage they at last succeed but we enemy give we a frightful degree of trouble there be no end of the old man 's prying peeping and precaution he leave I as little as possible by myself and he have all the coast thereabout at he command together with the few boat that ever touch it ordauro however do a thing at once the most bold and the most ingenious he give out that he be marry and invite my husband to dinner who have hear the news with transport present I to he astonished eye for the bride the old man look as if he would have die for rage and misery horrible villain cry he what be this ordauro profess astonishment in he turn what ask he do you not know that the princess you lady 's sister be wonderfully like she and that she have do I the honor of become my wife i invite you in order to do honor to yourself and so bring the good family together detestable falsehood cry folderico do you think i be blind or a bear idiot but i 'll see to this business directly and terrible shall be my revenge so say he fling out and hasten as fast as age would let he to the room in the tower where he expect to find I not but there he do find I : -- there be i sit as if nothing have happen with my hand on my cheek and full of my old melancholy god preserve I exclaim he this be astonishing indeed never could i have dream that one sister could be so like another but be it so or be it not i have terrible suspicion it be impossible to believe it tell I truly he continue answer I on the faith of a daring woman and you shall get no hurt by it have any one open the portal for you to-day who be it how do you get out tell I the truth and you shall not suffer for it but deceive I and there be no punishment that you may not look for it be needless to say how i vow and protest that i have never stir that it be quite impossible that i could not have do it if i would & c i take all the saint to witness to my veracity and swear i have never see the outside of he tremendous castle the monster have nothing to say to this but i see what he mean to do -- i see that he would return instantly to the house of ordauro and ascertain if the bride be there accordingly the moment he turn the key on I i fly down the subterraneous passage toss on my new clothes like lightning and sit in my lover 's house as before wait the arrival of the panting old gentleman well exclaim he as soon as he set eye upon I never in all my life -- no -- i must allow it to be impossible -- never can my wife at home be the lady sit here from that day forth the old man whenever he see I in ordauro 's house treat I as if i be indeed he sister-in-law though he never have the heart to bring the two wife together for fear of old recollection nevertheless this state of thing be still very perilous and my new husband and myself lose no time in consider how we should put a end to it by leave the country ordauro resort as before to a bold expedient he tell folderico that the air of the sea-coast disagree with he and the old man whose delight at get rid of he neighbor help to blind he to the deceit not only expedite the movement but offer to see he part of the way on he journey the offer be accept six mile he ride forth with we the stupid old man and then take he leave to return home we push we horse like lightning and so leave he to tear he hair and he old beard with cry and curse as soon as he open the door of he tower ariosto : critical notice of he life and genius critical notice of ariosto 's life and genius -lrb- 1 -rrb- the congenial spirit of pulcus and boiardo may be say to have attain to they height in the person of ariosto upon the principle of a transmigration of soul or after the fashion of that hero in romance who be heir to the bodily strength of all whom he conquer lodovico giovannus ariosto be bear on the 8th of September 1474 in the fortress at reggio in lombardy and be the son of niccolò ariosto captain of that citadel -lrb- as boiardo have be -rrb- and darium maleguzzus whose family still exist the race be transplant from bologna in the century previous when obizzo the third of este marquess of ferrara marry a lady belong to it whose christian name be lippa niccolò ariosto besides hold the same office as boiardo have do at modena as well as at reggio be master of the household to he two successive patron the duke borso and ercole he be also employ like he in diplomacy and be make a count by the emperor frederick the third though not it seem with remainder to he heir lodovico be the eldest of ten child five son and five daughter during he boyhood theatrical entertainment be in great vogue at court as we have see in the life of boiardo and at the age of twelve a year after the decease of that poet -lrb- who must have be well know to he and probably encourage he attempt -rrb- he successor be understand to have dramatise after he infant fashion the story of pyramus and thisbe and to have get he brother and sister to perform it panizzus doubt the possibility of these precocious private theatricals but consider what be call write on the part of child and that only one other performer be require in the piece or at best a third for the lion -lrb- which some little brother might have roar like any sucking-dove -rrb- i can not see good reason for disbelieve the story pope be not twelve year old when he turn the siege of troy into a play and get he school-fellow to perform it the part of ajax be give to the gardener man be a theatrical animal -lrb- -lrb- greek : zoon mimaetikon -rrb- -rrb- and the instinct be develop at a very early period as almost every family can witness that have take its child to the playhouse at fifteen the young poet like so many other of he class be consign to the study of the law and take a great dislike to it the extreme mobility of he nature and the wish to please he father appear to have make he enter on it willingly enough in the first instance -lrb- 2 -rrb- but as soon as he betray symptom of disgust niccolò whose affair be in a bad way drive he back to it with a vehemence which must have make bad worse -lrb- 3 -rrb- at the expiration of five year he be allow to give it up there be reason to believe that ariosto be theatricalise during no little portion of this time for in he nineteenth year he be understand to have be take by duke ercole to pavia and to milan either as a writer or performer of comedy probably both since the courtier and ducal family themselves occasionally appear on the stage and one of the poet 's brother mention he have frequently see he dress in character -lrb- 4 -rrb- on be deliver from the study of the law the young poet appear to have lead a cheerful and unrestrained life for the next four or five year he write or begin to write the comedy of the _ cassarium _ probably meditate some poem in the style of boiardo then in the height of he fame and he cultivate the latin language and intend to learn greek but delay and unfortunately miss it in consequence of lose he tutor some of he happiest day be pass at a villa still possess by the maleguzzus family call la mauriziana two mile from reggio twenty-five year afterwards he call to mind with sigh the pleasant spot there which use to invite he to write verse the garden the little river the mill the tree by the water-side and all the other shady place in which he enjoy himself during that sweet season of he life betwixt April and may -lrb- 5 -rrb- to complete he happiness he have a friend and cousin pandolfo ariosto who love every thing that he love and for whom he augur a brilliant reputation but a dismal cloud be approach in he twenty-first year he lose he father and find a large family leave on he hand in narrow circumstance the charge be at first so heavy especially when aggravate by the death of pandolfo that he tell we he wish to die he take to it manfully however in spite of these fit of gloom and he live to see he admirable effort reward he brother enable to seek they fortune and he sister properly take care of two of they it seem have become nun a third married and a fourth remain long in he house it be not know what become of the fifth in these family-matter the anxious son and brother be occupy for three or four year not however without recreate himself with he verse latin and italian and record he admiration of a number of goddess of he youth he mention in particular one of the name of lydium who keep he often from he dear mother and household and who be probably represent by the princess of the same name in the _ orlando _ punish in the smoke of tartarus for be a jilt and coquette -lrb- 6 -rrb- he friend bembo afterwards the celebrated cardinal recommend he to be blind to such little immaterial point as lady ' infidelity but he be shock at the advice he be far more of othello 's opinion than congreve 's in such matter and declare that he would not have share he mistress ' good-will with jupiter himself -lrb- 7 -rrb- towards the year 1504 the poet enter the service of the unworthy prince cardinal ippolito of este brother of the new duke of ferrara alfonso the first he eminence who have be make a prince of the church at thirteen year of age by the infamous alexander the sixth -lrb- borgium -rrb- be at this period little more than one-and-twenty but he take a active part in the duke 's affair both civil and military and be say to have make himself conspicuous in he father 's lifetime for he vice and brutality he be charge with have order a papal messenger to be severely beat for bring he some unpleasant despatch : which so exasperate he unfortunate parent that he be exile to mantua and the marquess of that city he brother-in-law be oblige to come to ferrara to obtain he pardon but this be a trifle compare with what he be accuse of have do to one of he brother a female of they acquaintance in answer to a speech make she by the reverend gallant have be so unlucky as to say that she prefer he brother giulio 's eye to he eminence 's whole body : upon which the monstrous villain hire two ruffian to put out he brother 's eye some say be present at the attempt attempt only it fortunately turn out to be at least in part the opinion be that the sight of one of the eye be preserve -lrb- 8 -rrb- party-spirit have so much to do with story of prince and prince be so little in a condition to notice they that on the principle of not condemn a man till he have be hear in he defense a honest biographer would be loath to credit these horror of cardinal ippolito do not the violent nature of the time and the general character of the man even with he defender incline he to do so he be a soldier rather than a churchman be a fault of the age perhaps a credit to the man for he appear to have have ability for war and it be no crime of he if he be put into the church when a boy but he conduct to ariosto shew he coarse and selfish and those who say all they can for he admit that he be proud and revengeful and that nobody regret he when he die he be say to have have a taste for mathematics as he brother have for mechanic the truth seem to be that he and the duke who live in troubled time and have to exert all they strength to hinder ferrara from become a prey to the court of rome be clever harsh man of no grace or elevation of character and with no taste but for war and if it have not be for they connexion with ariosto nobody would have hear of they except while peruse the annals of the time ippolito might have be and probably be the ruffian which the anecdote of he brother giulio represent he but the world would have hear little of the villany have he not treat a poet with contempt the admirer of we author may wonder how he could become the servant of such a man much more how he could praise he as he do in the great work which he be soon to begin write but ariosto be the son of a man who have pass he life in the service of the family he have probably be teach a loyal blindness to its defect gratuitous panegyric of prince have be the fashion of man of letter since the time of augustus and the poet want help for he relative and be of a nature to take the least show of favor for a virtue till he have learn as he unfortunately do to be disappoint in the substance it be not know what he appointment be under the cardinal probably he be a kind of gentleman of all work a officer in he guard a companion to amuse and a confidential agent for the transaction of business the employment in which he be chiefly see be that of a envoy but he be say also to have be in the field of battle and he intimate in he _ satire _ that household attention be expect of he which he be not quick to offer such as pull off he eminence 's boot and put on he spur -lrb- 9 -rrb- it be certain that he be employ in very delicate negotiation sometimes to the risk of he life from the peril of road and torrent ippolito who be a man of no delicacy probably make use of he on every occasion that require address the smallest as well as greatest -- a interview with a pope one day and a despatch to a dog-fancier the next he great poem however proceed it be probably begin before he enter the cardinal 's service certainly be in progress during the early part of he engagement this appear from a letter write to ippolito by he sister the marchioness of mantua to whom he have send ariosto at the beginning of the year 1509 to congratulate she on the birth of a child she give she brother special thanks for send he message to she by messer ludovico ariosto who have make she she say pass two delightful day with give she a account of the poem he be write -lrb- 10 -rrb- isabellum be the name of this princess and the grateful poet do not forget to embalm it in he verse -lrb- 11 -rrb- ariosto 's latest biographer panizzus think he never serve under any other leader than the cardinal but i can not help be of opinion with a former one whom he quote that he once take arm under a captain of the name of pio probably a kinsman of he friend alberto pio to whom he address a latin poem it be probably on occasion of some early disgust with the cardinal but i be at a loss to discover at what period of time perhaps indeed he have the cardinal 's permission both to quit he service and return to it possibly he be not to quit it at all except accord to event but merely have leave give he to join a party in arm who be further ippolito 's own object italy be full of captain in arm and conflict interest the poet might even at some period of he life have head a troop under another cardinal he friend giovannus de ' medici afterwards leo the tenth he have certainly be with he in various part of italy and might have take part in some of he bloodless if not he most military equitation be this as it may it be understand that ariosto be present at the repulse give to the venetian by ippolito when they come up the river po against ferrara towards the close of the year 1509 though he be away from the scene of action at he subsequent capture of they flotilla the poet have be despatch between the two event to pope julius the second on the delicate business of at once appease he anger with the duke for resist he ally and request he help to a feudatary of the church julius be in one of he towering passion at first but give way before the address of the envoy and do what he desire but ariosto 's success in this mission be nearly be the death of he in another for alfonso have accompany the french the year follow in they attack on vicenza where they commit cruelty of the same horrible kind as have shock europe within a few month past -lrb- 12 -rrb- the poet 's tongue it be think might be equally efficacious a second time but julius worn out of patience with he too independent vassal who maintain a alliance with the french when the pope have cease to desire it be to be appease no longer he excommunicate alfonso and threaten to pitch he envoy into the tiber so that the poet be fain to run for it as the duke himself be afterwards when he visit rome to be absolved would julius have thus treat ariosto could he have foresee he renown probably he would the greater the opposition to the will the greater the will itself to chuck a accomplished envoy into the river would have be much but to chuck the immortal poet there laurel and all in the tooth of the amazement of posterity would have be a temptation irresistible it be on this occasion that ariosto probably from inability to choose he time or anode of return home contract a cough which be understand to have shorten he existence so that julius may have kill he after all but the pope have a worse enemy in he own bosom -- he violence -- which kill himself in a much shorter period he die in little more than two year afterwards and the poet 's prospects be all now of a very different sort -- at least he think so for in march 1513 he friend giovannus de ' medici succeed to the papacy under the title of leo the tenth ariosto hasten to rome among a shoal of visitant to congratulate the new pope perhaps not without a commission from alfonso to see what he could do for he native country on which the rival medicus family never cease to have design the poet be full of hope for he have know leo under various fortune have be style by he not only a friend but a brother and promise all sort of participation of he prosperity not one of they come the visitor be cordially receive leo stoop from he throne squeeze he hand and kiss he on both he cheek but at night say ariosto i go all the way to the sheep to get my supper wet through all that leo give he be a bull probably the one secure to he the profit of he _ orlando _ and the poet 's friend bibbiena -- wit cardinal and kinsman of bernus -- facilitate the bull but the receiver discharge the fee he do not get one penny by promise pope or friend -lrb- 13 -rrb- he complain a little but all in good humor and good-naturedly ask what he be to expect when so many hungry kinsman and partisan be to be serve first well and wisely ask too and with a superiority to he fortune which leo and bibbiena might have envy it be think probable however that if the poet have be less a friend to the house of este leo would have keep he word with he for they intimacy have undoubtedly be of the most cordial description but it be suppose that leo be afraid he should have a ferrarese envoy constantly about he have he detain ariosto in rome the poet however it be admit be not a good hunter of preferment he could not play the assenter and bow and importune : and sovereign however friendly they may have be before they elevation go the way of most princely flesh when they have attain it they like to take out a man 's gratitude beforehand perhaps because they feel little security in it afterwards the elevation to the papacy of the cheerful and indulgent son of lorenzo de ' medicus after the troublous reign of julius be hail with delight by all christendom and nowhere more so than in the pope 's native place florence ariosto go there to see the spectacles and there in the midst of they he find himself rob of he heart by the lady whom he afterwards marry she name be alessandra benuccus she be the widow of one of the strozzus family whom he have know in ferrara and he have long admire she the poet who like petrarch and boccaccio have record the day on which he fall in love which be that of st john the baptist -lrb- the showy saint-day of the south offer special temptation to that effect -rrb- dwell with minute fondness on the particulars of the lady 's appearance she dress be black silk embroider with two grape-bearing vine intertwist and between she serene forehead and the path that go divide in two she rich and golden tress be a sprig of laurel in bud she observer probably she welcome if not yet accept lover behold something very significant in this attire and a mysterious poem in which he record a device of a black pen feathered with gold which he wear embroidered on a gown of he own have be suppose to allude to it as every body be tempt to make he guess on such occasion i take the pen to have be the black-haired poet himself and the golden feather the tress of the lady beautiful as he describe she with a face full of sweetness and manners noble and engaging he speak most of the charm of she golden lock the black gown could hardly have imply she widowhood : the allusion would not have be delicate the vine belong to dramatic poet among whom the lover be at that time to be class the _ orlando _ not have appear its duplification intimate another self and the crowning laurel be the success that await the heroic poet and the conqueror of the lady 's heart -lrb- 14 -rrb- the marriage be never acknowledge the husband be in the receipt of profit arise from church-office which put he into the condition of the fellow of a college with we who can not marry so long as he retain he fellowship : but it be prove to have take place though the date of it be uncertain ariosto in a satire write three or four year after he fall in love say he never intend either to marry or to take order because if he take order he can not marry and if he marry he can not take order -- that be to say must give up he semi-priestly emolument this be one of the falsehood which the roman catholic religion think itself warrant in tempting honest man to fall into thus perplexing they faith as to the very root of all faith and tend to maintain a sensual hypocrisy which can do no good to the strongest mind and must terribly injure the weak ariosto 's love for this lady i take to have be one of the cause of dissatisfaction between he and the cardinal fortunately for the poet as panizzus observe ippolito be not always in ferrara he travel in italy and he have a archbishopric in hungary the tenure of which compel occasional residence he company be not desire in rome so that he be seldom there ariosto however be a amusing companion and the cardinal seem not to have like to go anywhere without he in the year 1515 he be attend by the poet part of the way on a journey to rome and urbino but ariosto fall ill and have leave to return he confess that he illness be owe to a anxiety of love and he even make a appeal to the cardinal 's experience of such feeling so that it might seem he be not afraid of ippolito 's displeasure in that direction but the weakness which selfish people excuse in themselves become a very different thing -lrb- as they phrase it -rrb- in another the appeal to the cardinal 's experience might only have exasperate he in its assumption of the identity of the case however the poet be at all event leave this time to the indulgence of he love and he poetry and in the course of the ensue year a copy of the first edition of the _ orlando furioso _ in forty canto be put into the hand of the illustrious person to whom it be dedicate the word in which the cardinal be please to express himself on this occasion have become memorable where the devil master lodovick say the reverend personage have you pick up such a parcel of trumpery the original term be much stronger aggravate the insult with indecency there be no equivalent for it in english and i shall not repeat it in italian it be as low and indecent say panizzus as any in the language suffice it to say that although the age be not scrupulous in such matter it be one of the last word befitting the lip of the reverend catholic and that when ippolito of este -lrb- as ginguéné observe -rrb- make that speech to the great poet he utter -- prince cardinal and mathematician as he be -- a impertinence -lrb- 15 -rrb- be the cardinal put out of temper by a device which appear in this book on the leaf succeed the title-page be the privilege for its publication grant by leo in term of the most flattering personal recognition -lrb- 16 -rrb- so far so good unless the unpoetical este patron be not pleased to see such interest take in the book by the tasteful medicus patron but on the back of this leaf be a device of a hive with the bee burn out of it for they honey and the motto evil for good -lrb- _ pro bono malum _ -rrb- most biographer be of opinion that this device be aim at the cardinal 's ill return for all the sweet word lavish on he and he house if so and suppose ariosto to have present the dedication-copy in person it would have be curious to see the face of the two man while he eminence be look at it some will think that the good-natured poet could hardly have take such a occasion of display he resentment but the device do not express at whom it be aim : the cardinal need not have apply it to himself if he do not choose especially as the book be full of he praise and good-natured people will not always miss a opportunity of covertly inflict a sting the device at all event shew that the honey-maker have get worse than nothing by he honey and the house of este could not say they have do any thing to contradict it i think it probable that neither the poet 's device nor the cardinal 's speech be forget when in the course of the next year the party come to a rupture in consequence of the servant 's refuse to attend he master into hungary ariosto excuse himself on account of the state of he health and of he family he say that a cold climate do not agree with he that he chest be affect and could not bear even the stove of hungary and that he could not in common decency and humanity leave he mother in she old age especially as all the rest of the family be away but he youngest sister whose interest he have also to take care of but ippolito be not to be appease the public have see in a late female biography a deplorable instance of the unfeelingness with which even a princess with a reputation for religion could treat the decline health and unwilling retirement of a poor slave in she service fifty time she superior in every thing but servility greater delicacy be not to be expect of the military priest the nobler the servant the greater the desire to trample upon he and keep he at a disadvantage it be a grudge which rank owe to genius and which it can only wave when its possessor be himself one of god almighty 's gentleman i do not mean in point of genius which be by no mean the highest thing in the world whatever its owner may think of it but in point of the highest of all thing which be nobleness of heart i confess i think ariosto be wrong in expect what he do of a man he must have know so well and in complain so much of court however good-humouredly a prince occupy the station he do to avert the peril of dispute succession and not to be what he birth can not make he -- if nature have not supply the material besides the cardinal in he quality of a mechanical-minded man with no taste might with reason have complain of he servant 's attend to poetry when it be not in he bond when it divert he from the only attention which he employer understand or desire ippolito candidly confess as ariosto himself tell we that he not only do not care for poetry but never give he attendant one stiver in patronage of it or for any thing whatsoever but go he journey and do as he be bid -lrb- 17 -rrb- on the other hand the cardinal 's payment be sorry one and the poet might with justice have think that he be not bind to consider they a equivalent for the time be be expect to give up the only thing to have be desire in this case be that he should have say so and in truth at the close of the explanation which he give on the subject to he friend at court he do -- boldly desire they as become he to tell the cardinal that if he eminence expect he to be a serf for what he receive he should decline the bargain and that he prefer the humblest freedom and he study to a slavery so preposterous -lrb- 18 -rrb- the truth be the poet should have attach himself wholly to the medicus have he not adhere to the duller house he might have lead as happy a life with the pope as pulcus do with the pope 's father perhaps have be make a cardinal like he friend bembo and sadolet but then we might have lose the _ orlando _ the only sinecure which the poet be now suppose to have retain be a grant of twenty-five crown every four month on the episcopal chancery of milan : so to help out he petty income he proceed to enter into the service of alfonso which shew that both the brother be not angry with he he tell we that he would gladly have have no new master could he have help it but that if he must need serve he would rather serve the master of every body else than a subordinate one at this juncture he have a brief prospect of be as free as he wish for a uncle die leave a large land property still know as the ariosto land -lrb- _ le arioste _ -rrb- but a convent demand it on the part of one of they brotherhood who be a natural son of this gentleman and a more formidable and ultimately successful claim be advance in a court of law by the chamber of the duchy of ferrara the first judge in the cause be the duke 's own steward and a personal enemy of the poet 's ariosto therefore while the suit be go on be oblige to content himself with he fee from milan and a monthly allowance which he receive from the duke of about thirty-eight shilling together with provision for three servant and two horse he enter the duke 's service in the spring of 1518 and remain in it for the rest of he life but it be not so burden-some as that of the cardinal and the consequence of the poet 's greater leisure be a second edition of the _ furioso _ in the year 1521 with addition and correction still however in forty canto only it appear by a deed of agreement -lrb- 19 -rrb- that the work be print at the author 's expense that he be to sell the bookseller one hundred copy for sixty livre -lrb- about 5_l _ 12_s _ -rrb- on condition of the book 's not be sell at the rate of more than sixteen sous -lrb- 1_s _ 8_d _ -rrb- that the author be not to give sell or allow to be sell any copy of the book at ferrara except by the bookseller that the bookseller after dispose of the hundred copy be to have as many more as he choose on the same term and that on he fail to require a further supply ariosto be to be at liberty to sell he volume to whom he please with such profit observe panizzus it be not likely that the poet would soon become independent and it may be add that he certainly get nothing by the first edition whatever he may have do by the second he expressly tell we in the satire which he write on decline to go abroad with ippolito that all he poetry have not procure he money enough to purchase a cloak -lrb- 20 -rrb- twenty year afterwards when he be dead the poem be in such request that between 1542 and 1551 panizzus calculate there must have be a sale of it in europe to the amount of a hundred thousand copy -lrb- 21 -rrb- the second edition of the _ furioso _ do not extricate the author from very serious difficulty for the next year he be compel to apply to either to relieve he from he necessity or permit he to look for some employment more profitable than the ducal service the answer of this prince who be now rich but have always be penurious and who never lay out a farthing if he could help it except in defense of he capital be a appointment of ariosto to the government of a district in a state of anarchy call garfagnana which have nominally return to he rule in consequence of the death of leo who have wrest it from he it be a wild spot in the apennine on the border of the ferrarese and papal territory ariosto be there three year and be say to have reduce it to order but accord to he own account he have very doubtful work of it the place be overrun with bandit include the troops commission to suppress they it require a severer governor than he be incline to be and alfonso do not attend to he requisition for supplies the candid and good-natured poet intimate that the duke might have give he the appointment rather for the governor 's sake than the people 's and the cold the loneliness and barrenness of the place and above all he absence from the object of he affection oppress he he do not write a verse for twelve month : he say he feel like a bird moulting -lrb- 22 -rrb- the best thing get out of it be a anecdote for posterity the poet be ride out one day with a few attendant -- some say walk out in a fit of absence of mind -- when he find himself in the midst of a band of outlaw who in a suspicious manner barely suffer he to pass a reader of mr radcliffe might suppose they a band of _ condottierus _ under the command of some profligate desperado and such perhaps they be the governor have scarcely go by when the leader of the band discover who he be come ride back with much earnestness and make he obeisance to the poet say that he never should have allow he to pass in that manner have he know he to be the signor ludovico ariosto author of the _ orlando furioso _ that he own name be filippo pacchione -lrb- a celebrated personage of he order -rrb- and that he man and himself so far from do the signor displeasure would have the honor of conduct he back to he castle and so they do say barettus entertaining he all along the way with the various excellence they have discern in he poem and bestow upon it the most rapturous praise -lrb- 23 -rrb- on he return from garfagnana ariosto be understand to have make several journey in italy either with or without the duke he master some of they to mantua where it have be say that he be crown with laurel by the emperor charle the fifth but the truth seem to be that he only receive a laureate diploma : it do not appear that charle make he any other gift he majesty and the whole house of este and the pope and all the other italian prince leave that to be do by the imperial general the celebrated alfonso davallo marquess of vasto to whom he be send on some mission by the duke of ferrara and who settle on he a annuity of a hundred golden ducat the only reward say panizzus which we find to have be confer on ariosto expressly as a poet -lrb- 24 -rrb- davallo be one of the conqueror of franci the first young and handsome and himself a writer of verse the grateful poet accordingly avail himself of he benefactor 's accomplishment to make he in turn a present of every virtue under the sun cæsar be not so liberal nestor so wise achille so potent nireus so beautiful nor even lada alexander 's messenger so swift -lrb- 25 -rrb- ariosto be now verge towards the grave and he probably see in the hundred ducat a golden sunset of he care meantime however the poet have build a house which although small be raise with he own money so that the second edition of the _ orlando _ may have realize some profit at last he record the pleasant fact in a inscription over the door which have become celebrated : parva sed apta mihi sed nulli obnoxia sed non sordida parta meo sed taman acre domus small yet it suit I be of no offence be build not meanly at my own expense what a pity -lrb- to compare great thing with small -rrb- that he have not as long a life before he to enjoy it as gil bla have with he own comfortable quotation over he retreat at liria -lrb- 26 -rrb- the house still remain but the inscription unfortunately become effaced though the follow one remain which be add by he son virginio : sic domus hæc areostea propitio habeat deo olim ut pindarica dear to the god whatever come to pass be ariosto 's house as pindar 's be this be a anticipation -- perhaps the origin -- of milton 's sonnet about he own house address to captain and collonel during the civil war -lrb- 27 -rrb- davallo make the poet he generous present in the October of the year 1513 and in the same month of the year follow the _ orlando _ be publish as it now stand with various insertion throughout chiefly story and six additional canto cardinal ippolito have be dead some time and the device of the beehive be exchange for one of two viper with a hand and pair of shears cut out they tongue and the motto thou hast prefer ill-will to good -lrb- _ dilexistus malitiam super benignitatem _ -rrb- the allusion be understand to have be to certain critic whose name have all perish unless sperone -lrb- of whom we shall hear more by and by -rrb- be one of they the appearance of this edition be eagerly look for but the trouble of correct the press and the destruction of a theater by fire which have be build under the poet 's direction do he health no good in its rapidly decline condition and after suffer greatly from a obstruction he die much attenuate on the sixth day of June 1533 he decease he fond biographer have tell we take place about three in the afternoon and he be aged fifty-eight year eight month and twenty-eight day he body accord to he direction be take to the church of the benedictine during the night by four man with only two taper and in the most private and simple manner the monk follow it to the grave out of respect contrary to they usual custom so live and so die and so desire humbly to be bury one of the delight of the world he son virginio have erect a chapel in the garden of the house build by he father and he wish to have he body remove thither but the monk would not allow it the tomb at first a very humble one be subsequently altered and enriched several time but remain i believe as rebuilt at the beginning of the century before last by he grand-nephew ludovico ariosto with a bust of the poet and two statue represent poetry and glory ariosto be tall and stout with a dark complexion bright black eye black and curling hair aquiline nose and shoulder broad but a little stoop he aspect be thoughtful and he gesture deliberate titian besides paint he portrait design that which appear in the woodcut of the author 's own third edition of he poem which have be copy into mr panizzus 's it have all the look of truth of that great artist 's vital hand but though there be a expression of the genial character of the mouth notwithstanding the exuberance of beard it do not suggest the sweetness observable in one of the medal of ariosto a wax impression of which be now before I nor have the nose so much delicacy and grace -lrb- 28 -rrb- the poet 's temperament incline he to melancholy but he intercourse be always cheerful one biographer say he be strong and healthy -- another that he be neither in all probability he be naturally strong but weaken by a life full of emotion he talk of grow old at forty four and of leave be bald for some time -lrb- 29 -rrb- he have a cough for many year before he die he son say he cure it by drink good old wine ariosto say that vin fumoso do not agree with he but that might only mean wine of a heady sort the chance under such circumstance be probably against wine of any kind and panizzus think the cough be never subdue he physician forbid he all sort of stimulant with he food -lrb- 30 -rrb- he temper and habit be those of a man wholly give up to love and poetry in he youth he be volatile and at no time without what be call some affair of the heart every woman attract he who have modesty and agreeableness and as at the same time he be very jealous one might imagine that he wife who have a right to be equally so would have lead no easy life but it be evident he could practice very generous self-denial and probably the married portion of he existence suppose alessandra 's sweet countenance not to have belie she be happy on both side he be beloved by he family which be never the case with the unamiable among he friend be most of the great name of the age include a world of lady and the whole graceful court of guidobaldo da montefeltro duke of urbino for which catiglione write he book of the _ gentleman -lrb- il cortegiano -rrb- _ raphael address he a sonnet and titian paint he likeness he know vittorium colonna and veronica da gambera and giulium gonzaga -lrb- whom the turk would have run away with -rrb- and ippolita sforza the beautiful blue-stocking who set bandello on write he novel and bembo and flaminio and bernus and molza and sannazzaro and the medicus family and vida and macchiavellus and nobody doubt that he might have shine at the court of leo the brightest of the bright but he think it better to enjoy a little in peace than seek after much with trouble -lrb- 31 -rrb- he care for none of the pleasure of the great except building and that he be content to satisfy in cowley 's fashion with a small house in a large garden he be plain in he diet dislike ceremony and be frequently absorb in think he indignation be rouse by mean and brutal vice but he take a large and liberal view of human nature in general and if he be somewhat free in he life must be pardon for the custom of the time for he charity to other and for the genial disposition which make he a enchanting poet above all he be a affectionate son live like a friend with he child and in spite of he tendency to pleasure supply the place of a anxious and careful father to he brother and sister who idolize he ornabat pieta et grata modestia vatem write he brother gabriel sanctum fide dictique memor munitaque recto justitium et nullo patientia victa labore et constans virtus animi et elementia mitis ambitione procul pulsa fastûsque tumore credere utus poss natum felicibus hori felicus fulgente astro jovi atque dione -lrb- 32 -rrb- devoted tenderness adorn would the bard and grateful modesty and grave regard to he least word and justice arm would with right and patience counting every labor light and constancy of soul and meekness too that neither pride nor worldly wish know you might have think he bear when there concur the sweet star and the strong venus and jupiter he son virginio and other have leave a variety of anecdote corroborate point in he character i shall give they all for they put we into he company it be record as a instance of he reputation for honesty that a old kinsman a clergyman who be afraid of be poison for he possession would trust himself in no other hand but the clergyman be he own grand-uncle and namesake probably godfather so that the compliment be not so very great in he youth he undergo a long rebuke one day from he father without say a word though a satisfactory answer be in he power on which he brother gabriel express he surprise he say that he be think all the time of a scene in a comedy he be write for which the paternal lecture afford a excellent study he love gardening better than he understand it be always shift he plant and destroy the seed out of impatience to see they germinate he be rejoice once on the come up of some caper which he have be visit every day to see how they get on when it turn out that he caper be elder-tree he be perpetually alter he verse he manuscript be full of correction he write the exordium of the _ orlando _ over and over again and at last could only be satisfy with it in proportion as it be not he own that be to say in proportion as it come nearer to the beautiful passage in dante from which he ear and he feeling have catch it -lrb- 33 -rrb- he however discover that correction be not always improvement he use to say it be with verse as with tree a plant naturally well grow might be make perfect by a little delicate treatment but over-cultivation destroy its native grace in like manner you might perfect a happily-inspired verse by take away any little fault of expression but too great a polish deprive it of the charm of the first conception it be like over-train a naturally graceful child if it be wonder how he who correct so much should succeed so well even to a appearance of happy negligence it be to be consider that the most impulsive writer often put down they thought too hastily then correct and re-correct they in the same impatient manner and so have to bring they round by as many step to the feeling which they really have at first though they be too hasty to do it justice ariosto would have alter he house as often as he verse but do not find it so convenient somebody wonder that he contented himself with so small a abode when he build such magnificent mansion in he poetry he say it be easier to put word together than block of stone -lrb- 34 -rrb- he like virgil commend the style of tibullus do not care for propertius but express high approbation of catullus and horace i suspect he favorite to have be ovid he son say he do not study much nor look after book but this may have be in he decline or when virginio first take to observe he a different conclusion as to study be to be draw from the correct state of he manuscript and the variety of he knowledge and with regard to book he not only mention the library of the vatican as one of he greatest temptation to visit rome but describe himself with all the gusto of a book-worm as enjoy they in he chimney-corner -lrb- 35 -rrb- to intimate he secrecy in love-matter he have a inkstand with a cupid on it hold a finger on he lip i believe it be still in existence -lrb- 36 -rrb- he do not disclose he mistress ' name as dante do for the purpose of treat they with contempt nor on the other hand do he appear to have be so indiscriminately gallant as to be fond of goitre -lrb- 37 -rrb- the only mistress of whom he complain he conceal in a latin appellation and of she he do not complain with scorn he have love besides alessandra benuccus a lady of the name of ginevra the mother of one of he child be record as a certain orsolina and that of the other be name marium and be understand to have be a governess in he father 's family -lrb- 38 -rrb- he eat fast and of whatever be next he often begin with the bread on the table before the dish come and he would finish he dinner with another bit of bread appetiva le rape say he good son videlicet he be fond of turnip in he fourth satire he mention as a favorite dish turnip seasoned with vinegar and boil _ must _ -lrb- sapa -rrb- which seem not unjustifiably to startle mr panizzus -lrb- 39 -rrb- he care so little for good eating that he say of himself he should have do very well in the day when people live on acorn a stranger come in one day at the dinner-hour he eat up what be provide for both say afterwards when tell of it that the gentleman should have take care of himself this do not look very polite but of course it be say in jest he son attribute this carelessness at table to absorption in he study he carry this absence of mind so far and be at the same time so good a pedestrian that virginio tell we he once walk all the way from carpus to ferrara in he slipper owe to he have stroll out of door in that direction the same biographer who describe he as a brave soldier add that he be a timid horseman and seaman and indeed he appear to have eschew every kind of unnecessary danger it be a maxim of he to be the last in go out of a boat i know not what orlando would have say to this but there be no doubt that the good son and brother avoid no pain in pursuit of he duty he more than once risk he life in the service of government from the peril of travel among war-maker and bandit imagination find something worthy of itself on great occasion but be apt to discover the absurdity of stake existence on small one ariosto do not care to travel out of italy he prefer he say go round the earth in a map visit country without have to pay innkeeper and plough harmless sea without thunder and lightning -lrb- 40 -rrb- he outward religion like the one he ascribe to he friend cardinal bembo be that of other people he do not think it of use to disturb they belief yet excuse rather than blame luther attribute he heresy to the necessary consequence of moot point too subtle for human apprehension -lrb- 41 -rrb- he find it impossible however to restrain he contempt of bigotry and like most great writer in catholic country be a derider of the pretension of devotee and the discord and hypocrisy of the convent he evidently laugh at dante 's figment about the other world not at the poetry of they for that he admire and sometimes imitate but at the superstition and presumption he turn the florentine 's moon into a depository of non-sense and find no hell so bad as the heart of tyrant the only other people he put into the infernal region be lady who be cruel to they lover he have a noble confidence in the intention of he creator and die ill the expectation of meet he friend again in a higher state of existence of ariosto 's four brother one become a courtier at naple another a clergyman another a envoy to the emperor charle the fifth and the fourth who be a cripple and a scholar live with lodovico and celebrate he memory he two son whose name be virginio and gianbattista and who be illegitimate -lrb- the reader be always to bear in mind the more indulgent custom of italy in matter of this nature especially in the poet 's time -rrb- become the first a canon in the cathedral of ferrara and the other a officer in the army it do not appear that he have any other child ariosto 's renown be wholly found on the _ orlando furioso _ though he write satire comedy and a good deal of miscellaneous poetry all occasionally exhibit a master-hand the comedy however be unfortunately model on those of the ancient and the constant termination of the verse with trisyllable contribute to render they tedious what comedy might he not have write have he give himself up to exist time and manners -lrb- 42 -rrb- the satire be rather good-natured epistle to he friend write with a charming ease and straightforwardness and contain much exquisite sense and interesting autobiography on he lyrical poetry he set little value and he latin verse be not of the best order critic have express they surprise at its inferiority to that of contemporary inferior to he in genius but the reason lay in the very circumstance i mean that he large and liberal inspiration could only find its proper vent in he own language he could not be content with pot up little delicacy in old-fashioned vessel the _ orlando furioso _ be literally a continuation of the _ orlando innamorato _ so much so that the story be not thoroughly intelligible without it this be probably the reason of a circumstance that would be otherwise unaccountable and that be ridiculously charge against he as a proof of despairing envy by the despairing envy of sperone namely he never have once mention the name of he predecessor if ariosto have despair of equal boiardo he must have be hopeless of reach posterity in which case he silence must have be useless and in any case it be clear that he look on himself as the continuator of another 's narration but boiardo be so popular when he write that the very silence shew he must have think the mention of he name superfluous still it be curious that he never should have allude to it in the course of the poem it could not have be from any dislike to the name itself or the family for in he latin poem he have eulogise the hospitality of the house of boiardo -lrb- 43 -rrb- the _ furioso _ continue not only what boiardo do but what he intend to do for as its subject be orlando 's love and knight-errantry in general so its object be to extol the house of este and deduce it from its fabulous ancestor ruggiero orlando be the open ruggiero the covert hero and almost all the incident of this suppose irregular poem which as panizzus have shewn be one of the most regular in the world go to crown with triumph and wedlock the originator of that unworthy race this be do on the old groundwork of charlemagne and he paladin of the treachery of the house of gan of maganza and of the war of the saracen against christendom bradamante the amazonian _ intend _ of ruggiero be of the same race as orlando and a great overthrower of infidel ruggiero begin with be a infidel himself and be keep from the war like a second achille by the device of a anxious guardian but ultimately fight be convert and marry and orlando all the while slay he thousand as of old love go mad for jealousy be the foolishest and wisest of mankind -lrb- somewhat like the poet himself -rrb- and crown the glory of ruggiero not only by be present at he marriage but put on he spur with he own hand when he go forth to conclude the war by the death of the king of algier the great charm however of the _ orlando furioso _ be not in its knight-errantry or its main plot or the cunning interweavement of its minor one but in its endless variety truth force and animal spirit in its fidelity to actual nature while it keep within the bound of the probable and its no less enchanting verisimilitude during its wildest sally of imagination at one moment we be in the midst of flesh and blood like ourselves at the next with fairy and goblin at the next in a tremendous battle or tempest then in one of the loveliest of solitude then hear a tragedy then a comedy then mystify in some enchanted palace then ride dancing dining look at picture then again descend to the depths of the earth or soar to the moon or see lover in a glade or witness the extravagance of the great jealous hero orlando and the music of a enchanting style perpetually attend we and the sweet face of angelica glance here and there like a bud : and there be gallantry of all kind and story endless and honest tear and joyous burst of laughter and bearding for all base opinion and no bigotry and reverence for whatsoever be venerable and candor exquisite and the happy interwoven name of angelica and medoro young for ever but so great a work be not to be dismiss with a mere rhapsody of panegyric ariosto be inferior in some remarkable respects to he predecessor pulcus and boiardo he character for the most part do not interest we as much as theirs by they variety and good fellowship he invent none as boiardo do with the exception indeed of orlando 's as modify by jealousy and he have no passage i thick equal in pathos to that of the struggle at roncesvalle for though orlando 's jealousy be pathetic as well as appalling the effect of it be confine to one person and dispute by he excessive strength ariosto have take all tenderness out of angelica except that of a kind of boarding-school first love -lrb- which however as here-after intimate may have simplify and improve she general effect -rrb- and he have omit all that be amusing in the character of astolfo knight-errantry have fall off a little in he hand from its first youthful and trusting freshness more sophisticate time be open upon we and satire more frequently and bitterly interfere the licentious passage -lrb- though never gross in word like those of he contemporary -rrb- be not redeem by sentiment as in boiardo and it seem to I that ariosto hardly improve so much as he might have do upon he predecessor 's imitation of the classic i can not help think that upon the whole he have better have leave they alone and depend entirely on himself shelley say he have too much fighting and revenge -lrb- 44 -rrb- -- which be true but the revenge be only among he knight he be himself -lrb- like my admirable friend -rrb- one of the most forgiving of man and the fighting be the taste of the age in which chivalry be still flourish in the shape of such man as bayard and ferocity in man like gaston de foix ariosto certainly do not anticipate any more than shakspeare do that spirit of human amelioration which have ennoble the present age he think only of reflect nature as he find it he be sometimes even as uninteresting as he find other people but the tiresome passage thank god all belong to the house of este he panegyric of ippolito and he ancestor recoil on the poet with a retributive dulness but in all the rest there be a wonderful invigoration and enlargement the genius of romance have increase to a extraordinary degree in power if not in simplicity its shoulder have grow broader its voice louder and more sustained and if it have lose a little on the sentimental side it have gain prodigiously not only in animal vigor but above all in knowledge of human nature and a brave and joyous candor in shew it the poet take a universal a acute and upon the whole a cheerful view like the sun itself of all which the sun look on and reader be charm to see a knowledge at once so keen and so happy herein lie the secret of ariosto 's greatness which be great not because it have the intensity of dante or the incessant thought and passion of shakspeare or the dignified imagination of milton to all of whom he be far inferior in sustained excellence -- but because he be like very nature herself whether great small serious pleasureable or even indifferent he still have the life ease and beauty of the operation of the daily planet even where he seem dull and common-place he brightness and originality at other time make it look like a good-natured condescension to we own common habit of thought and discourse as though he do it but on purpose to leave nothing unsaid that could bring he within the category of ourselves he charming manner intimate that instead of take thought he choose to take pleasure with we and compare old note and we be delighted that he do we so much honor and make as it be ariosto of we all he be shakspearian in go all length with nature as he find she not blinking the fact of evil yet find a soul of goodness in it and at the same time never compromise the worth of noble and generous quality he young and handsome medoro be a pitiless slayer of he enemy but they be he master 's enemy and he would have lose he life even to preserve he dead body he orlando for all he wisdom and greatness run mad for love of a coquette who triumph over warrior and king only to fall in love herself with a obscure lad he king laugh with all they heart like common people he mourner weep like such unaffected child of sorrow that they must need swallow some of they tear -lrb- 45 -rrb- he hero on the arrival of intelligence that excite they leap out of bed and write letter before they dress from natural impatience think nothing of they dignity when astolfo blow the magic horn which drive every body out of the castle of atlas not a mouse stay behind -- not as hoole and such critic think because the poet be here write ludicrously but because he use the same image seriously to give a idea of desolation as shakspeare in _ hamlet _ do to give that of silence when not a mouse be stir instead of be mere comic write such incident be in the highest epic taste of the meeting of extreme -- of the impartial eye with which nature regard high and low so give ariosto he hippogriff and other marvel with which he have enrich the stock of romance and nature take as much care of the verisimilitude of they action as if she have make they herself he hippogriff return like a common horse to the stable to which he have be accustom he enchanter who be gifted with the power of survive decapitation and pursue the decapitator so long as a fate hair remain on he head turn deadly pale in the face when it be scalp and fall lifeless from he horse he truth indeed be so genuine and at the same time he style be so unaffected sometimes so familiar in its grace and set we so much at ease in he company that the familiarity be in danger of bring he into contempt with the inexperienced and the truth of be consider old and obvious because the mode of its introduction make it seem a old acquaintance when voltaire be a young man and -lrb- to anglicise a favorite gallic phrase -rrb- fancy he have _ profounded _ every thing deep and know he think nothing of ariosto some year afterwards he take he for the first of grotesque writer but nothing more at last he pronounce he equally entertaining and sublime and humbly apologise for he error foscolo quote this passage from the _ dictionnaire philosophique _ and add another from sir joshua reynold in which the painter speak of a similar inability on he own part when young to enjoy the perfect nature of raphael and the admiration and astonishment which in he riper year he grow to feel for it -lrb- 46 -rrb- the excessive wildness attribute to ariosto be not wilder than many thing in homer or even than some thing in virgil -lrb- such as the transformation of ship into sea-nymph -rrb- the reason why it have be think so be that he render they more popular by mix they with satire and thus bring they more universally into notice one main secret of the delight they give we be they be poetical comment as it be on fancy and metaphor of we own thus we say of a suspicious man that he be suspicion itself ariosto turn he accordingly into a actual being of that name we speak of the flight of the poet ariosto make they literally flight -- flight on a hippogriff and to the moon the moon it have be say make lunatic he accordingly put a man 's wit into that planet vice deform beauty therefore he beautiful enchantress turn out to be a old hag ancient defeat empire be sound and emptiness therefore the assyrian and persian monarchy become in he limbo of vanity a heap of positive bladder youth be headstrong and kissing go by favor so angelica queen of cathay and beauty of the world jilt warrior and king and marry a common soldier and what a creature be this angelica what effect have she not have upon the world in spite of all she fault nay probably by very reason of they i know not whether it have be remark before but it appear to I that the charm which every body have feel in the story of angelica consist mainly in that very fact of she be nothing but a beauty and a woman dash even with coquetry which render she so inferior in character to most heroine of romance she interest be found on nothing exclusive or prejudiced it be not address to any special class she might or might not have be like by this person or that but the world in general will adore she because nature have make they to adore beauty and the sex apart from prejudice right or wrong youth will attribute virtue to she whether she have they or not middle-age be unable to help gaze on she old-age dote on she she be womankind itself in form and substance and that be a stronger thing for the most part than all we figment about it two musical name angelica and medoro have become identify in the mind of poetical reader with the honeymoon of youthful passion the only false acid insipid fiction i can call to mind in the _ orlando furioso _ be that of the swan who rescue medal from the river of oblivion -lrb- canto xxxv -rrb- it betray a singular forgetfulness of the poet 's wonted verisimilitude for what metaphor can reconcile we to swan take a interest in medal popular belief have make they singer but it be not a wise step to convert they into antiquary ariosto 's animal spirit and the brilliant hurry and abundance of he incident blind a careless reader to he endless particular beauty which though he may too often describe instead of paint -lrb- on account as foscolo say of he write to the many -rrb- spew that no man could paint better when he choose the bosom of he female come and go like the wave on the sea-coast in summer air -lrb- 47 -rrb- he witch draw the fish out of the water with simple word and a pure warble spell -lrb- 48 -rrb- he borrow the word painting itself -- like a true italian and friend of raphael and titian to express the commiseration in the face of the blest for the suffering of mortality dipinte di pietade il viso pio -lrb- 49 -rrb- they pious look paint with tenderness jesus be very finely call in the same passage il sempiterno amante the eternal lover the female sex be the schiera gentil the pur adorna il mondo -lrb- 50 -rrb- the gentle bevy that adorn the world he paint cabinet-picture like spenser in isolate stanza with a pencil at once solid and light as in the instance of the charming one that tell the story of mercury and he net how he watch the goddess of flower as she issue forth at dawn with she lap full of rose and violet and so throw the net over she one day and take she un dì lo prese -lrb- 51 -rrb- but he do not confine himself to these gentle picture he have many as strong as michael angelo some as intense as dante he paint the conquest of america in five word veggio da diece cacciar mille -lrb- 52 -rrb- i see thousand hunt by ten he compare the noise of a tremendous battle hear in the neighborhood to the sound of the cataract of the nile : un alto suon ch ' a quel s ' accorda con che i vicin ' cadendo il nil assorda -lrb- 53 -rrb- he scourge ship at sea with tempest -- say rather the miserable seaman while night-time grow blacker and blacker on the exasperated water -lrb- 54 -rrb- when rodomont have plunge into the thick of pari and be carry every thing before he -lrb- like a serpent that have newly cast he skin and go shake he three tongue under he eye of fire -rrb- he make this tremendous hero break the middle of the palace-gate into a huge window and look through it with a countenance which be suddenly behold by a crowd of face as pale as death : e dentro fatto l' ha tanta finestra che ben vedere e veduto esser puote dai visi impressi di color di morte -lrb- 55 -rrb- the whole description of orlando 's jealousy and grow madness be shakspearian for passion and circumstance as the reader may see even in the prose abstract of it in this volume and he sublimation of a suspicious king into suspicion itself -lrb- which it also contain -rrb- be as grandly and felicitously audacious as any thing ever invent by poet spenser think so and have imitate and emulate it in one of he own finest passage ariosto have not the spleen and gall of dante and therefore he satire be not so tremendous yet it be very exquisite as all the world have acknowledge in the instance of the lose thing find in the moon and the angel who find discord in a convent he do not take thing so much to heart as chaucer he have nothing so profoundly pathetic as we great poet 's _ griselda _ yet many a gentle eye have moisten at the conclusion of the story of isabellum and to recur once more to orlando 's jealousy all who have experience that passion will feel it shake they i have read somewhere of a visit pay to voltaire by a italian gentleman who recite it to he and who -lrb- be move perhaps by the recollection of some passage in he own history -rrb- have the tear all the while pour down he cheek such be the poem which the gracious and good cardinal ippolito designate as a parcel of trumpery it have indeed to contend with more slight than he like all original it be oblige to wait for the death of the envious and the self-loving before it acquire a popularity which surpass all precedent foscolo say that macchiavellus and ariosto the two writer of that age who really possess most excellence be the least praise during they life bembo be approach in a posture of adoration and fear the infamous aretino extort a fulsome letter of praise from the great and the learn -lrb- 56 -rrb- he might have add that the writer most in request in the circle be a gentleman of the name of bernardo accoltus then call the _ unique _ now never hear of ariosto himself eulogise he among a shoal of writer half of whose name have perish and who most likely include in that half the man who think he do not praise they enough for such be the fact i allude to the charming invention in he last canto in which he suppose himself welcome home after a long voyage gay imitate it very pleasantly in a address to pope on the conclusion of he homer some of the person thus honor by ariosto be vex it be say at not be praise highly enough other at see so many praise in they company some at be leave out of the list and some other at be mention at all these silly people think it take too great a liberty the poor fly of a day do not know that a god have take they in hand to give they wing for eternity happily for they the name of most of these mighty personage be not know one or two however take care to make posterity laugh trissino a very great man in he day and the would-be restorer of the ancient epic have the face in return for the poet 's too honorable mention of he to speak in he own absurd verse of ariosto with that _ furioso _ of he which please the vulgar : l' ariosto con quel _ furioso _ suo the piace al volgo _ he _ poem add panizzus have the merit of not have please any body -lrb- 57 -rrb- a sullen critic sperone -lrb- the same that afterwards plague tasso -rrb- be so disappointed at be leave out that he become the poet 's bitter enemy he talk of ariosto take himself for a swan and die like a

small meadow full of daisy and butter-cup and surround with tree there be a air abroad notwithstanding the heat which make the shepherd glad to sit without they jerkin and receive the coolness on they naked body : even the hard-skinned cattle be glad of it and orlando who be arm _ cap-a-pie _ be delighted to take off he helmet and lay aside he buckler and repose awhile in the midst of a scene so refreshing alas it be the unhappiest moment of he life cast he eye around he while about to get off he horse he observe a handwriting on many of the tree which he think he know ride up to the tree and look more closely he be sure he know it and in truth it be no other than that of he adored mistress angelica and the inscription one of those numerous inscription of which i have speak the spot be one of the haunt of the lover while they abide in the shepherd 's cottage wherever the county turn he eye he behold tie together in true-lover ' knot nothing but the word angelica and medoro all the tree have they -- he eye could see nothing else and every letter be a dagger that pierce he heart the unhappy lover try in vain to disbelieve what he see he endeavor to compel himself to think that it be some other angelica who have write the word but he know the handwriting too well too often have he dwell upon it and make himself familiar with every turn of the letter he then strive to fancy that medoro be a feigned name intend for himself but he feel that he be try to delude himself and that the more he try the bitterer be he conviction of the truth he be like a bird fix itself only the more deeply in the lime in which it be catch by struggle and beat its wing orlando turn he horse away in he anguish and pace it towards a grotto cover with vine and ivy which he look into the grotto both outside and in be full of the like inscription it be the retreat the lover be so fond of at noon they name be write on all side of it some in chalk and coal -lrb- 17 -rrb- other carve with a knife the wretched beholder get off he horse and enter the grotto the first thing that meet he eye be a larger inscription in the saracen lover 's own handwriting and tongue -- a language which the slayer of the infidel be too well acquaint with the word be in verse and express the gratitude of the poor medoro the writer for have have in he arm in that grotto the beautiful angelica daughter of king galafron whom so many have love in vain the writer invoke a blessing on every part of it its shades its water its flower its creep plant and entreated every person high and low who should chance to visit it particularly lover that they would bless the place likewise and take care that it be never polluted by foot of herd thrice and four time do the unhappy orlando read these word try always but in vain to disbelieve what he see every time he read they appear plainer and plainer and every time do a cold hand seem to be wring the heart in he bosom at length he remain with he eye fix on the stone see nothing more not even the stone itself he feel as if he wit be leave he so abandon do he seem of all comfort let those imagine what he feel who have experience the same emotion -- who know by they own suffering that this be the grief which surpass all other grief he head have fall on he bosom he look be deprive of all confidence he could not even speak or shed a tear he impetuous grief remain within he by reason of he impetuosity -- like water which attempt to rush out of the narrow-necked bottle but which be so compress as it come that it scarcely issue drop by drop again he endeavor to disbelieve he eye -- to conclude that somebody have wish to calumniate he mistress and drive she lover mad and so have do he best to imitate she handwriting with these sorry attempt at consolation he again take horse the sun have now give way to the moon and so ride a little onward till he behold smoke rise out of the top of the tree and hear the bark of dog and the lowing of cattle by these sign he know that he be approach a village he enter it and go into the first house he come to give he horse to the care of a youth and be disarm and have he spur of gold take off and so go into a room that be shewn he without demand either meat or drink so entirely be he fill with he sorrow now it happen that this be the very cottage into which medoro have be carry out of the wood by the loving angelica there he have be cure of he wound -- there he have be love and make happy -- and there wherever the county orlando turn he eye he behold the detest write on the wall the window the door he make no inquiry about it of the people of the house : he still dread to render the certainty clearer than he would fain suppose it but the cowardice avail he nothing for the host see he unhappy and think to cheer he come in as he be get into bed and open on the subject of he own accord it be a story be tell to every body who come and he be accustom to have it admire so with little preface he relate all the particulars to he new guest -- how the youth have be leave for dead on the field and how the lady have find he and have he bring to the cottage -- and how she fall in love with he as he grow well -- and how she could be content with nothing but marry he though she be daughter of the greatest king of the east and a queen herself at the conclusion of he narrative the good man produce the bracelet which have be give he by angelica as evidence of the truth of all that he have be say this be the final stroke the last fatal blow give to the poor hope of orlando by the executioner love he try to conceal he misery but it be no longer to be repress so find the tear rush into he eye he desire to be alone as soon as the man have retire he let they flow in passion and agony in vain he attempt to rest much less to sleep every part of the bed appear to be make of stone and thorn at length it occur to he that most likely they have sleep in that very bed he rise instantly as if he have be lie on a serpent the bed the house the herdsman every thing about the place give he such horror and detestation that without wait for dawn or the light of moon he dress himself and go forth and take he horse from the stable and galloped onward into the middle of the wood there as soon as he find himself in the solitude he open all the flood-gate of he grief and give way to cry and outcry but he still ride on day and night do orlando ride on weep and lament he avoid town and city and make he bed on the hard earth and wonder at himself that he could weep so long these think he be no tear that be thus pour forth they be life itself the fountain of vitality and i be weep and die both these be no sigh that i thus eternally exhale nature could not supply they they be love himself storm in my heart and at once consume I and keep I alive with he miraculous fire no more -- no more be i the man i seem he that be orlando be dead and bury he ungrateful mistress have slay he i be but the soul divide from he body -- doom to wander here in this misery a example to those that put they trust in love for the wit of the county orlando be go and he wander all night round and round in the wood till he come back to the grotto where medoro have write he triumphant verse madness then indeed fall upon he every particle of he be seem tear up with rage and fury and he draw he mighty sword and hew the grotto and the write till the word fly in piece to the heaven woe to every spot in the place in which be write the name of angelica and medoro woe to the place itself : never again do it afford refuge from the heat of day to sheep or shepherd for not a particle of it remain as it be with arm and sword orlando deface it all the clear and gentle fountain include he hack and hew it inside and out and cut down the branch of the tree that hang over it and tear away the ivy and the vine and root up great bit of earth and stone and fill the sweet water with the rubbish so that it be never clear and sweet again and at the end of he toil not have satisfy or be able to satisfy he soul with the excess of he violence he cast himself on the ground in rage and disdain and lay groan towards the heaven on the ground orlando throw himself and on the ground he remain he eye fix on heaven he lip close in dumbness and thus he continue for the space of three day and three night till he frenzy have mount to such a pitch that it turn against himself he then arise in fury and tear off mail and breastplate and every particle of clothing from he body till humanity be degrade in he heroical person and he become naked as the beast of the field in this condition and he wit quite go sword be forget as well as shield and helm and he tear up fir-tree and ash and begin run through the wood the shepherd hear the cry of the strong man and the crash of the bough come hasten from all quarter to know what it be but when he see they he give they chase and smite to death those whom he reach till the whole country be up in arm though to no purpose for they be seize with such terror that while they threaten and close after he they avoid he he enter cottage and tear away the food from the table and run up the craggy hill and down into the valley and chase beast as well as man tear the fawn and the goat to piece and stuff they flesh into he stomach with fierce will rage and scour onward in this manner he arrive one day at a bridge over a torrent on which the fierce rodomont have fix himself for the purpose of throw any one that attempt to pass it into the water it be a very narrow bridge with scarcely room for two horse but orlando take no heed of its narrowness he dash right forwards against man and steed and force the champion to wrestle with he on foot and wind himself about he with hideous strength he leap backwards with he into the torrent where he leave he and so mount the opposite bank and again rush over the country a more terrible bridge than this be in he way -- even a precipitous pass of frightful height over a valley but still he scour onward throw over it the agonised passenger that dare in they ignorance of he strength to oppose he and so always rush and rage he come down the mountain by the sea-side to barcelona where he cast he eye on the sand and think in he idiot mind to make himself a house in they for coolness and repose and so he grub up the sand and lay himself down in it : and this be the terrible madman whom angelica and medoro see look at they as they be approach the city neither of they know he nor do he know angelica but with a idiot laugh he look at she beauty and like she and come horribly towards she to carry she away shriek she put spur to she horse and flee and medoro in a fury come after the pursuer and smite he but to no purpose the great madman turn round and smite the other 's horse to the ground and so renew he chase after angelica who suddenly regain enough of she wit to recollect the enchanted ring instantly she put it into she lip and disappear but in she hurry she fall from she palfrey and orlando forget she in the instant and mount the poor beast dash off with it over the country till it die and so at last after many dreadful adventure by flood and field he come run into a camp full of he brother paladin who recognize he with tear and all join they force succeed in pull he down and bind he though not without many wound : and by the help of these friend and the special grace of the apostle st john -lrb- as will be tell in another place -rrb- the wit of the champion of the church be restore and he become ashamed of that passion for a infidel beauty which the heavenly power have thus resolve to punish but angelica and medoro pursue the rest of they journey in peace and take ship on the coast of spain for indium and there she crown she bridegroom king of cathay the description of orlando 's jealousy and grow madness be reckon one of the finest thing in italian poetry and very fine it surely be -- as strong as the hero 's strength and sensitive as the heart of man the circumstance be heighten one after the other with the utmost art as well as nature there be a scriptural awfulness in the account of the hero 's become naked and the violent result be tremendous i have not follow orlando into he feat of ultra-supernatural strength the

in which cloridan expose himself to the enemy be inferior to the latin poet 's famous I I -lrb- adsum qui fecus -rrb- in I convertite ferrum I I -lrb- ` tis i who do the deed -rrb- slay I and the reader will agree with panizzus that he be right the circumstance also of euryalus 's bequeath he aged mother to the care of he prince in case he fail in he enterprise be very touching and the main honor both of the invention of the whole episode and its particulars remain with virgil on the other hand the enterprise of the friend in the italian poet which be that of bury they dead master and not merely of communicate with a absent general be more affect though it may be less patriotic the inability of zerbino to kill he when he look on he face be extremely so and as panizzus have shew the adventure be make of importance to the whole story of the poem and be not simply a episode like that in the æneid it serve too in a very particular manner to introduce medoro worthily to the affection of angelica for mere female though she be we should hardly have go along with she passion as we do in a poem of any seriousness have it be found merely on he beauty -rrb- -lrb- footnote 16 : canto xix

like the faithful creature it be to the house of its own master atlante the magician but not long do it remain there -- no nor the house itself nor the magician for the paladin astolfo come with a mighty horn give he by a greater magician the sound of which overthrow all such abode and put to flight whoever hear it and so the house of atlas vanish and the enchanter flee and the paladin take possession of the griffin-horse and ride away with it on farther adventure one of these be the deliverance of senapus king of ethiopium from the visitation of the dreadful harpy of old who come infest he table as they do those of æneas and phineus astolfo drive they with he horse towards the source of the river nile in the mountain of the moon and pursue they with the hippogriff till they enter a

he find it would be impossible to complete he enterprise still he push forward as far as he could especially as he begin to discern in the darkness something that appear to stir with a involuntary

hell but the smoke grow so thick and palpable it be impossible to move a step farther turn about therefore he regain the entrance and have refresh himself in a fountain hard by and re-mount the hippogriff feel a inclination to ascend as high as he possibly could in the air the excessive loftiness of the mountain above the cavern make he think that its top could be at no great distance from the region of the moon and accordingly he push he horse upward and rise and rise till at length he find himself on its table-land it exhibit a region of celestial beauty the flower be like bed of precious stone for color and brightness the grass if you could have bring any to earth would have be find to surpass emerald and the tree whose leaf be no less beautiful be in fruit and flower at once bird of as many color be singing in the branch the murmuring rivulet and dumb lake be more limpid than crystal : a sweet air be for ever stir which reduce the warmth to a gentle temperature and every breath of it bring a odour from flower fruit-tree and herbage all at once which nourish the soul with sweetness -lrb- 5 -rrb- in the middle of this lonely plain be a palace radiant as fire astolfo

vermilion what become of the boast wonder of the world before this the world itself in the comparison appear but a lump of brute and fetid matter -lrb- 6 -rrb- as the paladin approach the vestibule he be meet by a venerable old man clothe in a white gown and red mantle whose beard descend on he bosom and whose aspect announce he as one of the elect of paradise it be st john the evangelist who live in that mansion with enoch and elijah the only three mortal who never taste death for the place as the saint inform he be the terrestrial paradise and the inhabitant be to live there till the

take he into the car which have bear elijah to heaven and four horse redder than fire convey they to the lunar world the mortal visitant be amaze to see in the moon a world resemble he own full of wood and water and contain even city and castle though of a different sort from ours it be strange to find a sphere so large which have seem so petty afar off and no less strange be it to look down on the world he have leave and be compel to knit he brow and look sharply before he could well discern it for it happen at the time to want light -lrb- 8 -rrb- but he guide do not leave he much time to look about he he conduct he with due speed into a valley that contain in one miraculous collection whatsoever have be lose or waste on earth i do not speak only -lrb- say the poet -rrb- of riches and

almighty by we poor sinner there lie the tear and the sigh of lover the hour lose in pastime the leisure of the dull and the intention of the lazy as to desire they be so numerous that they shadow the whole place astolfo go round among the different heap ask what they be he eye be first strike with a huge one of bladder which seem to contain mighty sound and the voice of multitude these he find be the assyrian and persian monarchy together with those of greece and lydium -lrb- 9 -rrb- one heap be nothing but hook of silver and gold which be the present it seem make to patron and great man in hope of a return another consist of snare in the shape of garland the manufacture of parasite other be verse in praise of great lord all make of cricket which have burst themselves with singing chain of gold he see there which be pretended and unhappy love-match and eagle ' claw which be depute authority and pair of bellows which be prince ' favor and overturn city and treasury be treason and conspiracy and serpent with female face that be coiner and thief and all sort of broken bottle which be service render in miserable court a great heap of overturn soup -lrb- 10 -rrb- he find to be alms to the poor which have be delay till the giver 's death he then come to a great mount of flower which once have a sweet smell but now a most rank one this -lrb- _ with submission _ -rrb- be the

thousand and thousand would not complete the list every thing be there which be to be meet with on earth except folly in the raw material for that be never export -lrb- 12 -rrb- there he behold some of he own lost time and deed and yet if nobody have be with he to make he aware of they never would he have recognize they as he -lrb- 13 -rrb- they then arrive at something which none of we ever pray god to bestow for we fancy we possess it in superabundance yet here it be in greater quantity than any thing else in the place -- i mean sense it be a subtle fluid apt to evaporate if not keep closely and here accordingly it be keep in vial of greater or less size the greatest of they all be inscribe with the follow word : the sense of orlando other in like manner exhibit the name of the proper possessor and among they the frank-hearted paladin behold the greater portion of he own but what more astonished he be to see multitude of the vial almost full to the stopper which bear the name of man whom he have suppose to enjoy they sens in perfection some have lose they for love other for glory other for riches other for hope from great man other for stupid conjurer for jewel for painting for all sort of whim there be a heap belong to sophist and astrologer and a still greater to poet -lrb- 14 -rrb- astolfo with leave of the writer of the dark apocalypse take possession of he own he have but to uncork it and set it under he nose and the wit shoot up to its place at once turpin acknowledge that the paladin for a long time afterwards lead the life of a sage man till unfortunately a mistake which he make lose he he brain a second time -lrb- 15 -rrb- the evangelist now present he with the vial contain the wit of orlando and the traveller quit the vale of lose treasure before they return to earth however the good saint chew he guest other curiosity and favor he with many a sage remark particularly on the subject of poet and the neglect of they by court he shew he how foolish it be in prince and other great man not to make friend of those who can immortalise they and observe with singular indulgence that crime themselves might be no hindrance to a good name with posterity if the poet be but feed well enough for spice to embalm the criminal he instance the case of homer and virgil you be not to take for grant say he that æneas be so pious as fame report he or achille and hector so brave thousand and thousand of warrior have excel they but they descendent bestow fine house and estate on great writer and it be from they honor page that all the glory have proceed augustus be no such religious or clement prince as the trumpet of virgil have proclaim he it be he good taste in poetry that get he pardon he iniquitous proscription nero himself might have fare as well as augustus have he possess as much wit heaven and earth might have be he enemy to no purpose have he known how to keep friend with good author homer make the greek victorious the trojan a poor set and penelope undergo a thousand wrong rather than be unfaithful to she husband and yet if you would have the real truth of the matter the greek be beat and the trojan the conqueror and penelope be a -- -lrb- 16 -rrb- see on the other hand what infamy have become the portion of dido she be honest to she heart 's core and yet because virgil be no friend of hers she be look upon as a baggage be not surprised conclude the good saint if i have express myself with warmth on this subject i love writer and look upon they cause as my own for i be a writer myself when i live among you and i succeed so well in the vocation that time and death will never prevail against I just therefore be it that i should be thankful to my beloved master who procure I so great a lot i grieve for writer who have fall on evil time -- man that with pale and hungry face find the door of courtesy close against all they hardship this be the reason there be so few poet now and why nobody care to study why should he study the very beast abandon place where there be nothing to feed they at these word the eye of the bless old man grow so inflamed with anger that they sparkle like two fire but he presently suppress what he feel and turn with a sage and gracious smile to the paladin prepare to accompany he back to earth with he wonted serenity he accordingly do so in the sacred car : and astolfo after receive he gentle benediction descend on he hippogriff from the mountain and join the delighted paladin with the vial he wit be restore as you have hear to the noble orlando the figure which be here cut by st john give this remarkable satire a most remarkable close he association of himself with the fraternity of author be think a little strong by ariosto 's contemporary the lesson read to the house of este be obvious and could hardly have be pleasant to man repute to be such criminal themselves nor can ariosto in this passage be reckon a very flattering or conscientious pleader for he brother-poet resentment and a good jest seem to have conspire to make he forget what be due to himself the original of st john 's remark about augustus and the ancient poet must not be omit it be exquisite of its kind both in matter and style voltaire have quote it somewhere with rapture non fu sì santo nè benigno augusto come la tuba di virgilio suona : l'aver avuto in poesium buon gusto la proscrizion iniqua glus perdona nessun sapria se neron fosse ingiusto nè sua fama sarium forse man buona avesse avuto e terra e ciel nimici se gli scrittor sapea tenersi amici omero agamennon vittorioso e fe ' i trojan

samuel chap xiii -rrb- and æneas for interfere with turnus and lavinium and take possession of place he have no right to it be delightful to see the great generous poet go upon grounds of reason and justice in the tooth of the trumped-up rights of the pious æneas that shabby deserter of dido and cant prototype of augustus he turn the table also with brave candor upon the tyrannical claim of the stronger sex to privilege which they deny the other and say that there be more faithless man in hell than faithless woman which if personal infidelity send people there most undoubtedly be the case

-rrb- he put up for the first day at a abbey which be accustom to entertain the knight and lady that journey that way and after avail himself of its hospitality he inquire of the abbot and he monk if they could direct he where to find what he look for they say that plenty of adventure be to be meet with in the forest but that for the most part they remain in as much obscurity as the spot in which they occur it would be more become he valor they think to exert itself where it would not be hide and they conclude with tell he of one of the noblest chance for renown that ever await a sword the

without the license of the priest which by the law of scotland be a crime only to be expiate at the stake unless a champion could be find to disprove the charge before the end of a month unfortunately the month have nearly expire and no champion yet make he appearance though the king have promise he daughter 's hand to anybody of noble blood who should establish she innocence and the saddest part of the thing be that she be account innocent by all the world and a very pattern of modesty while this horrible story be be tell he the paladin fall into a profound state of think after remain silent for a little while at the close of it he look up and say a lady then it seem be condemn to death for have be too kind to one lover while thousand of we sex be play the gallant with whomsoever they

new comer they flee and rinaldo after re-assure the damsel and request to know what have bring she to a pass so dreadful make he guide take she up on he horse behind he in order that they might lose no more time the damsel who be very beautiful could not speak at first for the horror of what she have expect to undergo but on rinaldo 's repeat he request she at length find word and in a voice of great humility begin to relate she story but before she begin the poet interfere with a impatient remark -- of all the creature in existence cry he whether they be tame or wild whether they be in a state of peace or of war man be the only one that lay violent hand on the female of he species the bear offer no injury to he the lioness be safe by the side of the lion the heifer have no fear of the horn of the bull what pest of abomination what fury from hell have come to disturb in this respect the bosom of human kind husband and wife deafen one another with injurious speech tear one another 's face bathe the genial bed with tear nay some time with bloodshed in my eye the man who can allow himself to give a blow to a woman or to hurt even a hair of she head be a violater of nature and a rebel against god but to poison she to strangle she to take the soul out of she body with a knife -- he that can do that never will i believe he to be a man at all but a fiend out of hell with a man 's face -lrb- 3 -rrb- such must have be the two villain who flee at the sight of rinaldo and who have bring the woman into this dark spot to stifle she testimony for ever but to return to what she be go to say -- you be to know sir she begin that i have be from my childhood in the service of the king 's daughter the princess ginevra i grow up with she i be hold in bonor and i lead a happy life till it please the cruel passion of love to envy I my condition and make I think that there be no be on earth to be compare to the duke of albany he pretend to love I so much that in return i love he with all my heart unable by degree to refuse he anything i let he into the palace at night nay into the room which of all other the princess regard as most exclusively she own for there she keep she jewel and there she be accustom to sleep during inclement state of the weather it communicate with the other sleeping-room by a covered gallery which look out to some lonely ruin and nobody ever pass that way day or night we intercourse continue for several month and find that i place all my happiness in oblige he he venture to disclose to I one day a design he have upon the princess 's hand nay do not blush to ask my assistance in further it judge how i set he wish above my own when i confess that i undertake to do so it be true he rank be nearer to the princess 's than to mine and he pretend that he seek the alliance merely on that account protest that he should love I more than ever and that ginevra would be little better than he wife in name but god know i do it wholly out of the excess of my desire to please he day and night i exert all my endeavor to recommend he to the princess heaven be my witness that i do it in real earnest however wrong it be but my labor be to no purpose for she be in love herself she return in all its warmth the passion of a most accomplished and valiant gentleman who have come into scotland with a younger brother from italy and who have make himself such a favorite with every body my lover include that the king himself have bestow on he title and estate and put he on a footing with the greatest lord of the land unfortunately the princess not only turn a deaf ear to all i say in the duke 's favor but grow to dislike he in proportion to my recommendation so that find there be no likelihood of he success he own love be secretly turn into hate and rage he study little as i dream he could be so base how he could best destroy she prospect of happiness he resort for this purpose to a most crafty expedient which i poor fool take for nothing but what he feign it to be he pretend that a whim have come into he head for seem to prosper in he suit out of a kind of revenge for he not be able to do so in reality and in order to indulge this whim he request I to dress myself in the identical clothes which the princess put off when she go to bed that night and then to appear in they at my usual post in the balcony and so let down the ladder as though i be she very self and receive he into my arm i do all that he desire mad fool that i be and out of the part which i play have come all this mischief i have intimate to you that the duke and ariodante -lrb- for such be the other 's name -rrb- have be good friend before ginevra prefer hint to my false lover pretend therefore to be still he friend and enter on the subject of a passion which he say he have long entertain for she he express he wonder at find it interfere with by so noble a gentleman especially as it be return by the princess with a fervor of which the other if he please might have ocular testimony greatly astonish at this news be ariodante he have receive all the proof of he mistress 's affection which it be possible for chaste love to bestow and with the greatest scorn refuse to believe it but as the duke with the air of a man who could not help the melancholy communication quietly persist in he story the unhappy lover find himself compel at any rate to let he afford those proof of she infidelity which he assert to be in he power the consequence be that ariodante come with he brother to the ruin i speak of and there the two be post on the night when i play my unhappy part in the balcony he bring lurcanio with he -lrb- that be the brother 's name -rrb- because he suspect that the duke have a design on he life not conceive what he allege against ginevra to be possible lurcanio however be not in the secret of he brother 's engagement with the princess it have be disclose hitherto neither to he nor to any one the lady not yet have choose to divulge it to the king himself ariodante therefore request he brother to take he station at a little distance out of sight of the palace and not to come to he unless he should call : ` otherwise my dear brother ' conclude he ` stir not a step if you love I ' ` doubt I not ' say lurcanio and with these word the latter entrenched himself in he post ariodante now stand by himself gaze at the balcony -- the only person visible at that moment in all the place in a few minute the duke of albany appear below it make the signal to which i have be accustom and then i in my horrible folly become visible to the eye of both and let down the ladder meantime lurcanio begin to be very uneasy at the mysterious situation in which he find himself and to have the most alarming fear for he brother have cautiously pick he way after he at a little distance so that he also though still hide in the shade of the lonely house perceive all that be go on i be dress as i have undertake to be in the identical clothes which the princess have put off that night and as i be not unlike she in air and figure and wear the golden net with red tassel peculiar to lady of the royal family and the two brother besides be at quite sufficient distance to be deceive i be take by both of they for she very self the duke impatiently mount the ladder i receive he as impatiently in my arm and circumstance though from very different feeling render the caress that pass between we of unusual ardor you may imagine the grief of ariodante it rise at once to despair he do not call out so that have not he brother follow he still worse would have ensue than do for he draw he sword and be proceed in distraction to fall upon it when lurcanio rush in and stop he ` miserable brother ' exclaim he ` be you mad would you die for a woman like this you see what a wretch she be i discern all you case at once and thank god have preserve you to turn you sword where it ought to be turn against the defender of such a pattern of infamy ' ariodante put up he sword and suffer himself to be lead away by he brother he even pretend in a little while to be able to review he condition calmly but not the less have

tell no falsehood the lover have indeed throw himself into the sea and disappear from the man 's eye but -lrb- as oftener happen than people suppose -rrb- the death which be desire when not present become hate when it be so and ariodante lover as he be rise at a little distance strike out lustily for the shore and reach it -lrb- 4 -rrb- he feel even a secret contempt for he attempt to kill himself yet put up at a hermitage become interested in the report concern the princess whose sorrow flattered and whose danger though he could not cease to think she guilty afflict he he grow exasperated with the very brother he love when he find that lurcanio pursue she thus to the death and on all these account he make he appearance at the place of combat to fight he though not to slay he purpose be to seek he own death he conclude that ginevra would then see who it be that have really love she while he brother would mourn the rashness which make he pursue the destruction of a woman

be say to have actually occur in ferrara and in ariosto 's own time be ariosto himself a party ariodante almost include he name and it be certain that he be once in love with a lady of the name of ginevra -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : rinaldo be a ambassador and one upon very urgent business yet he halt by the way in search of adventure this have be say to be in the true taste of knight-errantry and in one respect it be so we may imagine however that the ship be wind-bound and that he mean to return to it on change of weather the caledonian forest it be to be observe be close at hand -rrb- -lrb-

for mankind could not believe that they quit the world in the same way as other man they think they must be take up into heaven to be the lord of demigod when the prince be good the subject be good for they always imitate they master or at least if the subject can not attain to this height of virtue they at least be not as bad as they would be otherwise and at all event public decency be observe oh bless kingdom that be govern by such heart and oh most miserable one that be at the mercy of a man without justice -- a fellow-creature without feeling we italy be full of such who will have they

may think of it be true to the letter such letter at all event as be write upon the heart of he race he be one of the first who take to the custom of wear beard for great as he be he have a fear of the race of barber he build a tower in he palace guard by deep ditch and thick wall it have but one drawbridge and one bay-window there be no other open so that the very light of day have scarcely admittance or the inmate a place to breathe at in this tower he sleep and it be he wife 's business to put a ladder down for he when he come in a dog keep watch at the drawbridge and except the dog and the wife not a soul be to be discern about the place yet he have such little trust in she that he always send spy to look about the room before he withdraw for the night of what use be it all the woman herself kill he with he own sword and he soul go straight to hell rhadamanthus the judge there thrust he under the boil lake but be astonish to find that he betray no symptom of anguish he do not weep and howl as the rest do or cry out i burn i burn he evince so little suffering that rhadamanthus say i must put this fellow into other quarter accordingly he send he into the lowest pit where the torment be beyond all other nevertheless even here he seem to be under no distress at length they ask he the reason the wretch then candidly acknowledge that hell itself have no torment for he compare with those which suspicion have give he on earth the sage of hell lay they head together at this news amelioration of he lot on the part of a sinner be not to be think of in a place of eternal punishment so they call a parliament together the result of which be a unanimous conclusion that the man should be send back to earth and consign to the torment of suspicion for ever he go and the earthly fiend re-enter he be anew with a subtlety so incorporate that they two nature be identify and he become suspicion itself fruit be thus engraft on wild stock one color thus become the parent of

whatever he will he never seem to have do enough \* \* \* \* \* great poet and good man ariosto you terror be better than dante 's for they warn as far as warning can do good and they neither afflict humanity nor degrade god spenser have imitate this sublime piece of pleasantry for by a curious intermixture of all which the mind can experience from such a fiction pleasant it be in the midst of its sublimity -- laughable with satirical archness as well as grand and terrible in the climax the transformation in spenser be from a jealous man into jealousy he wife have go to live with the satyr and a villain have steal he money the husband in order to persuade he wife to return steal into the horde of the satyr by mix with they flock of goat -- as norandino do in a passage imitate from homer by ariosto the wife flatly refuse to do any such thing and the poor wretch be oblige to steal out again so soon as he the prison door do pass he run as fast as both he foot could bear and never look who behind he be nor scarcely who before like as a bear that creep close among the hive to rear a honeycomb the wakeful dog espy and he assail sore he carcass tear that hardly he away with life do fly nor stay till safe himself he see from jeopardy nor stay would he till be come unto the place where late he treasure he entombèd have where when he find it not -lrb- for trompart base have it purloin for

still flee he forward look backward still nor stay would he flight nor fearful agony till that he come unto a rocky hill over the sea suspend dreadfully that live creature it would terrify to look a-down or upward to the height from thence he throw himself dispiteously all desperate of he fore-damnèd spright that seem would no help for he be leave in live sight but through long anguish and self-murd ` ring think he be so waste and forpinèd quite that all he substance be consume to nought and nothing leave but like a airy sprite that on the rock he fall so flit and light that he thereby receive no hurt at all but chancèd on a craggy cliff to light whence he with crooked claw so long do crawl that at the last he find a cave with entrance small into the same he creep and thenceforth there resolve to build he baleful mansion in dreary darkness and continual fear of that rock 's fall which ever and anon threat with huge ruin he to fall upon that he dare never sleep but that one eye still ope he keep for that occasion nor ever rest he in tranquillity the roar billow beat he bower so boisterously nor ever be he wont on aught to feed but toad and frog he pasture poisonous which in

painful pleasure turn to please pain there dwell he ever miserable swain hateful both to himself and every wight where he through privy grief and horror vain be waxen so deform that he have quite forget he be a man and jealousy be hight spenser 's picture be more subtly work and imaginative than ariosto 's but it remove the man farther from ourselves except under very special circumstance indeed it might be take rather for a picture of hypochondria than jealousy and under that aspect be very appalling but nothing under more obvious circumstance come so dreadfully home to we as ariosto 's poor wretch feeling himself the less safe the more he put on and call out dismally from he tower a thousand foot high to the watcher and warder below to see that all be secure -lrb- footnote 1 : this daring and grand apologue be not in the _ furioso _ but in a poem which ariosto leave unfinished and which go under the name of the _ five canto _ the fragment though bear mark of want of correction be in some respects a beautiful and altogether a curious one especially as it seem to have be write after the _ furioso _ for it touch in a remarkable manner on several point of moral and politics and contain a extravagance wilder than any thing in pulcus -- a whale _ inhabit _ by knight it be most likely for these reason that he friend bembo and other advise he to suppress it be it write in he youth the apologue itself be not one of the least daring attack on the borgia and such scoundrel who have just then afflict italy do ariosto by the way omit macchiavellus in he list of the friend who hail the close of he great poem from not know what to make of he book entitle the _ prince _ it have perplex all the world to this day and be not unlikely to have make a particularly unpleasant impression on a mind at once so candid and humane as ariosto 's -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : a tremendous fancy this last sta for la pena de la qual dicea che nacque quando la brutt ` ira

favor of the tartar king mandricardo and mortify by the publicity of the rejection before he own lord paramount agramante the leader of the infidel army he could not bear the rejection he could not

have be desert by its clergy during the rage of war this vehement personage be stand one morning at the door of the chapel in a state of unusual thoughtfulness when he behold come towards he through a path in the green meadow before it a lady of a lovely aspect accompany by a bearded monk they be follow by something cover with black which they be bring along on a great horse alas the lady be the widow of zerbino the scottish prince who spare the life of medoro and who now himself lay dead under that pall he have expire in she arm from wound inflict during a combat with mandricardo and she have be throw by the loss into such anguish of mind that she would have die on he sword but for the intervention of the hermit now with she who persuade she to devote the rest of she day to god in a nunnery she have now come into provence with the good man for that purpose and to bury the corpse of she husband in the chapel which they be approach though the lady seem lose in grief and be very pale and have she hair all about the ear and though she do nothing but weep and lament and look in all respects quite bear down with she misery nevertheless she be still so beautiful that love and grace appear to be indestructible in she aspect the moment the saracen behold she he dismiss from he mind all the determination he have make to hate and detest the gentle bevy that adorn the world he be bent solely on obtain the new angel before he she seem precisely the sort of person to make he forget the one that have reject he advance therefore to meet she without delay he beg in as gentle a manner as he could assume to know the cause of she sorrow the lady with all the candor of wretchedness explain who she be and how precious a burden she be convey to its last home and the resolution she have take to withdraw from a vain world into the service of god the proud pagan who have no belief in a god much less any respect for restraint or fidelity of what kind soever forget he assumed gravity when he hear this determination and laugh outright at the simplicity of such a proceeding he pronounce it in he peremptory way to be foolish and frivolous compare it with the miser who in bury a treasure do good neither to himself nor any one else and say that lion and serpent might indeed be shut up in cage but not thing lovely and innocent the monk overhear these observation think it he duty to interfere he calmly oppose all which the other assert and then proceed to set forth a repast of spiritual consolation not at all to the saracen 's taste the fierce warrior interrupt the preacher several time tell he that he have nothing to do with the lady and that the sooner he return to he cell the better but the hermit nothing daunted go on with he advice till he antagonist lose all patience he lay hand on he sacred person seize he by the beard tear away as much of it as he grasp and at length work himself up into such a pitch of fury that he gripe the good man 's throat with all the force of a pair of pincers and swing he twice or thrice round as one might a dog fling he off the headland into the sea what become of the poor creature i can not say report be various some tell we that he be find on the rock dash all to piece so that you could not distinguish foot from head other that he fall into the sea at the distance of three mile and perish in consequence of not know how to swim in spite of the prayer and tear that he address to heaven other again affirm that a saint come and assist he and draw he to shore before people 's eye i must leave the reader to adopt which of these account he look upon as the most probable the pagan as soon as he have thus dispose of the garrulous hermit turn towards isabellum -lrb- for that be the lady 's name -rrb- and with a face some what less disturbed begin to talk to she in the common language of gallantry protest that she be he life and soul and that he should not know what to do without she for the sweetness of she

dispose she to return he inclination on the other hand the poor disconsolate creature who in a country unknown to she and a place so remote from help feel like a mouse in the cat 's claw begin cast in she mind by what possible contrivance she could escape from such a wretch with honor she have make up she mind to perish by she own hand rather than be faithless however unwillingly to the dear husband that have die in she arm : but the question be how she could protect herself from the pagan 's violence before she have secure the means of so do for he manner be become very impatient and he speech every moment less and less civil at length a expedient occur to she she tell he that if he would promise to respect she virtue she would put he in possession of a secret that would redound far more to he honor and glory than any wrong which he could inflict on the innocent she conjure he not to throw away the satisfaction he would experience all the rest of he life from the consciousness of have do right for the sake of injure one unhappy creature there be thousand of she sex she observe with cheerful as well as beautiful face who might rejoice in he affection whereas the secret she

with the fire of cypress-wood that the saracen contrary to he law and indeed to he habit indulge himself in drinking and the consequence be that as soon as it be morning isabellum lose no time in

the same respective rank tasso 's cardinal however though the poet lose he favor and though very little be know about he leave no such bad reputation behind he as ippolito it be in the service of the duke that the poet experience he suffering this prince who be haughty ostentatious and quarrelsome be at the time of the stranger 's arrival rehearse the show and tournament intend to welcome he bride the sister of the emperor maximilian the second she be he second wife the first be a daughter of the rival house of tuscany which he detest and the marriage have not be happy the new consort arrive in the course of a few week enter the city in great pomp and for a time all go happily with the young poet he be in a state of ecstasy with the beauty and grandeur he behold around he -- obtain the favourable notice of the duke 's two sister and the duke himself -- go on with he _ jerusalem deliver _ which in spite of the presence of ariosto 's memory he be resolve to load with praise of the house of este and in this tumult of pride and expectation he behold the duke like one of the hero of he poem set out to assist the emperor against the turk at the head of three hundred gentleman arm at all point and mantle in various-coloured velvet embroider with gold to complete the young poet 's happiness or commence he disappointment he fall in love notwithstanding the goddess he have leave in mantua with the beautiful lucrezium bendidio who do not seem however to have love in return for she become the wife of a macchiavellus among he rival be guarinus who afterwards emulate he in pastoral poetry and who accuse he on this occasion of court two lady at once guarinus 's accusation have be suppose to refer to the duke 's sister leonora whose name have become so romantically mix up with the poet 's biography but the latest inquiry render it probable that the allusion be to laura peperara -lrb- 3 -rrb- the young poet however who have not escape the influence of the free manners of italy and whose sens and vanity may hitherto have be more interested than he heart rhyme and flatter on all side of he not of course omit the charm of princess in order to win the admiration of the lady in a body he sustain for three day in public after the fashion of the time _ fifty amorous conclusion _ that be to say affirmation on the subject of love doubtless to the equal delight of he fair auditor and himself and the creation of a good deal of jealousy and ill-will on the part of such person of he own sex as have not wit or spirit enough for the display of so much logic and love-making in 1569 the death of he father who have be make governor of ostiglium by the duke of mantua cost the loving son a fit of illness but the continuation of he _ jerusalem _ a _ oration _ speak at the opening of the ferrarese academy the marriage of leonora 's sister lucrezium with the prince of urbino and the society of leonora herself who lead the retired life of a person in delicate health and be fond of the company of man of letter help to divert he from melancholy recollection and a journey to france at the close of the year follow take he into scene that be not only totally new but otherwise highly interesting to the singer of godfrey of boulogne the occasion of it be a visit of the cardinal he master to the court of he relative charle the ninth it be suppose that he eminence go to confer with the king on matter relative to the dispute which not long afterwards occasion the detestable massacre of st bartholomew before he departure tasso put into the hand of one of he friend a document which as it be very curious and serve to illustrate perhaps more than one cause of he misfortune be here give entire _ memorial leave by tasso on he departure to france _ since life be frail and it may please almighty god to dispose of I otherwise in this my journey to france it be request of signor ercole rondinellus that he will in that case undertake the management of the follow concern : in the first place with regard to my composition it be my wish that all my love-sonnet and madrigal should be collect and publish but with regard to those whether amatory or otherwise _ which i have write for any friend _ my request be that _ they should be bury with myself _ save only the one commence _ or che l'aura mium dolce altrove spira _ i wish the publication of the _ oration _ speak in ferrara at the opening of the academy of the four book on _ heroic poetry _ of the six last canto of the _ godfrey _ -lrb- the _ jerusalem _ -rrb- and of those stanza of the two first which shall seem least imperfect all these composition however be to be submit to the review and consideration of signor scipio gonzaga of signor domenico veniero and of signor battista guarinus who i persuade myself will not refuse this trouble when they consider the zealous friendship i have entertain for themselves let they be inform too that it be my intention that they should cut and hew without mercy whatever should appear to they defective or superfluous with regard to addition or change i should wish they to proceed more cautiously since after all the poem would remain imperfect as to my other composition should there be any which to the aforesaid signor rondinellus and the other gentleman might seem not unworthy of publication let they be dispose of accord to they pleasure in respect to my property i wish that such part of it as i have _ pledge to abram -- _ for twenty-five lira and seven piece of arras which be _ likewise in pledge to signor ascanio for thirteen scudus _ together with whatever i have in this house should be sell and that the overplus of the proceeds should go to defray the expense of the follow epitaph to be inscribe on a monument to my father whose body be in st polo and should any impediment take place in these matter i entreat signor ercole _ to have recourse to the favor of the most excellent madame leonora whose liberality i confide in for my sake _ i torquato tasso have write this ferrara 1570 i shall have occasion to recur to this document by and by i will merely observe for the present that the mark in it both of imprudence in money-matter and confidence in the goodwill of a princess be very striking abram and signor ascanio be both jew the piece of arras belong to he father and probably this be a additional reason why the affectionate son wish the proceeds to defray the expense of the epitaph the epitaph record he father 's poetry state-service and vicissitude of fortune tasso be introduce to the french king as the poet of a french hero and of a catholic victory and he reception be so favourable -lrb- particularly as the wretched charle the victim of he mother 's bigotry have himself no mean poetic feeling -rrb- that with a rash mixture of simplicity and self-reliance -lrb- respect make I unwilling to call it self-importance -rrb- the poet express a impolitic amount of astonishment at the favor shewn at court to the hugonot -- little suspect the horrible design it cover he shortly afterwards break with he master the cardinal and it be suppose that this unseasonable escape of zeal be the cause he himself appear to have think so -lrb- 4 -rrb- perhaps the cardinal only want to get the imprudent poet back to italy for on tasso 's return to ferrara he be not only receive into the service of the duke with a salary of some fifteen golden scudus a-month but tell that he be exempt from any particular duty and might attend in peace to he study balzac affirm that while tasso be at the court of france he be so poor as to beg a crown from a friend and that when he leave it he have the same coat on he back that he come in -lrb- 5 -rrb- the assertion of a profess wit and hyperbolist be not to be take for grant yet it be difficult to say to what shift improvidence may not be reduce the singer of the house of este would now it might have be suppose be happy he have leisure he have money he have the worldly honor that he be fond of he occupy himself in perfect the _ jerusalem _ and he write he beautiful pastoral the _ aminta _ which be perform before the duke and he court to the delight of the brilliant assembly the duke 's sister lucrezium princess of urbino who be a special friend of the poet send for he to read it to she at pesaro and in the course of the ensue carnival it be perform with similar applause at the court of she father-in-law the poet have be as much enchant by the spectacle which the audience at ferrara present to he eye as the audience with the love and grace with which he enrich they stage the shepherd thyrsis by whom he mean himself reflect it back upon they in a passage of the performance it be worth while dwelling on this passage a little because it exhibit a brief interval of happiness in the author 's life and also chew we what he have already begin to think of court at the moment he be praise they but he ingeniously contrive to put the praise in he own mouth and the blame in another be the shepherd 's friend mopsus -lrb- by whom tasso be think to have mean speronus -rrb- have warn he against go to court però figlio va su l'avviso & c therefore

summer of 1574 the duke of ferrara go to venice to pay he respects to the successor of charle the ninth henry the third then on he way to france from he kingdom of poland tasso go with the duke and be understand to have take the opportunity of look for a printer of he _ jerusalem _ which be now almost finish writer be anxious to publish in that crafty city because its government would give no security of profit to book print elsewhere alfonso who be in mourning for henry 's brother and to whom mourn itself only suggest a new occasion of pomp and vanity take with he to this interview five hundred ferrarese gentleman all dress in long black cloak who walk about venice -lrb- say a reporter -rrb- by two and three wonderfully impress the inhabitant with they gravity and magnificence -lrb- 9 -rrb- the mourner feast however and tasso have a quartan fever which delay the completion of the _ jerusalem _ till next year this be at length effect and now once more it might have be think that the writer would have repose on he laurel but tasso have already begin to experience the uneasiness attend superiority and unfortunately the strength of he mind be not equal to that of he genius he be of a ultra-sensitive temperament and subject to depressing fit of sickness he could not calmly bear envy sarcasm exasperated and hostile criticism afflict he the seed of a suspicious temper be nourish by prosperity itself the author of the _ armida _ and the _ jerusalem _ begin to think the attention he receive unequal to he merit while with a sort of hysterical mixture of demand for applause and provocation of censure he not only condescend to read he poem in manuscript wherever he go but in order to secure the goodwill of the papal licenser he transmit it for revisal to rome where it be mercilessly criticise for the space of two year by the bigot and hypocrite of a court which luther have render a very different one from that in the time of ariosto this new source of chagrin exasperate the complexional restlessness which now make we author think that he should be more easy any where than in ferrara perhaps more able to communicate with and convince he critic and unfortunately he permit himself to descend to a weakness the most fatal of all other to a mind naturally exalt and ingenuous perhaps it be one of the main cause of all which he suffer indeed he himself attribute he misfortune to irresolution what i mean in the present instance be that he do not disdain to adopt underhand measure he skew a face of satisfaction with alfonso at the moment that he be take step to exchange he court for another he write for that purpose to he friend scipio gonzaga now a prelate at the court of rome earnestly beg he at the same time not to commit he in they correspondence and scipio who be one of he kindest and most indulgent friend and who doubtless saw that the duke of ferrara and he poet be not of disposition to accord do all he could to procure he a appointment with one of the family of the medicus most unhappily for this speculation -lrb- and perhaps even the good-natured gonzaga take a little more pleasure in it on that account -rrb- alfonso inherit all the detestation of he house for that lucky race and it be remarkable that the same jealousy which hinder ariosto 's advancement with the medicus be still more fatal to the hope of tasso for they serve to plunge he into the deepest adversity in vain he have warning give he both friendly and hostile the princess now duchess of urbino who be he particular friend strongly caution he against the temptation of go away she say he be watch he himself think he letter be open and probably they be they certainly be at a subsequent period tasso however persist and go to rome scipio gonzaga introduce he to cardinal ferdinand de ' medici afterwards grand duke of tuscany and ferdinand make he offer of protection so handsome that they excite he suspicion the self-tormenting poet think they savor more of hatred to the este family than honor to himself -lrb- 10 -rrb- he do not accept they he do nothing at rome but make friend in order to perplex they listen to he critic in order to worry himself and perform act of piety in the church by way of shew that the love-scene in the _ jerusalem _ be innocent for the bigot have begin to find something very questionable in mix up so much love with war the bloodshed they have no objection to the love beard they prejudice and excite they envy tasso return to ferrara and endeavor to solace himself with eulogise two fair stranger who have arrive at alfonso 's court -- eleonora sanvitale who have be newly marry to the count of scandiano -lrb- a tiene not a boiardo whose line be extinct -rrb- and barbara sanseverino countess of sala she mother-in-law the mother-in-law who be a juno-like beauty wear she hair in the form of a crown the still more beautiful daughter-in-law have a under lip such as anacreon or sir john suckling would have admire -- pouting and provoke -- -lrb- prokaloymenon phileama -rrb- tasso write verse on they both but particularly to the lip and this countess of scandiano be the second out of the three leonora with whom tasso be say by he friend manso to have be in love the third it be now ascertain never exist and he love-making to the new or second leonora go to shew how little of real passion there be in the praise of the first -lrb- the princess leonora -rrb- or probably of any lady at court he even profess love as a forlorn hope to the countess 's waiting-maid yet these gallantry of sonnet be exalt into bewilderment of the heart he restlessness return the poet now condescend to craft a second time expect to meet with a refusal and so to be afford a pretext for quit ferrara he apply for the vacant office of historiographer it be grant he and he then disgust the medicus by plead a unlooked-for engagement which he could only reconcile to he application for they favor by renounce he claim to be believe if he could have deceive other why might he not have deceive they all the lurk weakness of the poet 's temperament begin to display itself at this juncture he perplexity excite he to a degree of irritability border on delirium and circumstance conspire to increase it he have lend a acquaintance the key of he room at court for the purpose -lrb- he tell we -rrb- of accommodate some intrigue and he suspect this person of open cabinet contain he papers remonstrate with he one day in the court of the palace either on that or some other account the man give he the lie he receive in return a blow on the face and be say by tasso to have bring a set of he kinsman to assassinate he all of whom the heroical poet immediately put to flight at one time he suspect the duke of jealousy respect the dedication of he poem and at another of a wish to burn it he suspect he servant he become suspicious of the truth of he friend gonzaga he doubt even whether some praise address to he by orazio ariosto the nephew of the great poet which one would have think would have be to he a consummation of bliss be not intend to mystify and hurt he at length he fancy that he persecutor have accuse he of heresy to the inquisition and as he have go through the metaphysical doubt common with most man of reflection respect point of faith and the mystery of creation he fear that some indiscreet word have escape he give color to the charge he thus behold enemy all around he he dread stab and poison and one day in some paroxysm of rage or horror how occasion it be not know run with a knife or dagger at one of the servant of the duchess of urbino in she own chamber alfonso upon this apparently in the mildest and most reasonable manner direct that he should be confine to he apartment and put into the hand of the physician these unfortunate event take place in the summer of 1577 and in the poet 's thirty-third year tasso shew so much affliction at this treatment and at the same time bear it so patiently that the duke take he to he beautiful country seat of belriguardo where in one of he account of the matter the poet say that he treat he as a brother but in another he accuse he of have take pain to make he criminate himself and confess certain matter real or suppose the nature of which be a puzzle with posterity some be of opinion -lrb- and this be the prevail one -rrb- that he be find guilty of be in love with the princess leonora perhaps of be love by herself other think the love out of the question and that the duke be concern at nothing but he endeavor to transfer he service and he poetic reputation into the hand of the medici other see in the duke 's conduct nothing but that of a good master interesting himself in the welfare of a afflict servant it be certain that alfonso do all he could to prevent the surreptitious printing of the _ jerusalem deliver _ in various town of italy the dread of which have much afflict the poet and he also endeavor though in vain to ease he mind on the subject of the inquisition for these fact be attest by state-papers and other document not dependent either on the testimony of third person or the partial representation of the sufferer but tasso feel so uneasy at belriguardo that he request leave to retire a while into a convent he remain there several day apparently so much to he satisfaction that he write to the duke to say that it be he intention to become a friar and yet he have no sooner get into the place than he address a letter to the inquisition at rome beseech it to desire permission for he to come to that city in order to clear himself from the charge of he enemy he also write to two other friend request they to further he petition and add that the duke be enrage with he in consequence of the anger of the grand duke of tuscany who it be suppose have accuse tasso of have reveal to alfonso some indecent epithet which he highness have apply to he -lrb- 11 -rrb- these letter be undoubtedly intercept for they be find among the secret archive of modena the only principality ultimately remain in the este family so that agreeably to the say of listener hear no good of themselves if alfonso do not know the epithet before he learn it then the reader may conceive he feeling tasso too at the same time be plague he with letter to similar purpose and it be observable that while in those which he send to rome he speak of cosmo de ' medici as grand duke he take care in the other to call he simply the duke of florence alfonso have be exasperate to the last degree at cosmo 's have have the epithet grand add by the pope to he ducal title and the reader may imagine the little allowance that would be make by a haughty and angry prince for the rebellious courtesy thus shew to a detest rival tasso furthermore who have not only a infantine hatred of bitter physic but reasonably think the fashion of the age for give it a ridiculous one begged hard in a manner which it be humiliating to witness that he might not be drench with medicine the duke at length forbid he write to he any more and tasso whose fear of every kind of ill usage have be wind up to a pitch unbearable watch a opportunity when he be carelessly guard and flee at once from the convent and ferrara the unhappy poet select the loneliest way he could find and direct he course to the kingdom of naple where he sister live he be afraid of pursuit he probably have little money and consider he ill health and he dread of the inquisition it be pitiable to think what he may have endure while pick he long way through the back state of the church and over the mountain of abruzzo as far as the gulf of naple for better security he exchange clothes with a shepherd and as he fear even he sister at first from doubt whether she still love he he interview with she be in all its circumstance painfully dramatic cornelium tasso now a widow with two son be still reside at sorrento where the poet cast he eye around he as he proceed towards the house must have behold with singular feeling of wretchedness the lovely spot in which he have be a happy little boy he do not announce himself at once he bring letter he say from the lady 's brother and it be affect to think that whether he sister might or might not have retain otherwise any personal recollection of he since that time -lrb- for he have not see she in the interval -rrb- he disguise be complete by the alteration which sorrow have make in he appearance for at all event she do not know he she see in he nothing but a haggard stranger who be acquaint with the writer of the letter and to whom they refer for particulars of the risk which she brother run unless she could afford he she protection these particulars be give by the stranger with all the pathos of the real man and the loving sister faint away on she recovery the visitor say what he could to reassure she and then by degree discover himself cornelium welcome he in the tenderest manner she do all that he desire and give out to she friend that the gentleman be a cousin from bergamo who have come to naple on family affair for a little while the affection of he sister and the beauty and freshness of sorrento render the mind of tasso more easy : but he restlessness return he fear he have mortally offend the duke of ferrara and with he wonted fluctuation of purpose he now wish to be restore to he presence for the very reason he have run away from it he do not know with what vengeance he might be pursue he write to the duke but receive no answer the duchess of urbino be equally silent leonora alone respond but with no encouragement these appearance only make he the more anxious to dare or to propitiate he doom and he accordingly determine to put himself in the duke 's hand he sister entreat he in vain to alter he resolution he quit she before the autumn be over and proceed to rome go directly to the house of the duke 's agent there who in concert with the ferrarese ambassador give he master advice of the circumstance gonzaga however and another good friend cardinal albano doubt whether it would be wise in the poet to return to ferrara under any circumstance they counsel he to be satisfy with be pardon at a distance and with have he papers and other thing return to he and the two friend immediately write to the duke request as much the duke apparently acquiesce in all that be desire but he say that the illness of he sister the duchess of urbino delay the procuration of the papers which it seem be chiefly in she hand the upshot be that the papers do not come and tasso with a mixture of rage and fear and perhaps for more reason than he have tell become uncontrollably desirous of retrace the rest of he step to ferrara love may have be among these reason -- probably be though it do not follow that the passion must have be for a princess the poet now therefore petition to that effect and alfonso write again and say he might come but only on condition of he again undergo the ducal course of medicine add that if he do not he be to be finally expel he highness 's territory he be graciously receive -- too graciously it would seem for he equanimity for it give he such a flow of spirit that the duke appear to have think it necessary to repress they the unhappy poet at this begin to have some of he old suspicion and the unaccountable detention of he papers confirm they he make a effort to keep the suspicion down but it be by means unfortunately of drown they in wine and jollity and this give he such a fit of sickness as have nearly be he death he recover only to make a fresh stir about he papers and a still greater one about he poem in general which though he _ jerusalem _ be yet only know in manuscript and not even he _ aminta _ publish he believe ought to occupy the attention of mankind people at ferrara therefore not foresee the respect that posterity would entertain for the poet and have no great desire perhaps to encourage a man who claim to be a rival of they countryman ariosto now begin to consider they neapolitan guest not merely a ingenious and pitiable but a overweening and tiresome enthusiast the court however still seem to be interested in its panegyrist though tasso fear that alfonso mean to burn he _ jerusalem _ alfonso on the other hand be suppose to have fear that he would burn it himself and the ducal praise with it the papers at all event apparently include the only fair copy of the poem be constantly withhold and tasso in a new fit of despair again quit ferrara this mystery of the papers be certainly very extraordinary the poet 's first step be to mantua where he meet with no such reception as encouraged he to stay he then go to urbino but do not stop long the prince it be true be very gracious and bandage for a cautery be apply by the fair hand of he highness 's sister but though the nurse enchant the surgery frighten he the hapless poet find himself pursue wherever he go by the torment beneficence of medicine he escape and go to turin he have no passport and present besides so miserable a appearance that the people at the gate roughly refuse he admittance he be well receive however at court and as he have begin to acknowledge that he be subject to humor and delusion and write to say as much to cardinal albano who return he a most excellent and affect letter full of the kindest regard and good counsel he friend entertain a hope that he would become tranquil but he disappoint they he again apply to alfonso for permission to return to ferrara -- again receive it though on worse than the old condition -- and again find himself in that city in the beginning of the year 1579 delighted at see a brilliant assemblage from all quarter of italy on occasion of a new marriage of the duke 's -lrb- with a princess of mantua -rrb- he make up he mind to think that nothing could be deny he at such a moment by the bridegroom whom he mean to honor and glorify alas the very circumstance to which he look for success tend to throw he into the greatest of he calamity alfonso be to be marry the day after the poet 's arrival he be therefore too busy to attend to he the princess do not attend to he nobody attend to he he again apply in vain for he papers he regret he return become anxious to be any where else think himself not only neglect but deride and at length become excite to a pitch of frenzy he break forth into the most unmeasured invective against the duke even in public invoked curse on he head and that of he whole race retract all he have ever say in the praise of any of they prince or otherwise and pronounce he and he whole court a parcel of ingrate rascal and poltroon -lrb- 12 -rrb- the outbreak be report to the duke and the consequence be that the poet be send to the hospital of st anne a establishment for the reception of the poor and lunatic where he remain -lrb- with the exception of a few unaccountable leave-day -rrb- upward of seven year this melancholy event happen in the march of the year 1579 tasso be stun by this blow as much as if he have never do or suffer any thing to expect it he could at first do nothing but wonder and bewail himself and implore to be set free the duke answer that he must be cure first tasso reply by fresh entreaty the duke return the same answer the unhappy poet have recourse to every friend prince and great man he could think of to join he entreaty he seek refuge in composition but still entreat he occasionally reproach and even banter the duke in some of he letter to he friend all of which doubtless be open but still he entreat flattered adore all to no purpose for seven long year and upward in time he become subject to maniacal illusion so that if he be not actually mad before he be now consider so he be not only visit with sight and sound such as many people have experience whose brain have be over-excited but he fancy himself haunt by a sprite and become the sport of magician the sprite steal he thing and the magician would not let he get well he have a vision such as benvenuto cellinus have of the virgin mary in she glory and he night be so miserable that he eat too much in order that he might sleep when he be temperate he lay awake sometimes he feel as if a horse have throw himself on he have pity on I he say to the friend to whom he give these affect account i be miserable because the world be unjust -lrb- 13 -rrb- the physician advise he to leave off wine but he say he could not do that though he be content to use it in moderation in truth he require something to support he against the physician themselves for they continue to exhaust he strength by they medicine and could not supply the want of it with air and freedom he have ringing in the ear vomit and flux of blood it would be ludicrous if it be not deplorably pathetic to hear so great a man in the commonest medical term now protest against the eternal drench of these practitioner now humbly submit to they and now entreat like a child that they might at least not be so bitter the physician with the duke at they head be as mad for they rhubarb and lancet as the quack in molière and nothing but the very imagination that have nearly sacrifice the poet 's life to they ignorance could have hinder he from dash he head against the wall and leave they to the execration of posterity it be the only occasion in which the noble profession of medicine have not appear in wise and beneficent connexion with the suffering of man of letter why do ferrara possess no brocklesby in those day no garth mead warren or southwood smith tasso enable himself to endure he imprisonment with composition he support it with he poetry and he poem and what alas he have be too proud of during he liberty the praise of he admirer he genius bring he gift from prince and some money from the bookseller : it support he even against he critic during he confinement the _ jerusalem deliver _ be first publish though to he grief from a surreptitious and mutilate copy but it be follow by a storm of applause and if this be succeed by as great a storm of objection and controversy still the healthier part of he faculty be rouse and he exasperate he critic and astonish the world by shew how coolly and learnedly the poor wild imprison genius could discuss the most intricate question of poetry and philosophy the dispute excite by he poem be generally suppose to have do he harm but the conclusion appear to be ill found they divert he thought and make he conscious of he power and he fame i doubt whether he would have be better for entire approbation : it would have put he in a state of elevation unfit for what he have to endure he have find he pen he great solace and he have never employ it so well it would be incredible what a heap of thing he write in this complicated torment of imprisonment sickness and physic if habit and mental activity have not be sufficient to account for much greater wonder he letter to he friend and other would make a good-sized volume those to he critic another sonnet and ode a third and he dialogue after the manner of plato two more perhaps a good half of all he write be write in this hospital of st anne and he study as well as compose and have to read all that be write at the time _ pro _ and _ con _ in the discussion about he _ jerusalem _ which in the latest edition of he work amount to three out of six volume octavo many of the occasion however of he poem as well as letter be most painful to think of they object have be to exchange praise for money and it be distressing in the letter to see he other little want and the fluctuation and mood of he mind now he be angry about some book not restore or some gift promise and delay now he be in want of some book to be lend he now of some praise to comfort he now of a little fresh linen he be very thankful for visit for respectful letter for sweetmeat and greatly puzzle to know what to do with the bad sonnet and panegyric that be send he they be sometimes too much even for the allow ultra courtesy of italian acknowledgment he compliment to most people be vary with astonishing grace and ingenuity he account of he condition often sufficient to bring the tear into the manliest eye and he ceaseless and vain effort to procure he liberation mortify when we think of himself and exasperate when we think of the petty despot who detain he in so long so degrading and so worse than useless a confinement tasso could not always conceal he contempt of he imprisoner from the ducal servant alfonso excel the grandiloquent poet himself in he love of pomp and worship and as he have no particular merit to warrant it he victim banter he love of title he say in a letter to the duke 's steward if it be the pleasure of the most serene signor duke most clement and most invincible to keep I in prison may i beg that he will have the goodness to return certain little thing of mine which he most invincible most clement and most serene highness have so often promise I -lrb- 14 -rrb- but these be rare ebullition of gaiety perhaps rather of bitter despair a playful address to a cat to lend he she eye to write by during some hour in which he happen to be without a light -lrb- for it do not appear to have be deny he -rrb- may be take as more probable evidence of a mind relieve at the moment though the necessity for the relief may have be very sad but the style in which he generally allude to he situation be far different he continually beg he correspondent to pity he to pray for he to attribute he error to infirmity he complain of impaired memory and acknowledge that he have become subject to the delirium formerly attribute to he by the enemy that have help to produce they petition the native city of he ancestor -lrb- bergamo -rrb- to intercede for he with the duke he speak of the writer as this unhappy person and subscribe himself -- most illustrious signor you affectionate servant torquato tasso a prisoner and infirm in the hospital of st anne in ferrara in one of he address to alfonso he say most affectingly : i have sometimes attribute much to myself and consider myself as somebody but now see in how many way imagination have impose on I i suspect that it have also deceive I in this opinion of my own consequence indeed methink the past have be a dream and hence i be resolve to rely on my imagination no longer alfonso make no answer the cause of tasso 's imprisonment and its long duration be among the puzzle of biography the prevail opinion notwithstanding the opposition make to it by serassus and black be that the poet make love to the princess leonora -- perhaps be beloved by she and that she brother the duke punish he for he arrogance this be the belief of he earliest biographer manso who be intimately acquaint with the poet in he latter day and from manso -lrb- though he do not profess to receive the information from tasso but only to gather it from he poem -rrb- it spread over all europe milton take it on trust from he -lrb- 15 -rrb- and so have we english translator hoole and wiffen the abbé de charne however decline to do so -lrb- 16 -rrb- and montaigne who see the poet in st anne 's hospital say nothing of the love at all he attribute he condition to poetical excitement hard study and the meeting of the extreme of wisdom and folly the philosopher however speak of the poet 's have survive he reason and become unconscious both of himself and he work which the reader know to be untrue he do not appear to have converse with tasso the poet be only shewn he probably at a sick moment or by a new and ignorant official -lrb- 17 -rrb- muratorus who be in the service of the este family at modena tell we on the authority of a old acquaintance who know contemporary of tasso that the good torquato finding himself one day in company with the duke and he sister and go close to the princess in order to answer some question which she have put to he be so transport by a impulse more than poetical as to give she a kiss upon which the duke who have observe it turn about to he gentleman and say what a pity to see so great a man distract and so order he to be lock up -lrb- 18 -rrb- but this writer add that he do not know what to think of the anecdote : he neither deny nor admit it tiraboschus who be also in the service of the este family doubt the truth of the anecdote and believe that the duke shut the poet up solely for fear lest he violence should do harm -lrb- 19 -rrb- serassi the second biographer of tasso who dedicate he book to a este princess inimical to the poet 's memory attribute the confinement on he own shewing to the violent word he have utter against he master -lrb- 20 -rrb- walker the author of the _ memoir on italian tragedy _ say that the life by serassus himself induce he to credit the love-story : -lrb- 21 -rrb- so do ginguéné -lrb- 22 -rrb- black forget the age and illness of hundred of enamoured lady and the distraction of lover at all time deride the notion of passion on either side because he argue tasso be subject to frenzy and leonora forty-two year of age and not in good health -lrb- 23 -rrb- what would madame d'houdetot have say to he or mademoiselle l'espinasse or mrs inchbald who use to walk up and down sackville street in order that she might see dr warren 's light in he window foscolo be a believer in the love -lrb- 24 -rrb- sismondus admit it -lrb- 25 -rrb- and rosinus the editor of the latest edition of the poet 's work be passionate for it he wonder how any body can fail to discern it in a number of passage which in truth may mean a variety of other love and he insist much upon certain loose verse -lrb- _ lascivus _ -rrb- which the poet among he various account of the origin of he imprisonment assign as the cause or one of the cause of it -lrb- 26 -rrb- i confess after a reasonable amount of inquiry into this subject that i can find no proof whatsoever of tasso 's have make love to leonora though i think it highly probable i believe the main cause of the duke 's proceedings be the poet 's own violence of behavior and incontinence of speech i think it very likely that in the course of the poetical love-making to various lady which be almost identical in that age with address they in verse torquato whether he be in love or not take more liberty with the princess than alfonso approve and it be equally probable that one of those liberty consist in he indulge he imagination too far it be not even impossible that more gallantry may have be go on at court than alfonso could endure to see allude to especially by a ambitious pen but there be no evidence that such be the case tasso as a gentleman could not have hint at such a thing on the part of a princess of staid reputation and on the other hand the love he speak of as entertain by she for he and warrant the application to she for money in case of he death be too plainly word to mean any thing but love in the sense of friendly regard per amor mio be a idiomatical expression meaning for my sake a strong one no doubt and such as a proud man like alfonso might think a liberty but not at all of necessity a amatory boast if it be its very effrontery and vanity be presumption of its falsehood the lady whom tasso allude to in the passage quote on he first confinement be complain of for she coldness towards he and unless this be itself a gentlemanly blind it might apply to fifty other lady besides the princess the man who assault he in the street and who be suppose to have be the violator of he papers need not have find any secret of love in they the servant at whom he aim the knife or the dagger might be as little connected with such matter and the sonnet which the poet say he write for a friend and which he desire to be bury with he might be alike innocent of all reference to leonora whether he write they for a friend or not leonora 's death take place during the poet 's confinement and lament as she be by the verse-writer accord to custom tasso write nothing on the event this silence have be attribute to the depth of he passion but how be the fact prove and why may it not have be occasion by there have be no passion at all all that appear certain be that tasso speak violent and contemptuous word against the duke that he often speak ill of he in he letter that he endeavor not with perfect ingenuousness to exchange he service for that of another prince that he assert he madness to have be pretend in the first instance purely to gratify the duke 's whim for think it so -lrb- which be one of the reason perhaps why alfonso as he complain would not believe a word be say -rrb- and finally that whether the madness be or be not so pretend it unfortunately become a confirm though milder form of mania during a long confinement alfonso too proud to forgive the poet 's contempt continue thus to detain he partly perhaps because he be not sorry to have a pretext for revenge partly because he do not know what to do with he consistently either with he own or the poet 's safety he have not be generous enough to put tasso above he want he have not address enough to secure he respect he have not merit enough to overlook he reproach if tasso have be as great a man as he be a poet alfonso would not have be reduce to these perplexity the poet would have know how to settle quietly down on he small court-income and wait patiently in the midst of he beautiful vision for what fortune have or have not in store for he but in truth he as well as the duke be weak they make a bad business of it between they and alfonso the second close the account of the este family with the muse by keep he panegyrist seven year in a mad-house to the astonishment of posterity and the destruction of he own claim to renown it do not appear that tasso be confine in any such dungeon as they now exhibit in ferrara the conduct of the prior of the hospital be more doubtful he name be agostino mostus and strangely enough he be the person who have raise a monument to ariosto of whom he be a enthusiastic admirer to this predilection have be attribute he alleged cruelty to the stranger from sorrento who dare to emulate the fame of he idol -- a extraordinary though perhaps not incredible mode of skewing a critic 's regard for poetry but tasso while he lament he severity wonder at it in a man so well breed and so imbue with literature and think it can only have originate in order -lrb- 27 -rrb- perhaps there be fault of temper on both side and mostus not like he office forget the allowance to be make for that of a prisoner and sick man he nephew giulio mostus become strongly attach to the poet and be a great comfort to he at length the time for liberation arrive in the summer of 1586 don vincenzo gonzaga prince of mantua kinsman of the poet 's friend scipio come to ferrara for the purpose of compliment alfonso 's heir on he nuptials the whole court of mantua with hereditary regard for tasso whose father have be one of they ornament be desirous of have he among they and the prince extort alfonso 's permission to take he away on condition -lrb- so hard do he find this late concession to humanity and so fearful be he of lose the dignity of jailor -rrb- that he deliverer should not allow he to quit mantua without obtain leave a young and dear friend he most frequent visitor antonio constantinus secretary to the tuscan ambassador go to st anne 's to prepare the captive by degree for the good news he tell he that he really might look for he release in the course of a few day the sensitive poet now a premature old man of forty-two be throw into a transport of mingled delight and anxiety he have be disappoint so often that he could scarcely believe he good fortune in a day or two he write thus to he visitor you kindness my dear friend have so accustomed I to you precious and frequent visit that i have be all day long at the window expect you come to comfort I as you be wont but since you have not yet arrive and in order not to remain altogether without consolation i visit you with this letter it enclose a sonnet to the ambassador write with a tremble hand and in such a manner that he will not perhaps have less difficulty in read it than i have in write two day afterwards the prince himself come again request of the poet some verse on a give subject express he esteem for he genius and virtue and tell he that on he return to mantua he should have the pleasure of conduct he to that city tasso lay awake almost all night compose the verse and next day enclose they with a letter in another to constantinus ardently beg he to keep the prince in mind of he promise the prince have not forget it and two or three day afterwards the order for the release arrive and tasso quit he prison he have be confine seven year two month and several day he await the prince 's departure for a week or two in he friend 's abode pay no visit probably from inability to endure so much novelty neither be he incline or send for to pay he respects to the duke two such party could hardly have be desirous to look on each other the duke must especially have dislike the thought of it though tasso afterwards fancy otherwise and that he be offend at he non-appearance but he letter unfortunately differ with themselves on this point as on most other about the middle of July 1586 the poet quit ferrara for ever at mantua tasso be greet with all the honor and attention which he love of distinction could desire the good old duke the friend of he father order handsome apartment to be provide for he in the palace the prince make he present of costly attire include perfumed silken hose -lrb- kindred elegancy to the italian glove of queen elizabeth -rrb- the princess and she mother-in-law be declare admirer of he poetry the courtier caress the favorite of they master tasso find literary society he pronounce the very bread and fruit the fish and the flesh excellent the wine be sharp and brisk -lrb- such as he father be fond of -rrb- and even the physician be admirable for he order confection one might imagine if circumstance have not prove the cordial nature of the gonzaga family and the real respect and admiration entertain for the poet 's genius by the greatest man of the time in spite of the rebuke it have receive from alfonso that there have be a confederacy to mock and mystify he after the fashion of the duke and duchess with don quixote -lrb- the only blot by the way in the book of cervante if indeed he do not intend it as a satire on the mystifier -rrb- for a while in short the liberated prisoner think himself happy he correct he prose work resume and finish the tragedy of _ torrismond _ which he have begin some year before correspond with prince and complete and publish a narrative poem leave unfinished by he father torquato be as love a son as mozart or montaigne whenever he have a glimpse of felicity he appear to have associate the idea of it with that of he father in the conclusion of he fragment o del grand ' apennino he affectingly beg pardon of he bless spirit for trouble he with he earthly grief -lrb- 28 -rrb- but alas what have be a indulgence of self-esteem have now become the habit of a disease and in the course of a few month the restless poet begin to make he old discovery that he be not sufficiently care for the prince have no leisure to attend to he the nobility do not yield he the first place or at least -lrb- he add -rrb- they do not allow he to be treat externally as they equal and he candidly confess that he could not live in a place where such be the custom -lrb- 29 -rrb- he feel also naturally enough however well it might have be intend that it be not pleasant to be confine to the range of the city of mantua attend by a servant even though he confess that he be now subject to frenzy he contrived to stay another half-year by help of a brilliant carnival and of the select society of the prince 's court who be evidently most kind to he but at the end of the twelvemonth he be in bergamo among he relation the prince give he leave to go and the cavaliere tasso he kinsman send he chariot on purpose to fetch he here again he find himself at a beautiful country-seat which the family of tasso still possess near that city and here again in the house of he father he propose to be happy have never desire he say any journey more earnestly than this he leave it in the course of a month to return to mantua and it be only to wander still mantua he quit in less than two month to go to rome in spite of the advice of he best friend he vindicate the proceeding by a hope of obtain some permanent settlement from the pope he take loretto by the way to refresh himself with devotion arrive in a transport at rome get nothing from the pope -lrb- the hard-minded sixtus the fifth -rrb- and in the spring of the next year in the triple hope of again embrace he sister and recover the dowry of he mother and the confiscate property of he father he proceed to naple naple be in its most beautiful vernal condition and the neapolitan welcome the poet with all honor and glory but he sister alas be dead he get none of he father 's property nor -lrb- till too late -rrb- any of he mother 's and before the year be out he be again in rome he acquire in naple however another friend as attach to he and as constant in he attention as he beloved constantinus to wit giambattista manso marquis of villa who become he biographer and who be visit and praise for he good office by milton in the society of this gentleman he seem for a short while to have become a new man he enter into field-sport listen to song and music nay dance say manso with the girl -lrb- one fancy a poetical dr johnson with the two country damsel on he knee -rrb- in short good air and freedom and no medicine have conspire with the lesson of disappointment to give he before he die a glimpse of the power to be pleased he have not get rid of all he spiritual illusion even those of a melancholy nature but he take the latter more quietly and have grow so comfortable with the race in general that he encourage they he be so entirely free from he fear of the inquisition and of charge of magic that whereas he have formerly be anxious to shew that he mean nothing but a poetical fancy by the spirit which he introduce as commune with he in he dialogue entitle the _ messenger _ he now maintain its reality against the argument of he friend manso and these argument give rise to the most poetical scene in he history he tell manso that he should have ocular testimony of the spirit 's existence and accordingly one day while they be sit together at the marquis 's fireside he turn he eye say manso towards a window and hold they a long time so intensely on it that when i call he he do not answer at last ` behold ' say he ` the friendly spirit which have courteously come to talk with I lift up you eye and see the truth ' i turn my eye thither immediately -lrb- continue the marquis -rrb- but though i endeavored to look as keenly as i could i beheld nothing but the ray of the sun which stream through the pane of the window into the chamber whilst i still look around without behold any object torquato begin to hold with this unknown something a most lofty converse i hear indeed and see nothing but himself nevertheless he word at one time question at another reply be such as take place between those who reason strictly on some important subject and from what be say by the one the reply of the other might be easily comprehend by the intellect although it be not hear by the ear the discourse be so lofty and marvellous both by the sublimity of they topic and a certain unwonted manner of talk that exalt above myself in a kind of ecstasy i do not dare to interrupt they nor ask tasso about the spirit which he have announce to I but which i do not see in this way while i listen between stupefaction and rapture a considerable time have elapse till at last the spirit depart as i learn from the word of torquato who turn to I say ` from this day forward all you doubt will have vanish from you mind ' ` nay ' say i ` they be rather increase since though i have hear many thing worthy of marvel i have see nothing of what you promise to shew I to dispel they ' he smile and say ` you have see and hear more of he than perhaps -- ' and here he pause fearful of importune he with new question the discourse end and the only conclusion i can draw be what i before say that it be more likely he vision or frenzy will disorder my own mind than that i shall extirpate he true or imaginary opinion -lrb- 30 -rrb- do the smile of tasso at the close of this extraordinary scene and the word which he omit to add signify that he friend have see and hear more perhaps than the poet _ would have like _ to explain do he mean that he himself alone have be see and hear and be author of the whole dialogue perhaps he do for credulity itself can impose -- can take pleasure in see other as credulous as itself on the other hand enough have become know in we day of the phenomenon of morbid perception to render tasso 's actual belief in such vision not at all surprising it be not uncommon for the sanest people of delicate organization to see face before they while go to sleep sometimes in fantastical succession a stronger exercise of this disposition in temperament more delicate will enlarge the face to figure and there can be no question that a imagination so heated as tasso 's so full of the speculation of the later platonist and accompany by a state of body so nervous and a will so bent on its fancy might embody whatever he choose to behold the dialogue he could as easily read in the vision 's look whether he hear it or not with ear if nicholay the prussian bookseller who see crowd of spiritual people go through he room have be a poet and possess of as wilful a imagination as tasso he might have gifted they all with _ speaking countenance _ as easily as with coat and waistcoat swedenborg found a religion on this morbid faculty and the catholic worship a hundred story of the like sort in the life of the saint many of which be equally true and false false in reality though true in supposition luther himself write and study till he see the devil only the great reformer retain enough of he naturally sturdy health and judgment to throw a inkstand at satan 's head -- a thing that philosophy have be do ever since tasso 's principal residence while at naple have be in the beautiful monastery of mount olivet on which the good monk beg he would write they a poem which he do a cold reception at rome and perhaps the difference of the air bring back he old lamentation but here again a monastery give he refuge and he set himself down to correct he former work and compose new one he miss however the comfort of society and amusement which he have experience at naple nevertheless he do not return thither he persuade himself that it be necessary to be in rome in order to expedite the receipt of some book and manuscript from bergamo and other place but he restlessness desire novelty he thus slip back from the neighborhood of rome to the city itself and from the city back to the monastery he friend in both place be probably tire of he instability he think of return to mantua but a present from the grand duke of tuscany accompany by a invitation to he court draw he in one of he short-lived transport to florence he return in spite of the best and most generous reception to rome then leave rome for mantua on invitation from he ever-kind deliverer from prison now the reign duke tire again even of he return to rome then once more to naple where the prince of conca grand admiral of the kingdom lodge and treat he like a equal but he grow suspicious of the admiral and go to live with he friend manso quit manso for rome again be treat with reverence on the way like ariosto by a famous leader of bandit be receive at rome into the vatican itself in the apartment of he friend cintio aldobrandino nephew of the new pope clement the eighth where he hope now seem to be raise at once to they highest and most reasonable pitch but fall ill and be oblige to go back to naple for the benefit of the air a life so strangely erratic to the last -lrb- for mortal illness be approach -rrb- be perhaps unique in the history of man of letter and might be therefore worth record even in that of a less man than tasso but when we recollect that this poet in spite of all he weakness and notwithstanding the enemy they provoke and the friend they cool be really almost adore for he genius in he own time and instead of refuse jewel one day and solicit a ducat the next might have settle down almost any where in quiet and glory if he have but possess the patience to do so it become a association of weakness with power and of adversity with the means of prosperity the absurdity of which admiration itself can only drown in pity he now take up he abode in another monastery that of san severino where he be comfort by the visit of he friend manso to whom he have lately inscribe a dialogue on _ friendship _ for he continue write to the last he have also the consolation such as it be of have the law-suit for he mother 's dowry settle in he favor though under circumstance that render it of little importance and only three month before he death so strangely do fortune seem to take delight in sport with a man of genius who have think both too much of she and too little too much for pomp 's sake and too little in prudence among he new acquaintance be the young marino afterwards the corrupter of italian poetry and the prince of venosa a amateur composer of music the die poet write madrigal for he so much to he satisfaction that be about to marry into the house of este he wish to reconcile he with the duke of ferrara and tasso who to the last moment of he life seem never to have be able to resist the chance of resume old quarter apparently from the double temptation of renounce they write he old master a letter full of respects and regret but the duke who himself die in the course of the year be not to be move from he silence the poet have give he the last possible offence by recast he _ jerusalem _ omit the glory of the house of este and dedicate it to another patron alfonso who have be extravagantly magnificent though not to poet have so weakened he government that the pope wrest ferrara from the hand of he successor and reduce the este family to the possession of modena which it still hold and dishonor the duke and the poet be thus fading away at the same time they never meet again in this world and a new dante would have divide they far enough in the next -lrb- 31 -rrb- the last glimpse of honor and glory be now open in a very grand manner on the poet -- the last and the greatest as if on purpose to give the climax to he disappointment cardinal cintio request the pope to give he the honor of a coronation it have be desire by the poet it seem three year before he be disappoint of it at that time and now that it be grant he be disappoint of the ceremony manso say he no longer care for it and as he feel himself die this be not improbable nevertheless he go to rome for the purpose and though the severity of the winter there delay the intention till spring wealth and honor seem determine to come in flood upon the poor expire great man in order to take away the breath which they have refuse to support the pope assign he a yearly pension of a hundred scudus and the withholder of he mother 's dowry come to a accommodation by which he be to have a annuity of a hundred ducat and a considerable sum in hand he hand be lose strength enough to close upon the money scarcely be the day for the coronation about to dawn when the poet feel he dissolution approach alfonso 's doctor have kill he at last by superinduce a habit of medicine-taking which defeat its purpose he request leave to return to the monastery of st onofrio -- write a farewell letter to constantinus -- receive the distinguished honor of a plenary indulgence from the pope -- say -lrb- in term very like what milton might have use have he die a catholic -rrb- that this be the chariot upon which he hope to go crown not with laurel as a poet into the capitol but with glory as a saint to heaven -- and expire on the 25th of April 1575 and the fifty-first year of he age closely embrace the crucifix and imperfectly utter the sentence begin into thy hand o lord -lrb- 32 -rrb- even after death success mock he for the coronation take place on the senseless dead body the head be wreathe with laurel a magnificent toga delay for a while the shroud and a procession take place through the city by torchlight all the inhabitant pour forth to behold it and painter crowd over the bier to gaze on the poet 's lineament from which they produce a multitude of portrait the corpse be then bury in the church of st onofrio and magnificent monument talk of which never appear manso however obtain leave to set up a modest tablet and eight year afterwards a ferrarese cardinal -lrb- bevilacqua -rrb- make what amends he could for he countryman by erect the stately memorial which be still to be see poor illustrious tasso weak enough to warrant pity from he inferior -- great enough to overshadow in death he once-fancied superior he have be a by-word for the misfortune of genius : but genius be not he misfortune it be he only good and might have bring he all happiness it be the want of genius as far as it go and apart from martyrdom for conscience ' sake which produce misfortune even to genius itself -- the want of as much wit and balance on the common side of thing as genius be suppose to confine to the uncommon manso have leave a minute account of he friend 's person and manners he be tall even among the tall have a pale complexion sunken cheek lightish brown hair head bald at the top large blue eye square forehead big nose incline towards the mouth lip pale and thin white tooth delicate white hand long arm broad chest and shoulder leg rather strong than fleshy and the body altogether better proportion than in good condition the result nevertheless be a aspect of manly beauty and expression particularly in the countenance the dignity of which mark he for a extraordinary person even to those who do not know he he demeanor be grave and deliberate he laugh seldom and though he tongue be prompt he delivery be slow and he be accustom to repeat he last word he be expert in all manly exercise but not equally graceful and the same defect attend he otherwise striking eloquence in public assembly he put to flight the assassin in ferrara give he such a reputation for courage that there go about in he honor a popular couplet collum penna e colla spada nessun val quanto torquato for the sword as well as pen tasso be the man of man he be a little eater but not averse to wine particularly such as combined piquancy with sweetness and he always dress in black manso 's account be still more particular and yet it do not tell all for tasso himself inform we that he stammer and be near-sighted -lrb- 33 -rrb- and a neapolitan writer who know he add to the near-sightedness some visible defect in the eye -lrb- 34 -rrb- i should doubt from what tasso say in he letter whether he be fond of speak in public notwithstanding he _ début _ in that line with the _ fifty amorous conclusions_nor do he appear to have be remarkable for he conversation manso have leave a collection of one hundred of he pithy saying -- a suspicious amount and unfortunately more than warrant the suspicion for almost every one of they be traceable to some other man they come from the greek and latin philosopher and the apothegm of erasmus the two follow have the greatest appearance of be genuine : a greek complain that he have speak ill of he country and maintain that all the virtue in the world have issue out of it the poet assent with the addition that they have not leave one behind they a foolish young fellow garnish with a number of golden chain come into a room where he be and be overhear by he exclaim be this the great man that be mad tasso say yes but that people have never put on he more than one chain at a time he character may be gather but not perhaps entirely from what have be write of he life for some of he earlier letter shew he to have be not quite so grave and refine in he way of talk as reader of the _ jerusalem _ might suppose he be probably at that time of life not so scrupulous in he moral as he profess to be during the greater part of it he mother be think to have die of chagrin and impatience at be separate so long from she husband and not know what to do to save she dowry from she brother and i take she son to have combine he mother 's ultra-sensitive organization with he father 's worldly imprudence and unequal spirit the addition of the nervous temperament of one parent to the aspiring nature of the other give rise to the poet 's tremble eagerness for distinction and torquato 's very love for they both hinder he from see what should have be correct in the infirmity which he inherit fall from the highest hope of prosperity into the most painful affliction he thus want solid principle of action to support he and be force to retreat upon a excess of self-esteem which allow he pride to become a beggar and he naturally kind loving just and heroical disposition to condescend to almost every species of inconsistency the duke of ferrara he complain do not believe a word he say -lrb- 35 -rrb- and the fact be that partly from disease and partly from a want of courage to look he defect in the face he behold the same thing in so many different light and accord as it suit he at the moment that without intend falsehood he statement be really not to be rely on he degrade even he verse sometimes with panegyric for interest 's sake sometimes out of weak wish to oblige of which he be afterwards ashamed and with the exception of constantinus we can not be sure that any one person praise in they retain he regard in he last day he suspicion make he a kind of rousseau but he be more amiable than the genevese and far from be in the habit of talk against old acquaintance whatever he might have think of they it be observable not only that he never marry but he tell manso he have lead a life of entire continence ever since he enter the wall of he prison be then in he thirty-fifth year -lrb- 36 -rrb- be this out of fidelity to some mistress or the consequence of a previous life the reverse of continent or be it from some principle of superstition he have become a devotee apparently out of a dread of disbelief and he remain extremely religious for the rest of he day the two unhappiest of italian poet tasso and dante be the two most superstitious as for the once formidable question concern the comparative merit of this poet and ariosto which anticipate the modern quarrel of the classical and romantic school some idea of the treatment which tasso experience may be conceive by suppose all that use to be sarcastic and bitter in the periodical party-criticism among ourselves some thirty year back collect into one huge vial of wrath and pour upon the new poet 's head even the great galileo who be a man of wit breed up in the pure tuscan school of bernus and casa and who be a idolator of ariosto write when he be young a review of the _ jerusalem deliver _ which it be painful to read it be so unjust and contemptuous -lrb- 37 -rrb- but now that the only final arbiter posterity have accept both the poet the dispute be surely the easiest thing in the world to settle not indeed with prejudice of creed or temperament but before any judge thoroughly sympathise with the two claimant its solution be the principle of the greater include the less for ariosto err only by have a unbounded circle to move in he sympathy be unlimited and those who think he inferior to tasso only do so in consequence of they own want of sympathy with the vivacity that degrade he in they eye ariosto can be as grave and exalted as tasso when he please and he could do a hundred thing which tasso never attempt he be as different in this respect as shakspeare from milton he have far more knowledge of mankind than tasso and he be superior in point of taste but it be painful to make disadvantageous comparison of one great poet with another let we be thankful for tasso 's enchanted garden without be force to vindicate the universal world of he predecessor suffice it to bear in mind that the grave poet himself agree with the rest of the italian in call the ferrarese the divine ariosto a title which have never be popularly give to he rival the _ jerusalem deliver _ be the history of a crusade relate with poetic license the infidel be assist by unlawful art and the libertinism that bring scandal on the christian be convert into youthful susceptibility lead away by enchantment the author propose to combine the ancient epic poet with ariosto or a simple plot and uniformly dignified style with romantic variety of adventure and the luxuriance of fairy-land he do what he propose to do but with a judgment inferior to virgil 's nay in point of the interdependence of the adventure to ariosto and with far less general vigor the mixture of affectation with he dignity be so frequent that whether boileau 's famous line about tasso 's tinsel and virgil 's gold do or do not mean to imply that the _ jerusalem _ be nothing but tinsel and the _ æneid _ all gold it be certain that the tinsel be so interwoven with the gold as to render it more of a rule than a exception and put a provoke distance between tasso 's epic pretension and those of the greatest master of the art people who take for grant the conceit because of the wildness of ariosto and the good taste because of the regularity of tasso just assume the reverse of the fact it be a rare thing to find a conceit in ariosto and where it do exist it be most likely defensible on some shakspearian ground of subtle propriety open tasso in almost any part particularly the love-scene and it be marvellous if before long you do not see the conceit vexatiously interfere with the beauty oh maraviglia amor the appena è nato già grande volum e già trionfa armato canto i st 47 oh miracle love be

-- be to be meet with more or less throughout the poem i have no doubt they be the proximate cause of that general corruption of taste which be afterwards complete by marino the acquaintance and ardent admirer of tasso when a boy they have be lay to the charge of petrarch but without enter into the question how far and in what instance conceit may not be natural to lover haunt as petrarch be with one idea and see it in every thing they behold what have the great epic poet to do with the fault of the lyrical and what be to be say for he standing in need of the excuse of bad example homer and milton be in no such want virgil would not have copy the trick of ovid there be a effeminacy and self-reflection in tasso analogous to he rinaldo in the enchanted garden where the hero wear a looking-glass by he side in which he contemplate he sophisticated self and the meretricious beauty of he enchantress -lrb- 38 -rrb- agreeably to this tendency to weakness the style of tasso when not support by great occasion -lrb- and even the occasion itself sometimes fail he -rrb- be too apt to fall into tameness and common-place -- to want movement and picture while at the same time with singular defect of enjoyment it do not possess the music which might be expect from a lyrical and voluptuous poet bernardo prophesy of he son that however he might surpass he in other respects he would never equal he in sweetness and he seem to have judge he rightly i have meet with a passage in torquato 's prose writings -lrb- but i can not lay my hand on it -rrb- in which he express a singular predilection for verse full of the same vowel he seem if i remember rightly to have regard it not merely as a please variety which it be on occasion but as a reign principle voltaire -lrb- i

he greatest poem with it be too often discordant in the rest of he versification it have be think that milton might have take from the italian the grand musical account to which he turn a list of proper name as in he enumeration of realm and deity but i have be surprise to find how little the most musical of language appear to have suggest to its poet anything of the sort i be not aware of it indeed in any poet but we own all other from homer with he catalogue of leader and ship down to metastasio himself though he write for music appear to have overlook this opportunity of play a voluntary of fine sound where they have no other theme on which to modulate its inventor as far as i be aware be that great poet marlowe -lrb- 39 -rrb- there be fault of invention as well as style in the _ jerusalem _ the talk bird or bird that sing with a human voice -lrb- canto iv 13 -rrb- be a piece of inverisimilitude which the author perhaps think justifiable by the speaking horse of the ancient but the latter be move supernaturally for the occasion and for a very fine occasion tasso 's bird be a mere bear contradiction to nature and for no necessity the vulgar idea of the devil with horn and a tail -lrb- though the retention of it argue a genius in tasso very inferior to that of milton -rrb- be defensible i think on the plea of the german critic that malignity should be make a thing low and deform but as much can not be say for the storehouse in heaven where st michael 's spear be keep with which he slew the dragon and the trident which be use for make earthquake -lrb- canto vii st 81 -rrb- the tomb which supernaturally come out of the ground inscribe with the name and virtue of sueno -lrb- canto viii st 39 -rrb- be worthy only of a pantomime and the wizard in robe with beech-leaf on he head who walk dry-shod on water and superfluously help the knight on they way to armida 's retirement -lrb- xiv 33 -rrb- be almost as ludicrous as the burlesque of the river-god in the _ voyage _ of bachaumont and chapelle but let we not wonder nevertheless at the effect which the _ jerusalem _ have have upon the world it could not have have it without great nature and power rinaldo in spite of he aberration with armida know the path to renown and so do he poet tasso 's epic with all its fault be a noble production and justly consider one of the poem of the world each of those poem hit some one great point of universal attraction at least in they respective country and among the giver of fame in other homer 's poem be that of action dante 's of passion virgil 's of judgment milton 's of religion spenser 's of poetry itself ariosto 's of animal spirit -lrb- i do not mean as respects gaiety only but in strength and readiness of accord with the whole play of nature -rrb- tasso look round with a ultra-sensitive temperament and a ambition which require encouragement and he poem be that of tenderness every thing incline to this point in he circle with the tremulousness of the needle love be its all in all even to the design of the religious war which be to rescue the sepulchre of the god of charity from the hand of the unlove he hero be all in love at least those on the right side he leader godfrey notwithstanding he prudence narrowly escape the passion and be full of a loving consideration he amazon clorinda inspire the truest passion and die take she lover 's hand he erminium be all love for a enemy he enchantress armida fall from pretended love into real and forsake she religion for its sake a old father -lrb- canto ix -rrb- lose he five son in battle and die on they dead body of a wound which he have provoke on purpose tancr can not achieve the enterprise of the enchanted forest because he dead mistress seem to come out of one of the tree olindo think it happiness to be martyr at the same stake with sophronium the reconciliation of rinaldo with he enchantress take place within a few stanza of the close of the poem as if contest its interest with religion the _ jerusalem deliver _ in short be the favorite epic of the young : all the lover in europe have love it the french have forgive the author he conceit for the sake of he gallantry : he be the poet of the gondolier and spenser the most luxurious of he brethren plunder he bower of bliss read tasso 's poem by this gentle light of he genius and you pity he twentyfold and know not what excuse to find for he jailer the story translate in the present volume though include war and magic be all love-story they be not select on that account they suggest themselves for selection as contain most of the finest thing in the poem they be conduct with great art and the character and affection happily vary the first -lrb- _ olindo and sophronium _ -rrb- be perhaps unique for the hopelessness of its commencement -lrb- i mean with regard to the lover -rrb- and the perfect and at the same time quite probable felicity of the conclusion there be no reason to believe that the staid and devout sophronium would have love she adorer at all but for the circumstance that first doom they both to a shocking death and then send they with perfect warrant from the stake to the altar clorinda be a amazon the idea of whom as such it be impossible for we to separate from very repulsive and unfeminine image yet under the circumstance of the story we call to mind in she behalf the possibility of a joan of arc 's have loved and be beloved and she death be a surprising and most affect variation upon that of agrican in boiardo tasso 's enchantress armida be a variation of the angelica of the same poet combine with ariosto 's alcina but she passionate voluptuousness make she quite a new character in regard to the one and she be as different from the paint hag of the _ orlando _ as youth beauty and patriotic intention can make she she be not very sentimental but all the passion in the world have sympathise with she and it be manly and honest in the poet not to let she paganism and vehemence hinder he from do justice to she claim as a human being and a desert woman she fate be leave in so please a state of doubt that we gladly avail ourselves of it to suppose she marry to rinaldo and become the mother of a line of christian prince i wish they have treat she poet half so well as she would infallibly have treat he herself but the singer of the crusade can be strong as well as gentle you discern in he battle and single combat the poet ambitious of renown and the accomplished swordsman the duel of tancr and argante in which the latter be slay be as earnest and fiery write throughout as truth and passion could desire that of tancr and clorinda be also very powerful as well as affect and the whole siege of jerusalem be admirable for the strength of its interest every body know the grand verse -lrb- not however quite original -rrb- that summons the devil to council chiama glus abitator & c and the still grander though less original one describe the desolation of time giace l'alta cartago -lrb- 40 -rrb- the forest fill with supernatural terror by a magician in order that the christian may not cut wood from it to make they engine of war be one of the happiest piece of invention in romance it be found in as true human feeling as those of ariosto and be make a admirable instrument for the aggrandizement of the character of rinaldo godfrey 's attestation of all time and of the host of heaven when he address he army in the first canto be in the highest spirit of epic magnificence so be the appearance of the celestial army together with that of the soul of the slay christian warrior in the last canto where they issue forth in the air to assist the entrance into the conquer city the classical poet be turn to great and frequent account throughout the poem and yet the work have a strong air of originality partly owe to the subject partly to the abundance of love-scene and to a certain compactness in the treatment of the main story notwithstanding the luxuriance of the episode the _ jerusalem deliver _ be stately well-ordered full of action and character sometimes sublime always elegant and very interesting-more so i think as a whole and in a popular sense than any other story in verse not except the _ odyssey _ for the exquisite domestic attractiveness of the second homeric poem be injure like the hero himself by too many diversion from the main point there be a interest it be true in that very delay but we become too much use to the disappointment in the epic of tasso the reader constantly desire to learn how the success of the enterprise be to be bring about and he scarcely lose sight of any of the person but he wish to see they again even in the love-scenes tender and absorb as they be we feel that the hero be fighter or go to fight when you be introduce to armida in the bower of bliss it be by warrior who come to take she lover away to battle one of the reason why tasso hurt the style of he poem by a manner too lyrical be that notwithstanding its deficiency in sweetness he be one of the profusest lyrical writer of he nation and always have he feeling turn in upon himself i be not sufficiently acquaint with he ode and sonnet to speak of they in the gross but i may be allow to express my belief that they possess a great deal of fancy and feeling it have be wonder how he could write so many consider the trouble he go through but the experience be the reason the constant succession of hope fear want gratitude love and the necessity of employ he imagination account for all some of he sonnet such as those on the countess of scandiano 's lip -lrb- quel labbro & c -rrb- the one to stigliano conclude with the affect mention of himself and he lost harp that begin io veggio in cielo scintillar le stelle recur to my mind oftener than any other except dante 's tanto gentile and filicaium 's _ lament on italy _ and with the exception of a few of the more famous ode of petrarch and one or two of filicaium 's and guidus 's i know of none in italian like several of tasso 's include he fragment o del grand ' apennino and the exquisite chorus on the _ golden age _ which strike a note in the heart of the world he _ aminta _ the chief pastoral poem of italy though with the exception of that ode not equal in passage to the _ faithful shepherdess _ -lrb- which be a pan to it compare with a beardless shepherd -rrb- be elegant interesting and as superior to guarinus 's more sophisticate yet still beautiful _ pastor fido _ as a first thought may be suppose to be to its emulator the objection of its be too elegant for shepherd he anticipate and nullify by make love himself account for it in a charming prologue of which the god be the speaker : queste selve oggus ragionar d'amore s ` udranno in nuova guisa e ben parassi che la mia deità sia quì presente in se medesma e non ne ' suoi ministrus spirerò nobil sensus à rozzus pettus raddolcirò nelle lor lingue il

it may please I do i equalise and ` tis my crowning glory and great miracle to make the rural pipe as eloquent even as the subtlest harp i ought not to speak of tasso 's other poetry or of he prose for i have read little of either though as they be not popular with he countryman a foreigner may be pardon for think he classical tragedy _ torrismondo _ not attractive -- he _ sette giornate _ -lrb- seven day of the creation -rrb- still less so -- and he platonical and critical discourse better fill with authority than reason tasso be a lesser kind of milton enchant by the siren we discern the weak part of he character more or less in all he writings but we see also the irrepressible elegance and superiority of the mind which in spite of all weakness be feel to tower above its age and to draw to it the homage as well as the resentment of prince -lrb- footnote 1 : my authority for this notice be black 's _ life of tasso _ -lrb- 2 vol 4to 1810 -rrb- he original serassus _ vita di

at word so noble and piteous as these the pagan themselves who stand within hearing begin to weep the christian weep too but in voice more lowly even the king feel a emotion of pity but disdain to give way to it he turn aside and withdraw the maiden alone partake not of the common grief she for whom every body weep weep not for herself the flame be now begin to approach the stake when there appear come through the crowd a warrior of noble mien habit in the arm of another country the tiger which form the crest of he helmet draw all eye to it for it be a cognizance well know the people begin to think that it be a heroine instead of a hero which they see even the famous clorinda nor do they err in the supposition a despiser of feminine habit have clorinda be from she childhood she disdain to put she hand to the needle and the distaff she renounce every soft indulgence every timid retirement think that virtue could be safe wherever it go in its own courageous heart and so she arm she countenance with pride and pleased herself with make it stern but not to the effect she look for for the sternness itself please while yet a child she little right hand would control the bit of the charger and she wield the sword and spear and harden she limb with wrestling and make they supple for the race and then as she grow up she track the footstep of the bear and lion and follow the trumpet to the war and in those and in the depths of the forest she seem a wild creature to mankind and a man to the wildest creature she have now come out of persium to wreak she displeasure on the christian who have already feel the sharpness of she sword and as she arrive near this assemble multitude death be the first thing that meet she eye but in a shape so perplexing that she look narrowly to discern what it be and then spur she horse towards the scene of action the crowd give way as she approach and she halt as she enter the circle round the stake and sit gaze on the youth and maiden she wonder to see the male victim lament while the female be mute but indeed she see that he be weep not out of grief but pity or at least not out of grief for himself and as to the maiden she observe she to be so wrapt up in the contemplation of the heaven at which she be gaze that she appear to have already take leave of earth pity touch the heart of the amazon and the tear come into she eye she feel sorry for both the victim but chiefly for the one that say nothing she turn to a white-headed man beside she and say what be this who be these two person whom crime or they ill fortune have bring hither the man answer she briefly but to the purpose and she discern at once that both must be innocent she therefore determine to save they she dismount and set the example of put a stop to the flame and then say to the officer let nobody continue this work till i have speak to the king rest assure he will hold you guiltless of the delay the officer obey be strike with she air of confidence and authority and she go straight towards the king who have hear of she arrival and who be come to bid she welcome i be clorinda she say thou knowest I then thou knowest sir one who be desirous to defend

no business in a mussulman temple much less the idol of unbeliever and my opinion be that the miracle be the work of mahomet himself out of scorn and hatred of the contamination let ismeno prefer he craft if he will to the weapon of a man but let he not take upon himself the defense of a nation of warrior the warlike damsel be silent and the king though he could with difficulty conquer he anger yet do so to please he guest they be free say he i can deny nothing to such a petitioner whether it be justice or not to absolve they absolved they be if they be innocent i pronounce they so if guilty i concede they pardon at these word the youth and the maiden be set free and blissful indeed be the fortune of olindo for love so prove as he awake love in the noble bosom of sophronium and so he pass

clorinda take they way down the hill of jerusalem and quit the gate go stealthily towards the site of the tower but its ever-watchful guard be alarm they demand the watch-word and not receive it cry out to arm to arm the dauntless adventurer plunge forwards with they sword they dash aside every assailant pitch the ball of sulphur into the machine and in a short time in the midst of a daring conflict have the pleasure of see the smoke and the flame arise and the whole tower blaze to its destruction a terrible sight it be to the christian wake up they come crowd to the place and the two companion notwithstanding they skill and audacity be compel to make a retreat the besiege with the king at they head now arrive also crowd on the wall and the gate be open to let the adventurer in the soldan issue forth at the same moment to cover the retreat argante be force through the gate by clorinda in spite of himself and she but for a luckless antagonist would have follow he but a soldier aim at she a last blow she rush back to give the man he death and in the confusion of the moment the warder believe she to have enter shut up the gate and the heroine be leave without behind clorinda be the gate -- before and round about she be a host of foe and surely at that moment she think that she life be draw to its end find however that she dark armor befriend she in the tumult she mingle with the enemy as though she have be one of themselves and so by degree pick she way through the confusion cause by the fire as the wolf with its bloody mouth seek covert in the wood even so clorinda get clear out of the multitude into the darkness and the open country not however so clear alas but that tancr perceive she -- tancr she foe in creed but she adoring lover whose heart she have conquer in the midst of strife and whose passion for she she know but now she know not that he have see she nor do he poor valiant wretch know that the knight in black armor whom he pursue be a woman and clorinda tancr have see the warrior strike down the assailant at the gate he have watch he as he pick he way to escape and clorinda now hear the unknown tancred come swiftly on horseback behind she as she be speed round towards another gate in hope of be let in the heroine at length turn and say how now friend -- what be thy business death answer the pursuer thou shalt have it reply the maiden the knight as he enemy be on foot dismount in order to render the combat equal and they sword be draw in fury and the fight begin -lrb- 4 -rrb- worthy of the brightest day-time be that fight -- worthy of a theater full of valiant be-holder be not displeased o night that i draw it out of thy bosom and set it in the serene light of renown : the splendor will but the more exhibit the great shade of thy darkness no trial be this of skill -- no contest of ward and traverse and take heed -- no artful interchange of blow now pretend now give in earnest now glance night-time and rage fling aside all consideration the sword horribly clash and hammer on one another not a cut descend in vain -- not a thrust be without substance shame and fury aggravate one another every blow become fiercer than the last they close -- they could use they blade no longer they dash the pummel of they sword at one another 's face they but and shoulder with helm and buckler three time the man throw he arm round the woman with other embrace than those of love -- three time they return to they sword and cut and slash one another 's bleed body till at length they be oblige to hold back for the purpose of take breath tancr and clorinda stand front one another in the darkness lean on they sword for want of strength the last star in the heaven be fading in the tinge of dawn and tancr saw that he enemy have lose more blood than himself and it make he proud and joyful oh foolish mind of we human elate at every fancy of success poor wretch for what dost thou rejoice how sad will be thy victory what a misery to look back upon thy delight every drop of that blood will be pay for with world of tear dimly thus look at one another stand the combatant bleed a while in peace at length tancr who wish to know he antagonist say it have be no good fortune of ours to be compel thus to fight where nobody can behold we but we have at least become acquaint with the good sword of one another let I request therefore -lrb- if to request any thing at such a time be not unbecoming -rrb- that i may be no stranger to thy name permit I to learn whatever be the result who it be that shall honor my death or my victory i be not accustomed answer the fierce maiden to disclose who i be nor shall i disclose it now suffice to hear that thou seest before thee one of the burner of the tower tancr be exasperate at this discovery in a evil moment cry he hast thou say it thy silence and thy speech alike disgust I into the combat again they dash feeble as they be ferocious indeed be the strife in which skill be not think of and strength itself be dead in which valor rage instead of contend and feebleness become hate and fury oh the gate of blood that be set open in wound upon wound if life itself do not come pour forth it be only because scorn withhold it as in the ægean sea when the south and north wind have lose the violence of they strength the billow do not subside nevertheless but retain the noise and magnitude of they first motion so the continue impulse of the combatant carry they still against one another hurl they into mutual injury though they have scarcely life in they body -lrb- 5 -rrb- and now the fatal hour have come when clorinda must die the sword of tancr be in she bosom to the very hilt the stomacher under the cuirass which enclose it be fill with a hot flood she leg give way beneath she she fall -- she feel that she be depart the conqueror with a still threatening countenance prepare to follow up he victory and tread on she as she lie but a new spirit have come upon she -- the spirit which call the beloved of heaven to itself and speak in a sorrowing voice she thus utter she last word : my friend thou hast conquer -- i forgive thee forgive thou I not for my body 's sake which fear nothing but for the sake alas of my soul baptise I i beseech thee there be something in the voice as the die person speak these word that go he know not why to the heart of tancr the tear force themselves into he eye not far off there be a little stream and the conqueror go to it and fill he helmet and return prepared for the pious office by unlace he adversary 's helmet he hand tremble when he first behold the forehead though he do not yet know it but when the vizor be all down and the face disclose he remain without speech and motion oh the sight oh the recognition he do not die he summon up all the power within he to support he heart for that moment he resolve to hold up he duty above he misery and give life with the sweet water to she whom he have slay with sword he dip he finger in it and mark she forehead with the cross and repeat the word of the sacred office and while he be repeat they the sufferer change countenance for joy and smile and seem to say in the cheerfulness of she departure the heaven be open -- i go in peace a paleness and a shade together then come over she countenance as if lily have be mix with violet she look up at heaven and heaven itself might be think for very tenderness to be look at she and then she raise a little she hand towards that of the knight -lrb- for she could not speak -rrb- and so give it he in sign of goodwill and with he pressure of it she soul pass away and she seem asleep but tancr no sooner behold she dead than all the strength of mind which he have summon up to support he fall flat on the instant he would have give way to the most frantic outcry but life and speech seem to be shut up in one point in he heart despair seize he like death and he fall senseless beside she and surely he would have die indeed have not a party of he countryman happen to come up they be look for water and have find it and they discover the body at the same time the leader know tancr by he arm the beautiful body of clorinda though he deem she a pagan he would not leave expose to the wolf so he direct they both to be carry to the pavilion of tancr and there place in separate chamber dreadful be the waking of tancr -- not for the solemn whisper around he -- not for he ache wound terrible as they be -- but for the agony of the recollection that rush upon he he would have go stagger out of the pavilion to seek the remains of he clorinda and save they from the wolf but he friend tell he they be at hand under the curtain of he own tent a gleam of pleasure shot across he face and be stagger into the chamber but when he behold the body gore with he own hand and the face calm indeed but calm like a pale night without star he tremble so that he would have sink to the ground but for he supporter o sweet face he exclaim thou mayst be calm now but what be to calm I o hand that be hold up to I in sign of peace and forgiveness to what have i bring thee wretch that i be i do not even weep mine eye be as cruel as my hand my blood shall be shed instead and with these word he begin tear off the bandage which the surgeon have put upon he and he thrust he finger into he wound and would have slay himself thus outright have not the pain make he faint away he be then take back to he own chamber godfrey come in the mean time with the venerable hermit peter and when the sufferer awake they address he in kind word which even he impatience respect but it be not to be calm till the preacher put on the terror of religion remonstrate with he as a ingrate to god and threaten he with the doom of a sinner the tear then creep into he eye and he try to be patient and in some degree be so -- only break out ever and anon now into exclamation of horror and now into fond lamentation talk as if with the shade of he beloved thus lay tancr for day together ever woful till fall asleep one night towards the dawn the shade of clorinda do indeed appear to he more beautiful than ever and clothe in light and joy she seem to stoop and wipe the tear from he eye and then say behold how happy i be behold I o beloved friend and see how happy and bright and beautiful i be and consider that it be all owe to thyself 'twa thou that take ` st I out of the false path and make I worthy of admission among saint and angel there in heaven i love and rejoice and there i look to see thee in thine appoint time after which we shall both love the great god and one another for ever and ever be faithful and command thyself and look to the end for lo as far as it be permit to a bless spirit to love mortality even now i love thee with these word the eye of the vision grow bright beyond mortal beauty and then it turn and be hide in the depth of its radiance and disappear tancr sleep a quiet sleep and when he awake he give himself patiently up to the will of the physician and the remains of clorinda be gather into a noble tomb -lrb- 6 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : st george -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : this

chief be no less so of he gallantry in war and of he qualification for be he commander gernando be a haughty barbarian who think that every sort of pre-eminence be confine to prince of blood royal he hear of the proposal of eustace with a disgust that break into the unworthiest expression he even vent it in public in the open part of the camp when rinaldo be stand at no great distance and the word come to the hero 's ear and break down the tranquillity of he contempt the latter dart towards he sword in hand and defy he to single combat gernando behold death before he but make a show of valor and stand on he defense a thousand sword leap forth to back he mix with as many voice and half the camp of godfrey try to withhold the impetuous youth who be for decide he quarrel without the general

the friend of the slay man increase he anger against rinaldo by charge he with all the blame of the catastrophe the hero 's friend tancr assuage it somewhat by disclose the truth and then venture to ask pardon for the outbreak but the wise commander skewed so many reason why such a offence could not be overlook and he countenance express such a determination to resent it that the gallant youth hasten secretly to he friend and urge he to quit the camp till he service should be need rinaldo at first call for he arm and be bent on resist every body who come to seize he have it be even godfrey himself but tancr shew he how unjust that would be and how fatal to the christian cause he consent with a ill grace to depart he would take nobody with he but two squire and he go away rage with a sense of ill requital for he achievement but resolve to prove they value by destroy every infidel prince that he could encounter armida now try in vain to make a impression on the heart of godfrey he be insensible to all she device but she succeed in quit the camp with she ten champion lot be draw to determine who should go and all who fail to be in the list -- eustace among they -- be so jealous of the rest that at night-time after the other have be long on the road they set out to overtake they each by himself and all in violation of they soldierly word the ten oppose they as they come up but to no purpose armida reconcile they all in appearance by feign to be devote to each in secret and thus she ride on with they many a mile till she come to a castle on the dead sea where she be accustom to practice she unfriendliest art meanwhile news come to godfrey that he egyptian enemy be at hand with a great fleet and that he caravan of provision have be take by the robber of the desert

they exult be leave the fair and bigoted magician but she little guess what a new fortune await they on the road the discord with which the power of evil have second she endeavor to weaken the christian camp have turn in this instance against herself it have make rinaldo a wanderer it have bring he wanderings into this very path and he now meet the prisoner and bid defiance to the escort a battle ensue in which the hero win he accustomed victory the christian receive the armor of they foe joyfully take they way back to the camp and one of the escort who escape the slaughter return to armida with news of the deliverance of she captive the mortified enchantress take horse and go in pursuit of rinaldo with wrath and vengeance in she heart she track he from place to place till she know he must arrive on the bank of the oronte and there make a stealthy circuit she cast a spell and lay in wait for he in a little island which divide the stream in two -lrb- 3 -rrb- rinaldo come up with he squire he behold on the bank a pillar of white marble and beside it on the water a little boat the pillar present a inscription invite traveller to cross to the island and behold a wonder of the world the hero accept the invitation but as the boat be too small to hold more than one person and the circumstance probably a appeal to he courage he bid he squire wait for he and proceed by himself on reach the island and cast he eye eagerly round about the adventurer could discern nothing but tree and grotto flower and grass and water he think himself trifle with but as the spot be beautiful and refreshing he take off he helmet resolve to stay a little and repose he cross to the farther side of the island and lay down on the river-side on a sudden he observe the water bubble and gurgle in a manner that be very strange and presently the top of a head arise with beautiful hair then the face of a damsel then the bosom the fair creature stand half out of the stream and warble a song so luxurious and so lull that the little wind there be seem to fall in order to listen and the young warrior be so drowse with the sweetness that languor creep through all he sens and he sleep armida come from out a thicket and look on he she have resolve that he should perish but when she see how placidly he breathe and what a intimation of beautiful eye there be in he very eyelid she hang over he still look in a little while she sit down by he side always look she hang over he as narcissus do over the water and indignation melt out of she heart she cool he face with she veil she make a fan of it she give herself up to the worship of those hide eye of a enemy she become a lover -lrb- 4 -rrb- armida gather trail of rose and lily from the thicket around she and cast a spell on they and make band with which she fetter he sleep limb and then she call she nymph and they put he into she ear and she go away with he through the air far off even to one of the fortunate island in the great ocean where she jealousy assist by she art would be in dread of no visitor no discovery she bear he to the top of a mountain and cast a spell about the mountain to make the top lovely and the side inaccessible she put shape of wild beast and monster in the wood of the lowest region and heap of ice in the second and alluring and betray shape and enchantment towards the summit and round the summit she put wall and labyrinth of inextricable error and in the heart of these be a palace by a lake and the loveliest of garden mere rinaldo be awake by love and beauty and here for the present he be left part the third the terror of the enchanted forest meantime the siege of the holy city have go on with various success on either side but chiefly to the loss of the christian the machination of satan be prevail rinaldo in he absence be think to have be slay by the contrivance of godfrey which nearly produce a revolt of the force godfrey be himself wound in battle by clorinda : and now the great wooden tower be burnt and clorinda slay in consequence -lrb- as you have hear in another place -rrb- which oppress the courage of tancr with melancholy on the other hand the power of evil be far from be as prosperous as they wish they have lose the soul of clorinda they have see godfrey heal by a secret messenger from heaven who dropt celestial balsam into he wound they have see the return of armida 's prisoner who have arrive just in time to change the fortune of a battle and drive the pagan back within they wall and worse than all they have again feel the arm of st michael who have threaten they with worse consequence if they reappear in the contest the fiend however have colleague on earth who plot for they meanwhile the christian have set about make another tower but in this proceed they be thwart by the enchanter ismeno who cast he spell to better purpose this time than he have do in the affair of the steal image the forest in which the christian obtain wood for these engine lay in a solitary valley not far from the camp it be very old dark and intricate and have already a evil fame as the haunt of impure spirit no shepherd ever take he flock there no pagan would cut a bough from it no traveller approach it unless he have lose he way : he make a large circuit to avoid it and point it out anxiously to he companion the necessity of the christian compel they to defy this evil repute of the forest and ismeno hasten to oppose they he draw he line and utter he incantation and call on the spirit whom st michael have rebuke bid they come and take charge of the forest -- every one of he tree as a soul of its body the spirit delay at first not only for dread of the great angel but because they resent the bidding of mortality even in they own cause the magician however persist and he spell become too powerful to be withstand presently they come pour in by myriad occupy the whole place and render the very approach to it a task of fear and labor the first party of man that come to cut wood be unable to advance when they behold the tree but turn like child and become the mockery of the camp godfrey send they back with a choose squadron to animate they to the work but the squadron themselves however boldly they affect to proceed lead no sooner approach the spot than they find reason to forgive the fear of the woodcutter the earth shake a great wind begin rise with a sound of water and presently every dreadful noise ever hear by man seem mingle into one and advance to meet they -- roaring of lion hissing of serpent pealing and roll of thunder the squadron go back to godfrey and plainly confess that it have not courage enough to enter such a place a leader of the name of alcasto shake he head at this candor with a contemptuous smile he be a man of the stupider sort of courage without mind enough to conceive danger pretty soldier exclaim he to be afraid of noise and sight give the duty to I nothing shall stop alcasto though the place be the mouth of hell alcasto go and he go farther than the rest and the tremble woodcutter once more prepared they axis but on a sudden there spring up between they and the tree a wall of fire which gird the whole forest it have glowing battlements and tower and on these there appear armed spirit with the strangest and most bewildering aspect alcasto retire -- slowly indeed but with shame and terror nor have he the courage to re-appear before he commander godfrey have he bring but could hardly get a word from he lip the man talk like one in a dream at last tancred go he would have go before but he have neither think the task so difficult nor do he care for any thing that be go forward he mind be occupy with the dead clorinda he have now work that arouse he and he set out in good earnest for the forest not unmoved in he imagination but resolve to defy all appearance arrive at the wall of fire tancr halt a moment and look up at the visage on its battlements not without alarm many reflection pass swiftly through he mind some urge he forward other withhold but he conclude with step right through the fire it do not resist he : he do not feel it the fire vanish and in its stead there pour down a storm of hail and rain black as midnight this vanish also tancr stand amaze for a instant and then pass on he be soon in the thick of the wood and for some time make he way with difficulty on a sudden he issue forth into a large open glade like a amphitheatre in which there be nothing but a cypress-tree that stand in the middle the cypress be mark with hieroglyphical character mix with some word in the syrian tongue which he could read and these word request the stranger to spare the fate place nor trouble the depart soul who be there shut up in the tree meantime the wind be constantly moan around it and in the moan be a sound of human sigh and tear tancr 's heart for a moment be overcome with awe and pity but recollect himself and resolve to make amends for he credulity he smite with all he might at the cypress the blow wonderful to see produce a effusion of blood which dye the grass about the root tancr 's hair stand on end he smite however again with double violence resolve to see the end of the marvel and then he hear a woful voice issue as from a tomb hast thou not hurt I it say tancr enough already hast thou slay the human body which i once joyfully inhabit and now must thou cut and rend I even in this wretched enclosure my name be clorinda every tree which thou beholdest be the habitation of some christian or pagan soul for all come hither that be slay beneath the wall of the city compel by i know not what power or for what reason every bough in the forest be alive and when thou cuttest down a tree thou slayest a soul as a sick man in a dream think and yet think not that he see some dreadful monster and notwithstanding he doubt wish to fly from the horrible perplexity so the tremble lover though suspect what he behold have so frightful a image before he thought of clorinda weep and wail after death and bleeding in she very soul that he have not the heart to do more or to remain in the place he return in bewildered sorrow to godfrey and tell he all it be not in my power he say to touch another bough of that forest -lrb- 5 -rrb- the astonished leader of the christian now make up he mind to go himself and so with prayer and valor unite bring this appalling adventure to some conclusion but the hermit peter dissuade he the holy man in a ecstacy of foreknowledge behold the come of the only champion fate to conclude it and godfrey himself the same night have a vision from heaven bidding he grant the petition of those who should sue he next day for the recall of rinaldo from exile -- rinaldo the right hand of the army as godfrey be its head the petition be make as soon as daylight appear and two knight carlo and ubaldo be despatch in search of the fate hero part the fourth the love of rinaldo and armida the knight with information procure on the road from a good wizard strike off for the sea-coast and embarking in a pinnace which miraculously await they sail along the shore of the mediterranean for the retreat of armida they see the egyptian army assemble at gaza but hope to return with rinaldo before it could effect anything at jerusalem they pass the mouth of the nile and alexandrium and cyrene and ptolemai and the city of the moor and the danger of the greater and lesser whirlpool and they pilot show they the spot where carthage stand -- carthage now a dead city whose grave be scarcely discernible for city die kingdom die -- a little sand and grass cover all that be once lofty in they and glorious and yet man forsooth disdain that he be mortal oh mind of ours inordinate and proud -lrb- 6 -rrb- after look towards the site of carthage they pass algier and oran and tingitana and behold the opposite coast of spain and then they clear the narrow sea of gibraltar and come out into the immeasurable ocean leave all sight of land behind they and so speeding ever onward in the billow they behold at last a cluster of mountainous and beautiful island the larger one inhabit by a simple people the smaller quite wild and desolate so at least they appear but in one of these smaller island be the mountain on the top of which in the indulgence of every lawless pleasure lay the champion of the christian faith this the pilot shew to the two knight and then steer the pinnace into its bay and here after a voyage of four day and night it drop its sail without need of anchor so mild and sheltered be the port with natural mole curve towards the entrance and evergreen wood overhead it be evening with a beautiful sunset the knight take leave of the pilot and set out instantly on they journey well furnished with all advice how to proceed sleep that night at the foot of the mountain for they be not to begin to scale it till sunrise with the first beam of the sun they arise and ascend they have not climb far when a serpent rush out upon the path entirely stop it but flee at the sound of a slender rod which ubaldo whisk as he advance a lion for all he cavernous jaw do the same nor be greater resistance make by a whole herd of monster they now mount with great labor the region of ice and snow but at the top of it emerge from winter-time into summer the air be full of sweet odour yet fresh they saunter -lrb- for they could not walk fast -rrb- over a velvet sward under tree by the side of a shady river and a bewitching pleasure begin to invite they sens but they know the river and bear in mind they duty it be call the river of laughter -lrb- 7 -rrb- a little way on increase in beauty as it go it form a lucid pool in a dell and by the side of this pool be a table spread with every delicacy and in the midst of it two bathing damsel talk and laugh sometimes they sprinkle one another then dive then partly come up without spew they face then play a hundred trick pretend all the while not to see the traveller then they become quiet and sink gently and as they reappear one of they rise half into sight sweetly as the morning star when it issue from the water dewy and drop or as venus herself arise out of the froth of the sea such look this damsel and so do the crystal moisture go drop from she tress then she turn she eye towards the traveller and feign to behold they for the first time shrink within herself she hasten to undo the knot in which she tress be tie up and shake they round about she and down they fall to the water thick and long enclose that beautiful sight and yet the enclosure itself be not less beautiful so hide in the pool below and in she tress above she glance at the knight through she hair with a blush gladness she blush and she laugh at the same time and the blush be more beautiful for the laughter and the laughter for the blushing and then she say in a voice which would alone have conquer any other hearer you be very happy to be allow to come to this place nothing but delight be here we queen must have choose you from a great number but be pleased first to rid you of the dust of you journey and to refresh yourselve at this table so speak the one and the other accompany she speech with accordant look and gesture as the dance accompany the music nor be the allurement unfelt but the companion pass on take no notice and the bather go sullenly under the water -lrb- 8 -rrb- the knight pass through the gate of the park of armida and enter a labyrinth make with contrivance the most intricate here they path would have be lose but for a map trace by one who know the secret by the help of this they thread it in safety and issue upon a garden beautiful beyond conception every thing that could be desire in garden be present to they eye in one landscape and yet without contradiction or confusion -- flower fruit water sunny hill descend wood retreat into corner and grotto : and what put the last loveliness upon the scene be that the art which do it all be no where discernible -lrb- 9 -rrb- you might have suppose -lrb- so exquisitely be the wild and the cultivate unite -rrb- that all have somehow happen not be contrived it seem to be the art of nature herself as though in a fit of playfulness she have imitate she imitator but the temperature of the place if nothing else be plainly the work of magic for blossom and fruit abound at the same time the ripe and the bud fig grow on the same bough green apple be cluster upon those with red cheek the vine in one place have small leaf and hard little grape and in the next they lay forth they richest tapestry in the sun heavy with bunch full of wine at one time you listen to the warbling of bird and a minute after as if they have stop on purpose nothing be hear but the whispering of wind and the fall of water it seem as if every thing in the place contribute to the harmony and the sweetness the note of the turtle-dove be deeper here than any where else the hard oak and the chaste laurel and the whole exuberant family of tree the earth the water every element of creation seem to have be compound but for one object and to breathe forth the fulness of its bliss -lrb- 10 -rrb- the two messenger harden they soul with all they might against the enchanting impression move forward silently among the tree till look through the branch into a little opening which form a bower they see -- or do they but think they see -- no they see indeed the hero and he armida recline on the grass -lrb- 11 -rrb- she dress be careless she hair loose in the summer-wind he head lay in she bosom a smile tremble on she lip and in she eye like a sunbeam in water and as she thus look on he with passionate love he look up at she face to face and return it with all he soul now she kiss he lip now he eye and then they look again at one another with they ever-hungry look and then she kiss he again and he give a sigh so deep you would have think he soul have go out of he and pass into hers the two warrior from they covert gaze on the loving scene at the lover 's side there hang a strange accoutrement for a warrior namely a crystal mirror he rise a little on he elbow and give it into armida 's hand : and in two different object each beheld but one emotion she hers in the glass and he he own in she eye but he would not suffer she to look long at any thing but himself and then they speak loving and adoring word and after a while armida bind up she hair and put some flower into it as jewel might be put upon gold and add a rose or two to the lily of she bosom and adjust she veil and never do peacock look so proudly beautiful when he display the pomp of he eyed plume nor be ever the rainbow so sweetly color when it curve forth its dewy bosom against the light -lrb- 12 -rrb- but lovely above all be the effect of a magic girdle which the enchantress have make with she whole art and which she never lay aside day or night spirit in it have take substance the subtlest emotion of the soul a shape and palpability tender disdain be in it and repulse that attract and levity that endear and contentment full of joy and smile and little word and drop of delicious tear and short-coming sigh and soft kiss all these she have mingle together and make one delight out of many and wind it about she heart and wear it for a charm irresistible -lrb- 13 -rrb- and now she kiss he once more and beg leave of a little absence -lrb- for love be courteous ever -rrb- and so go as usual to she book and she magic art rinaldo remain where he be for he have no power to wish himself out of the sweet spot only he would stray a while among the tree and amuse himself with the bird and squirrel and so be a loving hermit till she return and at night they retire under one roof still in the midst of the garden but no sooner have armida go than the two warrior issue from they hiding-place and stand before the lover glittering in they noble arm as a war-horse that have be take from the war and become the luxurious husband of the stud wander among the drive in the meadow in vile enjoyment should by chance a trumpet be hear in the place or a dazzling battle-axe become visible he turn towards it on the instant and neigh and long to be in the list and vehemently desire the rider on he back who be to dash and be dash at in the encounter -- even so turn the young hero when the light of the armor flash upon he even so long for the war even so shake himself up out of he bed of pleasure with all he great quality awake and eager ubaldo see the movement in he heart and hold right in he face the shield of adamant which have be bring for the purpose it be a mirror that shew to the eye of every one who look into it the very man as he be but when rinaldo behold himself indeed -- when he read he transformation not in the flattering glass of the enchantress but by the light of this true and simple and severe reflector -- he hair trick out with flower and unguent he soft mantle of exquisitest dye and he very sword render undistinguishable for what it be by a garland -- shame and remorse fall upon he he feel indeed like a dreamer come to himself he look down he could not speak he wish to hide himself in the bottom of the sea ubaldo raise he voice and speak all europe and asia say he be in arm whoever desire fame or be a worshipper of he savior be a fighter in the land of syrium thou only o son of bertoldo remainest out of the high way of renown -- in luxury -- in a little corner thou only unmoved with the movement of the world the champion of a girl what dream what lethargy can have drown a valor like thine what vileness have have attraction for thee up up and with we the camp the commander himself call for thee fortune and victory await thee come fate warrior and finish thy work see the false creed which thou hast shake lay low beneath thy inevitable sword on hear these word the noble youth remain for a time without speak without move at length shame give way to a passionate sense of he duty with a new fire in he cheek he tear away the effeminate ornament of he servitude and quit the spot without a word in a few moment he have thread the labyrinth : he be outside the gate ere long he be descend the mountain but meantime armida have receive news of the two visitor and come to look for they and cast she eye down the steep she behold -- with he face alas turn no longer towards she own -- the hasty step of she hero between he companion she wish to cry aloud but be unable she might have resort to some of she magic device but she heart forbid she she run however -- for what care she for dignity -- she run down the mountain hope still by she beauty and she tear to arrest the fugitive but he foot be too strong even for love : she do not reach he till he have arrive on the sea-shore where be she pride now where the scorn she have exhibit to so many suitor where she coquetry and she self-sufficiency -- she love of be love with the power to hate the lover the enchantress be now teach what the passion be in all its despair as well as delight she cry aloud she care not for the presence of the messenger oh go not rinaldo she cry go not or take I with thee my heart be tear to piece take I or turn and kill I stop at least and be cruel to I here if thou hast the heart to fly I it will not be hard to thee to stay and be unkind even the messenger be move at this or seem to be move ubaldo tell the fugitive that it would be heroical in he to wait and hear what the lady have to say with gentleness and firmness he conquest over himself would then be complete rinaldo stop and armida come up breathless and in tear -- lovelier than ever she look earnestly at he at first without a word he give she but a glance and look aside as a fine singer before he let loose he tongue in the lofty utterance of he emotion prepare the mind of he hearer with some sweet prelude exquisitely modulate in a lower tone -- so the enchantress whose anguish have not deprive she of all sense of she art breathe a few sigh to dispose the soul of she idol to listen and then say : i do not beg thee to hear I as one that love I we both love once but that be over i beg thee to hear even though as one that love I not it will cost thy disdain nothing to grant I that perhaps thou hast discover a pleasure in hate I do so i come not to deprive thee of it if it seem just to thee just let it be i too once hate i hate the christian -- hate even thyself i think it right to do so : i be breed up to think it i pursued thee to do thee mischief i overtook thee i bear thee away and worse than all -- for now perhaps thou loathest I for it -- i love thee i love thee for the first time that i love any one nay i make thee love I in turn and alas i give myself into thine arm it be wrong i be foolish i be wicked i grant that i have deserve thou shouldst think ill of I that thou shouldst punish I and quit I and hate to have any remembrance of this place which i have fill with delight go pass over the sea make war against my friend and my country destroy we all and the religion we believe in alas _ ` we ' _ do i say the religion be mine no longer -- o thou the cruel idol of my soul oh let I go with thee if it be but as thy servant thy slave let the conqueror take with he he captive let she be mock let she be point at only let she be with thee i will cut off these tress which no longer please thee : i will clothe myself in other attire and go with thee into the battle i have courage and strength enough to bear thy lance to lead thy spare-horse to be above all thy shield-bearer -- thy shield nothing shall touch thee but through I -- through this bosom rinaldo perhaps mischance may spare thee for its sake not a word not a little word do i dare to boast of what thou hadst once a kind word for though now thou wilt neither look upon I nor speak to I she could say no more : she word be suffocate by a torrent of tear but she seek to take he hand to arrest he by he mantle -- in vain he could scarcely it be true restrain he tear : but he do he look sorrowful but compose and at length he say : armida would i could do as thou wishest but i can not i would relieve thee instantly of all this tumult of emotion no hate be there in he that must quit thee no such disdain as thou fanciest nothing but the melancholy and impetuous sense of he duty thou hast err it be true -- err both in love and hate but have i not err with thee and can i find excuse which be not find for thyself dear and honor ever wilt thou be with rinaldo whether in joy or sorrow count I if it please thee thy champion still as far as my country and my faith permit but here in this spot must be bury all else -- bury not for my sake only but for that of thy beauty thy worthiness thy royal blood consent to disparage thyself no longer peace be with thee i go where i have no permission to take thee with I be happy be wise while rinaldo be speak in this manner armida change color she bosom heave she eye take a new kind of fire scorn rose upon she lip when he finish she look at he with a bitterness that reject every word he have say and then she exclaim : thou hast no such blood in thine own vein as thou canst fear to degrade thy boast descent be a fiction : base and brutish and insensible be thy stock what being of gentle blood could quit a love like mine without even a tear -- a sigh what but the mockery of a man could call I he and yet leave I vouchsafe I he pardon as if i have offend he excuse my guilt and my tenderness he the sage of virtue and I the wretch o god and these be the man that take upon they to slaughter the innocent and dictate faith to the world go hard heart with such peace as thou leavest in this bosom begone take thine injustice from my sight for ever my spirit will follow thee not as a help but as a retribution i shall die first and thou wilt die speedily : thou wilt perish in the battle thou wilt lie expire among the dead and bleeding and wilt call on armida in thy last moment and i shall hear it -- yes i shall hear it i shall look for that down fall armida on the ground senseless and rinaldo stand over she weep at last open thine eye poor wretch and see he alas the heaven deny thee the consolation what will he do will he leave thee lie there betwixt dead and alive or will he go -- pity thee but still go he go he be go he be in the bark and the wind be in the sail and he look back -- ever back but still go : the shore begin to be out

godfrey gladly pardon he the hermit peter bless he he himself retire to beg the forgiveness and favor of heaven and then he go straight to the enchanted forest it be a beautiful morning and the forest instead of present its usual terror appear to he singularly tranquil and please on enter it he hear not dreadful thunder-clap but harmony make up of all sort of gentle and lovely sound -- brook whisper wind nightingale organ harp human voice he go slowly and cautiously and soon come to a beautiful river which encircle the heart of the wood a bridge of gold carry he over he have no sooner cross it than the river higher up suddenly swell and rush like a torrent sweep the bridge away the harmony meanwhile have become silent admiring but nothing daunt the hero go on every thing as he advance appear to start into fresh beauty he step produce lily and rose here leap up a fountain and there come fall a cascade the wood itself seem to grow young as with sudden spring and he again hear the music and the human voice though he could see no one pass through the tree he come into a glade in the heart of the wood in the center of which he behold a myrtle-tree the largest and most beautiful ever see : it be taller than a cypress or palm and seem the queen of the forest look around he he observe to he astonishment a oak suddenly cleave itself open and out of it there come a nymph a hundred other tree do the same give birth to as many nymph they be all habit as we see they in theater only instead of bow and arrow each hold a lute or guitar come towards the hero with joyful eye they form a circle about he and dance and in they dancing they sing and bid he welcome to the haunt of they mistress they loving mistress of whom he be the only hope and joy look as they speak towards the myrtle rinaldo look also and behold issue out of it -- armida armida come sweetly towards he with a countenance at once grieve and rejoice but express above all infinite affection

helmet when thou beholdest she thou mightest surely have vouchsafe she once more a sight of thine eye let we be friend at least if we may be nothing more wilt thou not take she hand rinaldo 's answer be to turn away as from a cheat to look towards the myrtle-tree to draw he sword and proceed with manifest intention of assail it she run before he shriek and hug it round nay thou wilt not she say thou wilt not hurt my tree -- not cut and slay what be bind up with the life of armida thy sword must pass first through she bosom armida writhe and wail rinaldo nevertheless raise he sword and it be

segreto fè questo pensiero trar fuor di schiera quel conte gagliardo e poi che ucciso l'abbia in su ' l sentiero tornare a la battaglium senza tardo però che a lui par facile e leggiero cacciar soletto quel popol codardo chè tutti insieme e ' l suo re galafrone non li stimava quanto un vil bottone con tal proposto si pone a fuggire forte correndo sopra la pianura il conte nulla pensa a quel fallire anzus crede che ' l faccium per paura senz ' altro dubbio se ' l pone a seguire e già son giuntus ad una selva scura appunto in mezzo a quella selva piana era un bel prato intorno a una fontana fermossi ivi agricane a quella fonte e smontò de l'arcion per riposare ma non si tolse l'elmo da la fronte nè piastra o scudo si volse levare e poco dimorò che giunse ' l conte e come il vide a la fonte aspettare disseglus : cavalier tu sei fuggito e sì forte mostravi e tanto ardito come tanta vergogna puoi soffrire a dar le spalle ad un sol cavaliero forse credesti la morte fuggire or vedi che fallito hai il pensiero chus morir può onorato dee morire che spesse volte avviene e di leggiero che per durar in questa vita trista morte e vergogna ad un tratto s ` acquista agrican prima rimontò in arcione pous con voce soave rispondium tu sei per certo il più franco barone ch ` io mai trovassi ne la vita mia e però del tuo scampo fia cagione la tua prodezza e quella cortesia che oggi sì grande al campo usato m ` hai quando soccorso a mium gente donai però ti voglio la vita lasciare ma non tornastus più per darmus inciampo questo la fuga mi fè simulare nè v ` ebbi altro partito a dartus scampo se pur ti piace meco battagliare morto ne rimarrai su questo campo ma siami testimonio il cielo e ' l sole che dartus morte mi dispiace e duole il conte gli rispose molto umano perchè avea preso già di lui pietate quanto sei disse più franco e soprano più di te mi rincresce in veritate che sarai morto e non seus cristiano ed anderaus tra l'anime dannate ma se vuoi il corpo e l'anima salvare piglia battesmo e lascierotti andare disse agricane e riguardollo in viso : se tu sei cristiano orlando seus chus mi facesse re del paradiso con tal ventura non la cangierei ma sin or ti ricordo e dotti avviso che non mi parli de ' fatti de ' dei perchè potresti predicar invano difenda it suo ciascun co ' l brando in mano nè più parole ma trasse tranchera e verso orlando con ardir s ` affronta or si comincia la battaglia fiera con asprus colpus di taglio e di ponta ciascun è di prodezza una lumiera e sterno insieme com ` il libro conta da mezzo giorno insino a notte scura sempre più franchus a la battaglium dura ma pous che ' l sol avea passato il monte e cominciossi a far il ciel stellato prima verso del re parlava it conte che farem disse the ' l giorno n ' è andato disse agricane con parole pronte : ambus ci poseremo in questo prato e domattina come il giorno appare ritorneremo insieme a battagliare così d'accordo il partito si prese lega il destrier ciascun come glus piace pous sopra a l'erba verde si distese : come fosse tra loro antica pace l'uno a l'altro vicino era e palese orlando presso al fonte isteso giace ed agricane al bosco più vicino stassi colcato a l'ombra d'un gran pino e ragionando insieme tutta via di cose degne e condecenti a loro guardava il conte il ciel poscia dicium : questo the os veggiamo è un bel lavoro che fece la divina monarchia la luna d'argento e le stelle d'oro e la luce del giorno e ' l sol lucente dio tutto ha fatto per l'umana gente disse agricane : io comprendo per certo che to vuoi de la fede ragionare io di nulla scienza son esperto nè mai sendo fanciul volsus imparare e ruppi il capo al maestro mio per merto pous non si potè un altro ritrovare che mi mostrasse libro nè scrittura tanto ciascun avea di I

conviensus al cavaliero esercitare dottrina al prete ed al dottor sta bene io tanto saccio quanto mi conviene rispose orlando : io tiro teco a un seguo che l'armi son del ` uomo il primo onore ma non già che ' l saper faccium un man degno anzus l'adorna com ' un prato il fiore ed è simile a un bove a un sasso a un legno che non pensa a l'eterno creatore nè ben si puo pensar senza dottrina la somma

se in se ' veramente quell ' orlando che vien tanto nel mondo nominato e perchè qui sei giunto e come e quando e se mai fosti ancora innamorato perche ognus cavalier ch ' è senza amore se in vista è vivo vivo senza core rispose il conte : quell ' orlando sono che uccise almonte e ' l suo fratel troiano amor m ' ha posto tutto in abbandono e venir fammi in questo luogo strano e perchè teco piu largo ragiono voglio the sappus che ' l mio cor è in mano de la figliuola del re galafrone che ad albracca dimora nel girone tu fai co ' l padre guerra a gran furore per prender suo paese e sua castella ed io quà son condotto per amore e per piacer a quellum damisellum molte fiate son stato per onore e per la fede mia sopra la sella or sol per acquistar la bella dama faccio battaglia e d'altro non ho brama quando agrican ha nel parlare accolto che questo è orlando ed angelica amava fuor di misura si turbò nel volto ma per la notte non lo dimostrava piangeva sospirando come un stolto l'anima e ' l petto e ' l spirto glus avvampava e tanto gelosia gli batte il core che non è vivo e di doglia non more pous disse a orlando : tu debbi pensare che come il giorno sarà dimostrato debbiamo insieme la battaglium fare e l'uno o l'altro rimarrà su ' l prato or d'una cosa ti voglio pregare che prima che vegnamo e cotal piato quellum donzellum che ' l tuo cor disium tu l'abbandoni e lascila per mia io non potrium patire essendo vivo che altri con meco amasse il viso adorno : o l'uno o l'altro al tutto sarà privo del spirto e de la dama al novo giorno altri mai non saprà che

duol già fatto impetuoso e stolto ch ' al cor si stringe e chiusa in breve sede la vita empie di morte i sensi e ' l volto già simile all ' estinto il vivo langue al colore al silenzio agli atti al sangue e ben la vita sua sdegnosa e schiva spezzando a sforza il suo ritegno frale la bell ` anima sciolta alfin seguiva che poco innanzi a lei spiegava l'ale ma quivi stuol de ' franchi a caso arriva cui trae bisogno d' acqua o d'altro tale e con la donna il cavalier ne porta in sè mal vivo e morto in lei ch ' è morta \* \* \* \* \* no v tancr in the enchanted forest the same era in prence tancredus intanto sorto a seppellir la sua diletta amica e benchè in volto sia languido e smorto e mal atto a portar elmo e lorica nulladimen poi che ' l bisogno ha scorto eus non ricusa il rischio o la fatica che ' l cor vivace il suo vigor trasfonde al corpo sì che par ch ` esso n'abbonde vassene il valoroso in sè ristretto e tacito e guardingo al rischio ignoto e sostien della selva il fero aspetto e ' l gran romor del tuono e del tremoto e nulla sbigottisce e sol nel petto sente ma tosto il seda un picciol moto trapassa ed ecco in quel silvestre loco sorge improvvisa la città del foco allor s ' arretra e dubbio alquanto resta fra sè dicendo : or qui che vaglion l'armi nelle fauci de ' mostri e 'n golum a questa divoratrice fiamma andrò a gettarmus non mai la vita ove cagione onesta del comun pro la chieda altri risparmi ma nè prodigo sia d' anima grande uom denso e tale è ben chus qui la spande pur l'oste che dirà s ` indarno io riedo qual altra selva ha di troncar speranza nè intentato lasciar vorrà goffredo mai questo varco or s ` oltre alcun s ` avanza forse l'incendio che qui sorto i ' vedo fia d'effetto minor che sembianza ma seguane che puote e in questo dire dentro saltovvi : oh memorando ardire nè sotto l'arme già sentir gli parve caldo o fervor come di foco intenso ma pur se fosser vere fiamme o larve mal potè giudicar sì tosto il senso : perchè repente appena tocco sparve quel simulacro e giunse un nuvol denso che portò notte e verno e ' l verno ancora e l'ombra dileguossi in picciol ` os stupido sì ma intrepido rimane tancredus e poichè vede il tutto cheto mette securo il piè nelle profane soglie e spia della selva ogni secreto nè più apparenze inusitate e strane nè trova alcun per via scontro o divieto se non quanto per sè ritarda il bosco la vista e i passi inviluppato e fosco alfine un largo spazio in forma scorge d'anfiteatro e non è pianta in esso salvo che nel suo mezzo altero sorge quasi eccelsa piramide un cipresso colà si drizza e nel mirar s ' accorge ch ' era di varj segni il tronco impresso simil a quei chè in vece usò di scritto l'antico già misterioso egitto fra i segni ignoti alcune note ha scorte del sermon di soria ch ` ei ben possiede : o tu che dentro be chiostri dellum morte osastus por guerriero audace il piede deh se non seus crudel quanto sei forte deh non turbar questa secreta sede perdona all ` alme omaus di luce prive : non dee guerra co ' morti aver chus vive così dicea quel motto eglus era intento delle brevi parole be segnus occultus fremere intanto udium continuo il vento tra le frondi del bosco e tra i virgulti e trarne un suon che flebile concento par d'umanus sospiri e di singulti e un non so che confuso instillum al core di pietà di spavento e di dolore pur tragge alfin la spada e con gran forza percote l'alta pianta oh maraviglia manda fuor sangue la recisa scorza e fa la terra intorno a sè vermiglium tutto si raccapriccia e pur rinforza il colpo e ' l fin vederne ei si consiglia allor quasi di tomba uscir ne sente un indistinto gemito dolente che pous distinto in vocus : ahi troppo disse m ' hai tu tancredi offesso : or tanto bastus : tu dal corpo che meco e per I visse felice albergo gia mi discacciasti perchè il misero tronco a cuus m ` affisse il mio duro destino ancor mi guasti dopo la morte gli avversarj tuoi crudel ne ' lor sepolcri offender vuous clorinda fuus : nè sol qui spirto umano albergo in questa pianta rozza e dura ma ciascun altro ancor franco o pagano che lassus i membri a piè dell ` alte mura astretto è qui da novo incanto e strano non so s ' io dica in corpo o in sepoltura son di sensi animati i rami e i tronchi e micidial seus tu se legno tronchi qual infermo talor ch ` in sogno scorge drago o cinta di fiamme alta chimera sebben sospetta o in parte anco s ` accorge che simulacro sium non forma vera pur desium di fuggir tanto gli porge spavento la sembianza orrida e fera : tale il timido amante appien non crede be falsus ingannus : e pur ne teme e cede : e dentro il cor gli è in modo tal conquiso da varj affettus che s ' agghiaccium e trema e nel moto potente ed improvviso gli cade il ferro : e ' l manco e in lui la tema va fuor di sè presente aver gli è avviso l' offesa donna sua che plorus e gema : nè può soffrir di rimirar quel sangue nè quei gemiti udir d'egro che langue così quel contra morte audace core nulla forma turbò d' alto spavento ma lui che solo è fievole in amore falsa imago deluse e van lamento il suo caduto ferro instanto fuore portò del bosco impetuoso vento sicchè vinto partissus e in sullum strada ritrovò poscium e ripigliò la spada pur non tornò né ritentando ardio spiar di novo le cagioni ascose e poi che giunto al sommo duce unio gli spirti alquanto e l'animo compose incominciò : signor nunzio son io di non credute e non credibil cose ciò che dicean dello spettacol fero e del suon paventoso è tutto vero maraviglioso foco indi m ` apparse senza materia in un istante appreso che sorse e dilatando un muro farse parve e d' armati mostri esser difeso pur vi passai che ne l'incendio m ' arse nè dal ferro mi fu l'andar conteso : vernò in quel punto ed annottò : fe ' il giorno e la serenità poscium ritorno di più dirò ch ` agli alberus dà vita spirito uman che sente e che ragiona per prova sollo : io n'ho la voce udita che nel cor flebilmente anco mi suona stilla sangue de ' tronchi ogni ferita
