make where the descriptive matter be merely of local interest but the story itself be intact vsh _ the boy the elf _ Sunday march twentieth _ once there be a boy he be -- let we say -- something like fourteen year old long and loose-jointed and towheaded he be not good for much that boy he chief delight be to eat and sleep and after that -- he like best to make mischief it be a Sunday morning and the boy 's parent be get ready to go to church the boy sit on the edge of the table in he shirt sleeve and think how lucky it be that both father and mother be go away and the coast would be clear for a couple of hour good now i can take down pop 's gun and fire off a shot without anybody 's meddle interference he say to himself but it be almost as if father should have guess the boy 's thought for just as he be on the threshold -- ready to start -- he stop short and turn toward the boy since you will not come to church with mother and I he say the least you can do be to read the service at home will you promise to do so yes say the boy that i can do easy enough and he think of course that he would not read any more than he feel like read the boy think that never have he see he mother so persistent in a second she be over by the shelf near the fireplace and take down luther 's commentary and lay it on the table in front of the window -- open at the service for the day she also open the new testament and place it beside the commentary finally she draw up the big arm-chair which be buy at the parish auction the year before and which as a rule no one but father be permit to occupy the boy sit think that he mother be give herself altogether too much trouble with this spread for he have no intention of read more than a page or so but now for the second time it be almost as if he father be able to see right through he he walk up to the boy and say in a severe tone : now remember that you be to read carefully for when we come back i shall question you thoroughly and if you have skip a single page it will not go well with you the service be fourteen and a half page long say he mother just as if she want to heap up the measure of he misfortune you 'll have to sit down and begin the reading at once if you expect to get through with it with that they depart and as the boy stand in the doorway watch they he think that he have be catch in a trap there they go congratulating themselves i suppose in the belief that they have hit upon something so good that i 'll be force to sit and hang over the sermon the whole time that they be away think he but he father and mother be certainly not congratulating themselves upon anything of the sort but on the contrary they be very much distressed they be poor farmer and they place be not much bigger than a garden-plot when they first move there the place could not feed more than one pig and a pair of chicken but they be uncommonly industrious and capable folk -- and now they have both cow and goose thing have turn out very well for they and they would have go to church that beautiful morning -- satisfied and happy -- if they have not have they son to think of father complain that he be dull and lazy he have not care to learn anything at school and he be such a all-round good-for-nothing that he could barely be make to tend goose mother do not deny that this be true but she be most distressed because he be wild and bad cruel to animal and ill-willed toward human being may god soften he hard heart and give he a better disposition say the mother or else he will be a misfortune both to himself and to we the boy stand for a long time and ponder whether he should read the service or not finally he come to the conclusion that this time it be best to be obedient he seat himself in the easy chair and begin to read but when he have be rattle away in a undertone for a little while this mumble seem to have a soothing effect upon he -- and he begin to nod it be the most beautiful weather outside it be only the twentieth of march but the boy live in west vemminghög township down in southern skane where the spring be already in full swing it be not as yet green but it be fresh and bud there be water in all the trench and the colt 's - foot on the edge of the ditch be in bloom all the weed that grow in among the stone be brown and shiny the beech-wood in the distance seem to swell and grow thicker with every second the sky be high -- and a clear blue the cottage door stand ajar and the lark 's trill could be hear in the room the hen and goose patter about in the yard and the cow who feel the spring air away in they stall low they approval every now and then the boy read and nod and fight against drowsiness no i do not want to fall asleep think he for then i 'll not get through with this thing the whole forenoon but -- somehow -- he fall asleep he do not know whether he have sleep a short while or a long while but he be awaken by hear a slight noise back of he on the window-sill face the boy stand a small looking-glass and almost the entire cottage could be see in this as the boy raise he head he happen to look in the glass and then he see that the cover to he mother 's chest have be open he mother own a great heavy iron-bound oak chest which she permit no one but herself to open here she treasured all the thing she have inherit from she mother and of these she be especially careful here lay a couple of old-time peasant dress of red homespun cloth with short bodice and plaited shirt and a pearl-bedecked breast pin there be starch white-linen head-dress and heavy silver ornament and chain folk do not care to go about dress like that in these day and several time he mother have think of get rid of the old thing but somehow she have not have the heart to do it now the boy see distinctly -- in the glass -- that the chest-lid be open he could not understand how this have happen for he mother have close the chest before she go away she never would have leave that precious chest open when he be at home alone he become low-spirited and apprehensive he be afraid that a thief have sneak he way into the cottage he do not dare to move but sit still and stare into the looking-glass while he sit there and wait for the thief to make he appearance he begin to wonder what that dark shadow be which fall across the edge of the chest he look and look -- and do not want to believe he eye but the thing which at first seem shadowy become more and more clear to he and soon he see that it be something real it be no less a thing than a elf who sit there -- astride the edge of the chest to be sure the boy have hear story about elf but he have never dream that they be such tiny creature he be no taller than a hand 's breadth -- this one who sit on the edge of the chest he have a old wrinkled and beardless face and be dress in a black frock coat knee-breeches and a broad-brimmed black hat he be very trim and smart with he white lace about the throat and wrist-band he buckled shoe and the bow on he garter he have take from the chest a embroidered piece and sit and look at the old-fashioned handiwork with such a air of veneration that he do not observe the boy have awaken the boy be somewhat surprised to see the elf but on the other hand he be not particularly frighten it be impossible to be afraid of one who be so little and since the elf be so absorb in he own thought that he neither saw nor hear the boy think that it would be great fun to play a trick on he to push he over into the chest and shut the lid on he or something of that kind but the boy be not so courageous that he dare to touch the elf with he hand instead he look around the room for something to poke he with he let he gaze wander from the sofa to the leaf-table from the leaf-table to the fireplace he look at the kettle then at the coffee-urn which stand on a shelf near the fireplace on the water bucket near the door and on the spoon and knife and fork and saucer and plate which could be see through the half-open cupboard door he look at he father 's gun which hang on the wall beside the portrait of the danish royal family and on the geranium and fuchsia which blossom in the window and last he catch sight of a old butterfly-snare that hang on the window frame he have hardly set eye on that butterfly-snare before he reach over and snatch it and jump up and swing it alongside the edge of the chest he be himself astonish at the luck he have he hardly know how he have manage it -- but he have actually snare the elf the poor little chap lay head downward in the bottom of the long snare and could not free himself the first moment the boy have not the least idea what he should do with he prize he be only particular to swing the snare backward and forward to prevent the elf from get a foothold and clamber up the elf begin to speak and beg oh so pitifully for he freedom he have bring they good luck -- these many year -- he say and deserve better treatment now if the boy would set he free he would give he a old coin a silver spoon and a gold penny as big as the case on he father 's silver watch the boy do not think that this be much of a offer but it so happen -- that after he have get the elf in he power he be afraid of he he feel that he have enter into a agreement with something weird and uncanny something which do not belong to he world and he be only too glad to get rid of the horrid thing for this reason he agree at once to the bargain and hold the snare still so the elf could crawl out of it but when the elf be almost out of the snare the boy happen to think that he ought to have bargain for large estate and all sort of good thing he should at least have make this stipulation : that the elf must conjure the sermon into he head what a fool i be to let he go think he and begin to shake the snare violently so the elf would tumble down again but the instant the boy do this he receive such a stinging box on the ear that he think he head would fly in piece he be dash -- first against one wall then against the other he sink to the floor and lay there -- senseless when he awake he be alone in the cottage the chest-lid be down and the butterfly-snare hung in its usual place by the window if he have not feel how the right cheek burn from that box on the ear he would have be tempt to believe the whole thing have be a dream at any rate father and mother will be sure to insist that it be nothing else thought he they be not likely to make any allowance for that old sermon on account of the elf it be best for I to get at that reading again think he but as he walk toward the table he notice something remarkable it could not be possible that the cottage have grow but why be he oblige to take so many more step than usual to get to the table and what be the matter with the chair it look no bigger than it do a while ago but now he have to step on the ring first and then clamber up in order to reach the seat it be the same thing with the table he could not look over the top without climb to the arm of the chair what in all the world be this say the boy i believe the elf have bewitch both the armchair and the table -- and the whole cottage the commentary lay on the table and to all appearance it be not change but there must have be something queer about that too for he could not manage to read a single word of it without actually stand right in the book itself he read a couple of line and then he chance to look up with that he glance fall on the looking-glass and then he cry aloud : look there be another one for in the glass he see plainly a little little creature who be dress in a hood and leather breeches why that one be dress exactly like I say the boy and clasp he hand in astonishment but then he see that the thing in the mirror do the same thing then he begin to pull he hair and pinch he arm and swing round and instantly he do the same thing after he he who be see in the mirror the boy run around the glass several time to see if there be not a little man hide behind it but he find no one there and then he begin to shake with terror for now he understand that the elf have bewitch he and that the creature whose image he see in the glass -- be he himself the wild goose the boy simply could not make himself believe that he have be transform into a elf it can not be anything but a dream -- a queer fancy thought he if i wait a few moment i 'll surely be turn back into a human be again he place himself before the glass and close he eye he open they again after a couple of minute and then expect to find that it have all pass over -- but it have not he be -- and remain -- just as little in other respects he be the same as before the thin straw-coloured hair the freckle across he nose the patch on he leather breeches and the darn on he stocking be all like themselves with this exception -- that they have become diminish no it would do no good for he to stand still and wait of this he be certain he must try something else and he think the wisest thing that he could do be to try and find the elf and make he peace with he and while he seek he cry and pray and promise everything he could think of nevermore would he break he word to anyone never again would he be naughty and never never would he fall asleep again over the sermon if he might only be a human be once more he would be such a good and helpful and obedient boy but no matter how much he promise -- it do not help he the least little bit suddenly he remember that he have hear he mother say all the tiny folk make they home in the cowshed and at once he conclude to go there and see if he could not find the elf it be a lucky thing that the cottage-door stand partly open for he never could have reach the bolt and open it but now he slip through without any difficulty when he come out in the hallway he look around for he wooden shoe for in the house to be sure he have go about in he stocking-foot he wonder how he should manage with these big clumsy wooden shoe but just then he see a pair of tiny shoe on the doorstep when he observe that the elf have be so thoughtful that he have also bewitch the wooden shoe he be even more troubled it be evidently he intention that this affliction should last a long time on the wooden board-walk in front of the cottage hop a gray sparrow he have hardly set eye on the boy before he call out : teetee teetee look at nil goosey-boy look at thumbietot look at nil holgersson thumbietot instantly both the goose and the chicken turn and stare at the boy and then they set up a fearful cackle cock-el-i-coo crow the rooster good enough for he cock-el-i-coo he have pull my comb ka ka kada serve he right cry the hen and with that they keep up a continuous cackle the goose get together in a tight group stick they head together and ask : who can have do this who can have do this but the strangest thing of all be that the boy understand what they say he be so astonished that he stand there as if root to the doorstep and listen it must be because i be change into a elf say he this be probably why i understand bird-talk he think it be unbearable that the hen would not stop say that it serve he right he throw a stone at they and shout : shut up you pack but it have not occur to he before that he be no longer the sort of boy the hen need fear the whole henyard make a rush for he and form a ring around he then they all cry at once : ka ka kada serve you right ka ka kada serve you right the boy try to get away but the chicken run after he and scream until he think he would lose he hear it be more than likely that he never could have get away from they if the house cat have not come along just then as soon as the chicken see the cat they quiet down and pretend to be think of nothing else than just to scratch in the earth for worm immediately the boy run up to the cat you dear pussy say he you must know all the corner and hide place about here you 'll be a good little kitty and tell I where i can find the elf the cat do not reply at once he seat himself curl he tail into a graceful ring around he paw -- and stare at the boy it be a large black cat with one white spot on he chest he fur lay sleek and soft and shone in the sunlight the claw be draw in and the eye be a dull gray with just a little narrow dark streak down the center the cat look thoroughly good-natured and inoffensive i know well enough where the elf live he say in a soft voice but that do not say that i be go to tell _ you _ about it dear pussy you must tell I where the elf life say the boy can not you see how he have bewitch I the cat open he eye a little so that the green wickedness begin to shine forth he spin round and purr with satisfaction before he reply shall i perhaps help you because you have so often grab I by the tail he say at last then the boy be furious and forget entirely how little and helpless he be now oh i can pull you tail again i can say he and run toward the cat the next instant the cat be so change that the boy could scarcely believe it be the same animal every separate hair on he body stand on end the back be bent the leg have become elongate the claw scrape the ground the tail have grow thick and short the ear be lay back the mouth be frothy and the eye be wide open and glisten like spark of red fire the boy do not want to let himself be scare by a cat and he take a step forward then the cat make one spring and land right on the boy knock he down and stand over he -- he forepaw on he chest and he jaw wide apart -- over he throat the boy feel how the sharp claw sink through he vest and shirt and into he skin and how the sharp eye-tooth tickle he throat he shriek for help as loudly as he could but no one come he think surely that he last hour have come then he feel that the cat draw in he claw and let go the hold on he throat there he say that will do now i 'll let you go this time for my mistress 's sake i only want you to know which one of we two have the power now with that the cat walk away -- look as smooth and pious as he do when he first appear on the scene the boy be so crestfallen that he do not say a word but only hurry to the cowhouse to look for the elf there be not more than three cow all tell but when the boy come in there be such a bellowing and such a kick-up that one might easily have believe that there be at least thirty moo moo moo bellow mayrose it be well there be such a thing as justice in this world moo moo moo sing the three of they in unison he could not hear what they say for each one try to out-bellow the other the boy want to ask after the elf but he could not make himself hear because the cow be in full uproar they carry on as they use to do when he let a strange dog in on they they kick with they hind leg shake they neck stretch they head and measure the distance with they horn come here you say mayrose and you 'll get a kick that you will not forget in a hurry come here say gold lily and you shall dance on my horn come here and you shall taste how it feel when you throw you wooden shoe at I as you do last summer bawl star come here and you shall be repay for that wasp you let loose in my ear growl gold lily mayrose be the oldest and the wisest of they and she be the very maddest come here say she that i may pay you back for the many time that you have jerk the milk pail away from you mother and for all the snare you lay for she when she come carry the milk pail and for all the tear when she have stand here and weep over you the boy want to tell they how he regret that he have be unkind to they and that never never -- from now on -- should he be anything but good if they would only tell he where the elf be but the cow do not listen to he they make such a racket that he begin to fear one of they would succeed in break loose and he think that the best thing for he to do be to go quietly away from the cowhouse when he come out he be thoroughly dishearten he could understand that no one on the place want to help he find the elf and little good would it do he probably if the elf be find he crawl up on the broad hedge which fence in the farm and which be overgrow with brier and lichen there he sit down to think about how it would go with he if he never become a human be again when father and mother come home from church there would be a surprise for they yes a surprise -- it would be all over the land and people would come flock from east vemminghög and from torp and from skerup the whole vemminghög township would come to stare at he perhaps father and mother would take he with they and show he at the market place in kivik no that be too horrible to think about he would rather that no human being should ever see he again he unhappiness be simply frightful no one in all the world be so unhappy as he he be no longer a human being -- but a freak little by little he begin to comprehend what it mean -- to be no longer human he be separate from everything now he could no longer play with other boy he could not take charge of the farm after he parent be go and certainly no girl would think of marry _ he _ he sit and look at he home it be a little log house which lay as if it have be crush down to earth under the high sloping roof the outhouse be also small and the patch of ground be so narrow that a horse could barely turn around on they but little and poor though the place be it be much too good for he _ now _ he could not ask for any better place than a hole under the stable floor it be wondrously beautiful weather it bud and it ripple and it murmur and it twitter -- all around he but he sit there with such a heavy sorrow he should never be happy any more about anything never have he see the sky as blue as they be to-day bird of passage come on they travels they come from foreign land and have travel over the east sea by way of smygahuk and be now on they way north they be of many different kind but he be only familiar with the wild goose who come fly in two long row which meet at a angle several flock of wild goose have already fly by they fly very high still he could hear how they shriek : to the hill now we be off to the hill when the wild goose see the tame goose who walk about the farm they sink nearer the earth and call : come along come along we be off to the hill the tame goose could not resist the temptation to raise they head and listen but they answer very sensibly : we be pretty well off where we be we be pretty well off where we be it be as we have say a uncommonly fine day with a atmosphere that it must have be a real delight to fly in so light and brace and with each new wild geese-flock that fly by the tame goose become more and more unruly a couple of time they flap they wing as if they have half a mind to fly along but then a old mother-goose would always say to they : now do not be silly those creature will have to suffer both hunger and cold there be a young gander whom the wild goose have fire with a passion for adventure if another flock come this way i 'll follow they say he then there come a new flock who shriek like the other and the young gander answer : wait a minute wait a minute i be come he spread he wing and raise himself into the air but he be so unaccustomed to fly that he fall to the ground again at any rate the wild goose must have hear he call for they turn and fly back slowly to see if he be come wait wait he cry and make another attempt to fly all this the boy hear where he lay on the hedge it would be a great pity think he if the big goosey-gander should go away it would be a big loss to father and mother if he be go when they come home from church when he think of this once again he entirely forget that he be little and helpless he take one leap right down into the goose-flock and throw he arm around the neck of the goosey-gander oh no you do not fly away this time sir cry he but just about then the gander be consider how he should go to work to raise himself from the ground he could not stop to shake the boy off hence he have to go along with he -- up in the air they bear on toward the height so rapidly that the boy fairly gasp before he have time to think that he ought to let go he hold around the gander 's neck he be so high up that he would have be kill instantly if he have fall to the ground the only thing that he could do to make himself a little more comfortable be to try and get upon the gander 's back and there he wriggle himself forthwith but not without considerable trouble and it be not a easy matter either to hold himself secure on the slippery back between two sway wing he have to dig deep into feather and down with both hand to keep from tumble to the ground the big check cloth the boy have grow so giddy that it be a long while before he come to himself the wind howl and beat against he and the rustle of feather and sway of wing sound like a whole storm thirteen goose fly around he flap they wing and honk they dance before he eye and they buzz in he ear he do not know whether they fly high or low or in what direction they be travel after a bit he regain just enough sense to understand that he ought to find out where the goose be take he but this be not so easy for he do not know how he should ever muster up courage enough to look down he be sure he would faint if he attempt it the wild goose be not fly very high because the new travel companion could not breathe in the very thinnest air for he sake they also fly a little slower than usual at last the boy just make himself cast one glance down to earth then he think that a great big rug lay spread beneath he which be make up of a incredible number of large and small check where in all the world be i now he wonder he see nothing but check upon check some be broad and run crosswise and some be long and narrow -- all over there be angle and corner nothing be round and nothing be crooked what kind of a big check cloth be this that i be look down on say the boy to himself without expect anyone to answer he but instantly the wild goose who fly about he call out : field and meadow field and meadow then he understand that the big check cloth he be travel over be the flat land of southern sweden and he begin to comprehend why it look so check and multi-coloured the bright green check he recognize first they be rye field that have be sow in the fall and have keep themselves green under the winter snow the yellowish-gray check be stubble-field -- the remains of the oat-crop which have grow there the summer before the brownish one be old clover meadow : and the black one desert grazing land or ploughed-up fallow pasture the brown check with the yellow edge be undoubtedly beech-tree forest for in these you 'll find the big tree which grow in the heart of the forest -- naked in winter while the little beech-tree which grow along the border keep they dry yellowed leaf way into the spring there be also dark check with gray centre : these be the large built-up estate encircle by the small cottage with they blacken straw roof and they stone-divided land-plot and then there be check green in the middle with brown border : these be the orchard where the grass-carpet be already turn green although the tree and bush around they be still in they nude brown bark the boy could not keep from laugh when he see how check everything look but when the wild goose hear he laugh they call out -- kind o ' reprovingly : fertile and good land fertile and good land the boy have already become serious to think that you can laugh you who have meet with the most terrible misfortune that can possibly happen to a human be think he and for a moment he be pretty serious but it be not long before he be laugh again now that he have grow somewhat accustomed to the ride and the speed so that he could think of something besides hold himself on the gander 's back he begin to notice how full the air be of bird fly northward and there be a shouting and a call from flock to flock so you come over to-day shriek some yes answer the goose how do you think the spring 's get on not a leaf on the tree and ice-cold water in the lake come back the answer when the goose fly over a place where they see any tame half-naked fowl they shout : what be the name of this place what be the name of this place then the rooster cock they head and answer : its name 's lillgarde this year -- the same as last year most of the cottage be probably name after they owner -- which be the custom in skåne but instead of say this be per matsson or ola bossons the rooster hit upon the kind of name which to they way of thinking be more appropriate those who live on small farm and belong to poor cottager cry : this place be call grainscarce and those who belong to the poorest hut-dweller scream : the name of this place be little-to-eat little-to-eat little-to-eat the big well-cared-for farm get high-sounding name from the rooster -- such as luckymeadow eggberga and moneyville but the rooster on the great land estate be too high and mighty to condescend to anything like jest one of they crow and call out with such gusto that it sound as if he want to be hear clear up to the sun : this be herr dybeck 's estate the same this year as last year this year as last year a little further on strut one rooster who crow : this be swanholm surely all the world know that the boy observe that the goose do not fly straight forward but zigzag hither and thither over the whole south country just as though they be glad to be in skåne again and want to pay they respects to every separate place they come to one place where there be a number of big clumsy-looking building with great tall chimney and all around these be a lot of smaller house this be jordberga sugar refinery cry the rooster the boy shudder as he sit there on the goose 's back he ought to have recognize this place for it be not very far from he home here he have work the year before as a watch boy but to be sure nothing be exactly like itself when one see it like that -- from up above and think just think osa the goose girl and little mat who be he comrade last year indeed the boy would have be glad to know if they still be anywhere about here fancy what they would have say have they suspect that he be fly over they head soon jordberga be lose to sight and they travel towards svedalum and skaber lake and back again over görringe cloister and häckeberga the boy see more of skåne in this one day than he have ever see before -- in all the year that he have live whenever the wild goose happen across any tame goose they have the best fun they fly forward very slowly and call down : we be off to the hill be you come along be you come along but the tame goose answer : it be still winter in this country you be out too soon fly back fly back the wild goose lower themselves that they might be hear a little better and call : come along we 'll teach you how to fly and swim then the tame goose get mad and would not answer they with a single honk the wild goose sink themselves still lower -- until they almost touch the ground -- then quick as lightning they raise themselves just as if they would be terribly frightened oh oh oh they exclaim those thing be not goose they be only sheep they be only sheep the one on the ground be beside themselves with rage and shriek : may you be shoot the whole lot o ' you the whole lot o ' you when the boy hear all this teasing he laugh then he remember how badly thing have go with he and he cry but the next second he be laugh again never before have he ride so fast and to ride fast and recklessly -- that he have always like and of course he have never dream that it could be as fresh and brace as it be up in the air or that there rise from the earth such a fine scent of resin and soil nor have he ever dream what it could be like -- to ride so high above the earth it be just like fly away from sorrow and trouble and annoyance of every kind that could be think of akka from kebnekaise evening the big tame goosey-gander that have follow they up in the air feel very proud of be permit to travel back and forth over the south country with the wild goose and crack joke with the tame bird but in spite of he keen delight he begin to tire as the afternoon wear on he try to take deeper breath and quicker wing-stroke but even so he remain several goose-length behind the other when the wild goose who fly last notice that the tame one could not keep up with they they begin to call to the goose who ride in the center of the angle and lead the procession : akka from kebnekaise akka from kebnekaise what do you want of I ask the leader the white one will be leave behind the white one will be leave behind tell he it be easier to fly fast than slow call the leader and race on as before the goosey-gander certainly try to follow the advice and increase he speed but then he become so exhaust that he sink away down to the droop willow that border the field and meadow akka akka akka from kebnekaise cry those who fly last and see what a hard time he be have what do you want now ask the leader -- and she sound awfully angry the white one sink to the earth the white one sink to the earth tell he it be easier to fly high than low shout the leader and she do not slow up the least little bit but race on as before the goosey-gander try also to follow this advice but when he want to raise himself he become so winded that he almost burst he breast akka akka again cry those who fly last can not you let I fly in peace ask the leader and she sound even madder than before the white one be ready to collapse tell he that he who have not the strength to fly with the flock can go back home cry the leader she certainly have no idea of decrease she speed -- but race on as before oh be that the way the wind blow think the goosey-gander he understand at once that the wild goose have never intend to take he along up to lapland they have only lure he away from home in sport he feel thoroughly exasperate to think that he strength should fail he now so he would not be able to show these tramp that even a tame goose be good for something but the most provoking thing of all be that he have fall in with akka from kebnekaise tame goose that he be he have hear about a leader goose name akka who be more than a hundred year old she have such a big name that the best wild goose in the world follow she but no one have such a contempt for tame goose as akka and she flock and gladly would he have show they that he be they equal he fly slowly behind the rest while he deliberate whether he should turn back or continue finally the little creature that he carry on he back say : dear morten goosey-gander you know well enough that it be simply impossible for you who have never fly to go with the wild goose all the way up to lapland will not you turn back before you kill yourself but the farmer 's lad be about the worst thing the goosey-gander know anything about and as soon as it dawn on he that this puny creature actually believe that he could not make the trip he decide to stick it out if you say another word about this i 'll drop you into the first ditch we ride over say he and at the same time he fury give he so much strength that he begin to fly almost as well as any of the other it be not likely that he could have keep this pace up very long neither be it necessary for just then the sun sink quickly and at sunset the goose fly down and before the boy and the goosey-gander know what have happen they stand on the shore of vomb lake they probably intend that we shall spend the night here think the boy and jump down from the goose 's back he stand on a narrow beach by a fair-sized lake it be ugly to look upon because it be almost entirely cover with a ice-crust that be blacken and uneven and full of crack and hole -- as spring ice generally be the ice be already break up it be loose and floating and have a broad belt of dark shiny water all around it but there be still enough of it leave to spread chill and winter terror over the place on the other side of the lake there appear to be a open and light country but where the goose have light there be a thick pine-growth it look as if the forest of fir and pine have the power to bind the winter to itself everywhere else the ground be bare but beneath the sharp pine-branch lay snow that have be melting and freezing melting and freezing until it be hard as ice the boy think he have strike a arctic wilderness and he be so miserable that he want to scream he be hungry too he have not eat a bite the whole day but where should he find any food nothing eatable grow on either ground or tree in the month of march yes where be he to find food and who would give he shelter and who would fix he bed and who would protect he from the wild beast for now the sun be away and frost come from the lake and darkness sink down from heaven and terror steal forward on the twilight 's trail and in the forest it begin to patter and rustle now the good humor which the boy have feel when he be up in the air be go and in he misery he look around for he travel companion he have no one but they to cling to now then he see that the goosey-gander be have even a worse time of it than he he be lie prostrate on the spot where he have alight and it look as if he be ready to die he neck lay flat against the ground he eye be close and he breathing sound like a feeble hissing dear morten goosey-gander say the boy try to get a swallow of water it be not two step to the lake but the goosey-gander do not stir the boy have certainly be cruel to all animal and to the goosey-gander in time go by but now he feel that the goosey-gander be the only comfort he have leave and he be dreadfully afraid of lose he at once the boy begin to push and drag he to get he into the water but the goosey-gander be big and heavy and it be mighty hard work for the boy but at last he succeed the goosey-gander get in head first for a instant he lay motionless in the slime but soon he poke up he head shake the water from he eye and sniff then he swim proudly between reed and seaweed the wild goose be in the lake before he they have not look around for either the goosey-gander or for he rider but have make straight for the water they have bath and primp and now they lay and gulp half-rotten pond-weed and water-clover the white goosey-gander have the good fortune to spy a perch he grab it quickly swim ashore with it and lay it down in front of the boy here be a thank you for help I into the water say he it be the first time the boy have hear a friendly word that day he be so happy that he want to throw he arm around the goosey-gander 's neck but he refrain and he be also thankful for the gift at first he must have think that it would be impossible to eat raw fish and then he have a notion to try it he feel to see if he still have he sheath-knife with he and sure enough there it hang -- on the back button of he trousers although it be so diminish that it be hardly as long as a match well at any rate it serve to scale and cleanse fish with and it be not long before the perch be eat when the boy have satisfy he hunger he feel a little ashamed because he have be able to eat a raw thing it be evident that i be not a human be any longer but a real elf think he while the boy eat the goosey-gander stand silently beside he but when he have swallow the last bite he say in a low voice : it be a fact that we have run across a stuck-up goose folk who despise all tame bird yes i have observe that say the boy what a triumph it would be for I if i could follow they clear up to lapland and show they that even a tame goose can do thing y-e-e-s say the boy and drawl it out because he do not believe the goosey-gander could ever do it yet he do not wish to contradict he but i do not think i can get along all alone on such a journey say the goosey-gander i would like to ask if you could not come along and help I the boy of course have not expect anything but to return to he home as soon as possible and he be so surprised that he hardly know what he should reply i think that we be enemy you and i say he but this the goosey-gander seem to have forget entirely he only remember that the boy have but just save he life i suppose i really ought to go home to father and mother say the boy oh i 'll get you back to they some time in the fall say the goosey-gander i shall not leave you until i put you down on you own doorstep the boy think it might be just as well for he if he escape show himself before he parent for a while he be not disincline to favor the scheme and be just on the point of say that he agree to it -- when they hear a loud rumble behind they it be the wild goose who have come up from the lake -- all at one time -- and stand shake the water from they back after that they arrange themselves in a long row -- with the leader-goose in the center -- and come toward they as the white goosey-gander size up the wild goose he feel ill at ease he have expect that they should be more like tame goose and that he should feel a closer kinship with they they be much smaller than he and none of they be white they be all gray with a sprinkling of brown he be almost afraid of they eye they be yellow and shone as if a fire have be kindle back of they the goosey-gander have always be teach that it be most fitting to move slowly and with a rolling motion but these creature do not walk -- they half run he grow most alarmed however when he look at they foot these be large and the sole be tear and ragged-looking it be evident that the wild goose never question what they tramp upon they take no by-paths they be very neat and well care for in other respects but one could see by they foot that they be poor wilderness-folk the goosey-gander only have time to whisper to the boy : speak up quickly for yourself but do not tell they who you be -- before the goose be upon they when the wild goose have stop in front of they they curtsy with they neck many time and the goosey-gander do likewise many more time as soon as the ceremony be over the leader-goose say : now i presume we shall hear what kind of creature you be there be not much to tell about I say the goosey-gander i be bear in skanor last spring in the fall i be sell to holger nilsson of west vemminghög and there i have live ever since you do not seem to have any pedigree to boast of say the leader-goose what be it then that make you so high-minded that you wish to associate with wild goose it may be because i want to show you wild goose that we tame one may also be good for something say the goosey-gander yes it would be well if you could show we that say the leader-goose we have already observe how much you know about fly but you be more skilled perhaps in other sport possibly you be strong in a swimming match no i can not boast that i be say the goosey-gander it seem to he that the leader-goose have already make up she mind to send he home so he do not much care how he answer i never swim any farther than across a marl-ditch he continue then i presume you be a crack sprinter say the goose i have never see a tame goose run nor have i ever do it myself say the goosey-gander and he make thing appear much worse than they really be the big white one be sure now that the leader-goose would say that under no circumstance could they take he along he be very much astonish when she say : you answer question courageously and he who have courage can become a good travel companion even if he be ignorant in the begin what do you say to stop with we for a couple of day until we can see what you be good for that suit I say the goosey-gander -- and he be thoroughly happy thereupon the leader-goose point with she bill and say : but who be that you have with you i have never see anything like he before that be my comrade say the goosey-gander he be be a goose-tender all he life he 'll be useful all right to take with we on the trip yes he may be all right for a tame goose answer the wild one what do you call he he have several name say the goosey-gander -- hesitantly not know what he should hit upon in a hurry for he do not want to reveal the fact that the boy have a human name oh he name be thumbietot he say at last do he belong to the elf family ask the leader-goose at what time do you wild goose usually retire say the goosey-gander quickly -- try to evade that last question my eye close of they own accord about this time one could easily see that the goose who talk with the gander be very old she entire feather outfit be ice-gray without any dark streak the head be larger the leg coarser and the foot be more worn than any of the other the feather be stiff the shoulder knotty the neck thin all this be due to age it be only upon the eye that time have have no effect they shine brighter -- as if they be younger -- than any of the other she turn very haughtily toward the goosey-gander understand mr tame-goose that i be akka from kebnekaise and that the goose who fly nearest I -- to the right -- be iksi from vassijaure and the one to the left be kaksi from nuolja understand also that the second right-hand goose be kolmus from sarjektjakko and the second left be neljä from svappavaara and behind they fly viisus from oviksfjällen and kuusus from sjangelus and know that these as well as the six gosling who fly last -- three to the right and three to the leave -- be all high mountain goose of the finest breed you must not take we for land-lubber who strike up a chance acquaintance with any and everyone and you must not think that we permit anyone to share we quarter that will not tell we who he ancestor be when akka the leader-goose talk in this way the boy step briskly forward it have distressed he that the goosey-gander who have speak up so glibly for himself should give such evasive answer when it concern he i do not care to make a secret of who i be say he my name be nils holgersson i be a farmer 's son and until to-day i have be a human being but this morning -- he get no further as soon as he have say that he be human the leader-goose stagger three step backward and the rest of they even farther back they all extend they neck and hiss angrily at he i have suspect this ever since i first saw you here on these shore say akka and now you can clear out of here at once we tolerate no human being among we it be not possible say the goosey-gander meditatively that you wild goose can be afraid of anyone who be so tiny by to-morrow of course he 'll turn back home you can surely let he stay with we overnight none of we can afford to let such a poor little creature wander off by himself in the night -- among weasel and fox the wild goose come nearer but it be evident that it be hard for she to master she fear i have be teach to fear everything in human shape -- be it big or little say she but if you will answer for this one and swear that he will not harm we he can stay with we to-night but i do not believe we night quarter be suitable either for he or you for we intend to roost on the broken ice out here she think of course that the goosey-gander would be doubtful when he hear this but he never let on she be pretty wise who know how to choose such a safe bed say he you will be answerable for he return to he own to-morrow then i too will have to leave you say the goosey-gander i have swear that i would not forsake he you be free to fly whither you will say the leader-goose with this she raise she wing and fly out over the ice and one after another the wild goose follow she the boy be very sad to think that he trip to lapland would not come off and in the bargain he be afraid of the chilly night quarter it will be worse and worse say he in the first place we 'll freeze to death on the ice but the gander be in a good humor there be no danger say he only make haste i beg of you and gather together as much grass and litter as you can well carry when the boy have he arm full of dry grass the goosey-gander grab he by the shirt-band lift he and fly out on the ice where the wild goose be already fast asleep with they bill tuck under they wing now spread out the grass on the ice so there 'll be something to stand on to keep I from freezing fast you help I and i 'll help you say the goosey-gander this the boy do and when he have finish the goosey-gander pick he up once again by the shirt-band and tuck he under he wing i think you 'll lie snug and warm there say the goosey-gander as he cover he with he wing the boy be so imbed in down that he could not answer and he be nice and comfy oh but he be tire -- and in less than two wink he be fast asleep night it be a fact that ice be always treacherous and not to be trust in the middle of the night the loosen ice-cake on vomb lake move about until one corner of it touch the shore now it happen that mr smirre fox who live at this time in övid cloister park -- on the east side of the lake -- catch a glimpse of that one corner while he be out on he night chase smirre have see the wild goose early in the evening and have not dare to hope that he might get at one of they but now he walk right out on the ice when smirre be very near to the goose he claw scrape the ice and the goose awake flap they wing and prepare for flight but smirre be too quick for they he dart forward as though he would be shoot grab a goose by the wing and run toward land again but this night the wild goose be not alone on the ice for they have a human being among they -- little as he be the boy have awaken when the goosey-gander spread he wing he have tumble down on the ice and be sit there daze he have not grasp the why and wherefore of all this confusion until he catch sight of a little long-legged dog who run over the ice with a goose in he mouth in a minute the boy be after that dog to try and take the goose away from he he must have hear the goosey-gander call to he : have a care thumbietot have a care but the boy think that such a little runt of a dog be nothing to be afraid of and he rush ahead the wild goose that smirre fox tug after he hear the clatter as the boy 's wooden shoe beat against the ice and she could hardly believe she ear do that infant think he can take I away from the fox she wonder and in spite of she misery she begin to cackle right merrily deep down in she windpipe it be almost as if she have laugh the first thing he know he 'll fall through a crack in the ice think she but dark as the night be the boy see distinctly all the crack and hole there be and take daring leap over they this be because he have the elf 's good eyesight now and could see in the dark he see both lake and shore just as clearly as if it have be daylight smirre fox leave the ice where it touch the shore and just as he be work he way up to the land-edge the boy shout : drop that goose you sneak smirre do not know who be call to he and waste no time in look around but increase he pace the fox make straight for the forest and the boy follow he with never a thought of the danger he be run all he think about be the contemptuous way in which he have be receive by the wild goose and he make up he mind to let they see that a human being be something higher than all else create he shout again and again to that dog to make he drop he game what kind of a dog be you who can steal a whole goose and not feel ashamed of yourself drop she at once or you 'll see what a beat you 'll get drop she i say or i 'll tell you master how you behave when smirre fox see that he have be mistake for a scary dog he be so amuse that he come near drop the goose smirre be a great plunderer who be not satisfy with only hunting rat and pigeon in the field but he also venture into the farmyard to steal chicken and goose he know that he be fear throughout the district and anything as idiotic as this he have not hear since he be a baby the boy run so fast that the thick beech-tree appear to be run past he -- backward but he catch up with smirre finally he be so close to he that he get a hold on he tail now i 'll take the goose from you anyway cry he and hold on as hard as ever he could but he have not strength enough to stop smirre the fox drag he along until the dry foliage whirl around he but now it begin to dawn on smirre how harmless the thing be that pursued he he stop short put the goose on the ground and stand on she with he forepaw so she could not fly away he be just about to bite off she neck -- but then he could not resist the desire to tease the boy a little hurry off and complain to the master for now i be go to bite the goose to death say he certainly the one who be surprise when he see what a pointed nose and hear what a hoarse and angry voice that dog which he be pursue have -- be the boy but now he be so enraged because the fox have make fun of he that he never think of be frighten he take a firmer hold on the tail brace himself against a beech trunk and just as the fox open he jaw over the goose 's throat he pull as hard as he could smirre be so astonished that he let himself be pull backward a couple of step -- and the wild goose get away she flutter upward feebly and heavily one wing be so badly wound that she could barely use it in addition to this she could not see in the night darkness of the forest but be as helpless as the blind therefore she could in no way help the boy so she grope she way through the branch and fly down to the lake again then smirre make a dash for the boy if i do not get the one i shall certainly have the other say he and you could tell by he voice how mad he be oh do not you believe it say the boy who be in the best of spirit because he have save the goose he hold fast by the fox-tail and swing with it -- to one side -- when the fox try to catch he there be such a dance in that forest that the dry beech-leaf fairly fly smirre swing round and round but the tail swing too while the boy keep a tight grip on it so the fox could not grab he the boy be so gay after he success that in the beginning he laugh and make fun of the fox but smirre be persevere -- as old hunter generally be -- and the boy begin to fear that he should be capture in the end then he catch sight of a little young beech-tree that have shoot up as slender as a rod that it might soon reach the free air above the canopy of branch which the old beech spread above it quick as a flash he let go of the fox-tail and climb the beech tree smirre fox be so excited that he continue to dance around after he tail do not bother with the dance any longer say the boy but smirre could not endure the humiliation of he failure to get the better of such a little tot so he lay down under the tree that he might keep a close watch on he the boy do not have any too good a time of it where he sit astride a frail branch the young beech do not as yet reach the high branch-canopy so the boy could not get over to another tree and he do not dare to come down again he be so cold and numb that he almost lose he hold around the branch and he be dreadfully sleepy but he do not dare fall asleep for fear of tumble down my but it be dismal to sit in that way the whole night through out in the forest he never before understand the real meaning of night it be just as if the whole world have become petrified and never could come to life again then it commence to dawn the boy be glad that everything begin to look like itself once more although the chill be even sharper than it have be during the night finally when the sun get up it be not yellow but red the boy think it look as though it be angry and he wonder what it be angry about perhaps it be because the night have make it so cold and gloomy on earth while the sun be away the sunbeam come down in great cluster to see what the night have be up to it could be see how everything blush -- as if they all have guilty conscience the cloud in the sky the satiny beech-limb the little intertwine branch of the forest-canopy the hoar-frost that cover the foliage on the ground -- everything grow flush and red more and more sunbeam come burst through space and soon the night 's terror be drive away and such a marvellous lot of live thing come forward the black woodpecker with the red neck begin to hammer with its bill on the branch the squirrel glide from he nest with a nut and sit down on a branch and begin to shell it the starling come fly with a worm and the bulfinch sing in the tree-top then the boy understand that the sun have say to all these tiny creature : wake up now and come out of you nest i be here now you need be afraid of nothing the wild-goose call be hear from the lake as they be prepare for flight and soon all fourteen goose come fly through the forest the boy try to call to they but they fly so high that he voice could not reach they they probably believe the fox have eat he up and they do not trouble themselves to look for he the boy come near cry with regret but the sun stand up there -- orange-coloured and happy -- and put courage into the whole world it be not worth while nil holgersson for you to be trouble about anything as long as i be here say the sun goose-play _ Monday march twenty-first _ everything remain unchanged in the forest -- about as long as it take a goose to eat she breakfast but just as the morning be verge on forenoon a goose come fly all by herself under the thick tree-canopy she grope she way hesitatingly between the stem and branch and fly very slowly as soon as smirre fox see she he leave he place under the beech tree and sneak up toward she the wild goose do not avoid the fox but fly very close to he smirre make a high jump for she but he miss she and the goose go on she way down to the lake it be not long before another goose come fly she take the same route as the first one and fly still lower and slower she too fly close to smirre fox and he make such a high spring for she that he ear brush she foot but she too get away from he unhurt and go she way toward the lake silent as a shadow a little while pass and then there come another wild goose she fly still slower and lower and it seem even more difficult for she to find she way between the beech-branch smirre make a powerful spring he be within a hair 's breadth of catch she but that goose also manage to save herself just after she have disappear come a fourth she fly so slowly and so badly that smirre fox think he could catch she without much effort but he be afraid of failure now and conclude to let she fly past -- unmolested she take the same direction the other have take and just as she be come right above smirre she sink down so far that he be tempt to jump for she he jump so high that he touch she with he tail but she fling herself quickly to one side and save she life before smirre get through pant three more goose come fly in a row they fly just like the rest and smirre make high spring for they all but he do not succeed in catch any one of they after that come five goose but these fly better than the other and although it seem as if they want to lure smirre to jump he withstand the temptation after quite a long time come one single goose it be the thirteenth this one be so old that she be gray all over without a dark speck anywhere on she body she do not appear to use one wing very well but fly so wretchedly and crookedly that she almost touch the ground smirre not only make a high leap for she but he pursue she running and jump all the way down to the lake but not even this time do he get anything for he trouble when the fourteenth goose come along it look very pretty because it be white and as its great wing sway it glisten like a light in the dark forest when smirre fox see this one he muster all he resource and jump half-way up to the tree-canopy but the white one fly by unhurt like the rest now it be quiet for a moment under the beech it look as if the whole wild-goose-flock have travel past suddenly smirre remember he prisoner and raise he eye toward the young beech-tree and just as he might have expect -- the boy have disappear but smirre do not have much time to think about he for now the first goose come back again from the lake and fly slowly under the canopy in spite of all he ill luck smirre be glad that she come back and dart after she with a high leap but he have be in too much of a hurry and have not take the time to calculate the distance and he land at one side of the goose then there come still another goose then a third a fourth a fifth and so on until the angle close in with the old ice-gray one and the big white one they all fly low and slow just as they sway in the vicinity of smirre fox they sink down -- kind of inviting-like -- for he to take they smirre run after they and make leap a couple of fathom high -- but he could not manage to get hold of a single one of they it be the most awful day that smirre fox have ever experience the wild goose keep on travel over he head they come and go -- come and go great splendid goose who have eat themselves fat on the german heath and grain field sway all day through the wood and so close to he that he touch they many time yet he be not permit to appease he hunger with a single one of they the winter be hardly go yet and smirre recall night and day when he have be force to tramp around in idleness with not so much as a hare to hunt when the rat hide themselves under the frozen earth and when the chicken be all shut up but all the winter 's hunger have not be as hard to endure as this day 's miscalculation smirre be no young fox he have have the dog after he many a time and have hear the bullet whizz around he ear he have lie in hide down in the lair while the dachshund creep into the crevice and all but find he but all the anguish that smirre fox have be force to suffer under this hot chase be not to be compare with what he suffer every time that he miss one of the wild goose in the morning when the play begin smirre fox have look so stunning that the goose be amaze when they see he smirre love display he coat be a brilliant red he breast white he nose black and he tail be as bushy as a plume but when the evening of this day be come smirre 's coat hang in loose fold he be bath in sweat he eye be without lustre he tongue hang far out from he gaping jaw and froth ooze from he mouth in the afternoon smirre be so exhaust that he grow delirious he see nothing before he eye but fly goose he make leap for sun-spot which he see on the ground and for a poor little butterfly that have come out of he chrysali too soon the wild goose fly and fly unceasingly all day long they continue to torment smirre they be not move to pity because smirre be do up fevered and out of he head they continue without a let-up although they understand that he hardly see they and that he jump after they shadow when smirre fox sink down on a pile of dry leaf weak and powerless and almost ready to give up the ghost they stop tease he now you know mr fox what happen to the one who dare to come near akka of kebnekaise they shout in he ear and with that they leave he in peace the wonderful journey of nil on the farm _ Thursday march twenty-fourth _ just at that time a thing happen in skåne which create a good deal of discussion and even get into the newspaper but which many believe to be a fable because they have not be able to explain it it be about like this : a lady squirrel have be capture in the hazelbrush that grow on the shore of vomb lake and be carry to a farmhouse close by all the folk on the farm -- both young and old -- be delighted with the pretty creature with the bushy tail the wise inquisitive eye and the natty little foot they intend to amuse themselves all summer by watch its nimble movement its ingenious way of shell nut and its droll play they immediately put in order a old squirrel cage with a little green house and a wire-cylinder wheel the little house which have both door and window the lady squirrel be to use as a dining room and bedroom for this reason they place therein a bed of leave a bowl of milk and some nut the cylinder wheel on the other hand she be to use as a play-house where she could run and climb and swing round the people believe that they have arrange thing very comfortably for the lady squirrel and they be astonish because she do not seem to be contented but instead she sit there downcast and moody in a corner of she room every now and again she would let out a shrill agonised cry she do not touch the food and not once do she swing round on the wheel it be probably because she be frighten say the farmer folk to-morrow when she feel more at home she will both eat and play meanwhile the woman folk on the farm be make preparation for a feast and just on that day when the lady squirrel have be capture they be busy with a elaborate bake they have have bad luck with something : either the dough would not rise or else they have be dilatory for they be oblige to work long after dark naturally there be a great deal of excitement and bustle in the kitchen and probably no one there take time to think about the squirrel or to wonder how she be get on but there be a old grandma in the house who be too aged to take a hand in the bake this she herself understand but just the same she do not relish the idea of be leave out of the game she feel rather downheart and for this reason she do not go to bed but seat herself by the sitting-room window and look out they have open the kitchen door on account of the heat and through it a clear ray of light stream out on the yard and it become so well light out there that the old woman could see all the crack and hole in the plaster on the wall opposite she also see the squirrel cage which hang just where the light fall clearest and she notice how the squirrel run from she room to the wheel and from the wheel to she room all night long without stop a instant she think it be a strange sort of unrest that have come over the animal but she believe of course that the strong light keep she awake between the cow-house and the stable there be a broad handsome carriage-gate this too come within the light-radius as the night wear on the old grandma see a tiny creature no bigger than a hand 's breadth cautiously steal he way through the gate he be dress in leather breeches and wooden shoe like any other work man the old grandma know at once that it be the elf and she be not the least bit frightened she have always hear that the elf keep himself somewhere about the place although she have never see he before and a elf to be sure bring good luck wherever he appear as soon as the elf come into the stone-paved yard he run right up to the squirrel cage and since it hang so high that he could not reach it he go over to the store-house after a rod place it against the cage and swing himself up -- in the same way that a sailor climb a rope when he have reach the cage he shake the door of the little green house as if he want to open it but the old grandma do not move for she know that the child have put a padlock on the door as they fear that the boy on the neighbouring farm would try to steal the squirrel the old woman see that when the boy could not get the door open the lady squirrel come out to the wire wheel there they hold a long conference together and when the boy have listen to all that the imprison animal have to say to he he slide down the rod to the ground and run out through the carriage-gate the old woman do not expect to see anything more of the elf that night nevertheless she remain at the window after a few moment have go by he return he be in such a hurry that it seem to she as though he foot hardly touch the ground and he rush right up to the squirrel cage the old woman with she far-sighted eye see he distinctly and she also see that he carry something in he hand but what it be she could not imagine the thing he carry in he left hand he lay down on the pavement but that which he hold in he right hand he take with he to the cage he kick so hard with he wooden shoe on the little window that the glass be break he poke in the thing which he hold in he hand to the lady squirrel then he slide down again and take up that which he have lay upon the ground and climb up to the cage with that also the next instant he run off again with such haste that the old woman could hardly follow he with she eye but now it be the old grandma who could no longer sit still in the cottage but who very slowly go out to the back yard and station herself in the shadow of the pump to await the elf 's return and there be one other who have also see he and have become curious this be the house cat he creep along slyly and stop close to the wall just two step away from the stream of light they both stand and wait long and patiently on that chilly march night and the old woman be just begin to think about go in again when she hear a clatter on the pavement and see that the little mite of a elf come trot along once more carry a burden in each hand as he have do before that which he bear squeal and squirm and now a light dawn on the old grandma she understand that the elf have hurry down to the hazel-grove and bring back the lady squirrel 's baby and that he be carry they to she so they should not starve to death the old grandma stand very still so as not to disturb they and it do not look as if the elf have notice she he be just go to lay one of the baby on the ground so that he could swing himself up to the cage with the other one -- when he see the house cat 's green eye glisten close beside he he stand there bewilder with a young one in each hand he turn around and look in all direction then he become aware of the old grandma 's presence then he do not hesitate long but walk forward stretch he arm as high as he could reach for she to take one of the baby squirrel the old grandma do not wish to prove herself unworthy of the confidence so she bent down and take the baby squirrel and stand there and hold it until the boy have swing himself up to the cage with the other one then he come back for the one he have entrust to she care the next morning when the farm folk have gather together for breakfast it be impossible for the old woman to refrain from tell they of what she have see the night before they all laugh at she of course and say that she have be only dream there be no baby squirrel this early in the year but she be sure of she ground and beg they to take a look into the squirrel cage and this they do and there lay on the bed of leaf four tiny half-naked half blind baby squirrel who be at least a couple of day old when the farmer himself see the young one he say : be it as it may with this but one thing be certain we on this farm have behave in such a manner that we be shame before both animal and human being and thereupon he take the mother squirrel and all she young one from the cage and lay they in the old grandma 's lap go thou out to the hazel-grove with they say he and let they have they freedom back again it be this event that be so much talk about and which even get into the newspaper but which the majority would not credit because they be not able to explain how anything like that could have happen vittskövle _ Saturday march twenty-sixth _ two day later another strange thing happen a flock of wild goose come fly one morning and light on a meadow down in eastern skåne not very far from vittskövle manor in the flock be thirteen wild goose of the usual gray variety and one white goosey-gander who carry on he back a tiny lad dress in yellow leather breeches green vest and a white woollen toboggan hood they be now very near the eastern sea and on the meadow where the goose have alight the soil be sandy as it usually be on the sea-coast it look as if formerly there have be fly sand in this vicinity which have to be hold down for in several direction large plant pine-wood could be see when the wild goose have be feed a while several child come along and walk on the edge of the meadow the goose who be on guard at once raise herself into the air with noisy wing-stroke so the whole flock should hear that there be danger on foot all the wild goose fly upward but the white one trot along on the ground unconcerned when he see the other fly he raise he head and call after they : you need not fly away from these they be only a couple of child the little creature who have be ride on he back sit down upon a knoll on the outskirts of the wood and pick a pine-cone in piece that he might get at the seed the child be so close to he that he do not dare to run across the meadow to the white one he conceal himself under a big dry thistle-leaf and at the same time give a warning-cry but the white one have evidently make up he mind not to let himself be scare he walk along on the ground all the while and not once do he look to see in what direction they be go meanwhile they turn from the path walk across the field get nearer and nearer to the goosey-gander when he finally do look up they be right upon he he be so dumfounded and become so confused he forget that he could fly and try to get out of they reach by run but the child follow chase he into a ditch and there they catch he the larger of the two stick he under he arm and carry he off when the boy who lay under the thistle-leaf saw this he spring up as if he want to take the goosey-gander away from they then he must have remember how little and powerless he be for he throw himself on the knoll and beat upon the ground with he clenched fist the goosey-gander cry with all he might for help : thumbietot come and help I oh thumbietot come and help I the boy begin to laugh in the midst of he distress oh yes i be just the right one to help anybody i be say he anyway he get up and follow the goosey-gander i can not help he say he but i shall at least find out where they be take he the child have a good start but the boy have no difficulty in keep they within sight until they come to a hollow where a brook gush forth but here he be oblige to run alongside of it for some little time before he could find a place narrow enough for he to jump over when he come up from the hollow the child have disappear he could see they footprint on a narrow path which lead to the wood and these he continue to follow soon he come to a cross-road here the child must have separate for there be footprint in two direction the boy look now as if all hope have flee then he see a little white down on a heather-knoll and he understand that the goosey-gander have drop this by the wayside to let he know in which direction he have be carry and therefore he continue he search he follow the child through the entire wood the goosey-gander he do not see but wherever he be likely to miss he way lay a little white down to put he right the boy continue faithfully to follow the bit of down they lead he out of the wood across a couple of meadow up on a road and finally through the entrance of a broad _ allée _ at the end of the _ allée _ there be gable and tower of red tiling decorate with bright border and other ornamentation that glitter and shine when the boy see that this be some great manor he think he know what have become of the goosey-gander no doubt the child have carry the goosey-gander to the manor and sell he there by this time he be probably butcher he say to himself but he do not seem to be satisfy with anything less than proof positive and with renew courage he run forward he meet no one in the _ allée _ -- and that be well for such as he be generally afraid of be see by human being the mansion which he come to be a splendid old-time structure with four great wing which inclose a courtyard on the east wing there be a high arch lead into the courtyard this far the boy run without hesitation but when he get there he stop he dare not venture farther but stand still and ponder what he should do now there he stand with he finger on he nose think when he hear footstep behind he and as he turn around he see a whole company march up the _ allée _ in haste he steal behind a water-barrel which stand near the arch and hide himself those who come up be some twenty young man from a folk-high-school out on a walk tour they be accompany by one of the instructor when they be come as far as the arch the teacher request they to wait there a moment while he go in and ask if they might see the old castle of vittskövle the newcomer be warm and tired as if they have be on a long tramp one of they be so thirsty that he go over to the water-barrel and stoop down to drink he have a tin box such as botanist use hang about he neck he evidently think that this be in he way for he throw it down on the ground with this the lid fly open and one could see that there be a few spring flower in it the botanist 's box drop just in front of the boy and he must have think that here be he opportunity to get into the castle and find out what have become of the goosey-gander he smuggle himself quickly into the box and conceal himself as well as he could under the anemone and colt 's - foot he be hardly hide before the young man pick the box up hang it around he neck and slam down the cover then the teacher come back and say that they have be give permission to enter the castle at first he conduct they no farther than the courtyard there he stop and begin to talk to they about this ancient structure he call they attention to the first human being who have inhabit this country and who have be oblige to live in mountain-grotto and earth-cave in the den of wild beast and in the brushwood and that a very long period have elapse before they learn to build themselves hut from the trunk of tree and afterward how long have they not be force to labor and struggle before they have advance from the log cabin with its single room to the building of a castle with a hundred room -- like vittskövle it be about three hundred and fifty year ago that the rich and powerful build such castle for themselves he say it be very evident that vittskövle have be erect at a time when war and robber make it unsafe in skåne all around the castle be a deep trench fill with water and across this there have be a bridge in bygone day that could be hoist up over the gate-arch there be even to this day a watch-tower and all along the side of the castle run sentry-gallery and in the corner stand tower with wall a metre thick yet the castle have not be erect in the most savage war time for jen brahe who build it have also study to make of it a beautiful and decorative ornament if they could see the big solid stone structure at glimminge which have be build only a generation earlier they would readily see that jan holgersen ulfstand the builder have not figure upon anything else -- only to build big and strong and secure without bestow a think upon make it beautiful and comfortable if they visit such castle as marsvinsholm snogeholm and övid 's cloister -- which be erect a hundred year or so later -- they would find that the time have become less warlike the gentleman who build these place have not furnish they with fortification but have only take pain to provide themselves with great splendid dwelling house the teacher talk at length -- and in detail and the boy who lay shut up in the box be pretty impatient but he must have lie very still for the owner of the box have not the least suspicion that he be carry he along finally the company go into the castle but if the boy have hope for a chance to crawl out of that box he be deceive for the student carry it upon he all the while and the boy be oblige to accompany he through all the room it be a tedious tramp the teacher stop every other minute to explain and instruct in one room he find a old fireplace and before this he stop to talk about the different kind of fireplace that have be use in the course of time the first indoors fireplace have be a big flat stone on the floor of the hut with a opening in the roof which let in both wind and rain the next have be a big stone hearth with no opening in the roof this must have make the hut very warm but it also fill it with soot and smoke when vittskövle be build the people have advance far enough to open the fireplace which at that time have a wide chimney for the smoke but it also take most of the warmth up in the air with it if that boy have ever in he life be cross and impatient he be give a good lesson in patience that day it must have be a whole hour now that he have lie perfectly still in the next room they come to the teacher stop before a old-time bed with its high canopy and rich curtain immediately he begin to talk about the bed and bed place of olden day the teacher do not hurry himself but then he do not know of course that a poor little creature lay shut up in a botanist 's box and only wait for he to get through when they come to a room with gilded leather hanging he talk to they about how the people have dress they wall and ceiling ever since the beginning of time and when he come to a old family portrait he tell they all about the different change in dress and in the banquet hall he describe ancient custom of celebrate wedding and funeral thereupon the teacher talk a little about the excellent man and woman who have live in the castle about the old brahe and the old barnekow of christian barnekow who have give he horse to the king to help he escape of margareta ascheberg who have be marry to kjell barnekow and who when a widow have manage the estate and the whole district for fifty-three year of banker hageman a farmer 's son from vittskövle who have grow so rich that he have buy the entire estate about the stjernsvärds who have give the people of skåne better plough which enable they to discard the ridiculous old wooden plough that three ox be hardly able to drag during all this the boy lay still if he have ever be mischievous and shut the cellar door on he father or mother he understand now how they have feel for it be hour and hour before that teacher get through at last the teacher go out into the courtyard again and there he discourse upon the tireless labor of mankind to procure for themselves tool and weapon clothes and house and ornament he say that such a old castle as vittskövle be a mile-post on time 's highway here one could see how far the people have advance three hundred and fifty year ago and one could judge for oneself whether thing have go forward or backward since they time but this dissertation the boy escape hearing for the student who carry he be thirsty again and steal into the kitchen to ask for a drink of water when the boy be carry into the kitchen he should have try to look around for the goosey-gander he have begin to move and as he do this he happen to press too hard against the lid -- and it fly open as botanist ' box-lid be always fly open the student think no more about the matter but press it down again then the cook ask he if he have a snake in the box no i have only a few plant the student reply it be certainly something that move there insist the cook the student throw back the lid to show she that she be mistaken see for yourself -- if -- but he get no further for now the boy dare not stay in the box any longer but with one bind he stand on the floor and out he rush the maid hardly have time to see what it be that run but they hurry after it nevertheless the teacher still stand and talk when he be interrupt by shrill cry catch he catch he shriek those who have come from the kitchen and all the young man race after the boy who glide away faster than a rat they try to intercept he at the gate but it be not so easy to get a hold on such a little creature so luckily he get out in the open the boy do not dare to run down toward the open _ allée _ but turn in another direction he rush through the garden into the back yard all the while the people race after he shriek and laugh the poor little thing run as hard as ever he could to get out of they way but still it look as though the people would catch up with he as he rush past a labourer 's cottage he hear a goose cackle and see a white down lie on the doorstep there at last be the goosey-gander he have be on the wrong track before he think no more of housemaid and man who be hound he but climb up the step -- and into the hallway farther he could not come for the door be lock he hear how the goosey-gander cry and moan inside but he could not get the door open the hunter that be pursue he come nearer and nearer and in the room the goosey-gander cry more and more pitifully in this direst of need the boy finally pluck up courage and pound on the door with all he might a child open it and the boy look into the room in the middle of the floor sit a woman who hold the goosey-gander tight to clip he quill-feather it be she child who have find he and she do not want to do he any harm it be she intention to let he in among she own goose have she only succeed in clipping he wing so he could not fly away but a worse fate could hardly have happen to the goosey-gander and he shriek and moan with all he might and a lucky thing it be that the woman have not start the clipping sooner now only two quill have fall under the shears ' when the door be open -- and the boy stand on the door-sill but a creature like that the woman have never see before she could not believe anything else but that it be goa-nisse himself and in she terror she drop the shears clasp she hand -- and forget to hold on to the goosey-gander as soon as he feel himself free he run toward the door he do not give himself time to stop but as he run past he he grab the boy by the neck-band and carry he along with he on the stoop he spread he wing and fly up in the air at the same time he make a graceful sweep with he neck and seat the boy on he smooth downy back and off they fly -- while all vittskövle stand and stare after they in övid cloister park all that day when the wild goose play with the fox the boy lay and sleep in a desert squirrel nest when he awake along toward evening he feel very uneasy well now i shall soon be send home again then i 'll have to exhibit myself before father and mother think he but when he look up and see the wild goose who lay and bath in vomb lake -- not one of they say a word about he go they probably think the white one be too tired to travel home with I to-night think the boy the next morning the goose be awake at daybreak long before sunrise now the boy feel sure that he would have to go home but curiously enough both he and the white goosey-gander be permit to follow the wild one on they morning tour the boy could not comprehend the reason for the delay but he figure it out in this way that the wild goose do not care to send the goosey-gander on such a long journey until they have both eat they fill come what might he be only glad for every moment that should pass before he must face he parent the wild goose travel over övid 's cloister estate which be situate in a beautiful park east of the lake and look very impose with its great castle its well plan court surround by low wall and pavilion its fine old-time garden with covered arbor stream and fountain its wonderful tree trim bush and its evenly mown lawn with they bed of beautiful spring flower when the wild goose ride over the estate in the early morning hour there be no human be about when they have carefully assure themselves of this they lower themselves toward the dog kennel and shout : what kind of a little hut be this what kind of a little hut be this instantly the dog come out of he kennel -- furiously angry -- and bark at the air do you call this a hut you tramp can not you see that this be a great stone castle can not you see what fine terrace and what a lot of pretty wall and window and great door it have bow wow wow wow do not you see the grounds can not you see the garden can not you see the conservatory can not you see the marble statue you call this a hut do you do hut have park with beech-grove and hazel-bush and trail vine and oak tree and fir and hunting-grounds fill with game wow wow wow do you call this a hut have you see hut with so many outhouse around they that they look like a whole village you must know of a lot of hut that have they own church and they own parsonage and that rule over the district and the peasant home and the neighbouring farm and barracks wow wow wow do you call this a hut to this hut belong the richest possession in skåne you beggar you can not see a bit of land from where you hang in the cloud that do not obey command from this hut wow wow wow all this the dog manage to cry out in one breath and the wild goose fly back and forth over the estate and listen to he until he be winded but then they cry : what be you so mad about we do not ask about the castle we only want to know about you kennel stupid when the boy hear this joke he laugh then a thought steal in on he which at once make he serious think how many of these amusing thing you would hear if you could go with the wild goose through the whole country all the way up to lapland say he to himself and just now when you be in such a bad fix a trip like that would be the best thing you could hit upon the wild goose travel to one of the wide field east of the estate to eat grass-roots and they keep this up for hour in the meantime the boy wander in the great park which border the field he hunt up a beech-nut grove and begin to look up at the bush to see if a nut from last fall still hang there but again and again the thought of the trip come over he as he walk in the park he picture to himself what a fine time he would have if he go with the wild goose to freeze and starve : that he believe he should have to do often enough but as a recompense he would escape both work and study as he walk there the old gray leader-goose come up to he and ask if he have find anything eatable no that he have not he reply and then she try to help he she could not find any nut either but she discover a couple of dry blossom that hang on a brier-bush these the boy eat with a good relish but he wonder what mother would say if she know that he have live on raw fish and old winter-dried blossom when the wild goose have finally eat themselves full they bear off toward the lake again where they amuse themselves with game until almost dinner time the wild goose challenge the white goosey-gander to take part in all kind of sport they have swim race run race and fly race with he the big tame one do he level best to hold he own but the clever wild goose beat he every time all the while the boy sit on the goosey-gander 's back and encourage he and have as much fun as the rest they laugh and scream and cackle and it be remarkable that the people on the estate do not hear they when the wild goose be tire of play they fly out on the ice and rest for a couple of hour the afternoon they spend in pretty much the same way as the forenoon first a couple of hour feed then bathing and play in the water near the ice-edge until sunset when they immediately arrange themselves for sleep this be just the life that suit I think the boy when he creep in under the gander 's wing but to-morrow i suppose i 'll be send home before he fall asleep he lay and think that if he might go along with the wild goose he would escape all scolding because he be lazy then he could cut loose every day and he only worry would be to get something to eat but he need so little nowadays and there would always be a way to get that so he picture the whole scene to himself what he should see and all the adventure that he would be in on yes it would be something different from the wear and tear at home if i could only go with the wild goose on they travels i should not grieve because i would be transform think the boy he be not afraid of anything -- except be send home but not even on Wednesday do the goose say anything to he about go that day pass in the same way as Tuesday and the boy grow more and more contented with the outdoor life he think that he have the lovely övid cloister park -- which be as large as a forest -- all to himself and he be not anxious to go back to the stuffy cabin and the little patch of ground there at home on Wednesday he believe that the wild goose think of keep he with they but on Thursday he lose hope again Thursday begin just like the other day the goose feed on the broad meadow and the boy hunt for food in the park after a while akka come to he and ask if he have find anything to eat no he have not and then she look up a dry caraway herb that have keep all its tiny seed intact when the boy have eat akka say that she think he run around in the park altogether too recklessly she wonder if he know how many enemy he have to guard against -- he who be so little no he do not know anything at all about that then akka begin to enumerate they for he whenever he walk in the park she say that he must look out for the fox and the marten when he come to the shore of the lake he must think of the otter as he sit on the stone wall he must not forget the weasel who could creep through the smallest hole and if he wish to lie down and sleep on a pile of leaf he must first find out if the adder be not sleep they winter sleep in the same pile as soon as he come out in the open field he should keep a eye out for hawk and buzzard for eagle and falcon that soar in the air in the bramble-bush he could be capture by the sparrow-hawk magpie and crow be find everywhere and in these he must not place any too much confidence as soon as it be dusk he must keep he ear open and listen for the big owl who fly along with such soundless wing-stroke that they could come right up to he before he be aware of they presence when the boy hear that there be so many who be after he life he think that it would be simply impossible for he to escape he be not particularly afraid to die but he do not like the idea of be eat up so he ask akka what he should do to protect himself from the carnivorous animal akka answer at once that the boy should try to get on good term with all the small animal in the wood and field : with the squirrel-folk and the hare-family with bullfinch and the titmouse and woodpecker and lark if he make friend with they they could warn he against danger find hide place for he and protect he but later in the day when the boy try to profit by this counsel and turn to sirle squirrel to ask for he protection it be evident that he do not care to help he you surely can not expect anything from I or the rest of the small animal say sirle do not you think we know that you be nil the goose boy who tear down the swallow 's nest last year crush the starling 's egg throw baby crow in the marl-ditch catch thrush in snare and put squirrel in cage you just help yourself as well as you can and you may be thankful that we do not form a league against you and drive you back to you own kind this be just the sort of answer the boy would not have let go unpunished in the day when he be nil the goose boy but now he be only fearful lest the wild goose too have find out how wicked he could be he have be so anxious for fear he would not be permit to stay with the wild goose that he have not dare to get into the least little mischief since he join they company it be true that he do not have the power to do much harm now but little as he be he could have destroy many bird ' nest and crush many egg if he would be in a mind to now he have be good he have not pull a feather from a goose-wing or give anyone a rude answer and every morning when he call upon akka he have always remove he cap and bow all day Thursday he think it be surely on account of he wickedness that the wild goose do not care to take he along up to lapland and in the evening when he hear that sirle squirrel 's wife have be steal and she child be starve to death he make up he mind to help they and we have already be tell how well he succeed when the boy come into the park on Friday he hear the bulfinch sing in every bush of how sirle squirrel 's wife have be carry away from she child by cruel robber and how nil the goose boy have risk he life among human being and take the little squirrel child to she and who be so honor in övid cloister park now as thumbietot sing the bullfinch he whom all fear when he be nil the goose boy sirle squirrel will give he nut the poor hare be go to play with he the small wild animal will carry he on they back and fly away with he when smirre fox approach the titmouse be go to warn he against the hawk and the finch and lark will sing of he valor the boy be absolutely certain that both akka and the wild goose have hear all this but still Friday pass and not one word do they say about he remain with they until Saturday the wild goose feed in the field around övid undisturbed by smirre fox but on Saturday morning when they come out in the meadow he lay in wait for they and chase they from one field to another and they be not allow to eat in peace when akka understand that he do not intend to leave they in peace she come to a decision quickly raise herself into the air and fly with she flock several mile away over färs ' plain and linderödsosen 's hill they do not stop before they have arrive in the district of vittskövle but at vittskövle the goosey-gander be steal and how it happen have already be relate if the boy have not use all he power to help he he would never again have be find on Saturday evening as the boy come back to vomb lake with the goosey-gander he think that he have do a good day 's work and he speculate a good deal on what akka and the wild goose would say to he the wild goose be not at all spare in they praise but they do not say the word he be longing to hear then Sunday come again a whole week have go by since the boy have be bewitch and he be still just as little but he do not appear to be give himself any extra worry on account of this thing on Sunday afternoon he sit huddle together in a big fluffy osier-bush down by the lake and blow on a reed-pipe all around he there sit as many finch and bullfinch and starling as the bush could well hold -- who sing song which he try to teach himself to play but the boy be not at home in this art he blow so false that the feather raise themselves on the little music-master and they shriek and flutter in they despair the boy laugh so heartily at they excitement that he drop he pipe he begin once again and that go just as badly then all the little bird wail : to-day you play worse than usual thumbietot you do not take one true note where be you thought thumbietot they be elsewhere say the boy -- and this be true he sit there and ponder how long he would be allow to remain with the wild goose or if he should be send home perhaps to-day finally the boy throw down he pipe and jump from the bush he have see akka and all the wild goose come toward he in a long row they walk so uncommonly slow and dignified-like that the boy immediately understand that now he should learn what they intend to do with he when they stop at last akka say : you may well have reason to wonder at I thumbietot who have not say thanks to you for save I from smirre fox but i be one of those who would rather give thanks by deed than word i have send word to the elf that bewitch you at first he do not want to hear anything about cure you but i have send message upon message to he and tell he how well you have conduct yourself among we he greet you and say that as soon as you turn back home you shall be human again but think of it just as happy as the boy have be when the wild goose begin to speak just that miserable be he when they have finish he do not say a word but turn away and weep what in all the world be this say akka it look as though you have expect more of I than i have offer you but the boy be think of the care-free day and the banter and of adventure and freedom and travel high above the earth that he should miss and he actually bawl with grief i do not want to be human say he i want to go with you to lapland i 'll tell you something say akka that elf be very touchy and i be afraid that if you do not accept he offer now it will be difficult for you to coax he another time it be a strange thing about that boy -- as long as he have live he have never care for anyone he have not care for he father or mother not for the school teacher not for he school-mate nor for the boy in the neighborhood all that they have wish to have he do -- whether it have be work or play -- he have only think tiresome therefore there be no one whom he miss or long for the only one that he have come anywhere near agree with be osa the goose girl and little mat -- a couple of child who have tend goose in the field like himself but he do not care particularly for they either no far from it i do not want to be human bawl the boy i want to go with you to lapland that be why i have be good for a whole week i do not want to forbid you to come along with we as far as you like say akka but think first if you would not rather go home again a day may come when you will regret this no say the boy that be nothing to regret i have never be as well off as here with you well then let it be as you wish say akka thanks say the boy and he feel so happy that he have to cry for very joy -- just as he have cry before from sorrow glimminge castle black rat and gray rat in south-eastern skåne -- not far from the sea there be a old castle call glimminge it be a big and substantial stone house and can be see over the plain for mile around it be not more than four story high but it be so ponderous that a ordinary farmhouse which stand on the same estate look like a little child 's playhouse in comparison the big stone house have such thick ceiling and partition that there be scarcely room in its interior for anything but the thick wall the stair be narrow the entrance small and the room few that the wall might retain they strength there be only the fewest number of window in the upper story and none at all be find in the lower one in the old war time the people be just as glad that they could shut themselves up in a strong and massive house like this as one be nowadays to be able to creep into fur in a snap cold winter but when the time of peace come they do not care to live in the dark and cold stone hall of the old castle any longer they have long since desert the big glimminge castle and move into dwelling place where the light and air can penetrate at the time when nil holgersson wander around with the wild goose there be no human being in glimminge castle but for all that it be not without inhabitant every summer there live a stork couple in a large nest on the roof in a nest in the attic live a pair of gray owl in the secret passage hang bat in the kitchen oven live a old cat and down in the cellar there be hundred of old black rat rat be not hold in very high esteem by other animal but the black rat at glimminge castle be a exception they be always mention with respect because they have show great valor in battle with they enemy and much endurance under the great misfortune which have befall they kind they nominally belong to a rat-folk who at one time have be very numerous and powerful but who be now die out during a long period of time the black rat own skåne and the whole country they be find in every cellar in every attic in larder and cowhouse and barn in brewery and flour-mill in church and castle in every man-constructed building but now they be banish from all this -- and be almost exterminate only in one and another old and secluded place could one run across a few of they and nowhere be they to be find in such large number as in glimminge castle when a animal folk die out it be generally the human kind who be the cause of it but that be not the case in this instance the people have certainly struggle with the black rat but they have not be able to do they any harm worth mention those who have conquer they be a animal folk of they own kind who be call gray rat these gray rat have not live in the land since time immemorial like the black rat but descend from a couple of poor immigrant who land in malmö from a libyan sloop about a hundred year ago they be homeless starved-out wretch who stick close to the harbor swam among the pile under the bridge and eat refuse that be throw in the water they never venture into the city which be own by the black rat but gradually as the gray rat increase in number they grow bolder at first they move over to some waste place and condemn old house which the black rat have abandon they hunt they food in gutter and dirt heap and make the most of all the rubbish that the black rat do not deign to take care of they be hardy contented and fearless and within a few year they have become so powerful that they undertake to drive the black rat out of malmö they take from they attic cellar and storeroom starve they out or bit they to death for they be not at all afraid of fight when malmö be capture they march forward in small and large company to conquer the whole country it be almost impossible to comprehend why the black rat do not muster themselves into a great united war-expedition to exterminate the gray rat while these be still few in number but the black rat be so certain of they power that they could not believe it possible for they to lose it they sit still on they estate and in the meantime the gray rat take from they farm after farm city after city they be starve out force out root out in skåne they have not be able to maintain themselves in a single place except glimminge castle the old castle have such secure wall and such few rat passage lead through these that the black rat have manage to protect themselves and to prevent the gray rat from crowd in night after night year after year the struggle have continue between the aggressor and the defender but the black rat have keep faithful watch and have fight with the utmost contempt for death and thanks to the fine old house they have always conquer it will have to be acknowledge that as long as the black rat be in power they be as much shun by all other live creature as the gray rat be in we day -- and for just cause they have throw themselves upon poor fettered prisoner and tortured they they have ravish the dead they have steal the last turnip from the cellar of the poor bitten off the foot of sleep goose rob egg and chick from the hen and commit a thousand depredation but since they have come to grief all this seem to have be forget and no one could help but marvel at the last of a race that have hold out so long against its enemy the gray rat that live in the courtyard at glimminge and in the vicinity keep up a continuous warfare and try to watch out for every possible chance to capture the castle one would fancy that they should have allow the little company of black rat to occupy glimminge castle in peace since they themselves have acquire all the rest of the country but you may be sure this think never occur to they they be wont to say that it be a point of honor with they to conquer the black rat at some time or other but those who be acquaint with the gray rat must have know that it be because the human kind use glimminge castle as a grain store-house that the gray one could not rest before they have take possession of the place the stork _ Monday march twenty-eighth _ early one morning the wild goose who stand and sleep on the ice in vomb lake be awaken by long call from the air trirop trirop it sound trianut the crane send greeting to akka the wild goose and she flock to-morrow will be the day of the great crane dance on kullaberg akka raise she head and answer at once : greeting and thanks greeting and thanks with that the crane fly farther and the wild goose hear they for a long while -- where they travel and call out over every field and every wooded hill : trianut send greeting to-morrow will be the day of the great crane dance on kullaberg the wild goose be very happy over this invitation you be in luck they say to the white goosey-gander to be permit to attend the great crane dance on kullaberg be it then so remarkable to see crane dance ask the goosey-gander it be something that you have never even dream about reply the wild goose now we must think out what we shall do with thumbietot to-morrow -- so that no harm can come to he while we run over to kullaberg say akka thumbietot shall not be leave alone say the goosey-gander if the crane will not let he see they dance then i 'll stay with he no human being have ever be permit to attend the animal 's congress at kullaberg say akka and i should not dare to take thumbietot along but we 'll discuss this more at length later in the day now we must first and foremost think about get something to eat with that akka give the signal to adjourn on this day she also seek she feeding-place a good distance away on smirre fox 's account and she do not alight until she come to the swampy meadow a little south of glimminge castle all that day the boy sit on the shore of a little pond and blow on reed-pipe he be out of sort because he should not see the crane dance and he just could not say a word either to the goosey-gander or to any of the other it be pretty hard that akka should still doubt he when a boy have give up be human just to travel around with a few wild goose they surely ought to understand that he have no desire to betray they then too they ought to understand that when he have renounce so much to follow they it be they duty to let he see all the wonder they could show he i 'll have to speak my mind right out to they think he but hour after hour pass still he have not come round to it it may sound remarkable -- but the boy have actually acquire a kind of respect for the old leader-goose he feel that it be not easy to pit he will against hers on one side of the swampy meadow where the wild goose feed there be a broad stone hedge toward evening when the boy finally raise he head to speak to akka he glance happen to rest on this hedge he utter a little cry of surprise and all the wild goose instantly look up and stare in the same direction at first both the goose and the boy think that all the round gray stone in the hedge have acquire leg and be start on a run but soon they see that it be a company of rat who run over it they move very rapidly and run forward tightly pack line upon line and be so numerous that for some time they cover the entire stone hedge the boy have be afraid of rat even when he be a big strong human be then what must he feeling be now when he be so tiny that two or three of they could overpower he one shudder after another travel down he spinal column as he stand and stare at they but strangely enough the wild goose seem to feel the same aversion toward the rat that he do they do not speak to they and when they be go they shake themselves as if they feather have be mud-spattered such a lot of gray rat abroad say iksus from vassipaure that be not a good omen the boy intend to take advantage of this opportunity to say to akka that he think she ought to let he go with they to kullaberg but he be prevent anew for all of a sudden a big bird come down in the midst of the goose one could believe when one look at this bird that he have borrow body neck and head from a little white goose but in addition to this he have procure for himself large black wing long red leg and a thick bill which be too large for the little head and weigh it down until it give he a sad and worried look akka at once straighten out the fold of she wing and curtsy many time as she approach the stork she be not specially surprise to see he in skåne so early in the spring because she know that the male stork be in the habit of come in good season to take a look at the nest and see that it have not be damage during the winter before the female stork go to the trouble of fly over the east sea but she wonder very much what it might signify that he seek she out since stork prefer to associate with member of they own family i can hardly believe that there be anything wrong with you house herr ermenrich say akka it be apparent now that it be true what they say : a stork can seldom open he bill without complain but what make the thing he say sound even more doleful be that it be difficult for he to speak out he stand for a long time and only clatter with he bill afterward he speak in a hoarse and feeble voice he complain about everything : the nest -- which be situate at the very top of the roof-tree at glimminge castle -- have be totally destroy by winter storm and no food could he get any more in skåne the people of skåne be appropriate all he possession they dig out he marsh and lay waste he swamp he intend to move away from this country and never return to it again while the stork grumble akka the wild goose who have neither home nor protection could not help think to herself : if i have thing as comfortable as you have herr ermenrich i should be above complain you have remain a free and wild bird and still you stand so well with human being that no one will fire a shot at you or steal a egg from you nest but all this she keep to herself to the stork she only remark that she could not believe he would be willing to move from a house where stork have reside ever since it be build then the stork suddenly ask the goose if they have see the gray rat who be march toward glimminge castle when akka reply that she have see the horrid creature he begin to tell she about the brave black rat who for year have defend the castle but this night glimminge castle will fall into the gray rat ' power sigh the stork and why just this night herr ermenrich ask akka well because nearly all the black rat go over to kullaberg last night say the stork since they have count on all the rest of the animal also hurry there but you see that the gray rat have stay at home and now they be muster to storm the castle to-night when it will be defend by only a few old creature who be too feeble to go over to kullaberg they 'll probably accomplish they purpose but i have live here in harmony with the black rat for so many year that it do not please I to live in a place inhabit by they enemy akka understand now that the stork have become so enraged over the gray rat ' mode of action that he have seek she out as a excuse to complain about they but after the manner of stork he certainly have do nothing to avert the disaster have you send word to the black rat herr ermenrich she ask no reply the stork that would not be of any use before they can get back the castle will be take you must not be so sure of that herr ermenrich say akka i know a old wild goose i do who will gladly prevent outrage of this kind when akka say this the stork raise he head and stare at she and it be not surprising for akka have neither claw nor bill that be fit for fight and in the bargain she be a day bird and as soon as it grow dark she fall helplessly asleep while the rat do they fighting at night but akka have evidently make up she mind to help the black rat she call iksus from vassijaure and order he to take the wild goose over to vonib lake and when the goose make excuse she say authoritatively : i believe it will be best for we all that you obey I i must fly over to the big stone house and if you follow I the people on the place will be sure to see we and shoot we down the only one that i want to take with I on this trip be thumbietot he can be of great service to I because he have good eye and can keep awake at night the boy be in he most contrary mood that day and when he hear what akka say he raise himself to he full height and step forward he hand behind he and he nose in the air and he intend to say that he most assuredly do not wish to take a hand in the fight with gray rat she might look around for assistance elsewhere but the instant the boy be see the stork begin to move he have stand before as stork generally stand with head bent downward and the bill press against the neck but now a gurgle be hear deep down in he windpipe as though he would have laugh quick as a flash he lower the bill grab the boy and toss he a couple of metre in the air this feat he perform seven time while the boy shriek and the goose shout : what be you try to do herr ermenrich that be not a frog that be a human be herr ermenrich finally the stork put the boy down entirely unhurt thereupon he say to akka i 'll fly back to glimminge castle now mother akka all who live there be very much worry when i leave you may be sure they 'll be very glad when i tell they that akka the wild goose and thumbietot the human elf be on they way to rescue they with that the stork crane he neck raise he wing and dart off like a arrow when it leave a well-drawn bow akka understand that he be make fun of she but she do not let it bother she she wait until the boy have find he wooden shoe which the stork have shake off then she put he on she back and follow the stork on he own account the boy make no objection and say not a word about not want to go along he have become so furious with the stork that he actually sit and puff that long red-legged thing believe he be of no account just because he be little but he would show he what kind of a man nil holgersson from west vemminghög be a couple of moment later akka stand in the stork ' nest it have a wheel for foundation and over this lay several grass-mat and some twig the nest be so old that many shrub and plant have take root up there and when the mother stork sit on she egg in the round hole in the middle of the nest she not only have the beautiful outlook over a goodly portion of skåne to enjoy but she have also the wild brier-blossom and house-leek to look upon both akka and the boy see immediately that something be go on here which turn upside down the most regular order on the edge of the stork-nest sit two gray owl a old gray-streaked cat and a dozen old decrepit rat with protrude tooth and watery eye they be not exactly the sort of animal one usually find live peaceably together not one of they turn around to look at akka or to bid she welcome they think of nothing except to sit and stare at some long gray line which come into sight here and there -- on the winter-naked meadow all the black rat be silent one could see that they be in deep despair and probably know that they could neither defend they own life nor the castle the two owl sit and roll they big eye and twist they great encircle eyebrow and talk in hollow ghost-like voice about the awful cruelty of the gray rat and that they would have to move away from they nest because they have hear it say of they that they spare neither egg nor baby bird the old gray-streaked cat be positive that the gray rat would bite he to death since they be come into the castle in such great number and he scold the black rat incessantly how could you be so idiotic as to let you best fighter go away say he how could you trust the gray rat it be absolutely unpardonable the twelve black rat do not say a word but the stork despite he misery could not refrain from tease the cat do not worry so monsie house-cat say he can not you see that mother akka and thumbietot have come to save the castle you can be certain that they 'll succeed now i must stand up to sleep -- and i do so with the utmost calm to-morrow when i awaken there will not be a single gray rat in glimminge castle the boy wink at akka and make a sign -- as the stork stand upon the very edge of the nest with one leg draw up to sleep -- that he want to push he down to the ground but akka restrain he she do not seem to be the least bit angry instead she say in a confident tone of voice : it would be pretty poor business if one who be as old as i be could not manage to get out of worse difficulty than this if only mr and mr owl who can stay awake all night will fly off with a couple of message for I i think that all will go well both owl be willing then akka bade the gentleman owl that he should go and seek the black rat who have go off and counsel they to hurry home immediately the lady owl she send to flammea the steeple-owl who live in lund cathedral with a commission which be so secret that akka only dare to confide it to she in a whisper the rat charmer it be get on toward midnight when the gray rat after a diligent search succeed in find a open air-hole in the cellar this be pretty high upon the wall but the rat get up on one another 's shoulder and it be not long before the most daring among they sit in the air-hole ready to force its way into glimminge castle outside whose wall so many of its forebear have fall the gray rat sit still for a moment in the hole and wait for a attack from within the leader of the defender be certainly away but she assume that the black rat who be still in the castle would not surrender without a struggle with thump heart she listen for the slightest sound but everything remain quiet then the leader of the gray rat pluck up courage and jump down in the coal-black cellar one after another of the gray rat follow the leader they all keep very quiet and all expect to be ambush by the black rat not until so many of they have crowd into the cellar that the floor could not hold any more do they venture farther although they have never before be inside the building they have no difficulty in find they way they soon find the passage in the wall which the black rat have use to get to the upper floor before they begin to clamber up these narrow and steep step they listen again with great attention they feel more frightened because the black rat hold themselves aloof in this way than if they have meet they in open battle they could hardly believe they luck when they reach the first story without any mishap immediately upon they entrance the gray rat catch the scent of the grain which be store in great bin on the floor but it be not as yet time for they to begin to enjoy they conquest they search first with the utmost caution through the sombre empty room they run up in the fireplace which stand on the floor in the old castle kitchen and they almost tumble into the well in the inner room not one of the narrow peep-hole do they leave uninspected but they find no black rat when this floor be wholly in they possession they begin with the same caution to acquire the next then they have to venture on a bold and dangerous climb through the wall while with breathless anxiety they await a assault from the enemy and although they be tempt by the most delicious odour from the grain bin they force themselves most systematically to inspect the old-time warrior ' pillar-propped kitchen they stone table and fireplace the deep window-niche and the hole in the floor -- which in olden time have be open to pour down boiling pitch on the intrude enemy all this time the black rat be invisible the gray one grope they way to the third story and into the lord of the castle 's great banquet hall -- which stand there cold and empty like all the other room in the old house they even grope they way to the upper story which have but one big barren room the only place they do not think of explore be the big stork-nest on the roof -- where just at this time the lady owl awaken akka and inform she that flammea the steeple owl have grant she request and have send she the thing she wish for since the gray rat have so conscientiously inspect the entire castle they feel at ease they take it for grant that the black rat have fly and do not intend to offer any resistance and with light heart they run up into the grain bin but the gray rat have hardly swallow the first wheat-grain before the sound of a little shrill pipe be hear from the yard the gray rat raise they head listen anxiously run a few step as if they intend to leave the bin then they turn back and begin to eat once more again the pipe sound a sharp and piercing note -- and now something wonderful happen one rat two rat -- yes a whole lot of rat leave the grain jump from the bin and hurry down cellar by the shortest cut to get out of the house still there be many gray rat leave these thought of all the toil and trouble it have cost they to win glimminge castle and they do not want to leave it but again they catch the tone from the pipe and have to follow they with wild excitement they rush up from the bin slide down through the narrow hole in the wall and tumble over each other in they eagerness to get out in the middle of the courtyard stand a tiny creature who blow upon a pipe all round he he have a whole circle of rat who listen to he astonished and fascinate and every moment bring more once he take the pipe from he lip -- only for a second -- put he thumb to he nose and wiggle he finger at the gray rat and then it look as if they want to throw themselves on he and bite he to death but as soon as he blow on he pipe they be in he power when the tiny creature have play all the gray rat out of glimminge castle he begin to wander slowly from the courtyard out on the highway and all the gray rat follow he because the tone from that pipe sound so sweet to they ear that they could not resist they the tiny creature walk before they and charm they along with he on the road to vallby he lead they into all sort of crook and turn and bend -- on through hedge and down into ditch -- and wherever he go they have to follow he blow continuously on he pipe which appear to be make from a animal 's horn although the horn be so small that in we day there be no animal from whose forehead it could have be break no one know either who have make it flammea the steeple-owl have find it in a niche in lund cathedral she have show it to bataki the raven and they have both figure out that this be the kind of horn that be use in former time by those who wish to gain power over rat and mouse but the raven be akka 's friend and it be from he she have learn that flammea own a treasure like this and it be true that the rat could not resist the pipe the boy walk before they and play as long as the starlight last -- and all the while they follow he he play at daybreak he play at sunrise and the whole time the entire procession of gray rat follow he and be entice farther and farther away from the big grain loft at glimminge castle the great crane dance on kullaberg _ Tuesday march twenty-ninth _ although there be many magnificent building in skåne it must be acknowledge that there be not one among they that have such pretty wall as old kullaberg kullaberg be low and rather long it be not by any mean a big or impose mountain on its broad summit you 'll find wood and grain field and one and another heather-heath here and there round heather-knoll and barren cliff rise up it be not especially pretty up there it look a good deal like all the other upland place in skåne he who walk along the path which run across the middle of the mountain can not help feel a little disappointed then he happen perhaps to turn away from the path and wander off toward the mountain 's side and look down over the bluff and then all at once he will discover so much that be worth see he hardly know how he 'll find time to take in the whole of it for it happen that kullaberg do not stand on the land with plain and valley around it like other mountain but it have plunge into the sea as far out as it could get not even the tiniest strip of land lie below the mountain to protect it against the breaker but these reach all the way up to the mountain wall and can polish and mould they to suit themselves this be why the wall stand there as richly ornamented as the sea and its helpmeet the wind have be able to effect you 'll find steep ravine that be deeply chisel in the mountain 's side and black crag that have become smooth and shiny under the constant lash of the wind there be solitary rock-column that spring right up out of the water and dark grotto with narrow entrance there be barren perpendicular precipice and soft leaf-clad incline there be small point and small inlet and small rolling stone that be rattlingly wash up and down with every dash breaker there be majestic cliff-arch that project over the water there be sharp stone that be constantly spray by a white foam and other that mirror themselves in unchangeable dark-green still water there be giant troll-cavern shape in the rock and great crevice that lure the wanderer to venture into the mountain 's depths -- all the way to kullman 's hollow and over and around all these cliff and rock crawl entangled tendril and weed tree grow there also but the wind 's power be so great that tree have to transform themselves into cling vine that they may get a firm hold on the steep precipice the oak creep along on the ground while they foliage hang over they like a low ceiling and long-limbed beech stand in the ravine like great leaf-tent these remarkable mountain wall with the blue sea beneath they and the clear penetrate air above they be what make kullaberg so dear to the people that great crowd of they haunt the place every day as long as the summer last but it be more difficult to tell what it be that make it so attractive to animal that every year they gather there for a big play-meeting this be a custom that have be observe since time immemorial and one should have be there when the first sea-wave be dash into foam against the shore to be able to explain just why kullaberg be choose as a rendezvous in preference to all other place when the meeting be to take place the stag and roebuck and hare and fox and all the other four-footer make the journey to kullaberg the night before so as not to be observe by the human being just before sunrise they all march up to the playground which be a heather-heath on the left side of the road and not very far from the mountain 's most extreme point the playground be inclose on all side by round knoll which conceal it from any and all who do not happen to come right upon it and in the month of march it be not at all likely that any pedestrian will stray off up there all the stranger who usually stroll around on the rock and clamber up the mountain 's side the fall storm have drive away these many month past and the lighthouse keeper out there on the point the old fru on the mountain farm and the mountain peasant and he house-folk go they accustomed way and do not run about on the desolate heather-field when the four-footer have arrive on the playground they take they place on the round knoll each animal family keep to itself although it be understand that on a day like this universal peace reign and no one need fear attack on this day a little hare might wander over to the fox ' hill without lose as much as one of he long ear but still the animal arrange themselves into separate group this be a old custom after they have all take they place they begin to look around for the bird it be always beautiful weather on this day the crane be good weather prophet and would not call the animal together if they expect rain although the air be clear and nothing obstruct the vision the four-footer see no bird this be strange the sun stand high in the heaven and the bird should already be on they way but what the animal on the other hand observe be one and another little dark cloud that come slowly forward over the plain and look one of these cloud come gradually along the coast of öresund and up toward kullaberg when the cloud have come just over the playground it stop and simultaneously the entire cloud begin to ring and chirp as if it be make of nothing but tone it rise and sink rise and sink but all the while it ring and chirp at last the whole cloud fall down over a knoll -- all at once -- and the next instant the knoll be entirely cover with gray lark pretty red-white-gray bulfinch speckled starling and greenish-yellow titmouse soon after that another cloud come over the plain this stop over every bit of land over peasant cottage and palace over town and city over farm and railway station over fishing hamlet and sugar refinery every time it stop it draw to itself a little whirling column of gray dust-grain from the ground in this way it grow and grow and at last when it be all gather up and head for kullaberg it be no longer a cloud but a whole mist which be so big that it throw a shadow on the ground all the way from höganäs to mölle when it stop over the playground it hide the sun and for a long while it have to rain gray sparrow on one of the knoll before those who have be fly in the innermost part of the mist could again catch a glimpse of the daylight but still the biggest of these bird-cloud be the one which now appear this have be form of bird who have travel from every direction to join it it be dark bluish-gray and no sun-ray can penetrate it it be full of the ghastliest noise the most frightful shriek the grimmest laughter and most ill-luck-boding croak all on the playground be glad when it finally resolve itself into a storm of flutter and croak : of crow and jackdaw and rook and raven thereupon not only cloud be see in the heaven but a variety of stripe and figure then straight dot line appear in the east and northeast these be forest-bird from göinge district : black grouse and wood grouse who come fly in long line a couple of metre apart swimming-bird that live around måkläppen just out of falsterbo now come float over öresund in many extraordinary figure : in triangular and long curve in sharp hook and semicircle to the great reunion hold the year that nil holgersson travel around with the wild goose come akka and she flock -- later than all the other and that be not to be wonder at for akka have to fly over the whole of skåne to get to kullaberg beside as soon as she awake she have be oblige to go out and hunt for thumbietot who for many hour have go and play to the gray rat and lure they far away from glimminge castle mr owl have return with the news that the black rat would be at home immediately after sunrise and there be no longer any danger in let the steeple-owl 's pipe be hush and to give the gray rat the liberty to go where they pleased but it be not akka who discover the boy where he walk with he long following and quickly sink down over he and catch he with the bill and swing into the air with he but it be herr ermenrich the stork for herr ermenrich have also go out to look for he and after he have bear he up to the stork-nest he beg he forgiveness for have treat he with disrespect the evening before this pleased the boy immensely and the stork and he become good friend akka too show he that she feel very kindly toward he she stroke she old head several time against he arm and commend he because he have help those who be in trouble but this one must say to the boy 's credit : that he do not want to accept praise which he have not earn no mother akka he say you must not think that i lure the gray rat away to help the black one i only want to show herr ermenrich that i be of some consequence he have hardly say this before akka turn to the stork and ask if he think it be advisable to take thumbietot along to kullaberg i mean that we can rely on he as upon ourselves say she the stork at once advise most enthusiastically that thumbietot be permit to come along certainly you shall take thumbietot along to kullaberg mother akka say he it be fortunate for we that we can repay he for all that he have endure this night for we sake and since it still grieve I to think that i do not conduct myself in a become manner toward he the other evening it be i who will carry he on my back -- all the way to the meeting place there be not much that taste better than to receive praise from those who be themselves wise and capable and the boy have certainly never feel so happy as he do when the wild goose and the stork talk about he in this way thus the boy make the trip to kullaberg ride stork-back although he know that this be a great honor it cause he much anxiety for herr ermenrich be a master flyer and start off at a very different pace from the wild goose while akka fly she straight way with even wing-stroke the stork amuse himself by perform a lot of fly trick now he lay still in a immeasurable height and float in the air without move he wing now he fling himself downward with such sudden haste that it seem as though he would fall to the ground helpless as a stone now he have lot of fun fly all around akka in great and small circle like a whirlwind the boy have never be on a ride of this sort before and although he sit there all the while in terror he have to acknowledge to himself that he have never before know what a good flight mean only a single pause be make during the journey and that be at vomb lake when akka join she travel companion and call to they that the gray rat have be vanquish after that the traveller fly straight to kullaberg there they descend to the knoll reserve for the wild goose and as the boy let he glance wander from knoll to knoll he see on one of they the many-pointed antler of the stag and on another the gray heron ' neck-crest one knoll be red with fox one be gray with rat one be cover with black raven who shriek continually one with lark who simply could not keep still but keep on throw themselves in the air and singing for very joy just as it have ever be the custom on kullaberg it be the crow who begin the day 's game and frolic with they flying-dance they divide themselves into two flock that fly toward each other meet turn and begin all over again this dance have many repetition and appear to the spectator who be not familiar with the dance as altogether too monotonous the crow be very proud of they dance but all the other be glad when it be over it appear to the animal about as gloomy and meaningless as the winter-storm ' play with the snow-flake it depress they to watch it and they wait eagerly for something that should give they a little pleasure they do not have to wait in vain either for as soon as the crow have finish the hare come run they dash forward in a long row without any apparent order in some of the figure one single hare come in other they run three and four abreast they have all raise themselves on two leg and they rush forward with such rapidity that they long ear sway in all direction as they run they spin round make high leap and beat they forepaw against they hind-paw so that they rattle some perform a long succession of somersault other double themselves up and roll over like wheel one stand on one leg and swing round one walk upon he forepaw there be no regulation whatever but there be much that be droll in the hare ' play and the many animal who stand and watch they begin to breathe faster now it be spring joy and rapture be advance winter be over summer be come soon it be only play to live when the hare have romp themselves out it be the great forest bird ' turn to perform hundred of wood-grouse in shine dark-brown array and with bright red eyebrow fling themselves up into a great oak that stand in the center of the playground the one who sit upon the topmost branch fluff up he feather lower he wing and lift he tail so that the white covert-feather be see thereupon he stretch he neck and send forth a couple of deep note from he thick throat tjack tjack tjack it sound more than this he could not utter it only gurgle a few time way down in the throat then he close he eye and whisper : si si si hear how pretty si si si at the same time he fall into such a ecstasy that he no longer know what be go on around he while the first wood grouse be siss the three nearest -- under he -- begin to sing and before they have finish they song the ten who sit lower down join in and thus it continue from branch to branch until the entire hundred grouse sing and gurgle and siss they all fall into the same ecstasy during they song and this affect the other animal like a contagious transport lately the blood have flow lightly and agreeably now it begin to grow heavy and hot yes this be surely spring think all the animal folk winter chill have vanish the fire of spring burn over the earth when the black grouse see that the brown grouse be have such success they could no longer keep quiet as there be no tree for they to light on they rush down on the playground where the heather stand so high that only they beautifully turn tail-feather and they thick bill be visible -- and they begin to sing : orr orr orr just as the black grouse begin to compete with the brown grouse something unprecedented happen while all the animal think of nothing but the grouse-game a fox steal slowly over to the wild goose 's knoll he glide very cautiously and come way up on the knoll before anyone notice he suddenly a goose catch sight of he and as she could not believe that a fox have sneak in among the goose for any good purpose she begin to cry : have a care wild goose have a care the fox strike she across the throat -- mostly perhaps because he want to make she keep quiet -- but the wild goose have already hear the cry and they all raise themselves in the air and when they have fly up the animal see smirre fox standing on the wild goose 's knoll with a dead goose in he mouth but because he have in this way break the play-day 's peace such a punishment be mete out to smirre fox that for the rest of he day he must regret he have not be able to control he thirst for revenge but have attempt to approach akka and she flock in this manner he be immediately surround by a crowd of fox and doom in accordance with a old custom which demand that whosoever disturb the peace on the great play-day must go into exile not a fox wish to lighten the sentence since they all know that the instant they attempt anything of the sort they would be drive from the playground and would nevermore be permit to enter it banishment be pronounce upon smirre without opposition he be forbid to remain in skåne he be banish from wife and kindred from hunting grounds home rest place and retreat which he have hitherto own and he must tempt fortune in foreign land so that all fox in skåne should know that smirre be outlaw in the district the oldest of the fox bite off he right earlap as soon as this be do all the young fox begin to yowl from blood-thirst and throw themselves on smirre for he there be no alternative except to take flight and with all the young fox in hot pursuit he rush away from kullaberg all this happen while black grouse and brown grouse be go on with they game but these bird lose themselves so completely in they song that they neither hear nor see nor have they permit themselves to be disturb the forest bird ' contest be barely over before the stag from häckeberga come forward to show they wrestling game there be several pair of stag who fight at the same time they rush at each other with tremendous force strike they antler dashingly together so that they point be entangled and try to force each other backward the heather-heath be tear up beneath they hoof the breath come like smoke from they nostril out of they throat strain hideous bellowing and the froth ooze down on they shoulder on the knoll round about there be breathless silence while the skilled stag-wrestler clinch in all the animal new emotion be awaken each and all feel courageous and strong enliven by return power bear again with the spring sprightly and ready for all kind of adventure they feel no enmity toward each other although everywhere wing be lift neck-feather raise and claw sharpen if the stag from häckeberga have continue another instant a wild struggle would have arise on the knoll for all have be grip with a burning desire to show that they too be full of life because the winter 's impotence be over and strength surge through they body but the stag stop wrestle just at the right moment and instantly a whisper go from knoll to knoll : the crane be come and then come the gray dusk-clad bird with plume in they wing and red feather-ornament on they neck the big bird with they tall leg they slender throat they small head come glide down the knoll with a abandon that be full of mystery as they glide forward they swing round -- half fly half dancing with wing gracefully lift they move with a inconceivable rapidity there be something marvellous and strange about they dance it be as though gray shadow have play a game which the eye could scarcely follow it be as if they have learn it from the mist that hover over desolate morass there be witchcraft in it all those who have never before be on kullaberg understand why the whole meeting take its name from the crane 's dance there be wildness in it but yet the feeling which it awaken be a delicious longing no one think any more about struggle instead both the winged and those who have no wing all want to raise themselves eternally lift themselves above the cloud seek that which be hide beyond they leave the oppressive body that drag they down to earth and soar away toward the infinite such longing after the unattainable after the hidden mystery back of this life the animal feel only once a year and this be on the day when they behold the great crane dance in rainy weather _ Wednesday march thirtieth _ it be the first rainy day of the trip as long as the wild goose have remain in the vicinity of vomb lake they have have beautiful weather but on the day when they set out to travel farther north it begin to rain and for several hour the boy have to sit on the goose-back soak wet and shiver with the cold in the morning when they start it have be clear and mild the wild goose have fly high up in the air -- evenly and without haste -- with akka at the head maintain strict discipline and the rest in two oblique line back of she they have not take the time to shout any witty sarcasm to the animal on the ground but as it be simply impossible for they to keep perfectly silent they sing out continually -- in rhythm with the wing-stroke -- they usual coax call : where be you here be i where be you here be i they all take part in this persistent calling and only stop now and then to show the goosey-gander the landmark they be travel over the place on this route include linderödsosen 's dry hill ovesholm 's manor christianstad 's church steeple bäckaskog 's royal castle on the narrow isthmus between oppmann 's lake and ivö 's lake ryss mountain 's steep precipice it have be a monotonous trip and when the rain-cloud make they appearance the boy think it be a real diversion in the old day when he have only see a rain-cloud from below he have imagine that they be gray and disagreeable but it be a very different thing to be up amongst they now he see distinctly that the cloud be enormous cart which drive through the heaven with sky-high load some of they be pile up with huge gray sack some with barrel some be so large that they could hold a whole lake and a few be fill with big utensil and bottle which be pile up to a immense height and when so many of they have drive forward that they fill the whole sky it appear as though someone have give a signal for all at once water commence to pour down over the earth from utensil barrel bottle and sack just as the first spring-shower patter against the ground there arise such shout of joy from all the small bird in grove and pasture that the whole air ring with they and the boy leap high where he sit now we 'll have rain rain give we spring spring give we flower and green leaf green leaf and flower give we worm and insect worm and insect give we food and plentiful and good food be the best thing there be sing the bird the wild goose too be glad of the rain which come to awaken the grow thing from they long sleep and to drive hole in the ice-roof on the lake they be not able to keep up that seriousness any longer but begin to send merry call over the neighborhood when they fly over the big potato patch which be so plentiful in the country around christianstad -- and which still lay bare and black -- they scream : wake up and be useful here come something that will awaken you you have idle long enough now when they see people who hurry to get out of the rain they reprove they say : what be you in such a hurry about can not you see that it be rain rye-loaf and cookie it be a big thick mist that move northward briskly and follow close upon the goose they seem to think that they drag the mist along with they and just now when they see great orchard beneath they they call out proudly : here we come with anemone here we come with rose here we come with apple blossom and cherry bud here we come with pea and bean and turnip and cabbage he who will can take they he who will can take they thus it have sound while the first shower fall and when all be still glad of the rain but when it continue to fall the whole afternoon the wild goose grow impatient and cry to the thirsty forest around ivös lake : have not you get enough yet have not you get enough yet the heaven be grow grayer and grayer and the sun hide itself so well that one could not imagine where it be the rain fall faster and faster and beat harder and harder against the wing as it try to find its way between the oily outside feather into they skin the earth be hide by fog lake mountain and wood float together in a indistinct maze and the landmark could not be distinguish the flight become slower and slower the joyful cry be hush and the boy feel the cold more and more keenly but still he have keep up he courage as long as he have ride through the air and in the afternoon when they have light under a little stunt pine in the middle of a large morass where all be wet and all be cold where some knoll be cover with snow and other stand up naked in a puddle of half-melted ice-water even then he have not feel discourage but run about in fine spirit and hunt for cranberry and frozen whortleberry but then come evening and darkness sink down on they so close that not even such eye as the boy 's could see through it and all the wilderness become so strangely grim and awful the boy lay tuck in under the goosey-gander 's wing but could not sleep because he be cold and wet he hear such a lot of rustling and rattle and stealthy step and menacing voice that he be terror-stricken and do not know where he should go he must go somewhere where there be light and heat if he be not go to be entirely scare to death if i should venture where there be human being just for this night think the boy only so i could sit by a fire for a moment and get a little food i could go back to the wild goose before sunrise he creep from under the wing and slide down to the ground he do not awaken either the goosey-gander or any of the other goose but steal silently and unobserved through the morass he do not know exactly where on earth he be : if he be in skåne in småland or in blekinge but just before he have get down in the morass he have catch a glimpse of a large village and thither he direct he step it be not long either before he discover a road and soon he be on the village street which be long and have plant tree on both side and be border with garden after garden the boy have come to one of the big cathedral town which be so common on the upland but can hardly be see at all down in the plain the house be of wood and very prettily construct most of they have gable and front edge with carve moulding and glass door with here and there a color pane opening on veranda the wall be paint in light oil-colour the door and window-frame shine in blues and green and even in red while the boy walk about and view the house he could hear all the way out to the road how the people who sit in the warm cottage chatter and laugh the word he could not distinguish but he think it be just lovely to hear human voice i wonder what they would say if i knock and beg to be let in thought he this be of course what he have intend to do all along but now that he see the light window he fear of the darkness be go instead he feel again that shyness which always come over he now when he be near human being i 'll take a look around the town for a while longer think he before i ask anyone to take I in on one house there be a balcony and just as the boy walk by the door be throw open and a yellow light stream through the fine sheer curtain then a pretty young fru come out on the balcony and lean over the railing it be rain now we shall soon have spring say she when the boy see she he feel a strange anxiety it be as though he want to weep for the first time he be a bit uneasy because he have shut himself out from the human kind shortly after that he walk by a shop outside the shop stand a red corn-drill he stop and look at it and finally crawl up to the driver 's place and seat himself when he have get there he smack with he lip and pretend that he sit and drive he think what fun it would be to be permit to drive such a pretty machine over a grainfield for a moment he forget what he be like now then he remember it and jump down quickly from the machine then a greater unrest come over he after all human being be very wonderful and clever he walk by the post-office and then he think of all the newspaper which come every day with news from all the four corner of the earth he see the apothecary 's shop and the doctor 's home and he think about the power of human being which be so great that they be able to battle with sickness and death he come to the church then he think how human being have build it that they might hear about another world than the one in which they live of god and the resurrection and eternal life and the longer he walk there the better he like human being it be so with child that they never think any farther ahead than the length of they nose that which lie nearest they they want promptly without care what it may cost they nil holgersson have not understand what he be lose when he choose to remain a elf but now he begin to be dreadfully afraid that perhaps he should never again get back to he right form how in all the world should he go to work in order to become human this he want oh so much to know he crawl up on a doorstep and seat himself in the pour rain and meditate he sit there one whole hour -- two whole hour and he think so hard that he forehead lay in furrow but he be none the wiser it seem as though the thought only roll round and round in he head the longer he sit there the more impossible it seem to he to find any solution this thing be certainly much too difficult for one who have learn as little as i have he think at last it will probably wind up by my have to go back among human being after all i must ask the minister and the doctor and the schoolmaster and other who be learn and may know a cure for such thing this he conclude that he would do at once and shake himself -- for he be as wet as a dog that have be in a water-pool just about then he see that a big owl come fly along and alight on one of the tree that border the village street the next instant a lady owl who sit under the cornice of the house begin to call out : kivitt kivitt be you at home again mr gray owl what kind of a time do you have abroad thank you lady brown owl i have a very comfortable time say the gray owl have anything out of the ordinary happen here at home during my absence not here in blekinge mr gray owl but in skåne a marvellous thing have happen a boy have be transform by a elf into a goblin no bigger than a squirrel and since then he have go to lapland with a tame goose that be a remarkable bit of news a remarkable bit of news can he never be human again lady brown owl can he never be human again that be a secret mr gray owl but you shall hear it just the same the elf have say that if the boy watch over the goosey-gander so that he come home safe and sound and -- what more lady brown owl what more what more fly with I up to the church tower mr gray owl and you shall hear the whole story i fear there may be someone listen down here in the street with that the owl fly they way but the boy fling he cap in the air and shout : if i only watch over the goosey-gander so that he get back safe and sound then i shall become a human be again hurrah hurrah then i shall become a human be again he shout hurrah until it be strange that they do not hear he in the house -- but they do not and he hurry back to the wild goose out in the wet morass as fast as he leg could carry he the stairway with the three step _ Thursday march thirty-first _ the follow day the wild goose intend to travel northward through allbo district in småland they send iksus and kaksus to spy out the land but when they return they say that all the water be freeze and all the land be snow-covered we may as well remain where we be say the wild goose we can not travel over a country where there be neither water nor food if we remain where we be we may have to wait here until the next moon say akka it be better to go eastward through blekinge and see if we can not get to småland by way of möre which lie near the coast and have a early spring thus the boy come to ride over blekinge the next day now that it be light again he be in a merry mood once more and could not comprehend what have come over he the night before he certainly do not want to give up the journey and the outdoor life now there lay a thick fog over blekinge the boy could not see how it look out there i wonder if it be a good or a poor country that i be ride over think he and try to search he memory for the thing which he have hear about the country at school but at the same time he know well enough that this be useless as he have never be in the habit of study he lesson at once the boy see the whole school before he the child sit by the little desk and raise they hand the teacher sit in the lectern and look displeased and he himself stand before the map and should answer some question about blekinge but he have not a word to say the schoolmaster 's face grow darker and darker for every second that pass and the boy think the teacher be more particular that they should know they geography than anything else now he come down from the lectern take the pointer from the boy and send he back to he seat this will not end well the boy think then but the schoolmaster have go over to a window and have stand there for a moment and look out and then he have whistle to himself once then he have go up into the lectern and say that he would tell they something about blekinge and that which he then talk about have be so amusing that the boy have listen when he only stop and think for a moment he remember every word småland be a tall house with spruce tree on the roof say the teacher and lead up to it be a broad stairway with three big step and this stairway be call blekinge it be a stairway that be well construct it stretch forty-two mile along the frontage of småland house and anyone who wish to go all the way down to the east sea by way of the stair have twenty-four mile to wander a good long time must have elapse since the stairway be build both day and year have go by since the step be hew from gray stone and lay down -- evenly and smoothly -- for a convenient track between småland and the east sea since the stairway be so old one can of course understand that it do not look just the same now as it do when it be new i do not know how much they trouble themselves about such matter at that time but big as it be no broom could have keep it clean after a couple of year moss and lichen begin to grow on it in the autumn dry leaf and dry grass blow down over it and in the spring it be pile up with fall stone and gravel and as all these thing be leave there to mould they finally gather so much soil on the step that not only herb and grass but even bush and tree could take root there but at the same time a great disparity have arise between the three step the topmost step which lie nearest småland be mostly cover with poor soil and small stone and no tree except birch and bird-cherry and spruce -- which can stand the cold on the height and be satisfy with little -- can thrive up there one understand best how poor and dry it be there when one see how small the field-plot be that be plough up from the forest land and how many little cabin the people build for themselves and how far it be between the church but on the middle step there be better soil and it do not lie bind down under such severe cold either this one can see at a glance since the tree be both higher and of finer quality there you 'll find maple and oak and linden and weeping-birch and hazel tree grow but no cone-tree to speak of and it be still more noticeable because of the amount of cultivate land that you will find there and also because the people have build themselves great and beautiful house on the middle step there be many church with large town around they and in every way it make a better and finer appearance than the top step but the very lowest step be the best of all it be cover with good rich soil and where it lie and bathe in the sea it have not the slightest feeling of the småland chill beech and chestnut and walnut tree thrive down here and they grow so big that they tower above the church-roof here lie also the largest grain-field but the people have not only timber and farming to live upon but they be also occupy with fishing and trading and seafare for this reason you will find the most costly residence and the prettiest church here and the parish have develop into village and city but this be not all that be say of the three step for one must realize that when it rain on the roof of the big småland house or when the snow melt up there the water have to go somewhere and then naturally a lot of it be spill over the big stairway in the begin it probably ooze over the whole stairway big as it be then crack appear in it and gradually the water have accustom itself to flow alongside of it in well dug-out groove and water be water whatever one do with it it never have any rest in one place it cut and file away and in another it add to those groove it have dig into vale and the wall of the vale it have deck with soil and bush and tree and vine have cling to they ever since -- so thick and in such profusion that they almost hide the stream of water that wind its way down there in the deep but when the stream come to the landing between the step they throw themselves headlong over they this be why the water come with such a seething rush that it gather strength with which to move mill-wheel and machinery -- these too have spring up by every waterfall but this do not tell all that be say of the land with the three step it must also be tell that up in the big house in småland there live once upon a time a giant who have grow very old and it fatigue he in he extreme age to be force to walk down that long stairway in order to catch salmon from the sea to he it seem much more suitable that the salmon should come up to he where he live therefore he go up on the roof of he great house and there he stand and throw stone down into the east sea he throw they with such force that they fly over the whole of blekinge and drop into the sea and when the stone come down the salmon get so scared that they come up from the sea and flee toward the blekinge stream run through the rapid fling themselves with high leap over the waterfall and stop how true this be one can see by the number of island and point that lie along the coast of blekinge and which be nothing in the world but the big stone that the giant throw one can also tell because the salmon always go up in the blekinge stream and work they way up through rapid and still water all the way to småland that giant be worthy of great thanks and much honor from the blekinge people for salmon in the stream and stone-cutting on the island -- that mean work which give food to many of they even to this day by ronneby river _ Friday April first _ neither the wild goose nor smirre fox have believe that they should ever run across each other after they have leave skåne but now it turn out so that the wild goose happen to take the route over blekinge and thither smirre fox have also go so far he have keep himself in the northern part of the province and since he have not as yet see any manor park or hunting grounds fill with game and dainty young deer he be more disgruntled than he could say one afternoon when smirre tramp around in the desolate forest district of mellanbygden not far from ronneby river he see a flock of wild goose fly through the air instantly he observe that one of the goose be white and then he know of course with whom he have to deal smirre begin immediately to hunt the goose -- just as much for the pleasure of get a good square meal as for the desire to be avenge for all the humiliation that they have heap upon he he see that they fly eastward until they come to ronneby river then they change they course and follow the river toward the south he understand that they intend to seek a sleeping-place along the river-bank and he think that he should be able to get hold of a pair of they without much trouble but when smirre finally discover the place where the wild goose have take refuge he observe they have choose such a well-protected spot that he could not get near ronneby river be not any big or important body of water nevertheless it be just as much talk of for the sake of its pretty shore at several point it force its way forward between steep mountain-wall that stand upright out of the water and be entirely overgrow with honeysuckle and bird-cherry mountain-ash and osier and there be not much that can be more delightful than to row out on the little dark river on a pleasant summer day and look upward on all the soft green that fasten itself to the rugged mountain-side but now when the wild goose and smirre come to the river it be cold and blustery spring-winter all the tree be nude and there be probably no one who think the least little bit about whether the shore be ugly or pretty the wild goose thank they good fortune that they have find a sand-strip large enough for they to stand upon on a steep mountain wall in front of they rush the river which be strong and violent in the snow-melting time behind they they have a impassable mountain rock wall and overhang branch screen they they could not have it better the goose be asleep instantly but the boy could not get a wink of sleep as soon as the sun have disappear he be seize with a fear of the darkness and a wilderness-terror and he long for human being where he lay -- tuck in under the goose-wing -- he could see nothing and only hear a little and he think if any harm come to the goosey-gander he could not save he noise and rustling be hear from all direction and he grow so uneasy that he have to creep from under the wing and seat himself on the ground beside the goose long-sighted smirre stand on the mountain 's summit and look down upon the wild goose you may as well give this pursuit up first as last he say to himself you can not climb such a steep mountain you can not swim in such a wild torrent and there be not the tiniest strip of land below the mountain which lead to the sleeping-place those goose be too wise for you do not ever bother yourself again to hunt they but smirre like all fox have find it hard to give up a undertaking already begin and so he lay down on the extremest point of the mountain edge and do not take he eye off the wild goose while he lay and watch they he think of all the harm they have do he yes it be they fault that he have be drive from skåne and have be oblige to move to poverty-stricken blekinge he work himself up to such a pitch as he lay there that he wish the wild goose be dead even if he himself should not have the satisfaction of eat they when smirre 's resentment have reach this height he hear rasp in a large pine that grow close to he and see a squirrel come down from the tree hotly pursue by a marten neither of they notice smirre and he sit quietly and watch the chase which go from tree to tree he look at the squirrel who move among the branch as lightly as though he would be able to fly he look at the marten who be not as skilled at climb as the squirrel but who still run up and along the branch just as securely as if they have be even path in the forest if i could only climb half as well as either of they think the fox those thing down there would not sleep in peace very long as soon as the squirrel have be capture and the chase be end smirre walk over to the marten but stop two step away from he to signify that he do not wish to cheat he of he prey he greet the marten in a very friendly manner and wish he good luck with he catch smirre choose he word well -- as fox always do the marten on the contrary who with he long and slender body he fine head he soft skin and he light brown neck-piece look like a little marvel of beauty -- but in reality be nothing but a crude forest dweller -- hardly answer he it surprise I say smirre that such a fine hunter as you be should be satisfy with chase squirrel when there be much better game within reach here he pause but when the marten only grin impudently at he he continue : can it be possible that you have not see the wild goose that stand under the mountain wall or be you not a good enough climber to get down to they this time he have no need to wait for a answer the marten rush up to he with back bent and every separate hair on end have you see wild goose he hiss where be they tell I instantly or i 'll bite you neck off no you must remember that i be twice you size -- so be a little polite i ask nothing better than to show you the wild goose the next instant the marten be on he way down the steep and while smirre sit and watch how he swing he snake-like body from branch to branch he think : that pretty tree-hunter have the wickedest heart in all the forest i believe that the wild goose will have I to thank for a bloody awakening but just as smirre be wait to hear the goose 's death-rattle he see the marten tumble from branch to branch -- and plump into the river so the water splash high soon thereafter wing beat loudly and strongly and all the goose go up in a hurry flight smirre intend to hurry after the goose but he be so curious to know how they have be save that he sit there until the marten come clamber up that poor thing be soak in mud and stop every now and then to rub he head with he forepaw now be not that just what i think -- that you be a booby and would go and tumble into the river say smirre contemptuously i have not act boobyishly you do not need to scold I say the marten i sit -- all ready -- on one of the lowest branch and think how i should manage to tear a whole lot of goose to piece when a little creature no bigger than a squirrel jump up and throw a stone at my head with such force that i fall into the water and before i have time to pick myself up -- the marten do not have to say any more he have no audience smirre be already a long way off in pursuit of the wild goose in the meantime akka have fly southward in search of a new sleeping-place there be still a little daylight and beside the half-moon stand high in the heaven so that she could see a little luckily she be well acquaint in these part because it have happen more than once that she have be wind-driven to blekinge when she travel over the east sea in the spring she follow the river as long as she see it wind through the moon-lit landscape like a black shine snake in this way she come way down to djupafor -- where the river first hide itself in a underground channel -- and then clear and transparent as though it be make of glass rush down in a narrow cleft and break into bit against its bottom in glitter drop and fly foam below the white fall lay a few stone between which the water rush away in a wild torrent cataract here mother akka alight this be another good sleeping-place -- especially this late in the evening when no human being move about at sunset the goose would hardly have be able to camp there for djupafor do not lie in any wilderness on one side of the fall be a paper factory on the other -- which be steep and tree-grown -- be djupadal 's park where people be always stroll about on the steep and slippery path to enjoy the wild stream 's rush movement down in the ravine it be about the same here as at the former place none of the traveller think the least little bit that they have come to a pretty and well-known place they think rather that it be ghastly and dangerous to stand and sleep on slippery wet stone in the middle of a rumble waterfall but they have to be content if only they be protect from carnivorous animal the goose fall asleep instantly while the boy could find no rest in sleep but sit beside they that he might watch over the goosey-gander after a while smirre come run along the river-shore he spy the goose immediately where they stand out in the foam whirlpool and understand that he could not get at they here either still he could not make up he mind to abandon they but seat himself on the shore and look at they he feel very much humble and think that he entire reputation as a hunter be at stake all of a sudden he see a otter come creep up from the fall with a fish in he mouth smirre approach he but stop within two step of he to show he that he do not wish to take he game from he you be a remarkable one who can content yourself with catch a fish while the stone be cover with goose say smirre he be so eager that he have not take the time to arrange he word as carefully as he be wont to do the otter do not turn he head once in the direction of the river he be a vagabond -- like all otter -- and have fish many time by vomb lake and probably know smirre fox i know very well how you act when you want to coax away a salmon-trout smirre say he oh be it you gripe say smirre and be delighted for he know that this particular otter be a quick and accomplished swimmer i do not wonder that you do not care to look at the wild goose since you can not manage to get out to they but the otter who have swimming-web between he toe and a stiff tail -- which be as good as a oar -- and a skin that be water-proof do not wish to have it say of he that there be a waterfall that he be not able to manage he turn toward the stream and as soon as he catch sight of the wild goose he throw the fish away and rush down the steep shore and into the river if it have be a little later in the spring so that the nightingale in djupafor have be at home they would have sing for many a day of gripe 's struggle with the rapid for the otter be thrust back by the wave many time and carry down river but he fight he way steadily up again he swim forward in still water he crawl over stone and gradually come nearer the wild goose it be a perilous trip which might well have earn the right to be sing by the nightingale smirre follow the otter 's course with he eye as well as he could at last he see that the otter be in the act of climb up to the wild goose but just then it shriek shrill and wild the otter tumble backward into the water and dash away as if he have be a blind kitten a instant later there be a great crackling of goose 's wing they raise themselves and fly away to find another sleeping-place the otter soon come on land he say nothing but commence to lick one of he forepaw when smirre sneer at he because he have not succeed he break out : it be not the fault of my swimming-art smirre i have race all the way over to the goose and be about to climb up to they when a tiny creature come run and jab I in the foot with some sharp iron it hurt so i lose my footing and then the current take I he do not have to say any more smirre be already far away on he way to the wild goose once again akka and she flock have to take a night fly fortunately the moon have not go down and with the aid of its light she succeed in find another of those sleeping-place which she know in that neighborhood again she follow the shine river toward the south over djupadal 's manor and over ronneby 's dark roof and white waterfall she sway forward without alight but a little south of the city and not far from the sea lie ronneby health-spring with its bath house and spring house with its big hotel and summer cottage for the spring 's guest all these stand empty and desolate in winter -- which the bird know perfectly well and many be the bird-company who seek shelter on the desert building ' balustrade and balcony during hard storm-time here the wild goose light on a balcony and as usual they fall asleep at once the boy on the contrary could not sleep because he have not care to creep in under the goosey-gander 's wing the balcony face south so the boy have a outlook over the sea and since he could not sleep he sit there and see how pretty it look when sea and land meet here in blekinge you see that sea and land can meet in many different way in many place the land come down toward the sea with flat tufted meadow and the sea meet the land with fly sand which pile up in mound and drift it appear as though they both dislike each other so much that they only wish to show the poorest they possess but it can also happen that when the land come toward the sea it raise a wall of hill in front of it -- as though the sea be something dangerous when the land do this the sea come up to it with fiery wrath and beat and roar and lash against the rock and look as if it would tear the land-hill to piece but in blekinge it be altogether different when sea and land meet there the land break itself up into point and island and islet and the sea divide itself into fiord and bay and sound and it be perhaps this which make it look as if they must meet in happiness and harmony think now first and foremost of the sea far out it lie desolate and empty and big and have nothing else to do but to roll its gray billow when it come toward the land it happen across the first obstacle this it immediately overpower tear away everything green and make it as gray as itself then it meet still another obstacle with this it do the same thing and still another yes the same thing happen to this also it be strip and plunder as if it have fall into robber ' hand then the obstacle come nearer and nearer together and then the sea must understand that the land send toward it she littlest child in order to move it to pity it also become more friendly the farther in it come roll its wave less high moderate its storm let the green thing stay in crack and crevice separate itself into small sound and inlet and become at last so harmless in the land that little boat dare venture out on it it certainly can not recognize itself -- so mild and friendly have it grown and then think of the hillside it lie uniform and look the same almost everywhere it consist of flat grain-field with one and another birch-grove between they or else of long stretch of forest range it appear as if it have think about nothing but grain and turnip and potato and spruce and pine then come a sea-fiord that cut far into it it do not mind that but border it with birch and alder just as if it be a ordinary fresh-water lake then still another wave come drive in nor do the hillside bother itself about cringe to this but it too get the same cover as the first one then the fiord begin to broaden and separate they break up field and wood and then the hillside can not help but notice they i believe it be the sea itself that be come say the hillside and then it begin to adorn itself it wreathe itself with blossom travel up and down in hill and throw island into the sea it no longer care about pine and spruce but cast they off like old every day clothes and parade later with big oak and linden and chestnut and with blossom leafy bower and become as gorgeous as a manor-park and when it meet the sea it be so change that it do not know itself all this one can not see very well until summertime but at any rate the boy observe how mild and friendly nature be and he begin to feel calmer than he have be before that night then suddenly he hear a sharp and ugly yowl from the bath-house park and when he stand up he see in the white moonlight a fox standing on the pavement under the balcony for smirre have follow the wild goose once more but when he have find the place where they be quarter he have understand that it be impossible to get at they in any way then he have not be able to keep from yowl with chagrin when the fox yowl in this manner old akka the leader-goose be awaken although she could see nothing she think she recognize the voice be it you who be out to-night smirre say she yes say smirre it be i and i want to ask what you goose think of the night that i have give you do you mean to say that it be you who have send the marten and otter against we ask akka a good turn should not be deny say smirre you once play the goose-game with I now i have begin to play the fox-game with you and i be not incline to let up on it so long as a single one of you still live even if i have to follow you the world over you smirre ought at least to think whether it be right for you who be weapon with both tooth and claw to hound we in this way we who be without defense say akka smirre think that akka sound scared and he say quickly : if you akka will take that thumbietot -- who have so often oppose I -- and throw he down to I i 'll promise to make peace with you then i 'll never more pursue you or any of yours i be not go to give you thumbietot say akka from the youngest of we to the oldest we would willingly give we life for he sake since you be so fond of he say smirre i 'll promise you that he shall be the first among you that i will wreak vengeance upon akka say no more and after smirre have send up a few more yowl all be still the boy lay all the while awake now it be akka 's word to the fox that prevent he from sleep never have he dream that he should hear anything so great as that anyone be willing to risk life for he sake from that moment it could no longer be say of nil holgersson that he do not care for anyone karlskrona _ Saturday April second _ it be a moonlight evening in karlskrona -- calm and beautiful but earlier in the day there have be rain and wind and the people must have think that the bad weather still continue for hardly one of they have venture out on the street while the city lay there so desolate akka the wild goose and she flock come fly toward it over vemmön and pantarholman they be out in the late evening to seek a sleep place on the island they could not remain inland because they be disturb by smirre fox wherever they light when the boy ride along high up in the air and look at the sea and the island which spread themselves before he he think that everything appear so strange and spook-like the heaven be no longer blue but encase he like a globe of green glass the sea be milk-white and as far as he could see rolled small white wave tip with silver ripple in the midst of all this white lay numerous little islet absolutely coal black whether they be big or little whether they be as even as meadow or full of cliff they look just as black even dwelling house and church and windmill which at other time be white or red be outline in black against the green sky the boy think it be as if the earth have be transform and he be come to another world he think that just for this one night he want to be brave and not afraid -- when he see something that really frighten he it be a high cliff island which be cover with big angular block and between the block shine speck of bright shine gold he could not keep from thinking of maglestone by trolle-ljungby which the troll sometimes raise upon high gold pillar and he wonder if this be something like that but with the stone and the gold it might have go fairly well if such a lot of horrid thing have not be lie all around the island it look like whale and shark and other big sea-monster but the boy understand that it be the sea-troll who have gather around the island and intend to crawl up on it to fight with the land-troll who live there and those on the land be probably afraid for he see how a big giant stand on the highest point of the island and raise he arm -- as if in despair over all the misfortune that should come to he and he island the boy be not a little terrify when he notice that akka begin to descend right over that particular island no for pity 's sake we must not light there say he but the goose continue to descend and soon the boy be astonish that he could have see thing so awry in the first place the big stone block be nothing but house the whole island be a city and the shine gold speck be street lamp and light window-pane the giant who stand highest up on the island and raise he arm be a church with two cross-tower all the sea-troll and monster which he think he have see be boat and ship of every description that lay anchor all around the island on the side which lay toward the land be mostly row-boats and sailboat and small coast steamer but on the side that face the sea lay armour-clad battleship some be broad with very thick slant smokestack other be long and narrow and so construct that they could glide through the water like fish now what city might this be that the boy could figure out because he see all the battleship all he life he have love ship although he have have nothing to do with any except the galley which he have sail in the road ditch he know very well that this city -- where so many battleship lay -- could not be any place but karlskrona the boy 's grandfather have be a old marine and as long as he have live he have talk of karlskrona every day of the great warship dock and of all the other thing to be see in that city the boy feel perfectly at home and he be glad that he should see all this of which he have hear so much but he only have a glimpse of the tower and fortification which bar the entrance to the harbor and the many building and the shipyard -- before akka come down on one of the flat church-tower this be a pretty safe place for those who want to get away from a fox and the boy begin to wonder if he could not venture to crawl in under the goosey-gander 's wing for this one night yes that he might safely do it would do he good to get a little sleep he should try to see a little more of the dock and the ship after it have grow light the boy himself think it be strange that he could keep still and wait until the next morning to see the ship he certainly have not sleep five minute before he slip out from under the wing and slide down the lightning-rod and the waterspout all the way down to the ground soon he stand on a big square which spread itself in front of the church it be cover with round stone and be just as difficult for he to travel over as it be for big people to walk on a tufted meadow those who be accustom to live in the open -- or way out in the country -- always feel uneasy when they come into a city where the house stand straight and forbid and the street be open so that everyone can see who go there and it happen in the same way with the boy when he stand on the big karlskrona square and look at the german church and town hall and the cathedral from which he have just descend he could not do anything but wish that he be back on the tower again with the goose it be a lucky thing that the square be entirely desert there be not a human be about -- unless he count a statue that stand on a high pedestal the boy gaze long at the statue which represent a big brawny man in a three-cornered hat long waistcoat knee-breeches and coarse shoe and wonder what kind of a one he be he hold a long stick in he hand and he look as if he would know how to make use of it too -- for he have a awfully severe countenance with a big hooked nose and a ugly mouth what be that long-lipped thing do here say the boy at last he have never feel so small and insignificant as he do that night he try to jolly himself up a bit by say something audacious then he think no more about the statue but betook himself to a wide street which lead down to the sea but the boy have not go far before he hear that someone be follow he someone be walk behind he who stamp on the stone pavement with heavy footstep and pound on the ground with a hard stick it sound as if the bronze man up in the square have go out for a promenade the boy listen after the step while he run down the street and he become more and more convinced that it be the bronze man the ground tremble and the house shake it could not be anyone but he who walk so heavily and the boy grow panic-stricken when he think of what he have just say to he he do not dare to turn he head to find out if it really be he perhaps he be only out walk for recreation think the boy surely he can not be offend with I for the word i speak they be not at all badly mean instead of go straight on and try to get down to the dock the boy turn into a side street which lead east first and foremost he want to get away from the one who tramp after he but the next instant he hear that the bronze man have switch off to the same street and then the boy be so scared that he do not know what he would do with himself and how hard it be to find any hide place in a city where all the gate be close then he see on he right a old frame church which lay a short distance away from the street in the center of a large grove not a instant do he pause to consider but rush on toward the church if i can only get there then i 'll surely be shield from all harm think he as he run forward he suddenly catch sight of a man who stand on a gravel path and beckon to he there be certainly someone who will help I think the boy he become intensely happy and hurry off in that direction he be actually so frightened that the heart of he fairly thump in he breast but when he come up to the man who stand on the edge of the gravel path upon a low pedestal he be absolutely thunderstruck surely it can not have be that one who beckon to I think he for he see that the entire man be make of wood he stand there and stare at he he be a thick-set man on short leg with a broad ruddy countenance shiny black hair and full black beard on he head he wear a wooden hat on he body a brown wooden coat around he waist a black wooden belt on he leg he have wide wooden knee-breeches and wooden stocking and on he foot black wooden shoe he be newly paint and newly varnish so that he glisten and shine in the moonlight this undoubtedly have a good deal to do with give he such a good-natured appearance that the boy at once place confidence in he in he left hand he hold a wooden slate and there the boy read : _ most humbly i beg you though voice i may lack : come drop a penny do but lift my hat _ oh ho the man be only a poor-box the boy feel that he have be do he have expect that this should be something really remarkable and now he remember that grandpa have also speak of the wooden man and say that all the child in karlskrona be so fond of he and that must have be true for he too find it hard to part with the wooden man he have something so old-timy about he that one could well take he to be many hundred year old and at the same time he look so strong and bold and animated -- just as one might imagine that folk look in olden time the boy have so much fun look at the wooden man that he entirely forget the one from whom he be flee but now he hear he he turn from the street and come into the churchyard he follow he here too where should the boy go just then he see the wooden man bend down to he and stretch forth he big broad hand it be impossible to believe anything but good of he and with one jump the boy stand in he hand the wooden man lift he to he hat -- and stick he under it the boy be just hide and the wooden man have just get he arm in its right place again when the bronze man stop in front of he and bang the stick on the ground so that the wooden man shake on he pedestal thereupon the bronze man say in a strong and resonant voice : who might this one be the wooden man 's arm go up so that it creak in the old woodwork and he touch he hat brim as he reply : rosenbom by you majesty 's leave once upon a time boatswain on the man-of-war _ dristigheten _ after complete service sexton at the admiral 's church -- and lately carve in wood and exhibit in the churchyard as a poor-box the boy give a start when he hear that the wooden man say you majesty for now when he think about it he know that the statue on the square represent the one who have found the city it be probably no less a one than charle the eleventh himself whom he have encounter he give a good account of himself say the bronze man can he also tell I if he have see a little brat who run around in the city to-night he be a impudent rascal if i get hold of he i 'll teach he manners with that he again pound on the ground with he stick and look fearfully angry by you majesty 's leave i have see he say the wooden man and the boy be so scared that he commence to shake where he sit under the hat and look at the bronze man through a crack in the wood but he calm down when the wooden man continue : you majesty be on the wrong track that youngster certainly intend to run into the shipyard and conceal himself there do he say so rosenbom well then do not stand still on the pedestal any longer but come with I and help I find he four eye be better than two rosenbom but the wooden man answer in a doleful voice : i would most humbly beg to be permit to stay where i be i look well and sleek because of the paint but i be old and mouldy and can not stand move about the bronze man be not one of those who like to be contradict what sort of notion be these come along rosenbom then he raise he stick and give the other one a resounding whack on the shoulder do rosenbom not see that he hold together with that they break off and walk forward on the street of karlskrona -- large and mighty -- until they come to a high gate which lead to the shipyard just outside and on guard walk one of the navy 's jack-tar but the bronze man strut past he and kick the gate open without the jack-tar 's pretend to notice it as soon as they have get into the shipyard they see before they a wide expansive harbor separate by pile-bridge in the different harbor basin lay the warship which look bigger and more awe-inspiring close to like this than lately when the boy have see they from up above then it be not so crazy after all to imagine that they be sea-troll think he where do rosenbom think it most advisable for we to begin the search say the bronze man such a one as he could most easily conceal himself in the hall of model reply the wooden man on a narrow land-strip which stretch to the right from the gate all along the harbor lay ancient structure the bronze man walk over to a building with low wall small window and a conspicuous roof he pound on the door with he stick until it burst open and tramp up a pair of worn-out step soon they come into a large hall which be fill with tackle and full-rigged little ship the boy understand without be tell that these be model for the ship which have be build for the swedish navy there be ship of many different variety there be old men-of-war whose side bristle with cannon and which have high structure fore and aft and they mast weigh down with a network of sail and rope there be small island-boat with rowing-bench along the side there be undecked cannon sloop and richly gilded frigate which be model of the one the king have use on they travels finally there be also the heavy broad armour-plated ship with tower and cannon on deck -- such as be in use nowadays and narrow shine torpedo boat which resemble long slender fish when the boy be carry around among all this he be awed fancy that such big splendid ship have be build here in sweden he think to himself he have plenty of time to see all that be to be see in there for when the bronze man see the model he forget everything else he examine they all from the first to the last and ask about they and rosenbom the boatswain on the _ dristigheten _ tell as much as he know of the ship ' builder and of those who have man they and of the fate they have meet he tell they about chapman and puke and trolle of hoagland and svensksund -- all the way along until 1809 -- after that he have not be there both he and the bronze man have the most to say about the fine old wooden ship the new battleship they do not exactly appear to understand i can hear that rosenbom do not know anything about these new-fangled thing say the bronze man therefore let we go and look at something else for this amuse I rosenbom by this time he have entirely give up he search for the boy who feel calm and secure where he sit in the wooden hat thereupon both man wander through the big establishment : sail-making shop anchor smithy machine and carpenter shop they see the mast sheer and the dock the large magazine the arsenal the rope-bridge and the big discard dock which have be blast in the rock they go out upon the pile-bridge where the naval vessel lay moor step on board and examine they like two old sea-dog wonder disapprove approve and become indignant the boy sit in safety under the wooden hat and hear all about how they have labor and struggle in this place to equip the navy which have go out from here he hear how life and blood have be risk how the last penny have be sacrifice to build the warship how skilled man have strain all they power in order to perfect these ship which have be they fatherland 's safeguard a couple of time the tear come to the boy 's eye as he hear all this and the very last they go into a open court where the galley model of old man-of-war be group and a more remarkable sight the boy have never behold for these model have inconceivably powerful and terror-striking face they be big fearless and savage : fill with the same proud spirit that have fit out the great ship they be from another time than he he think that he shrivel up before they but when they come in here the bronze man say to the wooden man : take off thy hat rosenbom for those that stand here they have all fight for the fatherland and rosenbom -- like the bronze man -- have forget why they have begin this tramp without think he lift the wooden hat from he head and shout : i take off my hat to the one who choose the harbor and found the shipyard and recreate the navy to the monarch who have awaken all this into life thanks rosenbom that be well speak rosenbom be a fine man but what be this rosenbom for there stand nil holgersson right on the top of rosenbom 's bald pate he be not afraid any longer but raise he white toboggan hood and shout : hurrah for you longlip the bronze man strike the ground hard with he stick but the boy never learn what he have intend to do for now the sun run up and at the same time both the bronze man and the wooden man vanish -- as if they have be make of mist while he still stand and stare after they the wild goose fly up from the church tower and sway back and forth over the city instantly they catch sight of nil holgersson and then the big white one dart down from the sky and fetch he the trip to öland _ Sunday April third _ the wild goose go out on a wooded island to feed there they happen to run across a few gray goose who be surprise to see they -- since they know very well that they kinsman the wild goose usually travel over the interior of the country they be curious and inquisitive and would not be satisfy with less than that the wild goose should tell they all about the persecution which they have to endure from smirre fox when they have finish a gray goose who appear to be as old and as wise as akka herself say : it be a great misfortune for you that smirre fox be declare a outlaw in he own land he 'll be sure to keep he word and follow you all the way up to lapland if i be in you place i should not travel north over småland but would take the outside route over öland instead so that he 'll be throw off the track entirely to really mislead he you must remain for a couple of day on öland 's southern point there you 'll find lot of food and lot of company i do not believe you 'll regret it if you go over there it be certainly very sensible advice and the wild goose conclude to follow it as soon as they have eat all they could hold they start on the trip to öland none of they have ever be there before but the gray goose have give they excellent direction they only have to travel direct south until they come to a large bird-track which extend all along the blekinge coast all the bird who have winter residence by the west sea and who now intend to travel to finland and russium fly forward there -- and in pass they be always in the habit of stop at öland to rest the wild goose would have no trouble in find guide that day it be perfectly still and warm -- like a summer 's day -- the best weather in the world for a sea trip the only grave thing about it be that it be not quite clear for the sky be gray and veil here and there be enormous mist-cloud which hang way down to the sea 's outer edge and obstruct the view when the traveller have get away from the wooded island the sea spread itself so smooth and mirror-like that the boy as he look down think the water have disappear there be no longer any earth under he he have nothing but mist and sky around he he grow very dizzy and hold himself tight on the goose-back more frightened than when he sit there for the first time it seem as though he could not possibly hold on he must fall in some direction it be even worse when they reach the big bird-track of which the gray goose have speak actually there come flock after flock fly in exactly the same direction they seem to follow a fix route there be duck and gray goose surf-scoter and guillemot loon and pin-tail duck and merganser and grebe and oyster-catcher and sea-grouse but now when the boy lean forward and look in the direction where the sea ought to lie he see the whole bird procession reflect in the water but he be so dizzy that he do not understand how this have come about : he think that the whole bird procession fly with they belly upside down still he do not wonder at this so much for he do not himself know which be up and which be down the bird be tire out and impatient to get on none of they shriek or say a funny thing and this make everything seem peculiarly unreal think if we have travel away from the earth he say to himself think if we be on we way up to heaven he see nothing but mist and bird around he and begin to look upon it as reasonable that they be travel heaven-ward he be glad and wonder what he should see up there the dizziness pass all at once he be so exceedingly happy at the thought that he be on he way to heaven and be leave this earth just about then he hear a couple of loud shot and see two white smoke-column ascend there be a sudden awakening and a unrest among the bird hunter hunter they cry fly high fly away then the boy see finally that they be travel all the while over the sea-coast and that they certainly be not in heaven in a long row lay small boat fill with hunter who fire shoot upon shot the nearest bird-flock have not notice they in time they have fly too low several dark body sink down toward the sea and for every one that fall there arise cry of anguish from the live it be strange for one who have but lately believe himself in heaven to wake up suddenly to such fear and lamentation akka shot toward the height as fast as she could and the flock follow with the greatest possible speed the wild goose get safely out of the way but the boy could not get over he amazement to think that anyone could wish to shoot upon such as akka and yksus and kaksus and the goosey-gander and the other human being have no conception of what they do so it bear on again in the still air and everything be as quiet as heretofore -- with the exception that some of the tired bird call out every now and then : be we not there soon be you sure we be on the right track hereupon those who fly in the center answer : we be fly straight to öland straight to öland the gray goose be tire out and the loon fly around they do not be in such a rush cry the duck you 'll eat up all the food before we get there oh there 'll be enough for both you and we answer the loon before they have get so far that they see öland there come a light wind against they it bring with it something that resemble immense cloud of white smoke -- just as if there be a big fire somewhere when the bird see the first white spiral haze they become uneasy and increase they speed but that which resemble smoke blow thicker and thicker and at last it envelop they altogether they smell no smoke and the smoke be not dark and dry but white and damp suddenly the boy understand that it be nothing but a mist when the mist become so thick that one could not see a goose-length ahead the bird begin to carry on like real lunatic all these who before have travel forward in such perfect order begin to play in the mist they fly hither and thither to entice one another astray be careful they cry you be only travel round and round turn back for pity 's sake you 'll never get to öland in this way they all know perfectly well where the island be but they do they best to lead each other astray look at those wagtail ring out in the mist they be go back toward the north sea have a care wild goose shriek someone from another direction if you continue like this you 'll get clear up to rügen there be of course no danger that the bird who be accustom to travel here would permit themselves to be lure in a wrong direction but the one who have a hard time of it be the wild goose the jester observe that they be uncertain as to the way and do all they could to confuse they where do you intend to go good people call a swan he come right up to akka and look sympathetic and serious we shall travel to öland but we have never be there before say akka she think that this be a bird to be trust it be too bad say the swan they have lure you in the wrong direction you be on the road to blekinge now come with I and i 'll put you right and so he fly off with they and when he have take they so far away from the track that they hear no call he disappear in the mist they fly around for a while at random they have barely succeed in find the bird again when a duck approach they it be best that you lie down on the water until the mist clear say the duck it be evident that you be not accustom to look out for yourselve on journey those rogue succeed in make akka 's head swim as near as the boy could make out the wild goose fly round and round for a long time be careful can not you see that you be fly up and down shout a loon as he rush by the boy positively clutch the goosey-gander around the neck this be something which he have fear for a long time no one can tell when they would have arrive if they have not hear a rolling and muffle sound in the distance then akka crane she neck snap hard with she wing and rush on at full speed now she have something to go by the gray goose have tell she not to light on öland 's southern point because there be a cannon there which the people use to shoot the mist with now she know the way and now no one in the world should lead she astray again öland 's southern point _ April third to sixth _ on the most southerly part of öland lie a royal demesne which be call ottenby it be a rather large estate which extend from shore to shore straight across the island and it be remarkable because it have always be a haunt for large bird-company in the seventeenth century when the king use to go over to öland to hunt the entire estate be nothing but a deer park in the eighteenth century there be a stud there where blood race-horse be breed and a sheep farm where several hundred sheep be maintain in we day you 'll find neither blood horse nor sheep at ottenby in place of they live great herd of young horse which be to be use by the cavalry in all the land there be certainly no place that could be a better abode for animal along the extreme eastern shore lie the old sheep meadow which be a mile and a half long and the largest meadow in all öland where animal can graze and play and run about as free as if they be in a wilderness and there you will find the celebrated ottenby grove with the hundred-year-old oak which give shade from the sun and shelter from the severe öland wind and we must not forget the long ottenby wall which stretch from shore to shore and separate ottenby from the rest of the island so that the animal may know how far the old royal demesne extend and be careful about get in on other ground where they be not so well protect you 'll find plenty of tame animal at ottenby but that be not all one could almost believe that the wild one also feel that on a old crown property both the wild and the tame one can count upon shelter and protection -- since they venture there in such great number besides there be still a few stag of the old descent leave and burrow-duck and partridge love to live there and it offer a rest place in the spring and late summer for thousand of migratory bird above all it be the swampy eastern shore below the sheep meadow where the migratory bird alight to rest and feed when the wild goose and nil holgersson have finally find they way to öland they come down like all the rest on the shore near the sheep meadow the mist lay thick over the island just as it have over the sea but still the boy be amaze at all the bird which he discern only on the little narrow stretch of shore which he could see it be a low sand-shore with stone and pool and a lot of cast-up sea-weed if the boy have be permit to choose it be not likely that he would have think of alight there but the bird probably look upon this as a veritable paradise duck and goose walk about and feed on the meadow nearer the water run snipe and other coast-bird the loon lay in the sea and fish but the life and movement be upon the long sea-weed bank along the coast there the bird stand side by side close together and pick grub-worm -- which must have be find there in limitless quantity for it be very evident that there be never any complaint over a lack of food the great majority be go to travel farther and have only alight to take a short rest and as soon as the leader of a flock think that he comrade have recover themselves sufficiently he say if you be ready now we may as well move on no wait wait we have not have anything like enough say the follower you surely do not believe that i intend to let you eat so much that you will not be able to move say the leader and flap he wing and start off along the outermost sea-weed bank lay a flock of swan they do not bother about go on land but rest themselves by lie and rock on the water now and then they dive down with they neck and bring up food from the sea-bottom when they have get hold of anything very good they indulge in loud shout that sound like trumpet call when the boy hear that there be swan on the shoal he hurry out to the sea-weed bank he have never before see wild swan at close range he have luck on he side so that he get close up to they the boy be not the only one who have hear the swan both the wild goose and the gray goose and the loon swim out between the bank lay themselves in a ring around the swan and stare at they the swan ruffle they feather raise they wing like sail and lift they neck high in the air occasionally one and another of they swim up to a goose or a great loon or a diving-duck and say a few word and then it appear as though the one address hardly dare raise he bill to reply but then there be a little loon -- a tiny mischievous baggage -- who could not stand all this ceremony he dive suddenly and disappear under the water 's edge soon after that one of the swan let out a scream and swim off so quickly that the water foam then he stop and begin to look majestic once more but soon another one shriek in the same way as the first one and then a third the little loon be not able to stay under water any longer but appear on the water 's edge little and black and venomous the swan rush toward he but when they see what a poor little thing it be they turn abruptly -- as if they consider themselves too good to quarrel with he then the little loon dive again and pinch they foot it certainly must have hurt and the worst of it be that they could not maintain they dignity at once they take a decide stand they begin to beat the air with they wing so that it thunder come forward a bit -- as though they be run on the water -- get wind under they wing and raise themselves when the swan be go they be greatly miss and those who have lately be amuse by the little loon 's antic scold he for he thoughtlessness the boy walk toward land again there he station himself to see how the pool-snipe play they resemble small stork like these they have little body long leg and neck and light sway movement only they be not gray but brown they stand in a long row on the shore where it be wash by wave as soon as a wave roll in the whole row run backward as soon as it recede they follow it and they keep this up for hour the showiest of all the bird be the burrow-duck they be undoubtedly related to the ordinary duck for like these they too have a thick-set body broad bill and webbed foot but they be much more elaborately get up the feather dress itself be white around they neck they wear a broad gold band the wing-mirror shone in green red and black and the wing-edge be black and the head be dark green and shimmer like satin as soon as any of these appear on the shore the other say : now just look at those thing they know how to tog themselves out if they be not so conspicuous they would not have to dig they nest in the earth but could lay above ground like anyone else say a brown mallard-duck they may try as much as they please still they 'll never get anywhere with such nose say a gray goose and this be actually true the burrow-duck have a big knob on the base of the bill which spoil they appearance close to the shore sea-gull and sea-swallow move forward on the water and fish what kind of fish be you catch ask a wild goose it be a stickleback it be öland stickleback it be the best stickleback in the world say a gull will not you taste of it and he fly up to the goose with he mouth full of the little fish and want to give she some ugh do you think that i eat such filth say the wild goose the next morning it be just as cloudy the wild goose walk about on the meadow and fed but the boy have go to the seashore to gather mussel there be plenty of they and when he think that the next day perhaps they would be in some place where they could not get any food at all he conclude that he would try to make himself a little bag which he could fill with mussel he find a old sedge on the meadow which be strong and tough and out of this he begin to braid a knapsack he work at this for several hour but he be well satisfy with it when it be finish at dinner time all the wild goose come run and ask he if he have see anything of the white goosey-gander no he have not be with I say the boy we have he with we all along until just lately say akka but now we no longer know where he be to be find the boy jump up and be terribly frightened he ask if any fox or eagle have put in a appearance or if any human being have be see in the neighborhood but no one have notice anything dangerous the goosey-gander have probably lose he way in the mist but it be just as great a misfortune for the boy in whatever way the white one have be lose and he start off immediately to hunt for he the mist shield he so that he could run wherever he wish without be see but it also prevent he from see he run southward along the shore -- all the way down to the lighthouse and the mist cannon on the island 's extreme point it be the same bird confusion everywhere but no goosey-gander he venture over to ottenby estate and he search every one of the old hollow oak in ottenby grove but he see no trace of the goosey-gander he search until it begin to grow dark then he have to turn back again to the eastern shore he walk with heavy step and be fearfully blue he do not know what would become of he if he could not find the goosey-gander there be no one whom he could spare less but when he wander over the sheep meadow what be that big white thing that come toward he in the mist if it be not the goosey-gander he be all right and very glad that at last he have be able to find he way back to the other the mist have make he so dizzy he say that he have wander around on the big meadow all day long the boy throw he arm around he neck for very joy and beg he to take care of himself and not wander away from the other and he promise positively that he never would do this again no never again but the next morning when the boy go down to the beach and hunt for mussel the goose come run and ask if he have see the goosey-gander no of course he have not well then the goosey-gander be lose again he have go astray in the mist just as he have do the day before the boy run off in great terror and begin to search he find one place where the ottenby wall be so tumble-down that he could climb over it later he go about first on the shore which gradually widen and become so large that there be room for field and meadow and farm -- then up on the flat highland which lay in the middle of the island and where there be no building except windmill and where the turf be so thin that the white cement shone under it meanwhile he could not find the goosey-gander and as it draw on toward evening and the boy must return to the beach he could not believe anything but that he travel companion be lose he be so depressed he do not know what to do with himself he have just climb over the wall again when he hear a stone crash down close beside he as he turn to see what it be he think that he could distinguish something that move on a stone pile which lay close to the wall he steal nearer and see the goosey-gander come trudge wearily over the stone pile with several long fiber in he mouth the goosey-gander do not see the boy and the boy do not call to he but think it advisable to find out first why the goosey-gander time and again disappear in this manner and he soon learn the reason for it up in the stone pile lay a young gray goose who cry with joy when the goosey-gander come the boy creep near so that he hear what they say then he find out that the gray goose have be wound in one wing so that she could not fly and that she flock have travel away from she and leave she alone she have be near death 's door with hunger when the white goosey-gander have hear she call the other day and have seek she out ever since he have be carry food to she they have both hope that she would be well before they leave the island but as yet she could neither fly nor walk she be very much worry over this but he comfort she with the thought that he should not travel for a long time at last he bid she good-night and promise to come the next day the boy let the goosey-gander go and as soon as he be go he steal in turn up to the stone heap he be angry because he have be deceive and now he want to say to that gray goose that the goosey-gander be he property he be go to take the boy up to lapland and there would be no talk of he stay here on she account but now when he see the young gray goose close to he understand not only why the goosey-gander have go and carry food to she for two day but also why he have not wish to mention that he have help she she have the prettiest little head she feather-dress be like soft satin and the eye be mild and plead when she see the boy she want to run away but the left wing be out of joint and drag on the ground so that it interfere with she movement you must not be afraid of I say the boy and do not look nearly so angry as he have intend to appear i be thumbietot morten goosey-gander 's comrade he continue then he stand there and do not know what he want to say occasionally one find something among animal which make one wonder what sort of creature they really be one be almost afraid that they may be transform human being it be something like this with the gray goose as soon as thumbietot say who he be she lower she neck and head very charmingly before he and say in a voice that be so pretty that he could not believe it be a goose who speak : i be very glad that you have come here to help I the white goosey-gander have tell I that no one be as wise and as good as you she say this with such dignity that the boy grow really embarrassed this surely can not be any bird think he it be certainly some bewitch princess he be fill with a desire to help she and run he hand under the feather and feel along the wing-bone the bone be not break but there be something wrong with the joint he get he finger down into the empty cavity be careful now he say and get a firm grip on the bone-pipe and fit it into the place where it ought to be he do it very quickly and well consider it be the first time that he have attempt anything of the sort but it must have hurt very much for the poor young goose utter a single shrill cry and then sink down among the stone without show a sign of life the boy be terribly frightened he have only wish to help she and now she be dead he make a big jump from the stone pile and run away he think it be as though he have murder a human be the next morning it be clear and free from mist and akka say that now they should continue they travels all the other be willing to go but the white goosey-gander make excuse the boy understand well enough that he do not care to leave the gray goose akka do not listen to he but start off the boy jump up on the goosey-gander 's back and the white one follow the flock -- albeit slowly and unwillingly the boy be mighty glad that they could fly away from the island he be conscience-stricken on account of the gray goose and have not care to tell the goosey-gander how it have turn out when he have try to cure she it would probably be best if morten goosey-gander never find out about this he think though he wonder at the same time how the white one have the heart to leave the gray goose but suddenly the goosey-gander turn the thought of the young gray goose have overpower he it could go as it would with the lapland trip : he could not go with the other when he know that she lay alone and ill and would starve to death with a few wing-stroke he be over the stone pile but then there lay no young gray goose between the stone dunfin dunfin where art thou call the goosey-gander the fox have probably be here and take she thought the boy but at that moment he hear a pretty voice answer the goosey-gander here be i goosey-gander here be i i have only be take a morning bath and up from the water come the little gray goose -- fresh and in good trim -- and tell how thumbietot have pull she wing into place and that she be entirely well and ready to follow they on the journey the drop of water lay like pearl-dew on she shimmery satin-like feather and thumbietot think once again that she be a real little princess the big butterfly _ Wednesday April sixth _ the goose travel alongside the coast of the long island which lay distinctly visible under they the boy feel happy and light of heart during the trip he be just as pleased and well satisfied as he have be glum and depress the day before when he roam around down on the island and hunt for the goosey-gander he see now that the interior of the island consist of a barren high plain with a wreath of fertile land along the coast and he begin to comprehend the meaning of something which he have hear the other evening he have just seat himself to rest a bit by one of the many windmill on the highland when a couple of shepherd come along with the dog beside they and a large herd of sheep in they train the boy have not be afraid because he be well conceal under the windmill stair but as it turn out the shepherd come and seat themselves on the same stairway and then there be nothing for he to do but to keep perfectly still one of the shepherd be young and look about as folk do mostly the other be a old queer one he body be large and knotty but the head be small and the face have sensitive and delicate feature it appear as though the body and head do not want to fit together at all one moment he sit silent and gaze into the mist with a unutterably weary expression then he begin to talk to he companion then the other one take out some bread and cheese from he knapsack to eat he evening meal he answer scarcely anything but listen very patiently just as if he be think : i might as well give you the pleasure of let you chatter a while now i shall tell you something eric say the old shepherd i have figure out that in former day when both human being and animal be much larger than they be now that the butterfly too must have be uncommonly large and once there be a butterfly that be many mile long and have wing as wide as sea those wing be blue and shone like silver and so gorgeous that when the butterfly be out fly all the other animal stand still and stare at it it have this drawback however that it be too large the wing have hard work to carry it but probably all would have go very well if the butterfly have be wise enough to remain on the hillside but it be not it venture out over the east sea and it have not get very far before the storm come along and begin to tear at its wing well it be easy to understand eric how thing would go when the east sea storm commence to wrestle with frail butterfly-wing it be not long before they be tear away and scatter and then of course the poor butterfly fall into the sea at first it be toss backward and forward on the billow and then it be strand upon a few cliff-foundation outside of småland and there it lay -- as large and long as it be now i think eric that if the butterfly have drop on land it would soon have rot and fall apart but since it fall into the sea it be soak through and through with lime and become as hard as a stone you know of course that we have find stone on the shore which be nothing but petrified worm now i believe that it go the same way with the big butterfly-body i believe that it turn where it lay into a long narrow mountain out in the east sea do not you he pause for a reply and the other one nod to he go on so i may hear what you be drive at say he and mark you eric that this very öland upon which you and i live be nothing else than the old butterfly-body if one only think about it one can observe that the island be a butterfly toward the north the slender fore-body and the round head can be see and toward the south one see the back-body -- which first broaden out and then narrow to a sharp point here he pause once more and look at he companion rather anxiously to see how he would take this assertion but the young man keep on eat with the utmost calm and nod to he to continue as soon as the butterfly have be change into a limestone rock many different kind of seed of herb and tree come travel with the wind and want to take root on it it be a long time before anything but sedge could grow there then come sheep sorrel and the rock-rose and thorn-brush but even to-day there be not so much growth on alvaret that the mountain be well cover but it shine through here and there and no one can think of plough and sowing up here where the earth-crust be so thin but if you will admit that alvaret and the stronghold around it be make of the butterfly-body then you may well have the right to question where that land which lie beneath the stronghold come from yes it be just that say he who be eat that i should indeed like to know well you must remember that öland have lie in the sea for a good many year and in the course of time all the thing which tumble around with the wave -- sea-weed and sand and clam -- have gather around it and remain lie there and then stone and gravel have fall down from both the eastern and western stronghold in this way the island have acquire broad shore where grain and flower and tree can grow up here on the hard butterfly-back only sheep and cow and little horse go about only lapwing and plover live here and there be no building except windmill and a few stone hut where we shepherd crawl in but down on the coast lie big village and church and parish and fishing hamlet and a whole city he look questioningly at the other one this one have finish he meal and be tie the food-sack together i wonder where you will end with all this say he it be only this that i want to know say the shepherd as he lower he voice so that he almost whisper the word and look into the mist with he small eye which appear to be wear out from spy after all that which do not exist only this i want to know : if the peasant who live on the built-up farm beneath the stronghold or the fisherman who take the small herr from the sea or the merchant in borgholm or the bathing guest who come here every summer or the tourist who wander around in borgholm 's old castle ruin or the sportsman who come here in the fall to hunt partridge or the painter who sit here on alvaret and paint the sheep and windmill -- i should like to know if any of they understand that this island have be a butterfly which fly about with great shimmery wing ah say the young shepherd suddenly it should have occur to some of they as they sit on the edge of the stronghold of a evening and hear the nightingale trill in the grove below they and look over kalmar sound that this island could not have come into existence in the same way as the other i want to ask say the old one if no one have have the desire to give wing to the windmill -- so large that they could reach to heaven so large that they could lift the whole island out of the sea and let it fly like a butterfly among butterfly it may be possible that there be something in what you say say the young one for on summer night when the heaven widen and open over the island i have sometimes think that it be as if it want to raise itself from the sea and fly away but when the old one have finally get the young one to talk he do not listen to he very much i would like to know the old one say in a low tone if anyone can explain why one feel such a longing up here on alvaret i have feel it every day of my life and i think it prey upon each and every one who must go about here i want to know if no one else have understand that all this wistfulness be cause by the fact that the whole island be a butterfly that long for its wing little karl 's island the storm _ Friday April eighth _ the wild goose have spend the night on öland 's northern point and be now on they way to the continent a strong south wind blow over kalmar sound and they have be throw northward still they work they way toward land with good speed but when they be near the first island a powerful rumble be hear as if a lot of strong-winged bird have come fly and the water under they all at once become perfectly black akka draw in she wing so suddenly that she almost stand still in the air thereupon she lower herself to light on the edge of the sea but before the goose have reach the water the west storm catch up with they already it drive before it fog salt scum and small bird it also snatch with it the wild goose throw they on end and cast they toward the sea it be a rough storm the wild goose try to turn back time and again but they could not do it and be drive out toward the east sea the storm have already blow they past öland and the sea lay before they -- empty and desolate there be nothing for they to do but to keep out of the water when akka observe that they be unable to turn back she think that it be needless to let the storm drive they over the entire east sea therefore she sink down to the water now the sea be rage and increase in violence with every second the sea-green billow roll forward with seething foam on they crest each one surge higher than the other it be as though they race with each other to see which could foam the wildest but the wild goose be not afraid of the swell on the contrary this seem to afford they much pleasure they do not strain themselves with swimming but lay and let themselves be wash up with the wave-crest and down in the water-dale and have just as much fun as child in a swing they only anxiety be that the flock should be separate the few land-bird who drive by up in the storm cry with envy : there be no danger for you who can swim but the wild goose be certainly not out of all danger in the first place the rock make they helplessly sleepy they wish continually to turn they head backward poke they bill under they wing and go to sleep nothing can be more dangerous than to fall asleep in this way and akka call out all the while : do not go to sleep wild goose he that fall asleep will get away from the flock he that get away from the flock be lose despite all attempt at resistance one after another fall asleep and akka herself come pretty near doze off when she suddenly see something round and dark rise on the top of a wave seal seal seal cry akka in a high shrill voice and raise herself up in the air with resounding wing-stroke it be just at the crucial moment before the last wild goose have time to come up from the water the seal be so close to she that they make a grab for she foot then the wild goose be once more up in the storm which drive they before it out to sea no rest do it allow either itself or the wild goose and no land do they see -- only desolate sea they light on the water again as soon as they dare venture but when they have rock upon the wave for a while they become sleepy again and when they fall asleep the seal come swim if old akka have not be so wakeful not one of they would have escape all day the storm rage and it cause fearful havoc among the crowd of little bird which at this time of year be migrate some be drive from they course to foreign land where they die of starvation other become so exhaust that they sink down in the sea and be drown many be crush against the cliff-wall and many become a prey for the seal the storm continue all day and at last akka begin to wonder if she and she flock would perish they be now dead tired and nowhere do they see any place where they might rest toward evening she no longer dare to lie down on the sea because now it fill up all of a sudden with large ice-cake which strike against each other and she fear they should be crush between these a couple of time the wild goose try to stand on the ice-crust but one time the wild storm sweep they into the water another time the merciless seal come creep up on the ice at sundown the wild goose be once more up in the air they fly on -- fearful for the night the darkness seem to come upon they much too quickly this night -- which be so full of danger it be terrible that they as yet see no land how would it go with they if they be force to stay out on the sea all night they would either be crush between the ice-cake or devour by seal or separate by the storm the heaven be cloud-bedecked the moon hide itself and the darkness come quickly at the same time all nature be fill with a horror which cause the most courageous heart to quail distressed bird-traveller ' cry have sound over the sea all day long without anyone have pay the slightest attention to they but now when one no longer saw who it be that utter they they seem mournful and terrifying down on the sea the ice-drift crash against each other with a loud rumble noise the seal tune up they wild hunting song it be as though heaven and earth be about to clash the sheep the boy sit for a moment and look down into the sea suddenly he think that it begin to roar louder than ever he look up right in front of he -- only a couple of metre away -- stand a rugged and bare mountain-wall at its base the wave dash into a foam spray the wild goose fly straight toward the cliff and the boy do not see how they could avoid be dash to piece against it hardly have he wonder that akka have not see the danger in time when they be over by the mountain then he also notice that in front of they be the half-round entrance to a grotto into this the goose steer and the next moment they be safe the first thing the wild goose think of -- before they give themselves time to rejoice over they safety -- be to see if all they comrade be also harbour yes there be akka iksi kolmi nelja viisi knusi all the six gosling the goosey-gander dunfin and thumbietot but kaksus from nuolja the first left-hand goose be miss -- and no one know anything about she fate when the wild goose discover that no one but kaksus have be separate from the flock they take the matter lightly kaksi be old and wise she know all they byway and they habit and she of course would know how to find she way back to they then the wild goose begin to look around in the cave enough daylight come in through the opening so that they could see the grotto be both deep and wide they be delighted to think they have find such a fine night harbor when one of they catch sight of some shine green dot which glitter in a dark corner these be eye cry akka there be big animal in here they rush toward the opening but thumbietot call to they : there be nothing to run away from it be only a few sheep who be lie alongside the grotto wall when the wild goose have accustom themselves to the dim daylight in the grotto they see the sheep very distinctly the grown-up one might be about as many as there be goose but beside these there be a few little lamb a old ram with long twisted horn appear to be the most lordly one of the flock the wild goose go up to he with much bowing and scrape well meet in the wilderness they greet but the big ram lay still and do not speak a word of welcome then the wild goose think that the sheep be displeased because they have take shelter in they grotto it be perhaps not permissible that we have come in here say akka but we can not help it for we be wind-driven we have wander about in the storm all day and it would be very good to be allow to stop here to-night after that a long time pass before any of the sheep answer with word but on the other hand it could be hear distinctly that a pair of they heave deep sigh akka know to be sure that sheep be always shy and peculiar but these seem to have no idea of how they should conduct themselves finally a old ewe who have a long and pathetic face and a doleful voice say : there be not one among we that refuse to let you stay but this be a house of mourning and we can not receive guest as we do in former day you need not worry about anything of that sort say akka if you know what we have endure this day you would surely understand that we be satisfied if we only get a safe spot to sleep on when akka say this the old ewe raise herself i believe that it would be better for you to fly about in the worst storm than to stop here but at least you shall not go from here before we have have the privilege of offer you the best hospitality which the house afford she conduct they to a hollow in the ground which be fill with water beside it lay a pile of bait and husk and chaff and she bid they make the most of these we have have a severe snow-winter this year on the island she say the peasant who own we come out to we with hay and oaten straw so we should not starve to death and this trash be all there be leave of the good cheer the goose rush to the food instantly they think that they have fare well and be in they best humor they must have observe of course that the sheep be anxious but they know how easily scared sheep generally be and do not believe there be any actual danger on foot as soon as they have eat they intend to stand up to sleep as usual but then the big ram get up and walk over to they the goose think that they have never see a sheep with such big and coarse horn in other respects also he be noticeable he have a high rolling forehead intelligent eye and a good bearing -- as though he be a proud and courageous animal i can not assume the responsibility of let you goose remain without tell you that it be unsafe here say he we can not receive night guest just now at last akka begin to comprehend that this be serious we shall go away since you really wish it say she but will not you tell we first what it be that trouble you we know nothing about it we do not even know where we be this be little karl 's island say the ram it lie outside of gottland and only sheep and seabird live here perhaps you be wild sheep say akka we be not far remove from it reply the ram we have nothing to do with human being it be a old agreement between we and some peasant on a farm in gottland that they shall supply we with fodder in case we have snow-winter and as a recompense they be permit to take away those of we who become superfluous the island be small so it can not feed very many of we but otherwise we take care of ourselves all the year round and we do not live in house with door and lock but we reside in grotto like these do you stay out here in the winter as well ask akka surprise we do answer the ram we have good fodder up here on the mountain all the year around i think it sound as if you might have it better than other sheep say akka but what be the misfortune that have befall you it be bitter cold last winter the sea freeze and then three fox come over here on the ice and here they have be ever since otherwise there be no dangerous animal here on the island oh oh do fox dare to attack such as you oh no not during the day then i can protect myself and mine say the ram shake he horn but they sneak upon we at night when we sleep in the grotto we try to keep awake but one must sleep some of the time and then they come upon we they have already kill every sheep in the other grotto and there be herd that be just as large as mine it be not pleasant to tell that we be so helpless say the old ewe we can not help ourselves any better than if we be tame sheep do you think that they will come here to-night ask akka there be nothing else in store for we answer the old ewe they be here last night and steal a lamb from we they 'll be sure to come again as long as there be any of we alive this be what they have do in the other place but if they be allow to keep this up you 'll become entirely exterminate say akka oh it will not be long before it be all over with the sheep on little karl 's island say the ewe akka stand there hesitatingly it be not pleasant by any means to venture out in the storm again and it be not good to remain in a house where such guest be expect when she have ponder a while she turn to thumbietot i wonder if you will help we as you have do so many time before say she yes that he would like to do he reply it be a pity for you not to get any sleep say the wild goose but i wonder if you be able to keep awake until the fox come and then to awaken we so we may fly away the boy be so very glad of this -- for anything be better than to go out in the storm again -- so he promise to keep awake he go down to the grotto opening crawl in behind a stone that he might be shield from the storm and sit down to watch when the boy have be sit there a while the storm seem to abate the sky grow clear and the moonlight begin to play on the wave the boy step to the open to look out the grotto be rather high up on the mountain a narrow path lead to it it be probably here that he must await the fox as yet he see no fox but on the other hand there be something which for the moment terrify he much more on the land-strip below the mountain stand some giant or other stone-troll -- or perhaps they be actual human being at first he think that he be dream but now he be positive that he have not fall asleep he see the big man so distinctly that it could not be a illusion some of they stand on the land-strip and other right on the mountain just as if they intend to climb it some have big thick head other have no head at all some be one-armed and some have hump both before and behind he have never see anything so extraordinary the boy stand and work himself into a state of panic because of those troll so that he almost forget to keep he eye peel for the fox but now he hear a claw scrape against a stone he see three fox come up the steep and as soon as he know that he have something real to deal with he be calm again and not the least bit scared it strike he that it be a pity to awaken only the goose and to leave the sheep to they fate he think he would like to arrange thing some other way he run quickly to the other end of the grotto shake the big ram 's horn until he awake and at the same time swing himself upon he back get up sheep and well try to frighten the fox a bit say the boy he have try to be as quiet as possible but the fox must have hear some noise for when they come up to the mouth of the grotto they stop and deliberate it be certainly someone in there that move say one i wonder if they be awake oh go ahead you say another at all event they can not do anything to we when they come farther in in the grotto they stop and sniff who shall we take to-night whisper the one who go first to-night we will take the big ram say the last after that we 'll have easy work with the rest the boy sit on the old ram 's back and see how they sneak along now butt straight forward whisper the boy the ram but and the first fox be thrust -- top over tail -- back to the opening now butt to the left say the boy and turn the big ram 's head in that direction the ram measure a terrific assault that catch the second fox in the side he roll around several time before he get to he foot again and make he escape the boy have wish that the third one too might have get a bump but this one have already go now i think that they have have enough for to-night say the boy i think so too say the big ram now lie down on my back and creep into the wool you deserve to have it warm and comfortable after all the wind and storm that you have be out in hell 's hole the next day the big ram go around with the boy on he back and show he the island it consist of a single massive mountain it be like a large house with perpendicular wall and a flat roof first the ram walk up on the mountain-roof and show the boy the good grazing land there and he have to admit that the island seem to be especially create for sheep there be not much else than sheep-sorrel and such little spicy growth as sheep be fond of that grow on the mountain but indeed there be something beside sheep fodder to look at for one who have get well up on the steep to begin with the largest part of the sea -- which now lay blue and sunlit and roll forward in glitter swell -- be visible only upon one and another point do the foam spray up to the east lay gottland with even and long-stretched coast and to the southwest lay great karl 's island which be build on the same plan as the little island when the ram walk to the very edge of the mountain roof so the boy could look down the mountain wall he notice that they be simply fill with bird ' nest and in the blue sea beneath he lay surf-scoter and eider-duck and kittiwake and guillemot and razor-bill -- so pretty and peaceful -- busy themselves with fishing for small herr this be really a favored land say the boy you live in a pretty place you sheep oh yes it be pretty enough here say the big ram it be as if he wish to add something but he do not only sigh if you go about here alone you must look out for the crevice which run all around the mountain he continue after a little and this be a good warning for there be deep and broad crevice in several place the largest of they be call hell 's hole that crevice be many fathom deep and nearly one fathom wide if anyone fall down there it would certainly be the last of he say the big ram the boy think it sound as if he have a special meaning in what he say then he conduct the boy down to the narrow strip of shore now he could see those giant which have frighten he the night before at close range they be nothing but tall rock-pillar the big ram call they cliff the boy could not see enough of they he think that if there have ever be any troll who have turn into stone they ought to look just like that although it be pretty down on the shore the boy like it still better on the mountain height it be ghastly down here for everywhere they come across dead sheep it be here that the fox have hold they orgy he see skeleton whose flesh have be eat and body that be half-eaten and other which they have scarcely taste but have allow to lie untouched it be heart-rending to see how the wild beast have throw themselves upon the sheep just for sport -- just to hunt they and tear they to death the big ram do not pause in front of the dead but walk by they in silence but the boy meanwhile could not help see all the horror then the big ram go up on the mountain height again but when he be there he stop and say : if someone who be capable and wise could see all the misery which prevail here he surely would not be able to rest until these fox have be punish the fox must live too say the boy yes say the big ram those who do not tear in piece more animal than they need for they sustenance they may as well live but these be felon the peasant who own the island ought to come here and help you insist the boy they have row over a number of time reply the ram but the fox always hide themselves in the grotto and crevice so they could not get near they to shoot they you surely can not mean father that a poor little creature like I should be able to get at they when neither you nor the peasant have succeed in get the better of they he that be little and spry can put many thing to rights say the big ram they talk no more about this and the boy go over and seat himself among the wild goose who feed on the highland although he have not care to show he feeling before the ram he be very sad on the sheep 's account and he would have be glad to help they i can at least talk with akka and morten goosey-gander about the matter think he perhaps they can help I with a good suggestion a little later the white goosey-gander take the boy on he back and go over the mountain plain and in the direction of hell 's hole at that he wander care-free on the open mountain roof -- apparently unconscious of how large and white he be he do not seek protection behind tuft or any other protuberance but go straight ahead it be strange that he be not more careful for it be apparent that he have fare badly in yesterday 's storm he limp on he right leg and the left wing hang and drag as if it might be break he act as if there be no danger peck at a grass-blade here and another there and do not look about he in any direction the boy lay stretch out full length on the goose-back and look up toward the blue sky he be so accustomed to ride now that he could both stand and lie down on the goose-back when the goosey-gander and the boy be so care-free they do not observe of course that the three fox have come up on the mountain plain and the fox who know that it be well-nigh impossible to take the life of a goose on a open plain thought at first that they would not chase after the goosey-gander but as they have nothing else to do they finally sneak down on one of the long pass and try to steal up to he they go about it so cautiously that the goosey-gander could not see a shadow of they they be not far off when the goosey-gander make a attempt to raise himself into the air he spread he wing but he do not succeed in lift himself when the fox seem to grasp the fact that he could not fly they hurry forward with greater eagerness than before they no longer conceal themselves in the cleft but come up on the highland they hurry as fast as they could behind tuft and hollow and come nearer and nearer the goosey-gander -- without he seem to notice that he be be hunt at last the fox be so near that they could make the final leap simultaneously all three throw themselves with one long jump at the goosey-gander but still at the last moment he must have notice something for he run out of the way so the fox miss he this at any rate do not mean very much for the goosey-gander only have a couple of metre headway and in the bargain he limp anyway the poor thing run ahead as fast as he could the boy sit upon the goose-back -- backward -- and shriek and call to the fox you have eat yourselve too fat on mutton fox you can not catch up with a goose even he tease they so that they become craze with rage and think only of rush forward the white one run right straight to the big cleft when he be there he make one stroke with he wing and get over just then the fox be almost upon he the goosey-gander hurry on with the same haste as before even after he have get across hell 's hole but he have hardly be run two metre before the boy pat he on the neck and say : now you can stop goosey-gander at that instant they hear a number of wild howl behind they and a scrape of claw and heavy fall but of the fox they see nothing more the next morning the lighthouse keeper on great karl 's island find a bit of bark poke under the entrance-door and on it have be cut in slant angular letter : the fox on the little island have fall down into hell 's hole take care of they and this the lighthouse keeper do too two city the city at the bottom of the sea _ Saturday April ninth _ it be a calm and clear night the wild goose do not trouble themselves to seek shelter in any of the grotto but stand and sleep upon the mountain top and the boy have lie down in the short dry grass beside the goose it be bright moonlight that night so bright that it be difficult for the boy to go to sleep he lay there and think about just how long he have be away from home and he figure out that it be three week since he have start on the trip at the same time he remember that this be easter-eve it be to-night that all the witch come home from blakulla think he and laugh to himself for he be just a little afraid of both the sea-nymph and the elf but he do not believe in witch the least little bit if there have be any witch out that night he should have see they to be sure it be so light in the heaven that not the tiniest black speck could move in the air without he see it while the boy lay there with he nose in the air and think about this he eye rest on something lovely the moon 's disc be whole and round and rather high and over it a big bird come fly he do not fly past the moon but he move just as though he might have fly out from it the bird look black against the light background and the wing extend from one rim of the disc to the other he fly on evenly in the same direction and the boy think that he be paint on the moon 's disc the body be small the neck long and slender the leg hang down long and thin it could not be anything but a stork a couple of seconds later herr ermenrich the stork light beside the boy he bent down and poke he with he bill to awaken he instantly the boy sit up i be not asleep herr ermenrich he say how do it happen that you be out in the middle of the night and how be everything at glimminge castle do you want to speak with mother akka it be too light to sleep to-night answer herr ermenrich therefore i conclude to travel over here to karl 's island and hunt you up friend thumbietot i learn from the seamew that you be spend the night here i have not as yet move over to glimminge castle but be still live at pommern the boy be simply overjoy to think that herr ermenrich have seek he out they chat about all sort of thing like old friend at last the stork ask the boy if he would not like to go out ride for a while on this beautiful night oh yes that the boy want to do if the stork would manage it so that he get back to the wild goose before sunrise this he promise so off they go again herr ermenrich fly straight toward the moon they rise and rise the sea sink deep down but the flight go so light and easy that it seem almost as if the boy lay still in the air when herr ermenrich begin to descend the boy think that the flight have last a unreasonably short time they land on a desolate bit of seashore which be cover with fine even sand all along the coast run a row of flying-sand drift with lyme-grass on they top they be not very high but they prevent the boy from see any of the island herr ermenrich stand on a sand-hill draw up one leg and bent he head backward so he could stick he bill under the wing you can roam around on the shore for a while he say to thumbietot while i rest myself but do not go so far away but what you can find you way back to I again to start with the boy intend to climb a sand-hill and see how the land behind it look but when he have walk a couple of pace he stub the toe of he wooden shoe against something hard he stoop down and see that a small copper coin lay on the sand and be so worn with verdigris that it be almost transparent it be so poor that he do not even bother to pick it up but only kick it out of the way but when he straighten himself up once more he be perfectly astounded for two pace away from he stand a high dark wall with a big turreted gate the moment before when the boy bent down the sea lay there -- shimmering and smooth while now it be hide by a long wall with tower and battlements directly in front of he where before there have be only a few sea-weed bank the big gate of the wall open the boy probably understand that it be a spectre-play of some sort but this be nothing to be afraid of thought he it be not any dangerous troll or any other evil -- such as he always dread to encounter at night both the wall and the gate be so beautifully construct that he only desire to see what there might be back of they i must find out what this can be think he and go in through the gate in the deep archway there be guard dress in brocaded and purr suit with long-handled spear beside they who sit and throw dice they think only of the game and take no notice of the boy who hurry past they quickly just within the gate he find a open space pave with large even stone block all around this be high and magnificent building and between these open long narrow street on the square -- face the gate -- it fairly swarm with human being the man wear long fur-trimmed cape over satin suit plume-bedecked hat sit obliquely on they head on they chest hang superb chain they be all so regally get up that the whole lot of they might have be king the woman go about in high head-dress and long robe with tight-fitting sleeve they too be beautifully dress but they splendor be not to be compare with that of the man this be exactly like the old story-book which mother take from the chest -- only once -- and show to he the boy simply could not believe he eye but that which be even more wonderful to look upon than either the man or the woman be the city itself every house be build in such a way that a gable face the street and the gable be so highly ornamented that one could believe they wish to compete with each other as to which one could show the most beautiful decoration when one suddenly see so much that be new he can not manage to treasure it all in he memory but at least the boy could recall that he have see stairway gable on the various landing which bear image of the christ and he apostle gable where there be image in niche after niche all along the wall gable that be inlay with multi-coloured bit of glass and gable that be striped and check with white and black marble as the boy admire all this a sudden sense of haste come over he anything like this my eye have never see before anything like this they would never see again he say to himself and he begin to run in toward the city -- up one street and down another the street be straight and narrow but not empty and gloomy as they be in the city with which he be familiar there be people everywhere old woman sit by they open door and spin without a spinning-wheel -- only with the help of a shuttle the merchant ' shop be like market-stall -- open on the street all the hand-worker do they work out of door in one place they be boil crude oil in another tanning hide in a third there be a long rope-walk if only the boy have have time enough he could have learn how to make all sort of thing here he see how armourer hammer out thin breast-plate how turner tend they iron how the shoemaker sole soft red shoe how the gold-wire drawer twist gold thread and how the weaver insert silver and gold into they weave but the boy do not have the time to stay he just rush on so that he could manage to see as much as possible before it would all vanish again the high wall run all around the city and shut it in as a hedge shut in a field he see it at the end of every street -- gable-ornamented and crenelated on the top of the wall walk warrior in shine armor and when he have run from one end of the city to the other he come to still another gate in the wall outside of this lay the sea and harbor the boy see olden-time ship with rowing-bench straight across and high structure fore and aft some lay and take on cargo other be just cast anchor carrier and merchant hurry around each other all over it be life and bustle but not even here do he seem to have the time to linger he rush into the city again and now he come up to the big square there stand the cathedral with its three high tower and deep vaulted arch fill with image the wall have be so highly decorate by sculptor that there be not a stone without its own special ornamentation and what a magnificent display of gilded cross and gold-trimmed altar and priest in golden vestment shimmer through the open gate directly opposite the church there be a house with a notch roof and a single slender sky-high tower that be probably the courthouse and between the courthouse and the cathedral all around the square stand the beautiful gabled house with they multiplicity of adornment the boy have run himself both warm and tired he think that now he have see the most remarkable thing and therefore he begin to walk more leisurely the street which he have turn into now be surely the one where the inhabitant purchase they fine clothing he see crowd of people stand before the little stall where the merchant spread brocade stiff satin heavy gold cloth shimmery velvet delicate veiling and lace as sheer as a spider 's web before when the boy run so fast no one have pay any attention to he the people must have think that it be only a little gray rat that dart by they but now when he walk down the street very slowly one of the salesman catch sight of he and begin to beckon to he at first the boy be uneasy and want to hurry out of the way but the salesman only beckon and smile and spread out on the counter a lovely piece of satin damask as if he want to tempt he the boy shake he head i will never be so rich that i can buy even a metre of that cloth think he but now they have catch sight of he in every stall all along the street wherever he look stand a salesman and beckon to he they leave they costly wares and think only of he he see how they hurry into the most hidden corner of the stall to fetch the best that they have to sell and how they hand tremble with eagerness and haste as they lay it upon the counter when the boy continue to go on one of the merchant jump over the counter catch hold of he and spread before he silver cloth and weave tapestry which shine with brilliant color the boy could not do anything but laugh at he the salesman certainly must understand that a poor little creature like he could not buy such thing he stand still and hold out he two empty hand so they would understand that he have nothing and let he go in peace but the merchant raise a finger and nod and push the whole pile of beautiful thing over to he can he mean that he will sell all this for a gold piece wonder the boy the merchant bring out a tiny worn and poor coin -- the smallest that one could see -- and show it to he and he be so eager to sell that he increase he pile with a pair of large heavy silver goblet then the boy begin to dig down in he pocket he know of course that he do not possess a single coin but he could not help feeling for it all the other merchant stand still and try to see how the sale would come off and when they observe that the boy begin to search in he pocket they fling themselves over the counter fill they hand full of gold and silver ornament and offer they to he and they all show he that what they ask in payment be just one little penny but the boy turn both vest and breeches pocket inside out so they should see that he own nothing then tear fill the eye of all these regal merchant who be so much richer than he at last he be move because they look so distressed and he ponder if he could not in some way help they and then he happen to think of the rusty coin which he have but lately see on the strand he start to run down the street and luck be with he so that he come to the self-same gate which he have happen upon first he dash through it and commence to search for the little green copper penny which lay on the strand a while ago he find it too very promptly but when he have pick it up and want to run back to the city with it -- he see only the sea before he no city wall no gate no sentinel no street no house could now be see -- only the sea the boy could not help that the tear come to he eye he have believe in the begin that that which he see be nothing but a hallucination but this he have already forget he only think about how pretty everything be he feel a genuine deep sorrow because the city have vanish that moment herr ermenrich awake and come up to he but he do not hear he and the stork have to poke the boy with he bill to attract attention to himself i believe that you stand here and sleep just as i do say herr ermenrich oh herr ermenrich say the boy what be that city which stand here just now have you see a city say the stork you have sleep and dream as i say no i have not dream say thumbietot and he tell the stork all that he have experience then herr ermenrich say : for my part thumbietot i believe that you fall asleep here on the strand and dream all this but i will not conceal from you that bataki the raven who be the most learn of all bird once tell I that in former time there be a city on this shore call vineta it be so rich and so fortunate that no city have ever be more glorious but its inhabitant unluckily give themselves up to arrogance and love of display as a punishment for this say bataki the city of vineta be overtake by a flood and sink into the sea but its inhabitant can not die neither be they city destroy and one night in every hundred year it rise in all its splendor up from the sea and remain on the surface just one hour yes it must be so say thumbietot for this i have see but when the hour be up it sink again into the sea if during that time no merchant in vineta have sell anything to a single living creature if you thumbietot only have have a ever so tiny coin to pay the merchant vineta might have remain up here on the shore and its people could have live and die like other human being herr ermenrich say the boy now i understand why you come and fetch I in the middle of the night it be because you believe that i should be able to save the old city i be so sorry it do not turn out as you wish herr ermenrich he cover he face with he hand and weep it be not easy to say which one look the more disconsolate -- the boy or herr ermenrich the live city _ Monday April eleventh _ on the afternoon of easter Monday the wild goose and thumbietot be on the wing they travel over gottland the large island lay smooth and even beneath they the ground be check just as it be in skåne and there be many church and farm but there be this difference however that there be more leafy meadow between the field here and then the farm be not build up with small house and there be no large manor with ancient tower-ornamented castle the wild goose have take the route over gottland on account of thumbietot he have be altogether unlike himself for two day and have not speak a cheerful word this be because he have think of nothing but that city which have appear to he in such a strange way he have never see anything so magnificent and royal and he could not be reconcile with himself for have fail to save it usually he be not chicken-hearted but now he actually grieve for the beautiful building and the stately people both akka and the goosey-gander try to convince thumbietot that he have be the victim of a dream or a hallucination but the boy would not listen to anything of that sort he be so positive that he have really see what he have see that no one could move he from this conviction he go about so disconsolate that he travel companion become uneasy for he just as the boy be the most depressed old kaksus come back to the flock she have be blow toward gottland and have be compel to travel over the whole island before she have learn through some crow that she comrade be on little karl 's island when kaksus find out what be wrong with thumbietot she say impulsively : if thumbietot be grieve over a old city we 'll soon be able to comfort he just come along and i 'll take you to a place that i see yesterday you will not need to be distressed very long thereupon the goose have take farewell of the sheep and be on they way to the place which kaksi wish to show thumbietot as blue as he be he could not keep from look at the land over which he travel as usual he think it look as though the whole island have in the beginning be just such a high steep cliff as karl 's island -- though much bigger of course but afterward it have in some way be flatten out someone have take a big rolling-pin and roll over it as if it have be a lump of dough not that the island have become altogether flat and even like a bread-cake for it be not like that while they have travel along the coast he have see white lime wall with grotto and crag in several direction but in most of the place they be level and sink inconspicuously down toward the sea in gottland they have a pleasant and peaceful holiday afternoon it turn out to be mild spring weather the tree have large bud spring blossom dress the ground in the leafy meadow the poplar ' long thin pendant sway and in the little garden which one find around every cottage the gooseberry bush be green the warmth and the spring-budding have tempt the people out into the garden and road and wherever a number of they be gather together they be play it be not the child alone who play but the grown-up also they be throw stone at a give point and they throw ball in the air with such exact aim that they almost touch the wild goose it look cheerful and pleasant to see big folk at play and the boy certainly would have enjoy it if he have be able to forget he grief because he have fail to save the city anyway he have to admit that this be a lovely trip there be so much singing and sound in the air little child play ring game and sing as they play the salvation army be out he see a lot of people dress in black and red -- sit upon a wooded hill playing on guitar and brass instrument on one road come a great crowd of people they be good templar who have be on a pleasure trip he recognize they by the big banner with the gold inscription which wave above they they sing song after song as long as he could hear they after that the boy could never think of gottland without thinking of the game and song at the same time he have be sit and look down for a long while but now he happen to raise he eye no one can describe he amazement before he be aware of it the wild goose have leave the interior of the island and go westward -- toward the sea-coast now the wide blue sea lay before he however it be not the sea that be remarkable but a city which appear on the sea-shore the boy come from the east and the sun have just begin to go down in the west when he come nearer the city its wall and tower and high gabled house and church stand there perfectly black against the light evening sky he could not see therefore what it really look like and for a couple of moment he believe that this city be just as beautiful as the one he have see on easter night when he get right up to it he see that it be both like and unlike that city from the bottom of the sea there be the same contrast between they as there be between a man whom one see array in purple and jewel one day and on another day one see he dress in rag yes this city have probably once upon a time be like the one which he sit and think about this one also be enclose by a wall with tower and gate but the tower in this city which have be allow to remain on land be roofless hollow and empty the gate be without door sentinel and warrior have disappear all the glitter splendor be go there be nothing left but the naked gray stone skeleton when the boy come farther into the city he see that the larger part of it be make up of small low house but here and there be still a few high gabled house and a few cathedral which be from the olden time the wall of the gabled house be whitewashed and entirely without ornamentation but because the boy have so lately see the bury city he seem to understand how they have be decorate : some with statue and other with black and white marble and it be the same with the old cathedral the majority of they be roofless with bare interior the window opening be empty the floor be grass-grown and ivy clamber along the wall but now he know how they have look at one time that they have be cover with image and painting that the chancel have have trim altar and gilded cross and that they priest have move about array in gold vestment the boy saw also the narrow street which be almost desert on holiday afternoon he know he do what a stream of stately people have once upon a time saunter about on they he know that they have be like large workshop -- fill with all sort of workman but that which nil holgersson do not see be that the city -- even to-day -- be both beautiful and remarkable he see neither the cheery cottage on the side street with they black wall and white bow and red pelargonium behind the shine window-pane nor the many pretty garden and avenue nor the beauty in the weed-clad ruin he eye be so fill with the precede glory that he could not see anything good in the present the wild goose fly back and forth over the city a couple of time so that thumbietot might see everything finally they sink down on the grass-grown floor of a cathedral ruin to spend the night when they have arrange themselves for sleep thumbietot be still awake and look up through the open arch to the pale pink evening sky when he have be sit there a while he think he do not want to grieve any more because he could not save the bury city no that he do not want to do now that he have see this one if that city which he have see have not sink into the sea again then it would perhaps become as dilapidated as this one in a little while perhaps it could not have withstand time and decay but would have stand there with roofless church and bare house and desolate empty street -- just like this one then it be better that it should remain in all its glory down in the deep it be best that it happen as it happen think he if i have the power to save the city i do not believe that i should care to do it then he no longer grieve over that matter and there be probably many among the young who think in the same way but when people be old and have become accustomed to be satisfy with little then they be more happy over the visby that exist than over a magnificent vineta at the bottom of the sea the legend of småland _ Tuesday April twelfth _ the wild goose have make a good trip over the sea and have light in tjust township in northern småland that township do not seem able to make up its mind whether it want to be land or sea fiord run in everywhere and cut the land up into island and peninsula and point and cape the sea be so forceful that the only thing which could hold themselves above it be hill and mountain all the lowland be hide away under the water exterior it be evening when the wild goose come in from the sea and the land with the little hill lay prettily between the shimmering fiord here and there on the island the boy see cabin and cottage and the farther inland he come the bigger and better become the dwelling house finally they grow into large white manor along the shore there be generally a border of tree and within this lay field-plot and on the top of the little hill there be tree again he could not help but think of blekinge here again be a place where land and sea meet in such a pretty and peaceful sort of way just as if they try to show each other the best and loveliest which they possess the wild goose alight upon a limestone island a good way in on goose-fiord with the first glance at the shore they observe that spring have make rapid stride while they have be away on the island the big fine tree be not as yet leaf-clad but the ground under they be brocade with white anemone gagea and blue anemone when the wild goose see the flower-carpet they fear that they have linger too long in the southern part of the country akka say instantly that there be no time in which to hunt up any of the stop place in småland by the next morning they must travel northward over östergötland the boy should then see nothing of småland and this grieve he he have hear more about småland than he have about any other province and he have long to see it with he own eye the summer before when he have serve as goose-boy with a farmer in the neighborhood of jordberga he have meet a pair of småland child almost every day who also tend goose these child have irritated he terribly with they småland it be not fair to say that osa the goose-girl have annoyed he she be much too wise for that but the one who could be aggravate with a vengeance be she brother little mat have you hear nil goose-boy how it go when småland and skåne be create he would ask and if nil holgersson say no he begin immediately to relate the old joke-legend well it be at that time when we lord be create the world while he be do he best work saint peter come walk by he stop and look on and then he ask if it be hard to do ` well it be not exactly easy ' say we lord saint peter stand there a little longer and when he notice how easy it be to lay out one landscape after another he too want to try he hand at it ` perhaps you need to rest yourself a little ' say saint peter ' i could attend to the work in the meantime for you ' but this we lord do not wish ' i do not know if you be so much at home in this art that i can trust you to take hold where i leave off ' he answer then saint peter be angry and say that he believe he could create just as fine country as we lord himself it happen that we lord be just then create småland it be not even half-ready but it look as though it would be a indescribably pretty and fertile land it be difficult for we lord to say no to saint peter and aside from this he think very likely that a thing so well begin no one could spoil therefore he say : if you like we will prove which one of we two understand this sort of work the better you who be only a novice shall go on with this which i have begin and i will create a new land ' to this saint peter agree at once and so they go to work -- each one in he place we lord move southward a bit and there he undertake to create skåne it be not long before he be through with it and soon he ask if saint peter have finish and would come and look at he work ' i have mine ready long ago ' say saint peter and from the sound of he voice it could be hear how pleased he be with what he have accomplish when saint peter see skåne he have to acknowledge that there be nothing but good to be say of that land it be a fertile land and easy to cultivate with wide plain wherever one look and hardly a sign of hill it be evident that we lord have really contemplated make it such that people should feel at home there ` yes this be a good country ' say saint peter ` but i think that mine be better ' ` then we 'll take a look at it ' say we lord the land be already finish in the north and east when saint peter begin the work but the southern and western part and the whole interior he have create all by himself now when we lord come up there where saint peter have be at work he be so horrify that he stop short and exclaim : ` what on earth have you be do with this land saint peter ' saint peter too stand and look around -- perfectly astonished he have have the idea that nothing could be so good for a land as a great deal of warmth therefore he have gather together a enormous mass of stone and mountain and erect a highland and this he have do so that it should be near the sun and receive much help from the sun 's heat over the stone-heap he have spread a thin layer of soil and then he have think that everything be well arrange but while he be down in skåne a couple of heavy shower have come up and more be not need to show what he work amount to when we lord come to inspect the land all the soil have be wash away and the naked mountain foundation shine forth all over where it be about the best lay clay and heavy gravel over the rock but it look so poor that it be easy to understand that hardly anything except spruce and juniper and moss and heather could grow there but what there be plenty of be water it have fill up all the cleft in the mountain and lake and river and brook these one saw everywhere to say nothing of swamp and morass which spread over large tract and the most exasperating thing of all be that while some tract have too much water it be so scarce in other that whole field lay like dry moor where sand and earth whirl up in cloud with the least little breeze ` what can have be you meaning in create such a land as this ' say we lord saint peter make excuse and declare he have wish to build up a land so high that it should have plenty of warmth from the sun ` but then you will also get much of the night chill ' say we lord ` for that too come from heaven i be very much afraid the little that can grow here will freeze ' this to be sure saint peter have not think about ` yes here it will be a poor and frost-bound land ' say we lord ` it can not be help ' when little mat have get this far in he story osa the goose-girl protest : i can not bear little mat to hear you say that it be so miserable in småland say she you forget entirely how much good soil there be there only think of möre district by kalmar sound i wonder where you 'll find a richer grain region there be field upon field just like here in skåne the soil be so good that i can not imagine anything that could not grow there i can not help that say little mat i be only relate what other have say before and i have hear many say that there be not a more beautiful coast land than tjust think of the bay and islet and the manor and the grove say osa yes that be true enough little mat admit and do not you remember continued osa the school teacher say that such a lively and picturesque district as that bit of småland which lie south of lake vettern be not to be find in all sweden think of the beautiful sea and the yellow coast-mountain and of grenna and jönköping with its match factory and think of huskvarna and all the big establishment there yes that be true enough say little mat once again and think of visingsö little mat with the ruin and the oak forest and the legend think of the valley through which emån flow with all the village and flour-mill and sawmill and the carpenter shop yes that be true enough say little mat and look trouble all of a sudden he have look up now we be pretty stupid say he all this of course lie in we lord 's småland in that part of the land which be already finish when saint peter undertake the job it be only natural that it should be pretty and fine there but in saint peter 's småland it look as it say in the legend and it be not surprising that we lord be distressed when he see it continue little mat as he take up the thread of he story again saint peter do not lose he courage at all event but try to comfort we lord ` do not be so grieve over this ' say he ` only wait until i have create people who can till the swamp and break up field from the stone hill ' that be the end of we lord 's patience -- and he say : ` no you can go down to skåne and make the skåninge but the smålander i will create myself ' and so we lord create the smålander and make he quick-witted and contented and happy and thrifty and enterprising and capable that he might be able to get he livelihood in he poor country then little mat be silent and if nil holgersson have also keep still all would have go well but he could not possibly refrain from ask how saint peter have succeed in create the skåninge well what do you think yourself say little mat and look so scornful that nil holgersson throw himself upon he to thrash he but mat be only a little tot and osa the goose-girl who be a year older than he run forward instantly to help he good-natured though she be she spring like a lion as soon as anyone touch she brother and nil holgersson do not care to fight a girl but turn he back and do not look at those småland child for the rest of the day the crow the earthen crock in the southwest corner of småland lie a township call sonnerbo it be a rather smooth and even country and one who see it in winter when it be cover with snow can not imagine that there be anything under the snow but garden-plot rye-field and clover-meadow as be generally the case in flat country but in the beginning of April when the snow finally melt away in sonnerbo it be apparent that that which lie hide under it be only dry sandy heath bare rock and big marshy swamp there be field here and there to be sure but they be so small that they be scarcely worth mention and one also find a few little red or gray farmhouse hide away in some beech-coppice -- almost as if they be afraid to show themselves where sonnerbo township touch the boundary of halland there be a sandy heath which be so far-reaching that he who stand upon one edge of it can not look across to the other nothing except heather grow on the heath and it would not be easy either to coax other growth to thrive there to start with one would have to uproot the heather for it be thus with heather : although it have only a little shrunken root small shrunken branch and dry shrunken leave it fancy that it be a tree therefore it act just like real tree -- spread itself out in forest fashion over wide area hold together faithfully and cause all foreign growth that wish to crowd in upon its territory to die out the only place on the heath where the heather be not all-powerful be a low stony ridge which pass over it there you 'll find juniper bush mountain ash and a few large fine oak at the time when nil holgersson travel around with the wild goose a little cabin stand there with a bit of clear ground around it but the people who have live there at one time have for some reason or other move away the little cabin be empty and the ground lay unused when the tenant leave the cabin they close the damper fasten the window-hook and lock the door but no one have think of the broken window-pane which be only stuff with a rag after the shower of a couple of summer the rag have mould and shrink and finally a crow have succeed in poke it out the ridge on the heather-heath be really not as desolate as one might think for it be inhabit by a large crow-folk naturally the crow do not live there all the year round they move to foreign land in the winter in the autumn they travel from one grain-field to another all over götaland and pick grain during the summer they spread themselves over the farm in sonnerbo township and live upon egg and berry and birdling but every spring when nesting time come they come back to the heather-heath the one who have poke the rag from the window be a crow-cock name garm whitefeather but he be never call anything but fumle or drumle or out and out fumle-drumle because he always act awkwardly and stupidly and be not good for anything except to make fun of fumle-drumle be bigger and stronger than any of the other crow but that do not help he in the least he be -- and remain -- a butt for ridicule and it do not profit he either that he come from very good stock if everything have go smoothly he should have be leader for the whole flock because this honor have from time immemorial belong to the oldest whitefeather but long before fumle-drumle be bear the power have go from he family and be now wield by a cruel wild crow name wind-rush this transference of power be due to the fact that the crow on crow-ridge desire to change they manner of live possibly there be many who think that everything in the shape of crow life in the same way but this be not so there be entire crow-folk who lead honorable life -- that be to say they only eat grain worm caterpillar and dead animal and there be other who lead a regular bandit 's life who throw themselves upon baby-hare and small bird and plunder every single bird 's nest they set eye on the ancient whitefeather have be strict and temperate and as long as they have lead the flock the crow have be compel to conduct themselves in such a way that other bird could speak no ill of they but the crow be numerous and poverty be great among they they do not care to go the whole length of live a strictly moral life so they rebel against the whitefeather and give the power to wind-rush who be the worst nest-plunderer and robber that could be imagine -- if he wife wind-air be not worse still under they government the crow have begin to lead such a life that now they be more fear than pigeon-hawk and leech-owl naturally fumle-drumle have nothing to say in the flock the crow be all of the opinion that he do not in the least take after he forefather and that he would not suit as a leader no one would have mention he if he have not constantly commit fresh blunder a few who be quite sensible sometimes say perhaps it be lucky for fumle-drumle that he be such a bungling idiot otherwise wind-rush and wind-air would hardly have allow he -- who be of the old chieftain stock -- to remain with the flock now on the other hand they be rather friendly toward he and willingly take he along with they on they hunting expedition there all could observe how much more skilful and daring they be than he none of the crow know that it be fumle-drumle who have peck the rag out of the window and have they know of this they would have be very much astonished such a thing as daring to approach a human being 's dwelling they have never believe of he he keep the thing to himself very carefully and he have he own good reason for it wind-rush always treat he well in the daytime and when the other be around but one very dark night when the comrade sit on the night branch he be attack by a couple of crow and nearly murder after that he move every night after dark from he usual sleep quarter into the empty cabin now one afternoon when the crow have put they nest in order on crow-ridge they happen upon a remarkable find wind-rush fumle-drumle and a couple of other have fly down into a big hollow in one corner of the heath the hollow be nothing but a gravel-pit but the crow could not be satisfy with such a simple explanation they fly down in it continually and turn every single sand-grain to get at the reason why human being have dig it while the crow be potter around down there a mass of gravel fall from one side they rush up to it and have the good fortune to find amongst the fall stone and stubble -- a large earthen crock which be lock with a wooden clasp naturally they want to know if there be anything in it and they try both to peck hole in the crock and to bend up the clasp but they have no success they stand perfectly helpless and examine the crock when they hear someone say : shall i come down and assist you crow they glance up quickly on the edge of the hollow sit a fox and blink down at they he be one of the prettiest fox -- both in color and form -- that they have ever see the only fault with he be that he have lose a ear if you desire to do we a service say wind-rush we shall not say nay at the same time both he and the other fly up from the hollow then the fox jump down in they place bit at the jar and pull at the lock -- but he could not open it either can you make out what there be in it say wind-rush the fox roll the jar back and forth and listen attentively it must be silver money say he this be more than the crow have expect do you think it can be silver say they and they eye be ready to pop out of they head with greed for remarkable as it may sound there be nothing in the world which crow love as much as silver money hear how it rattle say the fox and roll the crock around once more only i can not understand how we shall get at it that will surely be impossible say the crow the fox stand and rub he head against he left leg and ponder now perhaps he might succeed with the help of the crow in become master of that little imp who always elude he oh i know someone who could open the crock for you say the fox then tell we tell we cry the crow and they be so excited that they tumble down into the pit that i will do if you 'll first promise I that you will agree to my term say he then the fox tell the crow about thumbietot and say that if they could bring he to the heath he would open the crock for they but in payment for this counsel he demand that they should deliver thumbietot to he as soon as he have get the silver money for they the crow have no reason to spare thumbietot so agree to the compact at once it be easy enough to agree to this but it be harder to find out where thumbietot and the wild goose be stop wind-rush himself travel away with fifty crow and say that he should soon return but one day after another pass without the crow on crow-ridge see a shadow of he kidnap by crow _ Wednesday April thirteenth _ the wild goose be up at daybreak so they should have time to get themselves a bite of food before start out on the journey toward östergötland the island in goosefiord where they have sleep be small and barren but in the water all around it be growth which they could eat they fill upon it be worse for the boy however he could not manage to find anything eatable as he stand there hungry and drowsy and look around in all direction he glance fall upon a pair of squirrel who play upon the wooded point directly opposite the rock island he wonder if the squirrel still have any of they winter supplies leave and ask the white goosey-gander to take he over to the point that he might beg they for a couple of hazelnut instantly the white one swam across the sound with he but as luck would have it the squirrel have so much fun chase each other from tree to tree that they do not bother about listen to the boy they draw farther into the grove he hurry after they and be soon out of the goosey-gander 's sight -- who stay behind and wait on the shore the boy wade forward between some white anemone-stem -- which be so high they reach to he chin -- when he feel that someone catch hold of he from behind and try to lift he up he turn round and see that a crow have grab he by the shirt-band he try to break loose but before this be possible another crow run up grip he by the stock and knock he over if nil holgersson have immediately cry for help the white goosey-gander certainly would have be able to save he but the boy probably think that he could protect himself unaided against a couple of crow he kick and strike out but the crow do not let go they hold and they soon succeed in raise themselves into the air with he to make matter worse they fly so recklessly that he head strike against a branch he receive a hard knock over the head it grow black before he eye and he lose consciousness when he open he eye once more he find himself high above the ground he regain he sens slowly at first he know neither where he be nor what he see when he glance down he see that under he be spread a tremendously big woolly carpet which be weave in green and red and in large irregular pattern the carpet be very thick and fine but he think it be a pity that it have be so badly use it be actually ragged long tear run through it in some place large piece be tear away and the strangest of all be that it appear to be spread over a mirror floor for under the hole and tear in the carpet shone bright and glittering glass the next thing the boy observe be that the sun unrolled itself in the heaven instantly the mirror-glass under the hole and tear in the carpet begin to shimmer in red and gold it look very gorgeous and the boy be delighted with the pretty colour-scheme although he do not exactly understand what it be that he see but now the crow descend and he see at once that the big carpet under he be the earth which be dress in green and brown cone-tree and naked leaf-tree and that the hole and tear be shine fiord and little lake he remember that the first time he have travel up in the air he have think that the earth in skåne look like a piece of check cloth but this country which resemble a tear carpet -- what might this be he begin to ask himself a lot of question why be not he sit on the goosey-gander 's back why do a great swarm of crow fly around he and why be he be pull and knock hither and thither so that he be about to break to piece then all at once the whole thing dawn on he he have be kidnap by a couple of crow the white goosey-gander be still on the shore wait and to-day the wild goose be go to travel to östergötland he be be carry southwest this he understand because the sun 's disc be behind he the big forest-carpet which lay beneath he be surely småland what will become of the goosey-gander now when i can not look after he think the boy and begin to call to the crow to take he back to the wild goose instantly he be not at all uneasy on he own account he believe that they be carry he off simply in a spirit of mischief the crow do not pay the slightest attention to he exhortation but fly on as fast as they could after a bit one of they flap he wing in a manner which mean : look out danger soon thereafter they come down in a spruce forest push they way between prickly branch to the ground and put the boy down under a thick spruce where he be so well conceal that not even a falcon could have sight he fifty crow surround he with bill point toward he to guard he now perhaps i may hear crow what you purpose be in carry I off say he but he be hardly permit to finish the sentence before a big crow hiss at he : keep still or i 'll bear you eye out it be evident that the crow mean what she say and there be nothing for the boy to do but obey so he sit there and stare at the crow and the crow stare at he the longer he look at they the less he like they it be dreadful how dusty and unkempt they feather dress be -- as though they know neither bath nor oil they toe and claw be grimy with dried-in mud and the corner of they mouth be cover with food dripping these be very different bird from the wild goose -- that he observe he think they have a cruel sneaky watchful and bold appearance just like cut-throat and vagabond it be certainly a real robber-band that i have fall in with thought he just then he hear the wild goose 's call above he where be you here be i where be you here be i he understand that akka and the other have go out to search for he but before he could answer they the big crow who appear to be the leader of the band hiss in he ear : think of you eye and there be nothing else for he to do but to keep still the wild goose may not have know that he be so near they but have just happen incidentally to travel over this forest he hear they call a couple of time more then it die away well now you 'll have to get along by yourself nil holgersson he say to himself now you must prove whether you have learn anything during these week in the open a moment later the crow give the signal to break up and since it be still they intention apparently to carry he along in such a way that one hold on to he shirt-band and one to a stock the boy say : be there not one among you so strong that he can carry I on he back you have already travel so badly with I that i feel as if i be in piece only let I ride i 'll not jump from the crow 's back that i promise you oh you need not think that we care how you have it say the leader but now the largest of the crow -- a dishevelled and uncouth one who have a white feather in he wing -- come forward and say : it would certainly be best for all of we wind-rush if thumbietot get there whole rather than half and therefore i shall carry he on my back if you can do it fumle-drumle i have no objection say wind-rush but do not lose he with this much be already gain and the boy actually feel pleased again there be nothing to be gain by lose my grit because i have be kidnap by the crow think he i 'll surely be able to manage those poor little thing the crow continue to fly southwest over småland it be a glorious morning -- sunny and calm and the bird down on the earth be sing they best love song in a high dark forest sit the thrush himself with droop wing and swell throat and strike up tune after tune how pretty you be how pretty you be how pretty you be sing he no one be so pretty no one be so pretty no one be so pretty as soon as he have finish this song he begin it all over again but just then the boy ride over the forest and when he have hear the song a couple of time and mark that the thrush know no other he put both hand up to he mouth as a speaking trumpet and call down : we have hear all this before we have hear all this before who be it who be it who be it who make fun of I ask the thrush and try to catch a glimpse of the one who call it be kidnapped-by-crow who make fun of you song answer the boy at that the crow-chief turn he head and say : be careful of you eye thumbietot but the boy think oh i do not care about that i want to show you that i be not afraid of you farther and farther inland they travel and there be wood and lake everywhere in a birch-grove sit the wood-dove on a naked branch and before he stand the lady-dove he blow up he feather cock he head raise and lower he body until the breast-feather rattle against the branch all the while he coo : thou thou thou art the loveliest in all the forest no one in the forest be so lovely as thou thou thou but up in the air the boy ride past and when he hear mr dive he could not keep still do not you believe he do not you believe he cry he who who who be it that lie about I coo mr dive and try to get a sight of the one who shriek at he it be caught-by-crows that lie about you reply the boy again wind-rush turn he head toward the boy and command he to shut up but fumle-drumle who be carry he say : let he chatter then all the little bird will think that we crow have become quick-witted and funny bird oh they be not such fool either say wind-rush but he like the idea just the same for after that he let the boy call out as much as he like they fly mostly over forest and woodland but there be church and parish and little cabin in the outskirts of the forest in one place they see a pretty old manor it lay with the forest back of it and the sea in front of it have red wall and a turreted roof great sycamore about the grounds and big thick gooseberry-bush in the orchard on the top of the weathercock sit the starling and sing so loud that every note be hear by the wife who sit on a egg in the heart of a pear tree we have four pretty little egg sing the starling we have four pretty little round egg we have the whole nest fill with fine egg when the starling sing the song for the thousandth time the boy ride over the place he put he hand up to he mouth as a pipe and call : the magpie will get they the magpie will get they who be it that want to frighten I ask the starling and flap he wing uneasily it be captured-by-crows that frighten you say the boy this time the crow-chief do not attempt to hush he up instead both he and he flock be have so much fun that they caw with satisfaction the farther inland they come the larger be the lake and the more plentiful be the island and point and on a lake-shore stand a drake and kowtow before the duck i 'll be true to you all the day of my life i 'll be true to you all the day of my life say the drake it will not last until the summer 's end shriek the boy who be you call the drake my name 's stolen-by-crow shriek the boy at dinner time the crow light in a food-grove they walk about and procure food for themselves but none of they think about give the boy anything then fumle-drumle come ride up to the chief with a dog-rose branch with a few dry bud on it here be something for you wind-rush say he this be pretty food and suitable for you wind-rush sniff contemptuously do you think that i want to eat old dry bud say he and i who think that you would be please with they say fumle-drumle and throw away the dog-rose branch as if in despair but it fall right in front of the boy and he be not slow about grab it and eat until he be satisfy when the crow have eat they begin to chatter what be you think about wind-rush you be so quiet to-day say one of they to the leader i be think that in this district there live once upon a time a hen who be very fond of she mistress and in order to really please she she go and lay a nest full of egg which she hide under the store-house floor the mistress of the house wonder of course where the hen be keep herself such a long time she search for she but do not find she can you guess longbill who it be that find she and the egg i think i can guess it wind-rush but when you have tell about this i will tell you something like it do you remember the big black cat in hinneryd 's parish house she be dissatisfied because they always take the new-born kitten from she and drown they just once do she succeed in keep they conceal and that be when she have lay they in a haystack out door she be pretty well pleased with those young kitten but i believe that i get more pleasure out of they than she do now they become so excited that they all talk at once what kind of a accomplishment be that -- to steal little kitten say one i once chase a young hare who be almost full-grown that mean to follow he from covert to covert he get no further before another take the word from he it may be fun perhaps to annoy hen and cat but i find it still more remarkable that a crow can worry a human be i once steal a silver spoon -- but now the boy think he be too good to sit and listen to such gabble now listen to I you crow say he i think you ought to be ashamed of yourselve to talk about all you wickedness i have live amongst wild goose for three week and of they i have never hear or see anything but good you must have a bad chief since he permit you to rob and murder in this way you ought to begin to lead new life for i can tell you that human being have grow so tired of you wickedness they be try with all they might to root you out and then there will soon be a end of you when wind-rush and the crow hear this they be so furious that they intend to throw themselves upon he and tear he in piece but fumle-drumle laugh and caw and stand in front of he oh no no say he and seem absolutely terrify what think you that wind-air will say if you tear thumbietot in piece before he have get that silver money for we it have to be you fumle-drumle that be afraid of women-folk say rush but at any rate both he and the other leave thumbietot in peace shortly after that the crow go further until now the boy think that småland be not such a poor country as he have hear of course it be woody and full of mountain-ridge but alongside the island and lake lay cultivate grounds and any real desolation he have not come upon but the farther inland they come the fewer be the village and cottage toward the last he think that he be ride over a veritable wilderness where he see nothing but swamp and heath and juniper-hill the sun have go down but it be still perfect daylight when the crow reach the large heather-heath wind-rush send a crow on ahead to say that he have meet with success and when it be know wind-air with several hundred crow from crow-ridge fly to meet the arrival in the midst of the deafening cawing which the crow emit fumle-drumle say to the boy : you have be so comical and so jolly during the trip that i be really fond of you therefore i want to give you some good advice as soon as we light you 'll be request to do a bit of work which may seem very easy to you but beware of do it soon thereafter fumle-drumle put nil holgersson down in the bottom of a sandpit the boy fling himself down roll over and lay there as though he be simply do up with fatigue such a lot of crow flutter about he that the air rustle like a wind-storm but he do not look up thumbietot say wind-rush get up now you shall help we with a matter which will be very easy for you the boy do not move but pretend to be asleep then wind-rush take he by the arm and drag he over the sand to a earthen crock of old-time make that be stand in the pit get up thumbietot say he and open this crock why can not you let I sleep say the boy i be too tired to do anything to-night wait until to-morrow open the crock say wind-rush shake he how shall a poor little child be able to open such a crock why it be quite as large as i be myself open it command wind-rush once more or it will be a sorry thing for you the boy get up totter over to the crock fumble the clasp and let he arm fall i be not usually so weak say he if you will only let I sleep until morning i think that i 'll be able to manage with that clasp but wind-rush be impatient and he rush forward and pinch the boy in the leg that sort of treatment the boy do not care to suffer from a crow he jerk himself loose quickly run a couple of pace backward draw he knife from the sheath and hold it extend in front of he you would better be careful he cry to wind-rush this one too be so enraged that he do not dodge the danger he rush at the boy just as though he would be blind and run so straight against the knife that it enter through he eye into the head the boy draw the knife back quickly but wind-rush only strike out with he wing then he fall down -- dead wind-rush be dead the stranger have kill we chieftain wind-rush cry the nearest crow and then there be a terrible uproar some wail other cry for vengeance they all run or flutter up to the boy with fumle-drumle in the lead but he act badly as usual he only flutter and spread he wing over the boy and prevent the other from come forward and run they bill into he the boy think that thing look very bad for he now he could not run away from the crow and there be no place where he could hide then he happen to think of the earthen crock he take a firm hold on the clasp and pull it off then he hop into the crock to hide in it but the crock be a poor hiding place for it be nearly fill to the brim with little thin silver coin the boy could not get far enough down so he stoop and begin to throw out the coin until now the crow have flutter around he in a thick swarm and peck at he but when he throw out the coin they immediately forget they thirst for vengeance and hurry to gather the money the boy throw out handful of it and all the crow -- yes even wind-air herself -- pick they up and everyone who succeed in pick up a coin run off to the nest with the utmost speed to conceal it when the boy have throw out all the silver penny from the crock he glance up not more than a single crow be leave in the sandpit that be fumle-drumle with the white feather in he wing he who have carry thumbietot you have render I a greater service than you understand say the crow -- with a very different voice and a different intonation than the one he have use heretofore -- and i want to save you life sit down on my back and i 'll take you to a hiding place where you can be secure for to-night to-morrow i 'll arrange it so that you will get back to the wild goose the cabin _ Thursday April fourteenth _ the follow morning when the boy awake he lay in a bed when he see that he be in a house with four wall around he and a roof over he he think that he be at home i wonder if mother will come soon with some coffee he mutter to himself where he lay half-awake then he remember that he be in a desert cabin on the crow-ridge and that fumle-drumle with the white feather have bear he there the night before the boy be sore all over after the journey he have make the day before and he think it be lovely to lie still while he wait for fumle-drumle who have promise to come and fetch he curtain of check cotton hang before the bed and he draw they aside to look out into the cabin it dawn upon he instantly that he have never see the mate to a cabin like this the wall consist of nothing but a couple of row of log then the roof begin there be no interior ceiling so he could look clear up to the roof-tree the cabin be so small that it appear to have be build rather for such as he than for real people however the fireplace and chimney be so large he think that he have never see larger the entrance door be in a gable-wall at the side of the fireplace and be so narrow that it be more like a wicket than a door in the other gable-wall he see a low and broad window with many pane there be scarcely any movable furniture in the cabin the bench on one side and the table under the window be also stationary -- also the big bed where he lay and the many-coloured cupboard the boy could not help wonder who own the cabin and why it be desert it certainly look as though the people who have live there expect to return the coffee-urn and the gruel-pot stand on the hearth and there be some wood in the fireplace the oven-rake and baker 's peel stand in a corner the spin wheel be raise on a bench on the shelf over the window lay oakum and flax a couple of skein of yarn a candle and a bunch of match yes it surely look as if those who have live there have intend to come back there be bed-clothes on the bed and on the wall there still hung long strip of cloth upon which three rider name kasper melchior and baltasar be paint the same horse and rider be picture many time they ride around the whole cabin and continue they ride even up toward the joist but in the roof the boy see something which bring he to he sens in a jiffy it be a couple of loaf of big bread-cake that hang there upon a spit they look old and mouldy but it be bread all the same he give they a knock with the oven-rake and one piece fall to the floor he eat and stuff he bag full it be incredible how good bread be anyway he look around the cabin once more to try and discover if there be anything else which he might find useful to take along i may as well take what i need since no one else care about it think he but most of the thing be too big and heavy the only thing that he could carry might be a few match perhaps he clamber up on the table and swing with the help of the curtain up to the window-shelf while he stand there and stuff the match into he bag the crow with the white feather come in through the window well here i be at last say fumle-drumle as he light on the table i could not get here any sooner because we crow have elect a new chieftain in wind-rush 's place whom have you choose say the boy well we have choose one who will not permit robbery and injustice we have elect garm whitefeather lately call fumle-drumle answer he draw himself up until he look absolutely regal that be a good choice say the boy and congratulate he you may well wish I luck say garm then he tell the boy about the time they have have with wind-rush and wind-air during this recital the boy hear a voice outside the window which he think sound familiar be he here -- inquire the fox yes he be hide in there answer a crow-voice be careful thumbietot cry garm wind-air stand without with that fox who want to eat you more he do not have time to say for smirre dash against the window the old rotten window-frame give way and the next second smirre stand upon the window-table garm whitefeather who do not have time to fly away he kill instantly thereupon he jump down to the floor and look around for the boy he try to hide behind a big oakum-spiral but smirre have already spy he and be crouch for the final spring the cabin be so small and so low the boy understand that the fox could reach he without the least difficulty but just at that moment the boy be not without weapon of defense he strike a match quickly touch the curtain and when they be in flame he throw they down upon smirre fox when the fire envelop the fox he be seize with a mad terror he think no more about the boy but rush wildly out of the cabin but it look as if the boy have escape one danger to throw himself into a greater one from the tuft of oakum which he have fling at smirre the fire have spread to the bed-hanging he jump down and try to smother it but it blaze too quickly now the cabin be soon fill with smoke and smirre fox who have remain just outside the window begin to grasp the state of affair within well thumbietot he call out which do you choose now : to be broil alive in there or to come out here to I of course i should prefer to have the pleasure of eat you but in whichever way death meet you it will be dear to I the boy could not think but what the fox be right for the fire be make rapid headway the whole bed be now in a blaze and smoke rise from the floor and along the paint wall-strip the fire creep from rider to rider the boy jump up in the fireplace and try to open the oven door when he hear a key which turn around slowly in the lock it must be human being come and in the dire extremity in which he find himself he be not afraid but only glad he be already on the threshold when the door open he see a couple of child face he but how they look when they see the cabin in flame he take no time to find out but rush past they into the open he do not dare run far he know of course that smirre fox lay in wait for he and he understand that he must remain near the child he turn round to see what sort of folk they be but he have not look at they a second before he run up to they and cry : oh good-day osa goose-girl oh good-day little mat for when the boy see those child he forget entirely where he be crow and burn cabin and talk animal have vanish from he memory he be walk on a stubble-field in west vemminghög tend a goose-flock and beside he on the field walk those same småland child with they goose as soon as he see they he run up on the stone-hedge and shout : oh good-day osa goose-girl oh good-day little mat but when the child see such a little creature come up to they with outstretch hand they grab hold of each other take a couple of step backward and look scare to death when the boy notice they terror he wake up and remember who he be and then it seem to he that nothing worse could happen to he than that those child should see how he have be bewitch shame and grief because he be no longer a human be overpower he he turn and flee he know not whither but a glad meeting await the boy when he come down to the heath for there in the heather he spy something white and toward he come the white goosey-gander accompany by dunfin when the white one see the boy run with such speed he think that dreadful fiend be pursue he he fling he in all haste upon he back and fly off with he the old peasant woman _ Thursday April fourteenth _ three tired wanderer be out in the late evening in search of a night harbor they travel over a poor and desolate portion of northern småland but the sort of rest place which they want they should have be able to find for they be no weakling who ask for soft bed or comfortable room if one of these long mountain-ridge have a peak so high and steep that a fox could not in any way climb up to it then we should have a good sleeping-place say one of they if a single one of the big swamp be thaw out and be so marshy and wet that a fox would not dare venture out on it this too would be a right good night harbor say the second if the ice on one of the large lake we travel past be loose so that a fox could not come out on it then we should have find just what we be seek say the third the worst of it be that when the sun have go down two of the traveller become so sleepy that every second they be ready to fall to the ground the third one who could keep himself awake grow more and more uneasy as night approach then it be a misfortune that we come to a land where lake and swamp be freeze so that a fox can get around everywhere in other place the ice have melt away but now we be well up in the very coldest småland where spring have not as yet arrive i do not know how i shall ever manage to find a good sleeping-place unless i find some spot that be well protect smirre fox will be upon we before morning he gaze in all direction but he see no shelter where he could lodge it be a dark and chilly night with wind and drizzle it grow more terrible and disagreeable around he every second this may sound strange perhaps but the traveller do not seem to have the least desire to ask for house-room on any farm they have already pass many parish without knock at a single door little hillside cabin on the outskirts of the forest which all poor wanderer be glad to run across they take no notice of either one might almost be tempt to say they deserve to have a hard time of it since they do not seek help where it be to be have for the ask but finally when it be so dark that there be scarcely a glimmer of light leave under the sky and the two who need sleep journey on in a kind of half-sleep they happen into a farmyard which be a long way off from all neighbor and not only do it lie there desolate but it appear to be uninhabited as well no smoke rise from the chimney no light shone through the window no human be move on the place when the one among the three who could keep awake see the place he think : now come what may we must try to get in here anything better we be not likely to find soon after that all three stand in the house-yard two of they fall asleep the instant they stand still but the third look about he eagerly to find where they could get under cover it be not a small farm beside the dwelling house and stable and smoke-house there be long range with granary and storehouse and cattleshed but it all look awfully poor and dilapidated the house have gray moss-grown lean wall which seem ready to topple over in the roof be yawn hole and the door hang aslant on broken hinge it be apparent that no one have take the trouble to drive a nail into a wall on this place for a long time meanwhile he who be awake have figure out which house be the cowsh he rouse he travel companion from they sleep and conduct they to the cowshed door luckily this be not fasten with anything but a hook which he could easily push up with a rod he heave a sigh of relief at the thought that they should soon be in safety but when the cowshed door swing open with a sharp creak he hear a cow begin to bellow be you come at last mistress say she i think that you do not propose to give I any supper to-night the one who be awake stop in the doorway absolutely terrify when he discover that the cowsh be not empty but he soon see that there be not more than one cow and three or four chicken and then he take courage again we be three poor traveller who want to come in somewhere where no fox can assail we and no human be capture we say he we wonder if this can be a good place for we i can not believe but what it be answer the cow to be sure the wall be poor but the fox do not walk through they as yet and no one live here except a old peasant woman who be not at all likely to make a captive of anyone but who be you she continue as she twist in she stall to get a sight of the newcomer i be nil holgersson from vemminghög who have be transform into a elf reply the first of the incomer and i have with I a tame goose whom i generally ride and a gray goose such rare guest have never before be within my four wall say the cow and you shall be welcome although i would have prefer that it have be my mistress come to give I my supper the boy lead the goose into the cowsh which be rather large and place they in a empty manger where they fall asleep instantly for himself he make a little bed of straw and expect that he too should go to sleep at once but this be impossible for the poor cow who have not have she supper be not still a instant she shake she flank move around in the stall and complain of how hungry she be the boy could not get a wink of sleep but lay there and live over all the thing that have happen to he during these last day he think of osa the goose-girl and little mat whom he have encounter so unexpectedly and he fancy that the little cabin which he have set on fire must have be they old home in småland now he recall that he have hear they speak of just such a cabin and of the big heather-heath which lay below it now osa and mat have wander back there to see they old home again and then when they have reach it it be in flame it be indeed a great sorrow which he have bring upon they and it hurt he very much if he ever again become a human be he would try to compensate they for the damage and miscalculation then he thought wander to the crow and when he think of fumle-drumle who have save he life and have meet he own death so soon after he have be elect chieftain he be so distressed that tear fill he eye he have have a pretty rough time of it these last few day but anyway it be a rare stroke of luck that the goosey-gander and dunfin have find he the goosey-gander have say that as soon as the goose discover that thumbietot have disappear they have ask all the small animal in the forest about he they soon learn that a flock of småland crow have carry he off but the crow be already out of sight and whither they have direct they course no one have be able to say that they might find the boy as soon as possible akka have command the wild goose to start out -- two and two -- in different direction to search for he but after a two day ' hunt whether or not they have find he they be to meet in northwestern småland on a high mountain-top which resemble a abrupt chopped-off tower and be call taberg after akka have give they the best direction and describe carefully how they should find taberg they have separate the white goosey-gander have choose dunfin as travel companion and they have fly about hither and thither with the greatest anxiety for thumbietot during this ramble they have hear a thrush who sit in a tree-top cry and wail that someone who call himself kidnapped-by-crow have make fun of he they have talk with the thrush and he have show they in which direction that kidnapped-by-crow have travel afterward they have meet a dove-cock a starling and a drake they have all wail about a little culprit who have disturb they song and who be name caught-by-crows captured-by-crow and stolen-by-crow in this way they be enable to trace thumbietot all the way to the heather-heath in sonnerbo township as soon as the goosey-gander and dunfin have find thumbietot they have start toward the north in order to reach taberg but it have be a long road to travel and the darkness be upon they before they have sight the mountain top if we only get there by to-morrow surely all we trouble will be over think the boy and dig down into the straw to have it warmer all the while the cow fuss and fume in the stall then all of a sudden she begin to talk to the boy everything be wrong with I say the cow i be neither milk nor tend i have no night fodder in my manger and no bed have be make under I my mistress come here at dusk to put thing in order for I but she feel so ill that she have to go in soon again and she have not return it be distressing that i should be little and powerless say the boy i do not believe that i be able to help you you can not make I believe that you be powerless because you be little say the cow all the elf that i have ever hear of be so strong that they could pull a whole load of hay and strike a cow dead with one fist the boy could not help laugh at the cow they be a very different kind of elf from I say he but i 'll loosen you halter and open the door for you so that you can go out and drink in one of the pool on the place and then i 'll try to climb up to the hayloft and throw down some hay in you manger yes that would be some help say the cow the boy do as he have say and when the cow stand with a full manger in front of she he think that at last he should get some sleep but he have hardly creep down in the bed before she begin anew to talk to he you 'll be clean put out with I if i ask you for one thing more say the cow oh no i will not if it be only something that i be able to do say the boy then i will ask you to go into the cabin directly opposite and find out how my mistress be get along i fear some misfortune have come to she no i can not do that say the boy i dare not show myself before human being ` surely you be not afraid of a old and sick woman say the cow but you do not need to go into the cabin just stand outside the door and peep in through the crack oh if that be all you ask of I i 'll do it of course say the boy with that he open the cowshed door and go out in the yard it be a fearful night neither moon nor star shine the wind blow a gale and the rain come down in torrent and the worst of all be that seven great owl sit in a row on the eaves of the cabin it be awful just to hear they where they sit and grumble at the weather but it be even worse to think what would happen to he if one of they should set eye on he that would be the last of he pity he who be little say the boy as he venture out in the yard and he have a right to say this for he be blow down twice before he get to the house : once the wind sweep he into a pool which be so deep that he come near drown but he get there nevertheless he clamber up a pair of step scramble over a threshold and come into the hallway the cabin door be close but down in one corner a large piece have be cut away that the cat might go in and out it be no difficulty whatever for the boy to see how thing be in the cabin he have hardly cast a glance in there before he stagger back and turn he head away a old gray-haired woman lay stretch out on the floor within she neither move nor moan and she face shone strangely white it be as if a invisible moon have throw a feeble light over it the boy remember that when he grandfather have die he face have also become so strangely white-like and he understand that the old woman who lay on the cabin floor must be dead death have probably come to she so suddenly that she do not even have time to lie down on she bed as he think of be alone with the dead in the middle of the dark night he be terribly afraid he throw himself headlong down the step and rush back to the cowsh when he tell the cow what he have see in the cabin she stop eat so my mistress be dead say she then it will soon be over for I as well there will always be someone to look out for you say the boy comfortingly ah you do not know say the cow that i be already twice as old as a cow usually be before she be lay upon the slaughter-bench but then i do not care to live any longer since she in there can come no more to care for I she say nothing more for a while but the boy observe no doubt that she neither sleep nor eat it be not long before she begin to speak again be she lie on the bare floor she ask she be say the boy she have a habit of come out to the cowsh she continue and talk about everything that trouble she i understand what she say although i could not answer she these last few day she talk of how afraid she be lest there would be no one with she when she die she be anxious for fear no one should close she eye and fold she hand across she breast after she be dead perhaps you 'll go in and do this the boy hesitate he remember that when he grandfather have die mother have be very careful about put everything to rights he know this be something which have to be do but on the other hand he feel that he do not care go to the dead in the ghastly night he do not say no neither do he take a step toward the cowshed door for a couple of seconds the old cow be silent -- just as if she have expect a answer but when the boy say nothing she do not repeat she request instead she begin to talk with he of she mistress there be much to tell first and foremost about all the child which she have bring up they have be in the cowsh every day and in the summer they have take the cattle to pasture on the swamp and in the grove so the old cow know all about they they have be splendid all of they and happy and industrious a cow know well enough what she caretaker be good for there be also much to be say about the farm it have not always be as poor as it be now it be very large -- although the greater part of it consist of swamp and stony grove there be not much room for field but there be plenty of good fodder everywhere at one time there have be a cow for every stall in the cowsh and the oxshed which be now empty have at one time be fill with ox and then there be life and gayety both in cabin and cowhouse when the mistress open the cowshed door she would hum and sing and all the cow low with gladness when they hear she coming but the good man have die when the child be so small that they could not be of any assistance and the mistress have to take charge of the farm and all the work and responsibility she have be as strong as a man and have both plough and reap in the evening when she come into the cowsh to milk sometimes she be so tired that she weep then she dash away she tear and be cheerful again it do not matter good time be come again for I too if only my child grow up yes if they only grow up but as soon as the child be grow a strange longing come over they they do not want to stay at home but go away to a strange country they mother never get any help from they a couple of she child be marry before they go away and they have leave they child behind in the old home and now these child follow the mistress in the cowsh just as she own have do they tend the cow and be fine good folk and in the evening when the mistress be so tired out that she could fall asleep in the middle of the milk she would rouse herself again to renew courage by thinking of they good time be come for I too say she -- and shake off sleep -- when once they be grow but when these child grow up they go away to they parent in the strange land no one come back -- no one stay at home -- the old mistress be leave alone on the farm probably she have never ask they to remain with she think you rödlinna that i would ask they to stay here with I when they can go out in the world and have thing comfortable she would say as she stand in the stall with the old cow here in småland they have only poverty to look forward to but when the last grandchild be go it be all up with the mistress all at once she become bent and gray and totter as she walk as if she no longer have the strength to move about she stop work she do not care to look after the farm but let everything go to rack and ruin she do not repair the house and she sell both the cow and the ox the only one that she keep be the old cow who now talk with thumbietot she she let live because all the child have tend she she could have take maid and farm-hand into she service who would have help she with the work but she could not bear to see stranger around she since she own have desert she perhaps she be better satisfied to let the farm go to ruin since none of she child be come back to take it after she be go she do not mind that she herself become poor because she do not value that which be only hers but she be trouble lest the child should find out how hard she have it if only the child do not hear of this if only the child do not hear of this she sigh as she totter through the cowhouse the child write constantly and beg she to come out to they but this she do not wish she do not want to see the land that have take they from she she be angry with it it be foolish of I perhaps that i do not like that land which have be so good for they say she but i do not want to see it she never think of anything but the child and of this -- that they must need have go when summer come she lead the cow out to graze in the big swamp all day she would sit on the edge of the swamp she hand in she lap and on the way home she would say : you see rödlinna if there have be large rich field here in place of these barren swamp then there would have be no need for they to leave she could become furious with the swamp which spread out so big and do no good she could sit and talk about how it be the swamp 's fault that the child have leave she this last evening she have be more trembly and feeble than ever before she could not even do the milk she have lean against the manger and talk about two stranger who have be to see she and have ask if they might buy the swamp they want to drain it and sow and raise grain on it this have make she both anxious and glad do you hear rödlinna she have say do you hear they say that grain can grow on the swamp now i shall write to the child to come home now they 'll not have to stay away any longer for now they can get they bread here at home it be this that she have go into the cabin to do -- the boy hear no more of what the old cow say he have open the cowhouse door and go across the yard and in to the dead whom he have but lately be so afraid of it be not so poor in the cabin as he have expect it be well supply with the sort of thing one generally find among those who have relative in america in a corner there be a american rock chair on the table before the window lay a brocaded plush cover there be a pretty spread on the bed on the wall in carved-wood frame hang the photograph of the child and grandchild who have go away on the bureau stand high vase and a couple of candlestick with thick spiral candle in they the boy search for a matchbox and light these candle not because he need more light than he already have but because he think that this be one way to honor the dead then he go up to she closed she eye fold she hand across she breast and stroke back the thin gray hair from she face he think no more about be afraid of she he be so deeply grieve because she have be force to live out she old age in loneliness and longing he at least would watch over she dead body this night he hunt up the psalm book and seat himself to read a couple of psalm in a undertone but in the middle of the reading he pause -- because he have begin to think about he mother and father think that parent can long so for they child this he have never know think that life can be as though it be over for they when the child be away think if those at home long for he in the same way that this old peasant woman have long this thought make he happy but he dare not believe in it he have not be such a one that anybody could long for he but what he have not be perhaps he could become round about he he see the portrait of those who be away they be big strong man and woman with earnest face there be bride in long veil and gentleman in fine clothes and there be child with wave hair and pretty white dress and he think that they all stare blindly into vacancy -- and do not want to see poor you say the boy to the portrait you mother be dead you can not make reparation now because you go away from she but my mother be live here he pause and nod and smile to himself my mother be live say he both father and mother be live from taberg to huskvarna _ Friday April fifteenth _ the boy sit awake nearly all night but toward morning he fall asleep and then he dream of he father and mother he could hardly recognize they they have both grow gray and have old and wrinkled face he ask how this have come about and they answer that they have age so because they have long for he he be both touch and astonish for he have never believe but what they be glad to be rid of he when the boy awake the morning be come with fine clear weather first he himself eat a bit of bread which he find in the cabin then he give morning feed to both goose and cow and open the cowhouse door so that the cow could go over to the nearest farm when the cow come along all by herself the neighbor would no doubt understand that something be wrong with she mistress they would hurry over to the desolate farm to see how the old woman be get along and then they would find she dead body and bury it the boy and the goose have barely raise themselves into the air when they catch a glimpse of a high mountain with almost perpendicular wall and a abrupt broken-off top and they understand that this must be taberg on the summit stand akka with yksus and kaksi kolmi and neljä viisi and knusi and all six gosling and wait for they there be a rejoicing and a cackling and a fluttering and a call which no one can describe when they see that the goosey-gander and dunfin have succeed in find thumbietot the wood grow pretty high up on taberg 's side but she highest peak be barren and from there one could look out in all direction if one gaze toward the east or south or west then there be hardly anything to be see but a poor highland with dark spruce-tree brown morass ice-clad lake and bluish mountain-ridge the boy could not keep from think it be true that the one who have create this have not take very great pain with he work but have throw it together in a hurry but if one glance to the north it be altogether different here it look as if it have be work out with the utmost care and affection in this direction one see only beautiful mountain soft valley and wind river all the way to the big lake vettern which lay ice-free and transparently clear and shone as if it be not fill with water but with blue light it be vettern that make it so pretty to look toward the north because it look as though a blue stream have rise up from the lake and spread itself over land also grove and hill and roof and the spire of jönköping city -- which shimmer along vettern 's shore -- lay envelop in pale blue which caress the eye if there be country in heaven they too must be blue like this think the boy and imagine that he have get a faint idea of how it must look in paradise later in the day when the goose continue they journey they fly up toward the blue valley they be in holiday humor shriek and make such a racket that no one who have ear could help hear they this happen to be the first really fine spring day they have have in this section until now the spring have do its work under rain and bluster and now when it have all of a sudden become fine weather the people be fill with such a longing after summer warmth and green wood that they could hardly perform they task and when the wild goose ride by high above the ground cheerful and free there be not one who do not drop what he have in hand and glance at they the first one who see the wild goose that day be miner on taberg who be digging ore at the mouth of the mine when they hear they cackle they pause in they drilling for ore and one of they call to the bird : where be you go where be you go the goose do not understand what he say but the boy lean forward over the goose-back and answer for they : where there be neither pick nor hammer when the miner hear the word they think it be they own longing that make the goose-cackle sound like human speech take we along with you take we along with you they cry not this year shriek the boy not this year the wild goose follow taberg river down toward monk lake and all the while they make the same racket here on the narrow land-strip between monk and vettern lake lay jönköping with its great factory the wild goose ride first over monksjö paper mill the noon rest hour be just over and the big workman be stream down to the mill-gate when they hear the wild goose they stop a moment to listen to they where be you go where be you go call the workman the wild goose understand nothing of what they say but the boy answer for they : there where there be neither machine nor steam-box when the workman hear the answer they believe it be they own longing that make the goose-cackle sound like human speech take we along with you not this year answer the boy not this year next the goose ride over the well-known match factory which lie on the shore of vettern -- large as a fortress -- and lift its high chimney toward the sky not a soul move out in the yard but in a large hall young working-woman sit and fill match-box they have open a window on account of the beautiful weather and through it come the wild goose 's call the one who sit nearest the window lean out with a match-box in she hand and cry : where be you go where be you go to that land where there be no need of either light or match say the boy the girl think that what she have hear be only goose-cackle but since she think she have distinguish a couple of word she call out in answer : take I along with you not this year reply the boy not this year east of the factory rise jönköping on the most glorious spot that any city can occupy the narrow vettern have high steep sand-shore both on the eastern and western side but straight south the sand-wall be break down just as if to make room for a large gate through which one reach the lake and in the middle of the gate -- with mountain to the left and mountain to the right with monk lake behind it and vettern in front of it -- lie jönköping the wild goose travel forward over the long narrow city and behave themselves here just as they have do in the country but in the city there be no one who answer they it be not to be expect that city folk should stop out in the street and call to the wild goose the trip extend further along vettern 's shore and after a little they come to sanna sanitarium some of the patient have go out on the veranda to enjoy the spring air and in this way they hear the goose-cackle where be you go ask one of they with such a feeble voice that he be scarcely hear to that land where there be neither sorrow nor sickness answer the boy take we along with you say the sick one not this year answer the boy not this year when they have travel still farther on they come to huskvarna it lay in a valley the mountain around it be steep and beautifully form a river rush along the height in long and narrow fall big workshop and factory lay below the mountain wall and scatter over the valley-bottom be the workingmen ' home encircle by little garden and in the center of the valley lay the schoolhouse just as the wild goose come along a bell ring and a crowd of school child march out in line they be so numerous that the whole schoolyard be fill with they where be you go where be you go the child shout when they hear the wild goose where there be neither book nor lesson to be find answer the boy take we along shriek the child not this year but next cry the boy not this year but next the big bird lake jarro the wild duck on the eastern shore of vettern lie mount omberg east of omberg lie dagmosse east of dagmosse lie lake takern around the whole of takern spread the big even östergöta plain takern be a pretty large lake and in olden time it must have be still larger but then the people think it cover entirely too much of the fertile plain so they attempt to drain the water from it that they might sow and reap on the lake-bottom but they do not succeed in lay waste the entire lake -- which have evidently be they intention -- therefore it still hide a lot of land since the drain the lake have become so shallow that hardly at any point be it more than a couple of metre deep the shore have become marshy and muddy and out in the lake little mud-islet stick up above the water 's surface now there be one who love to stand with he foot in the water if he can just keep he body and head in the air and that be the reed and it can not find a better place to grow upon than the long shallow takern shore and around the little mud-islet it thrive so well that it grow taller than a man 's height and so thick that it be almost impossible to push a boat through it it form a broad green enclosure around the whole lake so that it be only accessible in a few place where the people have take away the reed but if the reed shut the people out they give in return shelter and protection to many other thing in the reed there be a lot of little dam and canal with green still water where duckweed and pondweed run to seed and where gnat-egg and blackfish and worm be hatch out in uncountable mass and all along the shore of these little dam and canal there be many well-concealed place where seabird hatch they egg and bring up they young without be disturb either by enemy or food worry a incredible number of bird live in the takern reed and more and more gather there every year as it become known what a splendid abode it be the first who settle there be the wild duck and they still live there by thousand but they no longer own the entire lake for they have be oblige to share it with swan grebe coot loon fen-duck and a lot of other takern be certainly the largest and choicest bird lake in the whole country and the bird may count themselves lucky as long as they own such a retreat but it be uncertain just how long they will be in control of reed and mud-bank for human being can not forget that the lake extend over a considerable portion of good and fertile soil and every now and then the proposition to drain it come up among they and if these proposition be carry out the many thousand of water-bird would be force to move from this quarter at the time when nil holgersson travel around with the wild goose there live at takern a wild duck name jarro he be a young bird who have only live one summer one fall and a winter now it be he first spring he have just return from south africa and have reach takern in such good season that the ice be still on the lake one evening when he and the other young wild duck play at race backward and forward over the lake a hunter fire a couple of shot at they and jarro be wound in the breast he think he should die but in order that the one who have shoot he should not get he into he power he continue to fly as long as he possibly could he do not think whither he be direct he course but only struggle to get far away when he strength fail he so that he could not fly any farther he be no longer on the lake he have fly a bit inland and now he sink down before the entrance to one of the big farm which lie along the shore of takern a moment later a young farm-hand happen along he see jarro and come and lift he up but jarro who ask for nothing but to be let die in peace gather he last power and nip the farm-hand in the finger so he should let go of he jarro do not succeed in free himself the encounter have this good in it at any rate : the farm-hand notice that the bird be alive he carry he very gently into the cottage and show he to the mistress of the house -- a young woman with a kindly face at once she take jarro from the farm-hand stroke he on the back and wipe away the blood which trickle down through the neck-feather she look he over very carefully and when she see how pretty he be with he dark-green shine head he white neck-band he brownish-red back and he blue wing-mirror she must have think that it be a pity for he to die she promptly put a basket in order and tuck the bird into it all the while jarro flutter and struggle to get loose but when he understand that the people do not intend to kill he he settle down in the basket with a sense of pleasure now it be evident how exhaust he be from pain and loss of blood the mistress carry the basket across the floor to place it in the corner by the fireplace but before she put it down jarro be already fast asleep in a little while jarro be awaken by someone who nudge he gently when he open he eye he experience such a awful shock that he almost lose he sens now he be lose for there stand _ the _ one who be more dangerous than either human being or bird of prey it be no less a thing than caesar himself -- the long-haired dog -- who nose around he inquisitively how pitifully scare have he not be last summer when he be still a little yellow-down duckling every time it have sound over the reed-stem : caesar be come caesar be come when he have see the brown and white spotted dog with the teeth-filled jowl come wade through the reed he have believe that he behold death itself he have always hope that he would never have to live through that moment when he should meet caesar face to face but to he sorrow he must have fall down in the very yard where caesar live for there he stand right over he who be you he growl how do you get into the house do not you belong down among the reed bank it be with great difficulty that he gain the courage to answer do not be angry with I caesar because i come into the house say he it be not my fault i have be wound by a gunshot it be the people themselves who lay I in this basket oho so it be the folk themselves that have place you here say caesar then it be surely they intention to cure you although for my part i think it would be wiser for they to eat you up since you be in they power but at any rate you be taboo in the house you need not look so scared now we be not down on takern with that caesar lay himself to sleep in front of the blaze log-fire as soon as jarro understand that this terrible danger be past extreme lassitude come over he and he fall asleep anew the next time jarro awake he see that a dish with grain and water stand before he he be still quite ill but he feel hungry nevertheless and begin to eat when the mistress see that he eat she come up and pet he and look pleased after that jarro fall asleep again for several day he do nothing but eat and sleep one morning jarro feel so well that he step from the basket and wander along the floor but he have not go very far before he keel over and lay there then come caesar open he big jaw and grab he jarro believe of course that the dog be go to bite he to death but caesar carry he back to the basket without harm he because of this jarro acquire such a confidence in the dog caesar that on he next walk in the cottage he go over to the dog and lay down beside he thereafter caesar and he become good friend and every day for several hour jarro lay and sleep between caesar 's paw but a even greater affection than he feel for caesar do jarro feel toward he mistress of she he have not the least fear but rub he head against she hand when she come and feed he whenever she go out of the cottage he sigh with regret and when she come back he cry welcome to she in he own language jarro forget entirely how afraid he have be of both dog and human in other day he think now that they be gentle and kind and he love they he wish that he be well so he could fly down to takern and tell the wild duck that they enemy be not dangerous and that they need not fear they he have observe that the human being as well as caesar have calm eye which it do one good to look into the only one in the cottage whose glance he do not care to meet be clawina the house cat she do he no harm either but he could not place any confidence in she then too she quarrel with he constantly because he love human being you think they protect you because they be fond of you say clawina you just wait until you be fat enough then they 'll wring the neck off you i know they i do jarro like all bird have a tender and affectionate heart and he be unutterably distressed when he hear this he could not imagine that he mistress would wish to wring the neck off he nor could he believe any such thing of she son the little boy who sit for hour beside he basket and babble and chatter he seem to think that both of they have the same love for he that he have for they one day when jarro and caesar lay on the usual spot before the fire clawina sit on the hearth and begin to tease the wild duck i wonder jarro what you wild duck will do next year when takern be drain and turn into grain field say clawina what be that you say clawina cry jarro and jump up -- scare through and through i always forget jarro that you do not understand human speech like caesar and myself answer the cat or else you surely would have hear how the man who be here in the cottage yesterday say that all the water be go to be drain from takern and that next year the lake-bottom would be as dry as a house-floor and now i wonder where you wild duck will go when jarro hear this talk he be so furious that he hiss like a snake you be just as mean as a common coot he scream at clawina you only want to incite I against human being i do not believe they want to do anything of the sort they must know that takern be the wild duck ' property why should they make so many bird homeless and unhappy you have certainly hit upon all this to scare I i hope that you may be tear in piece by gorgo the eagle i hope that my mistress will chop off you whisker but jarro could not shut clawina up with this outburst so you think i be lie say she ask caesar then he be also in the house last night caesar never lie caesar say jarro you understand human speech much better than clawina say that she have not hear aright think how it would be if the people drain takern and change the lake-bottom into field then there would be no more pondweed or duck-food for the grown wild duck and no blackfish or worm or gnat-egg for the duckling then the reed-bank would disappear -- where now the duckling conceal themselves until they be able to fly all duck would be compel to move away from here and seek another home but where shall they find a retreat like takern caesar say that clawina have not hear aright it be extraordinary to watch caesar 's behavior during this conversation he have be wide-awake the whole time before but now when jarro turn to he he pant lay he long nose on he forepaw and be sound asleep within the wink of a eyelid the cat look down at caesar with a know smile i believe that caesar do not care to answer you she say to jarro it be with he as with all dog they will never acknowledge that human can do any wrong but you can rely upon my word at any rate i shall tell you why they wish to drain the lake just now as long as you wild duck still have the power on takern they do not wish to drain it for at least they get some good out of you but now grebe and coot and other bird who be no good as food have infested nearly all the reed-bank and the people do not think they need let the lake remain on they account jarro do not trouble himself to answer clawina but raise he head and shout in caesar 's ear : caesar you know that on takern there be still so many duck leave that they fill the air like cloud say it be not true that human being intend to make all of these homeless then caesar spring up with such a sudden outburst at clawina that she have to save herself by jump up on a shelf i 'll teach you to keep quiet when i want to sleep bawled caesar of course i know that there be some talk about drain the lake this year but there be be talk of this many time before without anything come of it and that drain business be a matter in which i take no stock whatever for how would it go with the game if takern be lay waste you be a donkey to gloat over a thing like that what will you and i have to amuse ourselves with when there be no more bird on takern the decoy-duck _ Sunday April seventeenth _ a couple of day later jarro be so well that he could fly all about the house then he be pet a good deal by the mistress and the little boy run out in the yard and pluck the first grass-blade for he which have spring up when the mistress caress he jarro think that although he be now so strong that he could fly down to takern at any time he should not care to be separate from the human being he have no objection to remain with they all he life but early one morning the mistress place a halter or noose over jarro which prevent he from use he wing and then she turn he over to the farm-hand who have find he in the yard the farm-hand poke he under he arm and go down to takern with he the ice have melt away while jarro have be ill the old dry fall leave still stand along the shore and islet but all the water-growth have begin to take root down in the deep and the green stem have already reach the surface and now nearly all the migratory bird be at home the curlew ' hooked bill peep out from the reed the grebe glide about with new feather-collar around the neck and the jack-snipe be gather straw for they nest the farm-hand get into a scow lay jarro in the bottom of the boat and begin to pole himself out on the lake jarro who have now accustom himself to expect only good of human being say to caesar who be also in the party that he be very grateful toward the farm-hand for take he out on the lake but there be no need to keep he so closely guard for he do not intend to fly away to this caesar make no reply he be very close-mouthed that morning the only thing which strike jarro as be a bit peculiar be that the farm-hand have take he gun along he could not believe that any of the good folk in the cottage would want to shoot bird and beside caesar have tell he that the people do not hunt at this time of the year it be a prohibit time he have say although this do not concern I of course the farm-hand go over to one of the little reed-enclosed mud-islet there he step from the boat gather some old reed into a pile and lay down behind it jarro be permit to wander around on the ground with the halter over he wing and tethered to the boat with a long string suddenly jarro catch sight of some young duck and drake in whose company he have formerly race backward and forward over the lake they be a long way off but jarro call they to he with a couple of loud shout they respond and a large and beautiful flock approach before they get there jarro begin to tell they about he marvellous rescue and of the kindness of human being just then two shot sound behind he three duck sink down in the reed -- lifeless -- and caesar bounce out and capture they then jarro understand the human being have only save he that they might use he as a decoy-duck and they have also succeed three duck have die on he account he think he should die of shame he think that even he friend caesar look contemptuously at he and when they come home to the cottage he do not dare lie down and sleep beside the dog the next morning jarro be again take out on the shallows this time too he see some duck but when he observe that they fly toward he he call to they : away away be careful fly in another direction there be a hunter hide behind the reed-pile i be only a decoy-bird and he actually succeed in prevent they from come within shooting distance jarro have scarcely have time to taste of a grass-blade so busy be he in keep watch he call out he warn as soon as a bird draw nigh he even warn the grebe although he detest they because they crowd the duck out of they best hiding-place but he do not wish that any bird should meet with misfortune on he account and thanks to jarro 's vigilance the farm-hand have to go home without firing off a single shot despite this fact caesar look less displeased than on the previous day and when evening come he take jarro in he mouth carry he over to the fireplace and let he sleep between he forepaw nevertheless jarro be no longer contented in the cottage but be grievously unhappy he heart suffer at the thought that human never have love he when the mistress or the little boy come forward to caress he he stick he bill under he wing and pretend that he sleep for several day jarro continue he distressful watch-service and already he be know all over takern then it happen one morning while he call as usual : have a care bird do not come near I i be only a decoy-duck that a grebe-nest come float toward the shallows where he be tie this be nothing especially remarkable it be a nest from the year before and since grebe-nest be build in such a way that they can move on water like boat it often happen that they drift out toward the lake still jarro stand there and stare at the nest because it come so straight toward the islet that it look as though someone have steer its course over the water as the nest come nearer jarro see that a little human being -- the tiniest he have ever see -- sit in the nest and row it forward with a pair of stick and this little human call to he : go as near the water as you can jarro and be ready to fly you shall soon be free a few seconds later the grebe-nest lay near land but the little oarsman do not leave it but sit huddle up between branch and straw jarro too hold himself almost immovable he be actually paralyse with fear lest the rescuer should be discover the next thing which occur be that a flock of wild goose come along then jarro wake up to business and warn they with loud shriek but in spite of this they fly backward and forward over the shallows several time they hold themselves so high that they be beyond shooting distance still the farm-hand let himself be tempt to fire a couple of shot at they these shot be hardly fire before the little creature run up on land draw a tiny knife from its sheath and with a couple of quick stroke cut loose jarro 's halter now fly away jarro before the man have time to load again cry he while he himself run down to the grebe-nest and pole away from the shore the hunter have have he gaze fix upon the goose and have not observe that jarro have be free but caesar have follow more carefully that which happen and just as jarro raise he wing he dash forward and grab he by the neck jarro cry pitifully and the boy who have free he say quietly to caesar : if you be just as honorable as you look surely you can not wish to force a good bird to sit here and entice other into trouble when caesar hear these word he grin viciously with he upper lip but the next second he drop jarro fly jarro say he you be certainly too good to be a decoy-duck it be not for this that i want to keep you here but because it will be lonely in the cottage without you the lowering of the lake _ Wednesday April twentieth _ it be indeed very lonely in the cottage without jarro the dog and the cat find the time long when they do not have he to wrangle over and the housewife miss the glad quack which he have indulge in every time she enter the house but the one who long most for jarro be the little boy per ola he be but three year old and the only child and in all he life he have never have a playmate like jarro when he hear that jarro have go back to takern and the wild duck he could not be satisfy with this but think constantly of how he should get he back again per olum have talk a good deal with jarro while he lay still in he basket and he be certain that the duck understand he he beg he mother to take he down to the lake that he might find jarro and persuade he to come back to they mother would not listen to this but the little one do not give up he plan on that account the day after jarro have disappear per olum be run about in the yard he play by himself as usual but caesar lay on the stoop and when mother let the boy out she say : take care of per ola caesar now if all have be as usual caesar would also have obey the command and the boy would have be so well guard that he could not have run the least risk but caesar be not like himself these day he know that the farmer who live along takern have hold frequent conference about the lowering of the lake and that they have almost settle the matter the duck must leave and caesar should nevermore behold a glorious chase he be so preoccupy with thought of this misfortune that he do not remember to watch over per olum and the little one have scarcely be alone in the yard a minute before he realize that now the right moment be come to go down to takern and talk with jarro he open a gate and wander down toward the lake on the narrow path which run along the bank as long as he could be see from the house he walk slowly but afterward he increase he pace he be very much afraid that mother or someone else should call to he that he could not go he do not wish to do anything naughty only to persuade jarro to come home but he feel that those at home would not have approve of the undertaking when per olum come down to the lake-shore he call jarro several time thereupon he stand for a long time and wait but no jarro appear he see several bird that resemble the wild duck but they fly by without notice he and he could understand that none among they be the right one when jarro do not come to he the little boy think that it would be easier to find he if he go out on the lake there be several good craft lie along the shore but they be tie the only one that lay loose and at liberty be a old leaky scow which be so unfit that no one thought of use it but per ola scramble up in it without care that the whole bottom be fill with water he have not strength enough to use the oar but instead he seat himself to swing and rock in the scow certainly no grow person would have succeed in move a scow out on takern in that manner but when the tide be high -- and ill-luck to the fore -- little child have a marvellous faculty for get out to sea per olum be soon ride around on takern and call for jarro when the old scow be rock like this -- out to sea -- its crack open wider and wider and the water actually stream into it per olum do not pay the slightest attention to this he sit upon the little bench in front and call to every bird he see and wonder why jarro do not appear at last jarro catch sight of per ola he hear that someone call he by the name which he have bear among human being and he understand that the boy have go out on takern to search for he jarro be unspeakably happy to find that one of the human really love he he shoot down toward per ola like a arrow seat himself beside he and let he caress he they be both very happy to see each other again but suddenly jarro notice the condition of the scow it be half-filled with water and be almost ready to sink jarro try to tell per olum that he who could neither fly nor swim must try to get upon land but per olum do not understand he then jarro do not wait a instant but hurry away to get help jarro come back in a little while and carry on he back a tiny thing who be much smaller than per ola himself if he have not be able to talk and move the boy would have believe that it be a doll instantly the little one order per olum to pick up a long slender pole that lay in the bottom of the scow and try to pole it toward one of the reed-island per olum obey he and he and the tiny creature together steer the scow with a couple of stroke they be on a little reed-encircled island and now per olum be tell that he must step on land and just the very moment that per olum set foot on land the scow be fill with water and sink to the bottom when per ola see this he be sure that father and mother would be very angry with he he would have start in to cry if he have not find something else to think about soon namely a flock of big gray bird who light on the island the little midget take he up to they and tell he they name and what they say and this be so funny that per ola forget everything else meanwhile the folk on the farm have discover that the boy have disappear and have start to search for he they search the outhouse look in the well and hunt through the cellar then they go out into the highway and by-path wander to the neighbouring farm to find out if he have stray over there and search for he also down by takern but no matter how much they seek they do not find he caesar the dog understand very well that the farmer-folk be look for per olum but he do nothing to lead they on the right track instead he lay still as though the matter do not concern he later in the day per olum 's footprint be discover down by the boat-landing and then come the thought that the old leaky scow be no longer on the strand then one begin to understand how the whole affair have come about the farmer and he helper immediately take out the boat and go in search of the boy they row around on takern until way late in the evening without see the least shadow of he they could not help believe that the old scow have go down and that the little one lay dead on the lake-bottom in the evening per olum 's mother hunt around on the strand everyone else be convince that the boy be drown but she could not bring herself to believe this she search all the while she search between reed and bulrush tramp and tramp on the muddy shore never think of how deep she foot sink and how wet she have become she be unspeakably desperate she heart ache in she breast she do not weep but wring she hand and call for she child in loud piercing tone round about she she hear swan ' and duck ' and curlew ' shriek she think that they follow she and moan and wail -- they too surely they too must be in trouble since they moan so think she then she remember : these be only bird that she hear complain they surely have no worry it be strange that they do not quiet down after sunset but she hear all these uncountable bird-throng which live along takern send forth cry upon cry several of they follow she wherever she go other come rustling past on light wing all the air be fill with moan and lamentation but the anguish which she herself be suffer open she heart she think that she be not as far remove from all other live creature as people usually think she understand much better than ever before how bird fare they have they constant worry for home and child they as she there be surely not such a great difference between they and she as she have heretofore believe then she happen to think that it be as good as settle that these thousand of swan and duck and loon would lose they home here by takern it will be very hard for they she think where shall they bring up they child now she stand still and muse on this it appear to be a excellent and agreeable accomplishment to change a lake into field and meadow but let it be some other lake than takern some other lake which be not the home of so many thousand creature she remember how on the follow day the proposition to lower the lake be to be decide and she wonder if this be why she little son have be lose -- just to-day be it god 's meaning that sorrow should come and open she heart -- just to-day -- before it be too late to avert the cruel act she walk rapidly up to the house and begin to talk with she husband about this she speak of the lake and of the bird and say that she believe it be god 's judgment on they both and she soon find that he be of the same opinion they already own a large place but if the lake-draining be carry into effect such a goodly portion of the lake-bottom would fall to they share that they property would be nearly double for this reason they have be more eager for the undertaking than any of the other shore owner the other have be worry about expense and anxious lest the drain should not prove any more successful this time than it be the last per olum 's father know in he heart that it be he who have influence they to undertake the work he have exercise all he eloquence so that he might leave to he son a farm as large again as he father have leave to he he stand and ponder if god 's hand be back of the fact that takern have take he son from he on the day before he be to draw up the contract to lay it waste the wife do not have to say many word to he before he answer : it may be that god do not want we to interfere with he order i 'll talk with the other about this to-morrow and i think we 'll conclude that all may remain as it be while the farmer-folk be talk this over caesar lay before the fire he raise he head and listen very attentively when he think that he be sure of the outcome he walk up to the mistress take she by the skirt and lead she to the door but caesar say she and want to break loose do you know where per olum be she exclaim caesar bark joyfully and throw himself against the door she open it and caesar dash down toward takern the mistress be so positive he know where per olum be that she rush after he and no sooner have they reach the shore than they hear a child 's cry out on the lake per olum have have the best day of he life in company with thumbietot and the bird but now he have begin to cry because he be hungry and afraid of the darkness and he be glad when father and mother and caesar come for he ulvåsa-lady the prophecy _ Friday April twenty-second _ one night when the boy lay and sleep on a island in takern he be awaken by oar-stroke he have hardly get he eye open before there fall such a dazzling light on they that he begin to blink at first he could not make out what it be that shone so brightly out here on the lake but he soon see that a scow with a big burning torch stick up on a spike aft lay near the edge of the reed the red flame from the torch be clearly reflect in the night-dark lake and the brilliant light must have lure the fish for round about the flame in the deep a mass of dark speck be see that move continually and change place there be two old man in the scow one sit at the oar and the other stand on a bench in the stern and hold in he hand a short spear which be coarsely barb the one who row be apparently a poor fisherman he be small dried-up and weather-beaten and wear a thin threadbare coat one could see that he be so use to be out in all sort of weather that he do not mind the cold the other be well feed and well dress and look like a prosperous and self-complacent farmer now stop say the farmer when they be opposite the island where the boy lay at the same time he plunge the spear into the water when he draw it out again a long fine eel come with it look at that say he as he release the eel from the spear that be one who be worth while now i think we have so many that we can turn back he comrade do not lift the oar but sit and look around it be lovely out here on the lake to-night say he and so it be it be absolutely still so that the entire water-surface lay in undisturbed rest with the exception of the streak where the boat have go forward this lay like a path of gold and shimmer in the firelight the sky be clear and dark blue and thickly stud with star the shore be hide by the reed island except toward the west there mount omberg loom up high and dark much more impressive than usual and cut away a big three-cornered piece of the vaulted heaven the other one turn he head to get the light out of he eye and look about he yes it be lovely here in östergylln say he still the best thing about the province be not its beauty then what be it that be best ask the oarsman that it have always be a respect and honor province that may be true enough and then this that one know it will always continue to be so but how in the world can one know this say the one who sit at the oar the farmer straighten up where he stand and brace himself with the spear there be a old story which have be hand down from father to son in my family and in it one learn what will happen to östergötland then you may as well tell it to I say the oarsman we do not tell it to anyone and everyone but i do not wish to keep it a secret from a old comrade at ulvåsa here in östergötland he continue -lrb- and one could tell by the tone of he voice that he talk of something which he have hear from other and know by heart -rrb- many many year ago there live a lady who have the gift of look into the future and tell people what be go to happen to they -- just as certainly and accurately as though it have already occur for this she become widely note and it be easy to understand that people would come to she both from far and near to find out what they be go to pass through of good or evil one day when ulvåsa-lady sit in she hall and spin as be customary in former day a poor peasant come into the room and seat himself on the bench near the door ' i wonder what you be sit and think about dear lady ' say the peasant after a little ' i be sit and think about high and holy thing ' answer she ` then it be not fitting perhaps that i ask you about something which weigh on my heart ' say the peasant ` it be probably nothing else that weigh on you heart than that you may reap much grain on you field but i be accustom to receive communication from the emperor about how it will go with he crown and from the pope about how it will go with he key ' ` such thing can not be easy to answer ' say the peasant ' i have also hear that no one seem to go from here without be dissatisfy with what he have hear ' when the peasant say this he see that ulvåsa-lady bit she lip and move higher up on the bench ` so this be what you have hear about I ' say she ` then you may as well tempt fortune by ask I about the thing you wish to know and you shall see if i can answer so that you will be satisfied ' after this the peasant do not hesitate to state he errand he say that he have come to ask how it would go with östergötland in the future there be nothing which be so dear to he as he native province and he feel that he should be happy until he die day if he could get a satisfactory reply to he query ` oh be that all you wish to know ' say the wise lady ` then i think that you will be content for here where i now sit i can tell you that it will be like this with östergötland : it will always have something to boast of ahead of other province ' ` yes that be a good answer dear lady ' say the peasant ` and now i would be entirely at peace if i could only comprehend how such a thing should be possible ' ` why should it not be possible ' say ulvåsa-lady ` do not you know that östergötland be already renowned or think you there be any place in sweden that can boast of own at the same time two such cloister as the one in alvastra and vreta and such a beautiful cathedral as the one in linköping ' ` that may be so ' say the peasant ` but i be a old man and i know that people 's mind be changeable i fear that there will come a time when they will not want to give we any glory either for alvastra or vreta or for the cathedral ' ` herein you may be right ' say ulvåsa-lady ` but you need not doubt prophecy on that account i shall now build up a new cloister on vadstena and that will become the most celebrated in the north thither both the high and the lowly shall make pilgrimage and all shall sing the praise of the province because it have such a holy place within its confines ' the peasant reply that he be right glad to know this but he also know of course that everything be perishable and he wonder much what would give distinction to the province if vadstena cloister should once fall into disrepute ` you be not easy to satisfy ' say ulvåsa-lady ` but surely i can see so far ahead that i can tell you before vadstena cloister shall have lose its splendor there will be a castle erect close by which will be the most magnificent of its period king and duke will be guest there and it shall be account a honor to the whole province that it own such a ornament ' ` this i be also glad to hear ' say the peasant ` but i be a old man and i know how it generally turn out with this world 's glory and if the castle go to ruin i wonder much what there will be that can attract the people 's attention to this province ' ` it be not a little that you want to know ' say ulvåsa-lady ` but certainly i can look far enough into the future to see that there will be life and movement in the forest around finspång i see how cabin and smithy arise there and i believe that the whole province shall be renown because iron will be mould within its confines ' the peasant do not deny that he be delighted to hear this ` but if it should go so badly that even finspång 's foundry go down in importance then it would hardly be possible that any new thing could arise of which östergötland might boast ' ` you be not easy to please ' say ulvåsa-lady ` but i can see so far into the future that i mark how along the lake-shore great manor -- large as castle -- be build by gentleman who have carry on war in foreign land i believe that the manor will bring the province just as much honor as anything else that i have mention ' ` but if there come a time when no one laud the great manor ' insist the peasant ` you need not be uneasy at all event ' say ulvåsa-lady i see how health-springs bubble on medevus meadow by vätter 's shore i believe that the well at medevus will bring the land as much praise as you can desire ' ` that be a mighty good thing to know ' say the peasant ` but if there come a time when people will seek they health at other spring ' ` you must not give yourself any anxiety on that account ' answer ulvåsa-lady i see how people dig and labor from motalum to mem they dig a canal right through the country and then östergötland 's praise be again on everyone 's lip ' but nevertheless the peasant look distraught ' i see that the rapid in motalum stream begin to draw wheel ' say ulvåsa-lady -- and now two bright red spot come to she cheek for she begin to be impatient -- ' i hear hammer resound in motalum and loom clatter in norrköping ' ` yes that be good to know ' say the peasant ` but everything be perishable and i be afraid that even this can be forget and go into oblivion ' when the peasant be not satisfied even now there be a end to the lady 's patience ` you say that everything be perishable ' say she ` but now i shall still name something which will always be like itself and that be that such arrogant and pig-headed peasant as you will always be find in this province -- until the end of time ' hardly have ulvåsa-lady say this before the peasant rise -- happy and satisfied -- and thank she for a good answer now at last he be satisfied he say ` verily i understand now how you look at it ' then say ulvåsa-lady ` well i look at it in this way dear lady ' say the peasant ` that everything which king and priest and nobleman and merchant build and accomplish can only endure for a few year but when you tell I that in östergötland there will always be peasant who be honour-loving and persevere then i know also that it will be able to keep its ancient glory for it be only those who go bent under the eternal labor with the soil who can hold this land in good repute and honor -- from one time to another ' the homespun cloth _ Saturday April twenty-third _ the boy ride forward -- way up in the air he have the great östergötland plain under he and sit and count the many white church which tower above the small leafy grove around they it be not long before he have count fifty after that he become confused and could not keep track of the count nearly all the farm be build up with large whitewashed two-story house which look so impose that the boy could not help admire they there can not be any peasant in this land he say to himself since i do not see any peasant farm immediately all the wild goose shriek : here the peasant live like gentleman here the peasant live like gentleman on the plain the ice and snow have disappear and the spring work have begin what kind of long crab be those that creep over the field ask the boy after a bit plough and ox plough and ox answer the wild goose the oxen move so slowly down on the field that one could scarcely perceive they be in motion and the goose shout to they : you will not get there before next year you will not get there before next year but the ox be equal to the occasion they raise they muzzle in the air and bellow : we do more good in a hour than such as you do in a whole lifetime in a few place the plough be draw by horse they go along with much more eagerness and haste than the ox but the goose could not keep from tease these either ar 'n' t you ashamed to be do ox-duty cry the wild goose ar 'n' t you ashamed yourselve to be do lazy man 's duty the horse neigh back at they but while horse and ox be at work in the field the stable ram walk about in the barnyard he be newly clip and touchy knock over the small boy chase the shepherd dog into he kennel and then strut about as though he alone be lord of the whole place rammie rammie what have you do with you wool ask the wild goose who ride by up in the air that i have send to drag 's woollen mill in norrköping reply the ram with a long drawn-out bleat rammie rammie what have you do with you horn ask the goose but any horn the rammie have never possess to he sorrow and one could not offer he a greater insult than to ask after they he run around a long time and but at the air so furious be he on the country road come a man who drive a flock of skåne pig that be not more than a few week old and be go to be sell up country they trot along bravely as little as they be and keep close together -- as if they seek protection nuff nuff nuff we come away too soon from father and mother nuff nuff nuff how will it go with we poor child say the little pig the wild goose do not have the heart to tease such poor little creature it will be better for you than you can ever believe they cry as they fly past they the wild goose be never so merry as when they fly over a flat country then they do not hurry themselves but fly from farm to farm and joke with the tame animal as the boy ride over the plain he happen to think of a legend which he have hear a long time ago he do not remember it exactly but it be something about a petticoat -- half of which be make of gold-woven velvet and half of gray homespun cloth but the one who own the petticoat adorn the homespun cloth with such a lot of pearl and precious stone that it look richer and more gorgeous than the gold-cloth he remember this about the homespun cloth as he look down on östergötland because it be make up of a large plain which lay wedge in between two mountainous forest-tract -- one to the north the other to the south the two forest-height lay there a lovely blue and shimmer in the morning light as if they be deck with golden veil and the plain which simply spread out one winter-naked field after another be in and of itself prettier to look upon than gray homespun but the people must have be contented on the plain because it be generous and kind and they have try to decorate it in the best way possible high up -- where the boy ride by -- he think that city and farm church and factory castle and railway station be scatter over it like large and small trinket it shine on the roof and the window-panes glitter like jewel yellow country road shine railway-track and blue canal run along between the district like embroidered loop linköping lay around its cathedral like a pearl-setting around a precious stone and the garden in the country be like little brooch and button there be not much regulation in the pattern but it be a display of grandeur which one could never tire of look at the goose have leave öberg district and travel toward the east along göta canal this be also get itself ready for the summer workman lay canal-bank and tar the huge lock-gate they be work everywhere to receive spring fittingly even in the city there mason and painter stand on scaffolding and make fine the exterior of the house while maid be clean the window down at the harbor sailboat and steamer be be wash and dress up at norrköping the wild goose leave the plain and fly up toward kolmården for a time they have follow a old hilly country road which wind around cliff and run forward under wild mountain-wall -- when the boy suddenly let out a shriek he have be sit and swing he foot back and forth and one of he wooden shoe have slip off goosey-gander goosey-gander i have drop my shoe cry the boy the goosey-gander turn about and sink toward the ground then the boy see that two child who be walk along the road have pick up he shoe goosey-gander goosey-gander scream the boy excitedly fly upward again it be too late i can not get my shoe back again down on the road stand osa the goose-girl and she brother little mat look at a tiny wooden shoe that have fall from the sky osa the goose-girl stand silent a long while and ponder over the find at last she say slowly and thoughtfully : do you remember little mat that when we go past övid cloister we hear that the folk in a farmyard have see a elf who be dress in leather breeches and have wooden shoe on he foot like any other work man and do you recollect when we come to vittskövle a girl tell we that she have see a goa-nisse with wooden shoe who fly away on the back of a goose and when we ourselves come home to we cabin little mat we see a goblin who be dress in the same way and who also straddle the back of a goose -- and fly away maybe it be the same one who ride along on he goose up here in the air and drop he wooden shoe yes it must have be say little mat they turn the wooden shoe about and examine it carefully -- for it be not every day that one happen across a goa-nisse 's wooden shoe on the highway wait wait little mat say osa the goose-girl there be something write on one side of it why so there be but they be such tiny letter let I see it say -- it say : ` nil holgersson from w vemminghög ' that be the most wonderful thing i have ever hear say little mat the story of karr and grayskin karr about twelve year before nil holgersson start on he travels with the wild goose there be a manufacturer at kolmården who want to be rid of one of he dog he send for he game-keeper and say to he that it be impossible to keep the dog because he could not be break of the habit of chase all the sheep and fowl he set eye on and he ask the man to take the dog into the forest and shoot he the game-keeper slip the leash on the dog to lead he to a spot in the forest where all the superannuated dog from the manor be shoot and bury he be not a cruel man but he be very glad to shoot that dog for he know that sheep and chicken be not the only creature he hunt time without number he have go into the forest and help himself to a hare or a grouse-chick the dog be a little black-and-tan setter he name be karr and he be so wise he understand all that be say as the game-keeper be lead he through the thicket karr know only too well what be in store for he but this no one could have guess by he behavior for he neither hang he head nor drag he tail but seem as unconcerned as ever it be because they be in the forest that the dog be so careful not to appear the least bit anxious there be great stretch of woodland on every side of the factory and this forest be famed both among animal and human being because for many many year the owner have be so careful of it that they have begrudge themselves even the tree need for firewood nor have they have the heart to thin or train they the tree have be allow to grow as they please naturally a forest thus protect be a beloved refuge for wild animal which be to be find there in great number among themselves they call it liberty forest and regard it as the best retreat in the whole country as the dog be be lead through the wood he think of what a bugaboo he have be to all the small animal and bird that live there now karr would not they be happy in they lair if they only know what be await you he think but at the same time he wag he tail and bark cheerfully so that no one should think that he be worry or depress what fun would there have be in living have i not hunt occasionally he reason let he who will regret it be not go to be karr but the instant the dog say this a singular change come over he he stretch he neck as though he have a mind to howl he no longer trot alongside the game-keeper but walk behind he it be plain that he have begin to think of something unpleasant it be early summer the elk cow have just give birth to they young and the night before the dog have succeed in parting from its mother a elk calf not more than five day old and have drive it down into the marsh there he have chase it back and forth over the knoll -- not with the idea of capture it but merely for the sport of see how he could scare it the elk cow know that the marsh be bottomless so soon after the thaw and that it could not as yet hold up so large a animal as herself so she stand on the solid earth for the longest time watch but when karr keep chase the calf farther and farther away she rush out on the marsh drive the dog off take the calf with she and turn back toward firm land elk be more skilled than other animal in traverse dangerous marshy ground and it seem as if she would reach solid land in safety but when she be almost there a knoll which she have step upon sink into the mire and she go down with it she try to rise but could get no secure foothold so she sink and sink karr stand and look on not daring to move when he see that the elk could not save herself he run away as fast as he could for he have begin to think of the beating he would get if it be discover that he have bring a mother elk to grief he be so terrify that he dare not pause for breath until he reach home it be this that the dog recall and it trouble he in a way very different from the recollection of all he other misdeed this be doubtless because he have not really mean to kill either the elk cow or she calf but have deprive they of life without wish to do so but maybe they be alive yet think the dog they be not dead when i run away perhaps they save themselves he be seize with a irresistible longing to know for a certainty while yet there be time for he to find out he notice that the game-keeper do not have a firm hold on the leash so he make a sudden spring break loose and dash through the wood down to the marsh with such speed that he be out of sight before the game-keeper have time to level he gun there be nothing for the game-keeper to do but to rush after he when he get to the marsh he find the dog standing upon a knoll howl with all he might the man think he have better find out the meaning of this so he drop he gun and crawl out over the marsh on hand and knee he have not go far when he see a elk cow lie dead in the quagmire close beside she lay a little calf it be still alive but so much exhaust that it could not move karr be stand beside the calf now bend down and lick it now howl shrilly for help the game-keeper raise the calf and begin to drag it toward land when the dog understand that the calf would be save he be wild with joy he jump round and round the game-keeper lick he hand and bark with delight the man carry the baby elk home and shut it up in a calf stall in the cow shed then he get help to drag the mother elk from the marsh only after this have be do do he remember that he be to shoot karr he call the dog to he and again take he into the forest the game-keeper walk straight on toward the dog 's grave but all the while he seem to be think deeply suddenly he turn and walk toward the manor karr have be trot along quietly but when the game-keeper turn and start for home he become anxious the man must have discover that it be he that have cause the death of the elk and now he be go back to the manor to be thrash before he be shoot to be beat be worse than all else with that prospect karr could no longer keep up he spirit but hang he head when he come to the manor he do not look up but pretend that he know no one there the master be stand on the stair lead to the hall when the game-keeper come forward where on earth do that dog come from he exclaim surely it can not be karr he must be dead this long time then the man begin to tell he master all about the mother elk while karr make himself as little as he could and crouch behind the game-keeper 's leg much to he surprise the man have only praise for he he say it be plain the dog know that the elk be in distress and wish to save they you may do as you like but i can not shoot that dog declare the game-keeper karr raise himself and prick up he ear he could hardly believe that he hear aright although he do not want to show how anxious he have be he could not help whine a little could it be possible that he life be to be spare simply because he have feel uneasy about the elk the master think that karr have conduct himself well but as he do not want the dog he could not decide at once what should be do with he if you will take charge of he and answer for he good behavior in the future he may as well live he say finally this the game-keeper be only too glad to do and that be how karr come to move to the game-keeper 's lodge grayskin 's flight from the day that karr go to live with the game-keeper he abandon entirely he forbid chase in the forest this be due not only to he have be thoroughly frightened but also to the fact that he do not wish to make the game-keeper angry at he ever since he new master save he life the dog love he above everything else he think only of follow he and watch over he if he leave the house karr would run ahead to make sure that the way be clear and if he sit at home karr would lie before the door and keep a close watch on every one who come and go when all be quiet at the lodge when no footstep be hear on the road and the game-keeper be work in he garden karr would amuse himself play with the baby elk at first the dog have no desire to leave he master even for a moment since he accompany he everywhere he go with he to the cow shed when he give the elk calf its milk the dog would sit outside the stall and gaze at it the game-keeper call the calf grayskin because he think it do not merit a prettier name and karr agree with he on that point every time the dog look at it he think that he have never see anything so ugly and misshapen as the baby elk with its long shambly leg which hang down from the body like loose stilt the head be large old and wrinkled and it always droop to one side the skin lay in tuck and fold as if the animal have put on a coat that have not be make for he always doleful and discontented curiously enough he jump up every time karr appear as if glad to see he the elk calf become less hopeful from day to day do not grow any and at last he could not even rise when he see karr then the dog jump up into the crib to greet he and thereupon a light kindle in the eye of the poor creature -- as if a cherish longing be fulfil after that karr visit the elk calf every day and spend many hour with he lick he coat playing and racing with he till he teach he a little of everything a forest animal should know it be remarkable that from the time karr begin to visit the elk calf in he stall the latter seem more contented and begin to grow after he be fairly start he grow so rapidly that in a couple of week the stall could no longer hold he and he have to be move into a grove when he have be in the grove two month he leg be so long that he could step over the fence whenever he wish then the lord of the manor give the game-keeper permission to put up a higher fence and to allow he more space here the elk live for several year and grow up into a strong and handsome animal karr keep he company as often as he could but now it be no longer through pity for a great friendship have spring up between the two the elk be always incline to be melancholy listless and indifferent but karr know how to make he playful and happy grayskin have live for five summer on the game-keeper 's place when he owner receive a letter from a zoölogical garden abroad ask if the elk might be purchase the master be please with the proposal the game-keeper be distressed but have not the power to say no so it be decide that the elk should be sell karr soon discover what be in the air and run over to the elk to have a chat with he the dog be very much distressed at the thought of lose he friend but the elk take the matter calmly and seem neither glad nor sorry do you think of let they send you away without offer resistance ask karr what good would it do to resist asked grayskin i should prefer to remain where i be naturally but if i have be sell i shall have to go of course karr look at grayskin and measure he with he eye it be apparent that the elk be not yet full grow he do not have the broad antler high hump and long mane of the mature elk but he certainly have strength enough to fight for he freedom one can see that he have be in captivity all he life think karr but say nothing karr leave and do not return to the grove till long past midnight by that time he know grayskin would be awake and eat he breakfast of course you be do right grayskin in let they take you away remark karr who appear now to be calm and satisfied you will be a prisoner in a large park and will have no responsibility it seem a pity that you must leave here without have see the forest you know you ancestor have a say that ` the elk be one with the forest ' but you have not even be in a forest grayskin glance up from the clover which he stand munch indeed i should love to see the forest but how be i to get over the fence he say with he usual apathy oh that be difficult for one who have such short leg say karr the elk glance slyly at the dog who jump the fence many time a day -- little as he be he walk over to the fence and with one spring he be on the other side without know how it happen then karr and grayskin go into the forest it be a beautiful moonlight night in late summer but in among the tree it be dark and the elk walk along slowly perhaps we have better turn back say karr you who have never before tramp the wild forest might easily break you leg grayskin move more rapidly and with more courage karr conduct the elk to a part of the forest where the pine grow so thickly that no wind could penetrate they it be here that you kind be in the habit of seek shelter from cold and storm say karr here they stand under the open sky all winter but you will fare much better where you be go for you will stand in a shed with a roof over you head like a ox grayskin make no comment but stand quietly and drink in the strong piney air have you anything more to show I or have i now see the whole forest he ask then karr go with he to a big marsh and show he clod and quagmire over this marsh the elk take flight when they be in peril say karr i do not know how they manage it but large and heavy as they be they can walk here without sinking of course you could not hold yourself up on such dangerous ground but then there be no occasion for you to do so for you will never be hound by hunter grayskin make no retort but with a leap he be out on the marsh and happy when he feel how the clod rock under he he dash across the marsh and come back again to karr without have step into a mudhole have we see the whole forest now he ask no not yet say karr he next conduct the elk to the skirt of the forest where fine oak linden and aspen grow here you kind eat leaf and bark which they consider the choicest of food but you will probably get better fare abroad grayskin be astonish when he see the enormous leaf-tree spread like a great canopy above he he eat both oak leave and aspen bark these taste deliciously bitter and good he remark better than clover then be not it well that you should taste they once say the dog thereupon he take the elk down to a little forest lake the water be as smooth as a mirror and reflect the shore which be veil in thin light mist when grayskin see the lake he stand entranced what be this karr he ask it be the first time that he have see a lake it be a large body of water -- a lake say karr you people swim across it from shore to shore one could hardly expect you to be familiar with this but at least you should go in and take a swim karr himself plunge into the water for a swim grayskin stay back on the shore for some little time but finally follow he grow breathless with delight as the cool water steal soothingly around he body he want it over he back too so go farther out then he feel that the water could hold he up and begin to swim he swim all around karr duck and snort perfectly at home in the water when they be on shore again the dog ask if they have not better go home now it be a long time until morning observe grayskin so we can tramp around in the forest a little longer they go again into the pine wood presently they come to a open glade illuminate by the moonlight where grass and flower shimmer beneath the dew some large animal be grazing on this forest meadow -- a elk bull several elk cow and a number of elk calf when grayskin catch sight of they he stop short he hardly glance at the cow or the young one but stare at the old bull which have broad antler with many taglet a high hump and a long-haired fur piece hang down from he throat what kind of a animal be that ask grayskin in wonderment he be call antler-crown say karr and he be you kinsman one of these day you too will have broad antler like those and just such a mane and if you be to remain in the forest very likely you also would have a herd to lead if he be my kinsman i must go closer and have a look at he say grayskin i never dream that a animal could be so stately grayskin walk over to the elk but almost immediately he come back to karr who have remain at the edge of the clearing you be not very well receive be you say karr i tell he that this be the first time i have run across any of my kinsman and ask if i might walk with they on they meadow but they drive I back threaten I with they antler you do right to retreat say karr a young elk bull with only a taglet crown must be careful about fight with a old elk another would have disgrace he name in the whole forest by retreat without resistance but such thing need not worry you who be go to move to a foreign land karr have barely finish speaking when grayskin turn and walk down to the meadow the old elk come toward he and instantly they begin to fight they antler meet and clash and grayskin be drive backward over the whole meadow apparently he do not know how to make use of he strength but when he come to the edge of the forest he plant he foot on the ground push hard with he antler and begin to force antler-crown back grayskin fight quietly while antler-crown puffed and snort the old elk in he turn be now be force backward over the meadow suddenly a loud crash be hear a taglet in the old elk 's antler have snap he tear himself loose and dash into the forest karr be still stand at the forest border when grayskin come along now that you have see what there be in the forest say karr will you come home with I yes it be about time observe the elk both be silent on the way home karr sigh several time as if he be disappoint about something but grayskin step along -- he head in the air -- and seem delighted over the adventure he walk ahead unhesitatingly until they come to the enclosure there he pause he look in at the narrow pen where he have live up till now see the beaten ground the stale fodder the little trough where he have drunk water and the dark shed in which he have sleep the elk be one with the forest he cry then he throw back he head so that he neck rest against he back and rush wildly into the wood helpless the water-snake in a pine thicket in the heart of liberty forest every year in the month of August there appear a few grayish-white moth of the kind which be call nun moth they be small and few in number and scarcely any one notice they when they have flutter about in the depth of the forest a couple of night they lay a few thousand egg on the branch of tree and shortly afterward drop lifeless to the ground when spring come little prickly caterpillar crawl out from the egg and begin to eat the pine needle they have good appetite but they never seem to do the tree any serious harm because they be hotly pursue by bird it be seldom that more than a few hundred caterpillar escape the pursuer the poor thing that live to be full grown crawl up on the branch spin white web around themselves and sit for a couple of week as motionless pupa during this period as a rule more than half of they be abducted if a hundred nun moth come forth in August wing and perfect it be reckon a good year for they this sort of uncertain and obscure existence do the moth lead for many year in liberty forest there be no insect folk in the whole country that be so scarce and they would have remain quite harmless and powerless have they not most unexpectedly receive a helper this fact have some connection with grayskin 's flight from the game-keeper 's paddock grayskin roam the forest that he might become more familiar with the place late in the afternoon he happen to squeeze through some thicket behind a clearing where the soil be muddy and slimy and in the center of it be a murky pool this open space be encircle by tall pine almost bare from age and miasmic air grayskin be displeased with the place and would have leave it at once have he not catch sight of some bright green calla leave which grow near the pool as he bent he head toward the calla stalk he happen to disturb a big black snake which lay sleep under they grayskin have hear karr speak of the poisonous adder that be to be find in the forest so when the snake raise its head shoot out its tongue and hiss at he he think he have encounter a awfully dangerous reptile he be terrify and raise he foot he strike so hard with he hoof that he crush the snake 's head then away he run in hot haste as soon as grayskin have go another snake just as long and as black as the first come up from the pool it crawl over to the dead one and lick the poor crushed-in head can it be true that you be dead old harmless hiss the snake we two have live together so many year we two have be so happy with each other and have fare so well here in the swamp that we have live to be older than all the other water-snake in the forest this be the worst sorrow that could have befall I the snake be so broken-hearted that he long body writhe as if it have be wound even the frog who live in constant fear of he be sorry for he what a wicked creature he must be to murder a poor water-snake that can not defend itself hiss the snake he certainly deserve a severe punishment as sure as my name be helpless and i be the oldest water-snake in the whole forest i 'll be avenge i shall not rest until that elk lie as dead on the ground as my poor old snake-wife when the snake have make this vow he curl up into a hoop and begin to ponder one can hardly imagine anything that would be more difficult for a poor water-snake than to wreak vengeance upon a big strong elk and old helpless pondered day and night without find any solution one night as he lay there with he vengeance-thought he hear a slight rustle over he head he glance up and see a few light nun moth play in among the tree he follow they with he eye a long while then begin to hiss loudly to himself apparently pleased with the thought that have occur to he -- then he fall asleep the next morning the water-snake go over to see crawlie the adder who live in a stony and hilly part of liberty forest he tell he all about the death of the old water-snake and beg that he who could deal such deadly thrust would undertake the work of vengeance but crawlie be not exactly disposed to go to war with a elk if i be to attack a elk say the adder he would instantly kill I old harmless be dead and go and we can not bring she back to life so why should i rush into danger on she account when the water-snake get this reply he raise he head a whole foot from the ground and hiss furiously : vish vash vish vash he say it be a pity that you who have be bless with such weapon of defense should be so cowardly that you do not dare use they when the adder hear this he too get angry crawl away old helpless he hiss the poison be in my fang but i would rather spare one who be say to be my kinsman but the water-snake do not move from the spot and for a long time the snake lay there hiss abusive epithet at each other when crawlie be so angry that he could not hiss but could only dart he tongue out the water-snake change the subject and begin to talk in a very different tone i have still another errand crawlie he say lower he voice to a mild whisper but now i suppose you be so angry that you would not care to help I if you do not ask anything foolish of I i shall certainly be at you service in the pine tree down by the swamp live a moth folk that fly around all night i know all about they remark crawlie what be up with they now they be the smallest insect family in the forest say helpless and the most harmless since the caterpillar content themselves with gnawing only pine needle yes i know say crawlie i be afraid those moth will soon be exterminate sigh the water-snake there be so many who pick off the caterpillar in the spring now crawlie begin to understand that the water-snake want the caterpillar for he own purpose and he answer pleasantly : do you wish I to say to the owl that they be to leave those pine tree worm in peace yes it would be well if you who have some authority in the forest should do this say helpless i might also drop a good word for the pine needle picker among the thrush volunteer the adder i will gladly serve you when you do not demand anything unreasonable now you have give I a good promise crawlie say helpless and i be glad that i come to you the nun moth one morning -- several year later -- karr lay asleep on the porch it be in the early summer the season of light night and it be as bright as day although the sun be not yet up karr be awaken by some one call he name be it you grayskin he ask for he be accustom to the elk 's nightly visit again he hear the call then he recognize grayskin 's voice and hasten in the direction of the sound karr hear the elk 's footfall in the distance as he dash into the thickest pine wood and straight through the brush follow no trodden path karr could not catch up with he and he have great difficulty in even follow the trail karr karrus come the cry and the voice be certainly grayskin 's although it have a ring now which the dog have never hear before i be come i be come the dog respond where be you karr karr do not you see how it fall and fall say grayskin then karr notice that the pine needle keep drop and drop from the tree like a steady fall of rain yes i see how it fall he cry and run far into the forest in search of the elk grayskin keep run through the thicket while karr be about to lose the trail again karr karr roar grayskin can not you scent that peculiar odour in the forest karr stop and sniff he have not think of it before but now he remark that the pine send forth a much stronger odour than usual yes i catch the scent he say he do not stop long enough to find out the cause of it but hurry on after grayskin the elk run ahead with such speed that the dog could not catch up with he karr karr he call can not you hear the crunching on the pine now he tone be so plaintive it would have melt a stone karr pause to listen he hear a faint but distinct tap tap on the tree it sound like the ticking of a watch yes i hear how it tick cry karr and run no farther he understand that the elk do not want he to follow but to take notice of something that be happen in the forest karr be stand beneath the droop branch of a great pine he look carefully at it the needle move he go closer and see a mass of grayish-white caterpillar creep along the branch gnawing off the needle every branch be cover with they the crunch crunch in the tree come from the working of they busy little jaw gnawed-off needle fall to the ground in a continuous shower and from the poor pine there come such a strong odour that the dog suffer from it what can be the meaning of this wonder karr it be too bad about the pretty tree soon they 'll have no beauty leave he walk from tree to tree try with he poor eyesight to see if all be well with they there be a pine they have not touch he think but they have take possession of it too and here be a birch -- no this also the game-keeper will not be please with this observe karr he run deeper into the thicket to learn how far the destruction have spread wherever he go he hear the same tick scented the same odour see the same needle rain there be no need of he pause to investigate he understand it all by these sign the little caterpillar be everywhere the whole forest be be ravage by they all of a sudden he come to a tract where there be no odour and where all be still here be the end of they domain think the dog as he pause and glance about but here it be even worse for the caterpillar have already do they work and the tree be needleless they be like the dead the only thing that cover they be a network of ragged thread which the caterpillar have spin to use as road and bridge in there among the die tree grayskin stand wait for karr he be not alone with he be four old elk -- the most respect in the forest karr know they : they be crooked-back who be a small elk but have a larger hump than the other antler-crown who be the most dignified of the elk rough-mane with the thick coat and a old long-legged one who up till the autumn before when he get a bullet in he thigh have be terribly hot-tempered and quarrelsome what in the world be happen to the forest karr ask when he come up to the elk they stand with lowered head far protrude upper lip and look puzzle no one can tell answer grayskin this insect family use to be the least hurtful of any in the forest and never before have they do any damage but these last few year they have be multiply so fast that now it appear as if the entire forest would be destroy yes it look bad karr agree but i see that the wisest animal in the forest have come together to hold a consultation perhaps you have already find some remedy when the dog say this crooked-back solemnly raise he heavy head prick up he long ear and speak : we have summon you hither karr that we may learn if the human know of this desolation no say karr no human be ever come thus far into the forest when it be not hunting time they know nothing of this misfortune then antler-crown say : we who have live long in the forest do not think that we can fight this insect pest all by ourselves after this there will be no peace in the forest put in rough-mane but we can not let the whole liberty forest go to rack and ruin protest big-and-strong we 'll have to consult the human there be no alternative karr understand that the elk have difficulty in express what they wish to say and he try to help they perhaps you want I to let the people know the condition here he suggest all the old elk nod they head it be most unfortunate that we be oblige to ask help of human being but we have no choice a moment later karr be on he way home as he run ahead deeply distressed over all that he have hear and see a big black water-snake approach they well meet in the forest hiss the water-snake well meet again snarl karr and rush by without stop the snake turn and try to catch up to he perhaps that creature also be worried about the forest think karr and wait immediately the snake begin to talk about the great disaster there will be a end of peace and quiet in the forest when human being be call hither say the snake i be afraid there will the dog agree but the oldest forest dweller know what they be about he add i think i know a better plan say the snake if i can get the reward i wish be you not the one whom every one around here call old helpless say the dog sneeringly i be a old inhabitant of the forest say the snake and i know how to get rid of such plague if you clear the forest of that pest i feel sure you can have anything you ask for say karr the snake do not respond to this until he have crawl under a tree stump where he be well protect then he say : tell grayskin that if he will leave liberty forest forever and go far north where no oak tree grow i will send sickness and death to all the creep thing that gnaw the pine and spruce what be that you say ask karr bristle up what harm have grayskin ever do you he have slay the one whom i love best the snake declare and i want to be avenge before the snake have finish speak karr make a dash for he but the reptile lay safely hide under the tree stump stay where you be karr conclude we 'll manage to drive out the caterpillar without you help the big war of the moth the following spring as karr be dash through the forest one morning he hear some one behind he call : karr karr he turn and see a old fox standing outside he lair you must tell I if the human be do anything for the forest say the fox yes you may be sure they be say karr they be work as hard as they can they have kill off all my kinsfolk and they 'll be kill I next protest the fox but they shall be pardon for that if only they save the forest that year karr never run into the wood without some animal 's ask if the human could save the forest it be not easy for the dog to answer the people themselves be not certain that they could conquer the moth but consider how fear and hate old kolmården have always be it be remarkable that every day more than a hundred man go there to work they clear away the underbrush they fell dead tree lop off branch from the live one so that the caterpillar could not easily crawl from tree to tree they also dig wide trench around the ravage part and put up lime-washed fence to keep they out of new territory then they paint ring of lime around the trunk of tree to prevent the caterpillar leave those they have already strip the idea be to force they to remain where they be until they starve to death the people work with the forest until far into the spring they be hopeful and could hardly wait for the caterpillar to come out from they egg feel certain that they have shut they in so effectually that most of they would die of starvation but in the early summer the caterpillar come out more numerous than ever they be everywhere they crawl on the country road on fence on the wall of the cabin they wander outside the confines of liberty forest to other part of kolmården they will not stop till all we forest be destroy sigh the people who be in great despair and could not enter the forest without weep karr be so sick of the sight of all these creep gnawing thing that he could hardly bear to step outside the door but one day he feel that he must go and find out how grayskin be get on he take the shortest cut to the elk 's haunt and hurry along -- he nose close to the earth when he come to the tree stump where he have meet helpless the year before the snake be still there and call to he : have you tell grayskin what i say to you when last we meet ask the water-snake karr only growl and try to get at he if you have not tell he by all means do so insist the snake you must see that the human know of no cure for this plague neither do you retort the dog and run on karr find grayskin but the elk be so low-spirited that he scarcely greet the dog he begin at once to talk of the forest i do not know what i would not give if this misery be only at a end he say now i shall tell you that ` tis say you could save the forest then karr deliver the water-snake 's message if any one but helpless have promise this i should immediately go into exile declare the elk but how can a poor water-snake have the power to work such a miracle of course it be only a bluff say karr water-snake always like to pretend that they know more than other creature when karr be ready to go home grayskin accompany he part of the way presently karr hear a thrush perch on a pine top cry : there go grayskin who have destroy the forest there go grayskin who have destroy the forest karr think that he have not hear correctly but the next moment a hare come dart across the path when the hare see they he stop flap he ear and scream : here come grayskin who have destroy the forest then he run as fast as he could what do they mean by that ask karr i really do not know say grayskin i think that the small forest animal be displeased with I because i be the one who propose that we should ask help of human being when the underbrush be cut down all they lair and hide place be destroy they walk on together a while longer and karr hear the same cry come from all direction : there go grayskin who have destroy the forest grayskin pretend not to hear it but karr understand why the elk be so downhearted i say grayskin what do the water-snake mean by say you kill the one he love best how can i tell say grayskin you know very well that i never kill anything shortly after that they meet the four old elk -- crooked-back antler-crown rough-mane and big-and-strong who be come along slowly one after the other well meet in the forest call grayskin well meet in turn answer the elk we be just look for you grayskin to consult with you about the forest the fact be begin crooked-back we have be inform that a crime have be commit here and that the whole forest be be destroy because the criminal have not be punish what kind of a crime be it some one kill a harmless creature that he could not eat such a act be account a crime in liberty forest who could have do such a cowardly thing wonder grayskin they say that a elk do it and we be just go to ask if you know who it be no say grayskin i have never hear of a elk kill a harmless creature grayskin part from the four old elk and go on with karr he be silent and walk with lowered head they happen to pass crawlie the adder who lay on he shelf of rock there go grayskin who have destroy the whole forest hiss crawlie like all the rest by that time grayskin 's patience be exhaust he walk up to the snake and raise a forefoot do you think of crush I as you crush the old water-snake hiss crawlie do i kill a water-snake asked grayskin astonish the first day you be in the forest you kill the wife of poor old helpless say crawlie grayskin turn quickly from the adder and continue he walk with karr suddenly he stop karr it be i who commit that crime i kill a harmless creature therefore it be on my account that the forest be be destroy what be you say karr interrupted you may tell the water-snake helpless that grayskin go into exile to-night that i shall never tell he protest karr the far north be a dangerous country for elk do you think that i wish to remain here when i have cause a disaster like this protest grayskin do not be rash sleep over it before you do anything it be you who teach I that the elk be one with the forest say grayskin and so say he part from karr the dog go home alone but this talk with grayskin trouble he and the next morning he return to the forest to seek he but grayskin be not to be find and the dog do not search long for he he realize that the elk have take the snake at he word and have go into exile on he walk home karr be too unhappy for word he could not understand why grayskin should allow that wretch of a water-snake to trick he away he have never hear of such folly what power can that old helpless have as karr walk along he mind full of these thought he happen to see the game-keeper who stand point up at a tree what be you look at ask a man who stand beside he sickness have come among the caterpillar observe the game-keeper karr be astonished but he be even more angered at the snake 's have the power to keep he word grayskin would have to stay away a long long time for of course that water-snake would never die at the very height of he grief a thought come to karr which comfort he a little perhaps the water-snake will not live so long after all he think surely he can not always lie protect under a tree root as soon as he have clean out the caterpillar i know some one who be go to bite he head off it be true that a illness have make its appearance among the caterpillar the first summer it do not spread much it have only just break out when it be time for the larva to turn into pupa from the latter come million of moth they fly around in the tree like a blinding snowstorm and lay countless number of egg a even greater destruction be prophesy for the following year the destruction come not only to the forest but also to the caterpillar the sickness spread quickly from forest to forest the sick caterpillar stop eat crawl up to the branch of the tree and die there there be great rejoicing among the people when they see they die but there be even greater rejoicing among the forest animal from day to day the dog karr go about with savage glee thinking of the hour when he might venture to kill helpless but the caterpillar meanwhile have spread over mile of pine wood not in one summer do the disease reach they all many live to become pupa and moth grayskin send message to he friend karr by the bird of passage to say that he be alive and faring well but the bird tell karr confidentially that on several occasion grayskin have be pursue by poacher and that only with the greatest difficulty have he escape karr live in a state of continual grief yearning and anxiety yet he have to wait two whole summer more before there be a end of the caterpillar karr no sooner hear the game-keeper say that the forest be out of danger than he start on a hunt for helpless but when he be in the thick of the forest he make a frightful discovery : he could not hunt any more he could not run he could not track he enemy and he could not see at all during the long year of wait old age have overtake karr he have grow old without have notice it he have not the strength even to kill a water-snake he be not able to save he friend grayskin from he enemy retribution one afternoon akka from kebnekaise and she flock alight on the shore of a forest lake spring be backward -- as it always be in the mountain district ice cover all the lake save a narrow strip next the land the goose at once plunge into the water to bathe and hunt for food in the morning nil holgersson have drop one of he wooden shoe so he go down by the elm and birch that grow along the shore to look for something to bind around he foot the boy walk quite a distance before he find anything that he could use he glance about nervously for he do not fancy be in the forest give I the plain and the lake he think there you can see what you be likely to meet now if this be a grove of little birch it would be well enough for then the ground would be almost bare but how people can like these wild pathless forest be incomprehensible to I if i own this land i would chop down every tree at last he catch sight of a piece of birch bark and just as he be fitting it to he foot he hear a rustle behind he he turn quickly a snake dart from the brush straight toward he the snake be uncommonly long and thick but the boy soon see that it have a white spot on each cheek why it be only a water-snake he laugh it can not harm I but the next instant the snake give he a powerful blow on the chest that knock he down the boy be on he foot in a second and run away but the snake be after he the ground be stony and scrubby the boy could not proceed very fast and the snake be close at he heel then the boy see a big rock in front of he and begin to scale it i do hope the snake can not follow I here he think but he have no sooner reach the top of the rock than he see that the snake be follow he quite close to the boy on a narrow ledge at the top of the rock lay a round stone as large as a man 's head as the snake come closer the boy run behind the stone and give it a push it roll right down on the snake draw it along to the ground where it land on its head that stone do its work well think the boy with a sigh of relief as he see the snake squirm a little and then lie perfectly still i do not think i have be in greater peril on the whole journey he say he have hardly recover from the shock when he hear a rustle above he and see a bird circle through the air to light on the ground right beside the snake the bird be like a crow in size and form but be dress in a pretty coat of shiny black feather the boy cautiously retreat into a crevice of the rock he adventure in be kidnap by crow be still fresh in he memory and he do not care to show himself when there be no need of it the bird stride back and forth beside the snake 's body and turn it over with he beak finally he spread he wing and begin to shriek in ear-splitting tone : it be certainly helpless the water-snake that lie dead here once more he walk the length of the snake then he stand in a deep study and scratch he neck with he foot it be not possible that there can be two such big snake in the forest he ponder it must surely be helpless he be just go to thrust he beak into the snake but suddenly check himself you must not be a numbskull batakus he remark to himself surely you can not be think of eat the snake until you have call karr he would not believe that helpless be dead unless he could see it with he own eye the boy try to keep quiet but the bird be so ludicrously solemn as he stalk back and forth chatter to himself that he have to laugh the bird hear he and with a flap of he wing he be up on the rock the boy rise quickly and walk toward he be you not the one who be call batakus the raven and be you not a friend of akka from kebnekaise ask the boy the bird regard he intently then nod three time surely you be not the little chap who fly around with the wild goose and whom they call thumbietot oh you be not so far out of the way say the boy what luck that i should have run across you perhaps you can tell I who kill this water-snake the stone which i roll down on he kill he reply the boy and related how the whole thing happen that be cleverly do for one who be as tiny as you be say the raven i have a friend in these part who will be glad to know that this snake have be kill and i should like to render you a service in return then tell I why you be glad the water-snake be dead respond the boy it be a long story say the raven you would not have the patience to listen to it but the boy insist that he have and then the raven tell he the whole story about karr and grayskin and helpless the water-snake when he have finish the boy sit quietly for a moment look straight ahead then he speak : i seem to like the forest better since hear this i wonder if there be anything left of the old liberty forest ' most of it have be destroy say batakus the tree look as if they have pass through a fire they 'll have to be clear away and it will take many year before the forest will be what it once be that snake deserve he death declare the boy but i wonder if it could be possible that he be so wise he could send sickness to the caterpillar perhaps he know that they frequently become sick in that way intimate batakus yes that may be but all the same i must say that he be a very wily snake the boy stop talk because he see the raven be not listen to he but sit with gaze avert hark he say karr be in the vicinity will not he be happy when he see that helpless be dead the boy turn he head in the direction of the sound he be talk with the wild goose he say oh you may be sure that he have drag himself down to the strand to get the latest news about grayskin both the boy and the raven jump to the ground and hasten down to the shore all the goose have come out of the lake and stand talk with a old dog who be so weak and decrepit that it seem as if he might drop dead at any moment there be karr say batakus to the boy let he hear first what the wild goose have to say to he later we shall tell he that the water-snake be dead presently they hear akka talk to karr it happen last year while we be make we usual spring trip remark the leader-goose we start out one morning -- yksi kaksi and i and we fly over the great boundary forest between dalecarlium and hälsingland under we we see only thick pine forest the snow be still deep among the tree and the creek be mostly frozen suddenly we notice three poacher down in the forest they be on ski have dog in leash carry knife in they belt but have no gun as there be a hard crust on the snow they do not bother to take the wind forest path but ski straight ahead apparently they know very well where they must go to find what they be seek we wild goose fly on high up in the air so that the whole forest under we be visible when we sight the poacher we want to find out where the game be so we circle up and down peer through the tree then in a dense thicket we see something that look like big moss-covered rock but could not be rock for there be no snow on they we shoot down suddenly and light in the center of the thicket the three rock move they be three elk -- a bull and two cow -- rest in the bleak forest when we alight the elk bull rise and come toward we he be the most superb animal we have ever see when he see that it be only some poor wild goose that have awaken he he lay down again ` no old granddaddy you must not go back to sleep ' i cry ` flee as fast as you can there be poacher in the forest and they be bind for this very deer fold ' ` thank you goose mother ' say the elk he seem to be drop to sleep while he be speak ` but surely you must know that we elk be under the protection of the law at this time of the year those poacher be probably out for fox ' he yawn ` there be plenty of fox trail in the forest but the poacher be not look for they believe I old granddaddy they know that you be lie here and be come to attack you they have no gun with they -- only spear and knife -- for they dare not fire a shot at this season ' the elk bull lay there calmly but the elk cow seem to feel uneasy ` it may be as the goose say ' they remark begin to bestir themselves ` you just lie down ' say the elk bull ` there be no poacher come here of that you may be certain ' there be nothing more to be do so we wild goose rise again into the air but we continue to circle over the place to see how it would turn out for the elk we have hardly reach we regular fly altitude when we see the elk bull come out from the thicket he sniff the air a little then walk straight toward the poacher as he stride along he step upon dry twig that crackle noisily a big barren marsh lay just beyond he thither he go and take he stand in the middle where there be nothing to hide he from view there he stand until the poacher emerge from the wood then he turn and flee in the opposite direction the poacher let loose the dog and they themselves ski after he at full speed the elk throw back he head and lope as fast as he could he kick up snow until it fly like a blizzard about he both dog and man be leave far behind then the elk stop as if to await they approach when they be within sight he dash ahead again we understand that he be purposely tempting the hunter away from the place where the cow be we think it brave of he to face danger himself in order that those who be dear to he might be leave in safety none of we want to leave the place until we have see how all this be to end thus the chase continue for two hour or more we wonder that the poacher go to the trouble of pursue the elk when they be not arm with rifle they could not have think that they could succeed in tire out a runner like he then we notice that the elk no longer run so rapidly he step on the snow more carefully and every time he lift he foot blood could be see in he track we understand why the poacher have be so persistent they have count on help from the snow the elk be heavy and with every step he sink to the bottom of the drift the hard crust on the snow be scrape he leg it scrape away the fur and tear out piece of flesh so that he be in torture every time he put he foot down the poacher and the dog who be so light that the ice crust could hold they weight pursue he all the while he run on and on -- he step become more and more uncertain and falter he gasp for breath not only do he suffer intense pain but he be also exhaust from wade through the deep snowdrift at last he lose all patience he pause to let poacher and dog come upon he and be ready to fight they as he stand there wait he glance upward when he see we wild goose circle above he he cry out : ` stay here wild goose until all be over and the next time you fly over kolmården look up karr and ask he if he do not think that he friend grayskin have meet with a happy end ' when akka have go so far in she story the old dog rise and walk nearer to she grayskin lead a good life he say he understand I he know that i be a brave dog and that i shall be glad to hear that he have a happy end now tell I how -- he raise he tail and throw back he head as if to give himself a bold and proud bearing -- then he collapse karr karr call a man 's voice from the forest the old dog rise obediently my master be call I he say and i must not tarry longer i just see he load he gun now we two be go into the forest for the last time many thanks wild goose i know everything that i need know to die content the wind witch in närke in bygone day there be something in närke the like of which be not to be find elsewhere : it be a witch name ysätter-kaisa the name kaisa have be give she because she have a good deal to do with wind and storm -- and these wind witch be always so call the surname be add because she be suppose to have come from ysätter swamp in asker parish it seem as though she real abode must have be at asker but she use also to appear at other place nowhere in all närke could one be sure of not meet she she be no dark mournful witch but gay and frolicsome and what she love most of all be a gale of wind as soon as there be wind enough off she would fly to the närke plain for a good dance on day when a whirlwind sweep the plain ysätter-kaisa have fun she would stand right in the wind and spin round she long hair fly up among the cloud and the long trail of she robe sweep the ground like a dust cloud while the whole plain lay spread out under she like a ballroom floor of a morning ysätter-kaisa would sit up in some tall pine at the top of a precipice and look across the plain if it happen to be winter and she see many team on the road she hurriedly blow up a blizzard pile the drift so high that people could barely get back to they home by evening if it chance to be summer and good harvest weather ysätter-kaisa would sit quietly until the first hayrick have be load then down she would come with a couple of heavy shower which put a end to the work for that day it be only too true that she seldom think of anything else than raise mischief the charcoal burner up in the kil mountain hardly dare take a cat-nap for as soon as she see a unwatched kiln she steal up and blow on it until it begin to burn in a great flame if the metal driver from laxå and svartå be out late of a evening ysätter-kaisa would veil the road and the country round about in such dark cloud that both man and horse lose they way and drive the heavy truck down into swamp and morass if on a summer 's day the dean 's wife at glanshammar have spread the tea table in the garden and along would come a gust of wind that lift the cloth from the table and turn over cup and saucer they know who have raise the mischief if the mayor of örebro 's hat blow off so that he have to run across the whole square after it if the wash on the line blow away and get cover with dirt or if the smoke pour into the cabin and seem unable to find its way out through the chimney it be easy enough to guess who be out make merry although ysätter-kaisa be fond of all sort of tantalizing game there be nothing really bad about she one could see that she be hardest on those who be quarrelsome stingy or wicked while honest folk and poor little child she would take under she wing old people say of she that once when asker church be burn ysätter-kaisa sweep through the air light amid fire and smoke on the church roof and avert the disaster all the same the närke folk be often rather tire of ysätter-kaisa but she never tire of play she trick on they as she sit on the edge of a cloud and look down upon närke which rest so peacefully and comfortably beneath she she must have think : the inhabitant would fare much too well if i be not in existence they would grow sleepy and dull there must be some one like myself to rouse they and keep they in good spirit then she would laugh wildly and chatter like a magpie would rush off dancing and spin from one end of the plain to the other when a närke man see she come drag she dust trail over the plain he could not help smile provoke and tiresome she certainly be but she have a merry spirit it be just as refreshing for the peasant to meet ysätter-kaisa as it be for the plain to be lash by the windstorm nowadays ` tis say that ysätter-kaisa be dead and go like all other witch but this one can hardly believe it be as if some one be to come and tell you that henceforth the air would always be still on the plain and the wind would never more dance across it with bluster breeze and drenching shower he who fancy that ysätter-kaisa be dead and go may as well hear what occur in närke the year that nil holgersson travel over that part of the country then let he tell what he think about it market eve _ Wednesday April twenty-seventh _ it be the day before the big cattle fair at örebro it rain in torrent and people think : this be exactly as in ysätter-kaisa 's time at fair she use to be more prankish than usual it be quite in she line to arrange a downpour like this on a market eve as the day wear on the rain increase and toward evening come regular cloud-burst the road be like bottomless swamp the farmer who have start from home with they cattle early in the morning that they might arrive at a seasonable hour fare badly cow and ox be so tired they could hardly move and many of the poor beast drop down in the middle of the road to show that they be too exhaust to go any farther all who live along the roadside have to open they door to the market-bound traveller and harbor they as best they could farm house barn and shed be soon crowd to they limit meanwhile those who could struggle along toward the inn do so but when they arrive they wish they have stop at some cabin along the road all the crib in the barn and all the stall in the stable be already occupy there be no other choice than to let horse and cattle stand out in the rain they master could barely manage to get under cover the crush and mud and slush in the barn yard be frightful some of the animal be stand in puddle and could not even lie down there be thoughtful master of course who procure straw for they animal to lie on and spread blanket over they but there be those also who sit in the inn drinking and gambling entirely forgetful of the dumb creature which they should have protect the boy and the wild goose have come to a little wooded island in hjälmar lake that evening the island be separate from the main land by a narrow and shallow stream and at low tide one could pass over it dry-shoe it rain just as hard on the island as it do everywhere else the boy could not sleep for the water that keep drip down on he finally he get up and begin to walk he fancy that he feel the rain less when he move about he have hardly circle the island when he hear a splashing in the stream presently he see a solitary horse tramp among the tree never in all he life have he see such a wreck of a horse he be broken-winded and stiff-kneed and so thin that every rib could be see under the hide he bear neither harness nor saddle -- only a old bridle from which dangle a half-rotted rope-end obviously he have have no difficulty in break loose the horse walk straight toward the spot where the wild goose be sleep the boy be afraid that he would step on they where be you go feel you ground shout the boy oh there you be exclaim the horse i have walk mile to meet you have you hear of I ask the boy astonished i have get ear even if i be old there be many who talk of you nowadays as he speak the horse bent he head that he might see better and the boy notice that he have a small head beautiful eye and a soft sensitive nose he must have be a good horse at the start though he have come to grief in he old age he think i wish you would come with I and help I with something plead the horse the boy think it would be embarrassing to accompany a creature who look so wretched and excuse himself on account of the bad weather you 'll be no worse off on my back than you be lie here say the horse but perhaps you do not dare to go with a old tramp of a horse like I certainly i dare say the boy then wake the goose so that we can arrange with they where they shall come for you to-morrow say the horse the boy be soon seat on the animal 's back the old nag trot along better than he have think possible it be a long ride in the rain and darkness before they halt near a large inn where everything look terribly uninviting the wheel track be so deep in the road that the boy fear he might drown should he fall down into they alongside the fence which enclose the yard some thirty or forty horse and cattle be tie with no protection against the rain and in the yard be wagon pile with packing case where sheep calf hog and chicken be shut in the horse walk over to the fence and station himself the boy remain seat upon he back and with he good night eye plainly see how badly the animal fare how do you happen to be stand out here in the rain he ask we be on we way to a fair at örebro but we be oblige to put up here on account of the rain this be a inn but so many traveller have already arrive that there be no room for we in the barn the boy make no reply but sit quietly look about he not many of the animal be asleep and on all side he hear complaint and indignant protest they have reason enough for grumble for the weather be even worse than it have be earlier in the day a freezing wind have begin to blow and the rain which come beat down on they be turn to snow it be easy enough to understand what the horse want the boy to help he with do you see that fine farm yard directly opposite the inn remark the horse yes i see it answer the boy and i can not comprehend why they have not try to find shelter for all of you in there they be already full perhaps no there be no stranger in that place say the horse the people who live on that farm be so stingy and selfish that it would be useless for any one to ask they for harbor if that be the case i suppose you 'll have to stand where you be i be bear and raise on that farm say the horse i know that there be a large barn and a big cow shed with many empty stall and manger and i be wonder if you could not manage in some way or other to get we in over there i do not think i could venture -- hesitate the boy but he feel so sorry for the poor beast that he want at least to try he run into the strange barn yard and see at once that all the outhouse be lock and the key go he stand there puzzle and helpless when aid come to he from a unexpected source a gust of wind come sweeping along with terrific force and fling open a shed door right in front of he the boy be not long in get back to the horse it be not possible to get into the barn or the cow house he say but there be a big empty hay shed that they have forget to bolt i can lead you into that thank you say the horse it will seem good to sleep once more on familiar ground it be the only happiness i can expect in this life meanwhile at the flourishing farm opposite the inn the family sit up much later than usual that evening the master of the place be a man of thirty-five tall and dignified with a handsome but melancholy face during the day he have be out in the rain and have get wet like every one else and at supper he ask he old mother who be still mistress of the place to light a fire on the hearth that he might dry he clothes the mother kindle a feeble blaze -- for in that house they be not wasteful with wood -- and the master hang he coat on the back of a chair and place it before the fire with one foot on top of the andiron and a hand rest on he knee he stand gaze into the ember thus he stand for two whole hour make no move other than to cast a log on the fire now and then the mistress remove the supper thing and turn down he bed for the night before she go to she own room and seat herself at interval she come to the door and look wonderingly at she son it be nothing mother i be only think he say he thought be on something that have occur shortly before : when he pass the inn a horse dealer have ask he if he would not like to purchase a horse and have show he a old nag so weather-beaten that he ask the dealer if he take he for a fool since he wish to palm off such a played-out beast on he oh no say the horse dealer i only think that inasmuch as the horse once belong to you you might wish to give he a comfortable home in he old age he have need of it then he look at the horse and recognize it as one which he himself have raise and break in but it do not occur to he to purchase such a old and useless creature on that account no indeed he be not one who squander he money all the same the sight of the horse have awaken many memory -- and it be the memory that keep he awake that horse have be a fine animal he father have let he tend it from the start he have break it in and have love it above everything else he father have complain that he use to feed it too well and often he have be oblige to steal out and smuggle oats to it once when he venture to talk with he father about let he buy a broadcloth suit or have the cart paint he father stand as if petrified and he think the old man would have a stroke he try to make he father understand that when he have a fine horse to drive he should look presentable himself the father make no reply but two day later he take the horse to örebro and sell it it be cruel of he but it be plain that he father have fear that this horse might lead he into vanity and extravagance and now so long afterward he have to admit that he father be right a horse like that surely would have be a temptation at first he have grieve terribly over he loss many a time he have go down to örebro just to stand on a street corner and see the horse pass by or to steal into the stable and give he a lump of sugar he think : if i ever get the farm the first thing i do will be to buy back my horse now he father be go and he himself have be master for two year but he have not make a move toward buy the horse he have not think of he for ever so long until to-night it be strange that he should have forget the beast so entirely he father have be a very headstrong domineering man when he son be grow and the two have work together the father have gain absolute power over he the boy have come to think that everything he father do be right and after he become the master he only try to do exactly as he father would have do he know of course that folk say he father be stingy but it be well to keep a tight hold on one 's purse and not throw away money needlessly the goods one have receive should not be waste it be better to live on a debt-free place and be call stingy than to carry heavy mortgage like other farm owner he have go so far in he mind when he be call back by a strange sound it be as if a shrill mocking voice be repeat he thought : it be better to keep a firm hold on one 's purse and be call stingy than to be in debt like other farm owner it sound as if some one be try to make sport of he wisdom and he be about to lose he temper when he realize that it be all a mistake the wind be begin to rage and he have be stand there get so sleepy that he mistake the howling of the wind in the chimney for human speech he glance up at the wall clock which just then strike eleven it be time that you be in bed he remark to himself then he remember that he have not yet go the round of the farm yard as it be he custom to do every night to make sure that all door be close and all light extinguish this be something he have never neglect since he become master he draw on he coat and go out in the storm he find everything as it should be save that the door to the empty hay shed have be blow open by the wind he step inside for the key lock the shed door and put the key into he coat pocket then he go back to the house remove he coat and hang it before the fire even now he do not retire but begin pacing the floor the storm without with its bite wind and snow-blended rain be terrible and he old horse be stand in this storm without so much as a blanket to protect he he should at least have give he old friend a roof over he head since he have come such a long distance at the inn across the way the boy hear a old wall clock strike eleven time just then he be untie the animal to lead they to the shed in the farm yard opposite it take some time to rouse they and get they into line when all be ready they march in a long procession into the stingy farmer 's yard with the boy as they guide while the boy have be assemble they the farmer have go the round of the farm yard and lock the hay shed so that when the animal come along the door be close the boy stand there dismay he could not let the creature stand out there he must go into the house and find the key keep they quiet out here while i go in and fetch the key he say to the old horse and off he run on the path right in front of the house he pause to think out how he should get inside as he stand there he notice two little wanderer come down the road who stop before the inn the boy see at once that they be two little girl and run toward they come now britta maja say one you must not cry any more now we be at the inn here they will surely take we in the girl have but just say this when the boy call to she : no you must not try to get in there it be simply impossible but at the farm house opposite there be no guest go there instead the little girl hear the word distinctly though they could not see the one who speak to they they do not wonder much at that however for the night be as black as pitch the larger of the girl promptly answer : we do not care to enter that place because those who live there be stingy and cruel it be they fault that we two must go out on the highway and beg that may be so say the boy but all the same you should go there you shall see that it will be well for you we can try but it be doubtful that they will even let we enter observe the two little girl as they walk up to the house and knock the master be stand by the fire thinking of the horse when he hear the knock he step to the door to see what be up think all the while that he would not let himself be tempt into admit any wayfarer as he fumble the lock a gust of wind come along wrench the door from he hand and swing it open to close it he have to step out on the porch and when he step back into the house the two little girl be stand within they be two poor beggar girl ragged dirty and starving -- two little tot bent under the burden of they beggar 's pack which be as large as themselves who be you that go prowl about at this hour of the night say the master gruffly the two child do not answer immediately but first remove they pack then they walk up to the man and stretch forth they tiny hand in greet we be anna and britta maja from the engärd say the elder and we be go to ask for a night 's lodging he do not take the outstretched hand and be just about to drive out the beggar child when a fresh recollection face he engärd -- be not that a little cabin where a poor widow with five child have live the widow have owe he father a few hundred krone and in order to get back he money he have sell she cabin after that the widow with she three eldest child go to norrland to seek employment and the two youngest become a charge on the parish as he call this to mind he grow bitter he know that he father have be severely censure for squeeze out that money which by right belong to he what be you do nowadays he ask in a cross tone do not the board of charity take charge of you why do you roam around and beg it be not we fault reply the larger girl the people with whom we be live have send we out to beg well you pack be fill the farmer observe so you can not complain now you would better take out some of the food you have with you and eat you fill for here you 'll get no food as all the woman folk be in bed later you may lie down in the corner by the hearth so you will not have to freeze he wave he hand as if to ward they off and he eye take on a hard look he be thankful that he have have a father who have be careful of he property otherwise he might perhaps have be force in childhood to run about and beg as these child now do no sooner have he think this out to the end than the shrill mocking voice he have hear once before that evening repeat it word for word he listen and at once understand that it be nothing -- only the wind roaring in the chimney but the queer thing about it be when the wind repeat he thought they seem so strangely stupid and hard and false the child meanwhile have stretch themselves side by side on the floor they be not quiet but lay there mutter do be still will not you he growl for he be in such a irritable mood that he could have beat they but the mumble continue and again he call for silence when mother go away pipe a clear little voice she make I promise that every night i would say my evening prayer i must do this and britta maja too as soon as we have say ` god who care for little child -- ' we 'll be quiet the master sit quite still while the little one say they prayer then he rise and begin pacing back and forth back and forth wring he hand all the while as though he have meet with some great sorrow the horse drive out and wreck these two child turn into road beggar -- both father 's doings perhaps father do not do right after all he think he sit down again and bury he head in he hand suddenly he lip begin to quiver and into he eye come tear which he hastily wipe away fresh tear come and he be just as prompt to brush these away but it be useless for more follow when he mother step into the room he swing he chair quickly and turn he back to she she must have notice something unusual for she stand quietly behind he a long while as if wait for he to speak she realize how difficult it always be for man to talk of the thing they feel most deeply she must help he of course from she bedroom she have observe all that have take place in the living room so that she do not have to ask question she walk very softly over to the two sleep child lift they and bear they to she own bed then she go back to she son lar she say as if she do not see that he be weep you have better let I keep these child what mother he gasp try to smother the sob i have be suffer for year -- ever since father take the cabin from they mother and so have you yes but -- i want to keep they here and make something of they they be too good to beg he could not speak for now the tear be beyond he control but he take he old mother 's withered hand and pat it then he jump up as if something have frighten he what would father have say of this father have he day at rule retort the mother now it be you day as long as father live we have to obey he now be the time to show what you be she son be so astonished that he cease cry but i have just show what i be he return no you have not protest the mother you only try to be like he father experience hard time which make he fear poverty he believe that he have to think of himself first but you have never have any difficulty that should make you hard you have more than you need and it would be unnatural of you not to think of other when the two little girl enter the house the boy slip in behind they and secrete himself in a dark corner he have not be there long before he catch a glimpse of the shed key which the farmer have thrust into he coat pocket when the master of the house drive the child out i 'll take the key and run he think but the child be not drive out and the boy crouch in the corner not know what he should do next the mother talk long with she son and while she be speak he stop weep gradually he feature soften he look like another person all the while he be stroke the waste old hand now we may as well retire say the old lady when she see that he be calm again no he say suddenly rise i can not retire yet there be a stranger without whom i must shelter to-night he say nothing further but quickly draw on he coat light the lantern and go out there be the same wind and chill without but as he step to the porch he begin to sing softly he wonder if the horse would know he and if he would be glad to come back to he old stable as he cross the house yard he hear a door slam that shed door have blow open again he think and go over to close it a moment later he stand by the shed and be just go to shut the door when he hear a rustling within the boy who have watch he opportunity have run directly to the shed where he leave the animal but they be no longer out in the rain : a strong wind have long since throw open the door and help they to get a roof over they head the patter which the master hear be occasion by the boy run into the shed by the light of the lantern the man could see into the shed the whole floor be cover with sleep cattle there be no human be to be see the animal be not bind but be lie here and there in the straw he be enrage at the intrusion and begin storm and shriek to rouse the sleeper and drive they out but the creature lay still and would not let themselves be disturb the only one that rise be a old horse that come slowly toward he all of a sudden the man become silent he recognize the beast by its gait he raise the lantern and the horse come over and lay its head on he shoulder the master pat and stroke it my old horsy my old horsy he say what have they do to you yes dear i 'll buy you back you 'll never again have to leave this place you shall do whatever you like horsy mine those whom you have bring with you may remain here but you shall come with I to the stable now i can give you all the oats you be able to eat without have to smuggle they and you be not all use up either the handsomest horse on the church knoll -- that be what you shall be once more there there there there the break up of the ice _ Thursday April twenty-eighth _ the following day the weather be clear and beautiful there be a strong west wind people be glad of that for it dry up the road which have be soak by the heavy rain of the day before early in the morning the two småland child osa the goose girl and little mat be out on the highway lead from sörmland to närke the road run alongside the southern shore of hjälmar lake and the child be walk along look at the ice which cover the greater part of it the morning sun dart its clear ray upon the ice which do not look dark and forbid like most spring ice but sparkle temptingly as far as they could see the ice be firm and dry the rain have run down into crack and hollow or be absorb by the ice itself the child see only the sound ice osa the goose girl and little mat be on they way north and they could not help thinking of all the step they would be save if they could cut straight across the lake instead of go around it they know to be sure that spring ice be treacherous but this look perfectly secure they could see that it be several inch thick near the shore they see a path which they might follow and the opposite shore appear to be so near that they ought to be able to get there in a hour come let 's try say little mat if we only look before we so that we do not go down into some hole we can do it so they go out on the lake the ice be not very slippery but rather easy to walk upon there be more water on it than they expect to see and here and there be crack where the water purl up one have to watch out for such place but that be easy to do in broad daylight with the sun shine the child advance rapidly and talk only of how sensible they be to have go out on the ice instead of tramp the slushy road when they have be walk a while they come to vin island where a old woman have sight they from she window she rush from she cabin wave they back and shout something which they could not hear they understand perfectly well that she be warn they not to come any farther but they think there be no immediate danger it would be stupid for they to leave the ice when all be go so well therefore they go on past vin island and have a stretch of seven mile of ice ahead of they out there be so much water that the child be oblige to take roundabout way but that be sport to they they vie with each other as to which could find the soundest ice they be neither tire nor hungry the whole day be before they and they laugh at each obstacle they meet now and then they cast a glance ahead at the farther shore it still appear far away although they have be walk a good hour they be rather surprise that the lake be so broad the shore seem to be move farther away from we little mat observe out there the child be not protect against the wind which be become stronger and stronger every minute and be press they clothing so close to they body that they could hardly go on the cold wind be the first disagreeable thing they have meet with on the journey but the amazing part of it be that the wind come sweeping along with a loud roar -- as if it bring with it the noise of a large mill or factory though nothing of the kind be to be find out there on the ice they have walk to the west of the big island valen now they think they be near the north shore suddenly the wind begin to blow more and more while the loud roaring increase so rapidly that they begin to feel uneasy all at once it occur to they that the roar be cause by the foam and rush of the wave break against a shore even this seem improbable since the lake be still cover with ice at all event they pause and look about they notice far in the west a white bank which stretch clear across the lake at first they think it be a snowbank alongside a road later they realize it be the foam-capped wave dash against the ice they take hold of hand and run without say a word open sea lay beyond in the west and suddenly the streak of foam appear to be move eastward they wonder if the ice be go to break all over what be go to happen they feel now that they be in great danger all at once it seem as if the ice under they foot rise -- rise and sink as if some one from below be push it presently they hear a hollow boom and then there be crack in the ice all around they the child could see how they creep along under the ice-cover the next moment all be still then the rise and sink begin again thereupon the crack begin to widen into crevice through which the water bubble up by and by the crevice become gap soon after that the ice be divide into large floe osa say little mat this must be the break up of the ice why so it be little mat say osa but as yet we can get to land run for you life as a matter of fact the wind and wave have a good deal of work to do yet to clear the ice from the lake the hardest part be do when the ice-cake burst into piece but all these piece must be break and hurl against each other to be crushed wear down and dissolve there be still a great deal of hard and sound ice leave which form large unbroken surface the greatest danger for the child lay in the fact that they have no general view of the ice they do not see the place where the gap be so wide that they could not possibly jump over they nor do they know where to find any floe that would hold they so they wander aimlessly back and forth go farther out on the lake instead of nearer land at last confused and terrify they stand still and weep then a flock of wild goose in rapid flight come rush by they shriek loudly and sharply but the strange thing be that above the geese-cackle the little child hear these word : you must go to the right the right the right they begin at once to follow the advice but before long they be again stand irresolute face another broad gap again they hear the goose shriek above they and again amid the geese-cackle they distinguish a few word : stand where you be stand where you be the child do not say a word to each other but obeyed and stand still soon after that the ice-floe float together so that they could cross the gap then they take hold of hand again and run they be afraid not only of the peril but of the mysterious help that have come to they soon they have to stop again and immediately the sound of the voice reach they straight ahead straight ahead it say this lead continue for about half a hour by that time they have reach ljunger point where they leave the ice and wade to shore they be still terribly frightened even though they be on firm land they do not stop to look back at the lake -- where the wave be pitch the ice-floe faster and faster -- but run on when they have go a short distance along the point osa pause suddenly wait here little mat she say i have forget something osa the goose girl go down to the strand again where she stop to rummage in she bag finally she fish out a little wooden shoe which she place on a stone where it could be plainly see then she run to little mat without once look back but the instant she back be turn a big white goose shoot down from the sky like a streak of lightning snatch the wooden shoe and fly away with it thumbietot and the bear the ironworks _ Thursday April twenty-eighth _ when the wild goose and thumbietot have help osa the goose girl and little mat across the ice they fly into westmanland where they alight in a grain field to feed and rest a strong west wind blow almost the entire day on which the wild goose travel over the mining district and as soon as they attempt to direct they course northward they be buffet toward the east now akka think that smirre fox be at large in the eastern part of the province therefore she would not fly in that direction but turn back time and again struggle westward with great difficulty at this rate the wild goose advance very slowly and late in the afternoon they be still in the westmanland mining district toward evening the wind abate suddenly and the tired traveller hope that they would have a interval of easy flight before sundown then along come a violent gust of wind which toss the goose before it like ball and the boy who be sit comfortably with no thought of peril be lift from the goose 's back and hurl into space little and light as he be he could not fall straight to the ground in such a wind so at first he be carry along with it drift down slowly and spasmodically as a leaf fall from a tree why this be not so bad think the boy as he fall i be tumble as easily as if i be only a scrap of paper morten goosey-gander will doubtless hurry along and pick I up the first thing the boy do when he land be to tear off he cap and wave it so that the big white gander should see where he be here be i where be you here be i where be you he call and be rather surprise that morten goosey-gander be not already at he side but the big white gander be not to be see nor be the wild goose flock outline against the sky it have entirely disappear he think this rather singular but he be neither worried nor frightened not for a second do it occur to he that folk like akka and morten goosey-gander would abandon he the unexpected gust of wind have probably bear they along with it as soon as they could manage to turn they would surely come back and fetch he but what be this where on earth be he anyway he have be stand gaze toward the sky for some sign of the goose but now he happen to glance about he he have not come down on even ground but have drop into a deep wide mountain cave -- or whatever it might be it be as large as a church with almost perpendicular wall on all four side and with no roof at all on the ground be some huge rock between which moss and lignon-brush and dwarf birch grow here and there in the wall be projection from which swing rickety ladder at one side there be a dark passage which apparently lead far into the mountain the boy have not be travel over the mining district a whole day for nothing he comprehend at once that the big cleft have be make by the man who have mine ore in this place i must try and climb back to earth again he think otherwise i fear that my companion will not find I he be about to go over to the wall when some one seize he from behind and he hear a gruff voice growl in he ear : who be you the boy turn quickly and in the confusion of the moment he think he be face a huge rock cover with brownish moss then he notice that the rock have broad paw to walk with a head two eye and a growling mouth he could not pull himself together to answer nor do the big beast appear to expect it of he for it knock he down roll he back and forth with its paw and nose he it seem just about ready to swallow he when it change its mind and call : brumme and mulle come here you cub and you shall have something good to eat a pair of frowzy cub as uncertain on they foot and as woolly as puppy come tumble along what have you get mamma bear may we see oh may we see shriek the cub excitedly oho so i have fall in with bear think the boy to himself now smirre fox will not have to trouble himself further to chase after I the mother bear push the boy along to the cub one of they nab he quickly and run off with he but he do not bite hard he be playful and want to amuse himself awhile with thumbietot before eat he the other cub be after the first one to snatch the boy for himself and as he lumber along he manage to tumble straight down on the head of the one that carry the boy so the two cub roll over each other bite clawing and snarl during the tussle the boy get loose run over to the wall and start to scale it then both cub scurry after he and nimbly scale the cliff they catch up with he and toss he down on the moss like a ball now i know how a poor little mousie fare when it fall into the cat 's claw think the boy he make several attempt to get away he run deep down into the old tunnel and hide behind the rock and climb the birch but the cub hunt he out go where he would the instant they catch he they let he go so that he could run away again and they should have the fun of recapture he at last the boy get so sick and tired of it all that he throw himself down on the ground run away growl the cub or we 'll eat you up you 'll have to eat I then say the boy for i can not run any more immediately both cub rush over to the mother bear and complain : mamma bear oh mamma bear he will not play any more then you must divide he evenly between you say mother bear when the boy hear this he be so scared that he jump up instantly and begin play again as it be bedtime mother bear call to the cub that they must come now and cuddle up to she and go to sleep they have be have such a good time that they wish to continue they play next day so they take the boy between they and lay they paw over he they do not want he to move without wake they they go to sleep immediately the boy think that after a while he would try to steal away but never in all he life have he be so tumbled and toss and hunt and roll and he be so tired out that he too fall asleep by and by father bear come clamber down the mountain wall the boy be waken by he tear away stone and gravel as he swing himself into the old mine the boy be afraid to move much but he manage to stretch himself and turn over so that he could see the big bear he be a frightfully coarse huge old beast with great paw large glisten tusk and wicked little eye the boy could not help shudder as he look at this old monarch of the forest it smell like a human be around here say father bear the instant he come up to mother bear and he growl be as the rolling of thunder how can you imagine anything so absurd say mother bear without disturbing herself it have be settle for good and all that we be not to harm mankind any more but if one of they be to put in a appearance here where the cub and i have we quarter there would not be enough left of he for you to catch even a scent of he father bear lay down beside mother bear you ought to know I well enough to understand that i do not allow anything dangerous to come near the cub talk instead of what you have be do i have not see you for a whole week i have be look about for a new residence say father bear first i go over to vermland to learn from we kinsman at ekshärad how they fare in that country but i have my trouble for nothing there be not a bear 's den leave in the whole forest i believe the human want the whole earth to themselves say mother bear even if we leave people and cattle in peace and live solely upon lignon and insect and green thing we can not remain unmolested in the forest i wonder where we could move to in order to live in peace we have live comfortably for many year in this pit observe father bear but i can not be content here now since the big noise-shop have be build right in we neighborhood lately i have be take a look at the land east of dal river over by garpen mountain old mine pit be plentiful there too and other fine retreat i think it look as if one might be fairly protect against man -- the instant father bear say this he sit up and begin to sniff it be extraordinary that whenever i speak of human being i catch that queer scent again he remark go and see for yourself if you do not believe I challenge mother bear i should just like to know where a human being could manage to hide down here the bear walk all around the cave and nose finally he go back and lay down without a word what do i tell you say mother bear but of course you think that no one but yourself have any nose or ear one can not be too careful with such neighbor as we have say father bear gently then he leap up with a roar as luck would have it one of the cub have move a paw over to nil holgersson 's face and the poor little wretch could not breathe but begin to sneeze it be impossible for mother bear to keep father bear back any longer he push the young one to right and left and catch sight of the boy before he have time to sit up he would have swallow he instantly if mother bear have not cast herself between they do not touch he he belong to the cub she say they have have such fun with he the whole evening that they could not bear to eat he up but want to save he until morning father bear push mother bear aside do not meddle with what you do not understand he roar can not you scent that human odour about he from afar i shall eat he at once or he will play we some mean trick he open he jaw again but meanwhile the boy have have time to think and quick as a flash he dig into he knapsack and bring forth some match -- he sole weapon of defense -- strike one on he leather breeches and stick the burning match into the bear 's open mouth father bear snort when he smell the sulphur and with that the flame go out the boy be ready with another match but curiously enough father bear do not repeat he attack can you light many of those little blue rose ask father bear i can light enough to put a end to the whole forest reply the boy for he think that in this way he might be able to scare father bear oh that would be no trick for I boast the boy hope that this would make the bear respect he good exclaim the bear you shall render I a service now i be very glad that i do not eat you father bear carefully take the boy between he tusk and climb up from the pit he do this with remarkable ease and agility consider that he be so big and heavy as soon as he be up he speedily make for the wood it be evident that father bear be create to squeeze through dense forest the heavy body push through the brushwood as a boat do through the water father bear run along till he come to a hill at the skirt of the forest where he could see the big noise-shop here he lay down and place the boy in front of he hold he securely between he forepaw now look down at that big noise-shop he command the great ironworks with many tall building stand at the edge of a waterfall high chimney send forth dark cloud of smoke blast furnace be in full blaze and light shone from all the window and aperture within hammer and roll mill be go with such force that the air ring with they clatter and boom all around the workshop proper be immense coal shed great slag heap warehouse wood pile and tool shed just beyond be long row of workingman 's home pretty villa schoolhouse assembly hall and shop but there all be quiet and apparently everybody be asleep the boy do not glance in that direction but gaze intently at the ironworks the earth around they be black the sky above they be like a great fiery dome the rapid white with foam rush by while the building themselves be send out light and smoke fire and spark it be the grandest sight the boy have ever see surely you do not mean to say you can set fire to a place like that remark the bear doubtingly the boy stand wedge between the beast 's paw think the only thing that might save he would be that the bear should have a high opinion of he capability and power it be all the same to I he answer with a superior air big or little i can burn it down then i 'll tell you something say father bear my forefather live in this region from the time that the forest first spring up from they i inherit hunting grounds and pasture lair and retreat and have live here in peace all my life in the beginning i be not trouble much by the human kind they dig in the mountain and pick up a little ore down here by the rapid they have a forge and a furnace but the hammer sound only a few hour during the day and the furnace be not fire more than two moon at a stretch it be not so bad but that i could stand it but these last year since they have build this noise-shop which keep up the same racket both day and night life here have become intolerable formerly only a manager and a couple of blacksmith live here but now there be so many people that i can never feel safe from they i think that i should have to move away but i have discover something better the boy wonder what father bear have hit upon but no opportunity be afford he to ask as the bear take he between he tusk again and lumber down the hill the boy could see nothing but know by the increase noise that they be approach the roll mill father bear be well inform regard the ironworks he have prowl around there on many a dark night have observe what go on within and have wonder if there would never be any cessation of the work he have test the wall with he paw and wish that he be only strong enough to knock down the whole structure with a single blow he be not easily distinguishable against the dark ground and when in addition he remain in the shadow of the wall there be not much danger of he be discover now he walk fearlessly between the workshop and climb to the top of a slag heap there he sit up on he haunch take the boy between he forepaw and hold he up try to look into the house he command a strong current of air be force into a big cylinder which be suspend from the ceiling and fill with molten iron as this current rush into the mess of iron with a awful roar shower of spark of all color spurt up in bunch in spray in long cluster they strike against the wall and come splash down over the whole big room father bear let the boy watch the gorgeous spectacle until the blow be over and the flow and sparkling red steel have be pour into ingot mould the boy be completely charm by the marvellous display and almost forget that he be imprison between a bear 's two paw father bear let he look into the roll mill he see a workman take a short thick bar of iron at white heat from a furnace opening and place it under a roller when the iron come out from under the roller it be flatten and extend immediately another workman seize it and place it beneath a heavier roller which make it still longer and thinner thus it be pass from roller to roller squeeze and draw out until finally it curl along the floor like a long red thread but while the first bar of iron be be press a second be take from the furnace and place under the roller and when this be a little along a third be bring continuously fresh thread come crawl over the floor like hiss snake the boy be dazzle by the iron but he find it more splendid to watch the workman who dexterously and delicately seize the glowing snake with they tong and force they under the roller it seem like play for they to handle the hissing iron i call that real man 's work the boy remark to himself the bear then let the boy have a peep at the furnace and the forge and he become more and more astonished as he see how the blacksmith handle iron and fire those man have no fear of heat and flame he think the workman be sooty and grimy he fancy they be some sort of firefolk -- that be why they could bend and mould the iron as they wish he could not believe that they be just ordinary man since they have such power they keep this up day after day night after night say father bear as he drop wearily down on the ground you can understand that one get rather tire of that kind of thing i be mighty glad that at last i can put a end to it indeed say the boy how will you go about it oh i think that you be go to set fire to the building say father bear that would put a end to all this work and i could remain in my old home the boy be all of a shiver so it be for this that father bear have bring he here if you will set fire to the noise-works i 'll promise to spare you life say father bear but if you do not do it i 'll make short work of you the huge workshop be build of brick and the boy be think to himself that father bear could command as much as he like it be impossible to obey he presently he see that it might not be impossible after all just beyond they lay a pile of chip and shaving to which he could easily set fire and beside it be a wood pile that almost reach the coal shed the coal shed extend over to the workshop and if that once catch fire the flame would soon fly over to the roof of the iron foundry everything combustible would burn the wall would fall from the heat and the machinery would be destroy will you or will not you demand father bear the boy know that he ought to answer promptly that he would not but he also know that then the bear 's paw would squeeze he to death therefore he reply : i shall have to think it over very well do so assented father bear let I say to you that iron be the thing that have give man the advantage over we bear which be another reason for my wish to put a end to the work here the boy think he would use the delay to figure out some plan of escape but he be so worried he could not direct he thought where he would instead he begin to think of the great help that iron have be to mankind they need iron for everything there be iron in the plough that break up the field in the axe that fell the tree for build house in the scythe that mow the grain and in the knife which could be turn to all sort of use there be iron in the horse 's bit in the lock on the door in the nail that hold furniture together in the sheathing that cover the roof the rifle which drive away wild beast be make of iron also the pick that have break up the mine iron cover the men-of-war he have see at karlskrona the locomotive steam through the country on iron rail the needle that have stitch he coat be of iron the shears that clip the sheep and the kettle that cook the food big and little alike -- much that be indispensable be make from iron father bear be perfectly right in say that it be the iron that have give man they mastery over the bear now will you or will not you father bear repeat the boy be startle from he muse here he stand thinking of matter that be entirely unnecessary and have not yet find a way to save himself you must not be so impatient he say this be a serious matter for I and i have get to have time to consider well then consider another moment say father bear but let I tell you that it be because of the iron that man have become so much wiser than we bear for this alone if for nothing else i should like to put a stop to the work here again the boy endeavor to think out a plan of escape but he thought wander willy nilly they be take up with the iron and gradually he begin to comprehend how much thinking and calculate man must have do before they discover how to produce iron from ore and he seem to see sooty blacksmith of old bend over the forge ponder how they should properly handle it perhaps it be because they have think so much about the iron that intelligence have be develop in mankind until finally they become so advanced that they be able to build great work like these the fact be that man owe more to the iron than they themselves know well what say you will you or will not you insist father bear the boy shrink back here he stand think needless thought and have no idea as to what he should do to save himself it be not such a easy matter to decide as you think he answer you must give I time for reflection i can wait for you a little longer say father bear but after that you 'll get no more grace you must know that it be the fault of the iron that the human kind can live here on the property of the bear and now you understand why i would be rid of the work the boy mean to use the last moment to think out some way to save himself but anxious and distraught as he be he thought wander again now he begin think of all that he have see when he fly over the mining district it be strange that there should be so much life and activity and so much work back there in the wilderness just think how poor and desolate this place would be have there be no iron here this very foundry give employment to many and have gather around it many home fill with people who in turn have attract hither railway and telegraph wire and -- come come growl the bear will you or will not you the boy sweep he hand across he forehead no plan of escape have as yet come to he mind but this much he know -- he do not wish to do any harm to the iron which be so useful to rich and poor alike and which give bread to so many people in this land i will not he say father bear squeeze he a little harder but say nothing you 'll not get I to destroy the ironworks defy the boy the iron be so great a blessing that it will never do to harm it then of course you do not expect to be allow to live very long say the bear no i do not expect it return the boy look the bear straight in the eye father bear grip he still harder it hurt so that the boy could not keep the tear back but he do not cry out or say a word very well then say father bear raise he paw very slowly hope that the boy would give in at the last moment but just then the boy hear something click very close to they and see the muzzle of a rifle two pace away both he and father bear have be so engross in they own affair they have not observe that a man have steal right upon they father bear do not you hear the clicking of a trigger cry the boy run or you 'll be shoot father bear grow terribly hurry however he allow himself time enough to pick up the boy and carry he along as he run a couple of shot sound and the bullet graze he ear but luckily he escape the boy think as he be dangle from the bear 's mouth that never have he be so stupid as he be to-night if he have only keep still the bear would have be shoot and he himself would have be free but he have become so accustomed to help the animal that he do it naturally and as a matter of course when father bear have run some distance into the wood he pause and set the boy down on the ground thank you little one he say i dare say those bullet would have catch I if you have not be there and now i want to do you a service in return if you should ever meet with another bear just say to he this -- which i shall whisper to you -- and he will not touch you father bear whisper a word or two into the boy 's ear and hurry away for he think he hear hound and hunter pursue he the boy stand in the forest free and unharmed and could hardly understand how it be possible the wild goose have be fly back and forth the whole evening peer and call but they have be unable to find thumbietot they search long after the sun have set and finally when it have grow so dark that they be force to alight somewhere for the night they be very downhearted there be not one among they but think the boy have be kill by the fall and be lie dead in the forest where they could not see he but the next morning when the sun peep over the hill and awaken the wild goose the boy lay sleep as usual in they midst when he wake and hear they shriek and cackle they astonishment he could not help laugh they be so eager to know what have happen to he that they do not care to go to breakfast until he have tell they the whole story the boy soon narrate he entire adventure with the bear but after that he seem reluctant to continue how i get back to you perhaps you already know he say no we know nothing we think you be kill that be curious remark the boy oh yes -- when father bear leave I i climb up into a pine and fall asleep at daybreak i be awaken by a eagle hover over I he pick I up with he talon and carry I away he do not hurt I but fly straight here to you and drop I down among you do not he tell you who he be ask the big white gander he be go before i have time even to thank he i think that mother akka have send he after I how extraordinary exclaim the white goosey-gander but be you certain that it be a eagle i have never before see a eagle say the boy but he be so big and splendid that i can not give he a lowlier name morten goosey-gander turn to the wild goose to hear what they think of this but they stand gaze into the air as though they be think of something else we must not forget entirely to eat breakfast today say akka quickly spread she wing the flood the swan _ may first to fourth _ there be a terrible storm rage in the district north of lake mälar which last several day the sky be a dull gray the wind whistle and the rain beat both people and animal know the spring could not be usher in with anything short of this nevertheless they think it unbearable after it have be rain for a whole day the snowdrift in the pine forest begin to melt in earnest and the spring brook grow lively all the pool on the farm the standing water in the ditch the water that ooze between the tuft in marsh and swamp -- all be in motion and try to find they way to creek that they might be bear along to the sea the creek rush as fast as possible down to the river and the river do they utmost to carry the water to lake mälar all the lake and river in uppland and the mining district quickly throw off they ice cover on one and the same day so that the creek fill with ice-floe which rise clear up to they bank swollen as they be they empty into lake mälar and it be not long before the lake have take in as much water as it could well hold down by the outlet be a rage torrent norrström be a narrow channel and it could not let out the water quickly enough besides there be a strong easterly wind that lash against the land obstruct the stream when it try to carry the fresh water into the east sea since the river keep run to mälaren with more water than it could dispose of there be nothing for the big lake to do but overflow its bank it rise very slowly as if reluctant to injure its beautiful shore but as they be mostly low and gradually slope it be not long before the water have flood several acre of land and that be enough to create the greatest alarm lake mälar be unique in its way be make up of a succession of narrow fiord bay and inlet in no place do it spread into a storm center but seem to have be create only for pleasure trip yachting tour and fishing nowhere do it present barren desolate wind-swept shore it look as if it never think that its shore could hold anything but country seat summer villa manor and amusement resort but because it usually present a very agreeable and friendly appearance there be all the more havoc whenever it happen to drop its smile expression in the spring and show that it can be serious at that critical time smirre fox happen to come sneak through a birch grove just north of lake mälar as usual he be think of thumbietot and the wild goose and wonder how he should ever find they again he have lose all track of they as he steal cautiously along more discourage than usual he catch sight of agar the carrier-pigeon who have perch herself on a birch branch my but i be in luck to run across you agar exclaim smirre maybe you can tell I where akka from kebnekaise and she flock hold forth nowadays it be quite possible that i know where they be agar hint but i be not likely to tell you please yourself retort smirre nevertheless you can take a message that i have for they you probably know the present condition of lake mälar there be a great overflow down there and all the swan who live in hjälsta bay be about to see they nest with all they egg destroy daylight the swan-king have hear of the midget who travel with the wild goose and know a remedy for every ill he have send I to ask akka if she will bring thumbietot down to hjälsta bay i dare say i can convey you message agar reply but i can not understand how the little boy will be able to help the swan nor do i say smirre but he can do almost everything it seem it be surprising to I that daylight should send he message by a fox agar remark well we be not exactly what you would call good friend say smirre smoothly but in a emergency like this we must help each other perhaps it would be just as well not to tell akka that you get the message from a fox between you and I she be incline to be a little suspicious the safest refuge for water-fowl in the whole mälar district be hjälsta bay it have low shore shallow water and be also cover with reed it be by no means as large as lake tåkern but nevertheless hjälsta be a good retreat for bird since it have long be forbid territory to hunter it be the home of a great many swan and the owner of the old castle nearby have prohibit all shooting on the bay so that they might be unmolested as soon as akka receive word that the swan need she help she hasten down to hjälsta bay she arrive with she flock one evening and see at a glance that there have be a great disaster the big swan ' nest have be tear away and the strong wind be drive they down the bay some have already fall apart two or three have capsize and the egg lay at the bottom of the lake when akka alight on the bay all the swan live there be gather near the eastern shore where they be protect from the wind although they have suffer much by the flood they be too proud to let any one see it it be useless to cry they say there be plenty of root-fibre and stem here we can soon build new nest none have think of ask a stranger to help they and the swan have no idea that smirre fox have send for the wild goose there be several hundred swan rest on the water they have place themselves accord to rank and station the young and inexperienced be farthest out the old and wise nearer the middle of the group and right in the center sit daylight the swan-king and snow-white the swan-queen who be older than any of the other and regard the rest of the swan as they child the goose alight on the west shore of the bay but when akka see where the swan be she swim toward they at once she be very much surprised at they have send for she but she regard it as a honor and do not wish to lose a moment in come to they aid as akka approach the swan she pause to see if the goose who follow she swam in a straight line and at even distance apart now swim along quickly she order do not stare at the swan as if you have never before see anything beautiful and do not mind what they may say to you this be not the first time that akka have call on the aristocratic swan they have always receive she in a manner befitting a great traveller like herself but still she do not like the idea of swimming in among they she never feel so gray and insignificant as when she happen upon swan one or another of they be sure to drop a remark about common gray-feather and poor folk but it be always best to take no notice of such thing this time everything pass off uncommonly well the swan politely make way for the wild goose who swim forward through a kind of passageway which form a avenue border by shimmering white bird it be a beautiful sight to watch they as they spread they wing like sail to appear well before the stranger they refrain from make comment which rather surprise akka evidently daylight have note they misbehavior in the past and have tell the swan that they must conduct themselves in a proper manner -- so think the leader-goose but just as the swan be make a effort to observe the rule of etiquette they catch sight of the goosey-gander who swim last in the long goose-line then there be a murmur of disapproval even of threat among the swan and at once there be a end to they good deportment what be this shriek one do the wild goose intend to dress up in white feather they need not think that will make swan of they cry another they begin shriek -- one louder than another -- in they strong resonant voice it be impossible to explain that a tame goosey-gander have come with the wild goose that must be the goose-king himself come along they say tauntingly there be no limit to they audacity that be no goose it be only a tame duck the big white gander remember akka 's admonition to pay no attention no matter what he might hear he keep quiet and swim ahead as fast he could but it do no good the swan become more and more impertinent what kind of a frog do he carry on he back ask one they must think we do not see it be a frog because it be dress like a human be the swan who but a moment before have be rest in such perfect order now swim up and down excitedly all try to crowd forward to get a glimpse of the white wild goose that white goosey-gander ought to be ashamed to come here and parade before swan he be probably as gray as the rest of they he have only be in a flour barrel at some farm house akka have just come up to daylight and be about to ask he what kind of help he want of she when the swan-king notice the uproar among the swan what do i see have not i teach you to be polite to stranger he say with a frown snow-white the swan-queen swam out to restore order among she subject and again daylight turn to akka presently snow-white come back appear greatly agitate can not you keep they quiet shout daylight there be a white wild goose over there answer snow-white be it not shameful i do not wonder they be furious a white wild goose scoff daylight that be too ridiculous there can not be such a thing you must be mistake the crowd around morten goosey-gander grow larger and larger akka and the other wild goose try to swim over to he but be jostle hither and thither and could not get to he the old swan-king who be the strongest among they swim off quickly push all the other aside and make he way over to the big white gander but when he see that there really be a white goose on the water he be just as indignant as the rest he hiss with rage fly straight at morten goosey-gander and tear out a few feather i 'll teach you a lesson wild goose he shriek so that you 'll not come again to the swan tog out in this way fly morten goosey-gander fly fly cry akka for she know that otherwise the swan would pull out every feather the goosey-gander have fly fly scream thumbietot too but the goosey-gander be so hedge in by the swan that he have not room enough to spread he wing all around he the swan stretch they long neck open they strong bill and pluck he feather morten goosey-gander defend himself as best he could by striking and bite the wild goose also begin to fight the swan it be obvious how this would have end have the goose not receive help quite unexpectedly a red-tail notice that they be be roughly treat by the swan instantly he cry out the shrill call that little bird use when they need help to drive off a hawk or a falcon three call have barely sound when all the little bird in the vicinity come shoot down to hjälsta bay as if on wing of lightning these delicate little creature swoop down upon the swan screech in they ear and obstruct they view with the flutter of they tiny wing they make they dizzy with they fluttering and drive they to distraction with they cry of shame shame swan the attack of the small bird last but a moment when they be go and the swan come to they sens they see that the goose have rise and fly over to the other end of the bay the new watch-dog there be this at least to be say in the swan ' favor -- when they see that the wild goose have escape they be too proud to chase they moreover the goose could stand on a clump of reed with perfect composure and sleep nil holgersson be too hungry to sleep it be necessary for I to get something to eat he say at that time when all kind of thing be float on the water it be not difficult for a little boy like nil holgersson to find a craft he do not stop to deliberate but hop down on a stump that have drift in amongst the reed then he pick up a little stick and begin to pole toward shore just as he be land he hear a splash in the water he stop short first he see a lady swan asleep in she big nest quite close to he then he notice that a fox have take a few step into the water and be sneak up to the swan 's nest hi hi hi get up get up cry the boy beat the water with he stick the lady swan rise but not so quickly but that the fox could have pounce upon she have he care to however he refrain and instead hurry straight toward the boy thumbietot see the fox come and run for he life wide stretch of meadow land spread before he he see no tree that he could climb no hole where he might hide he just have to keep run the boy be a good runner but it stand to reason that he could not race with a fox not far from the bay there be a number of little cabin with candle light shine through the window naturally the boy run in that direction but he realize that long before he could reach the nearest cabin the fox would catch up to he once the fox be so close that it look as if the boy would surely be he prey but nil quickly spring aside and turn back toward the bay by that move the fox lose time and before he could reach the boy the latter have run up to two man who be on they way home from work the man be tire and sleepy they have notice neither boy nor fox although both have be run right in front of they nor do the boy ask help of the man he be content to walk close beside they surely the fox will not venture to come up to the man he think but presently the fox come patter along he probably count on the man take he for a dog for he go straight up to they whose dog can that be sneak around here query one he look as though he be ready to bite the other pause and glance back go along with you he say and give the fox a kick that send it to the opposite side of the road what be you do here after that the fox keep at a safe distance but follow all the while presently the man reach a cabin and enter it the boy intend to go in with they but when he get to the stoop he see a big shaggy watch-dog rush out from he kennel to greet he master suddenly the boy change he mind and remain out in the open listen watch-dog whisper the boy as soon as the man have shut the door i wonder if you would like to help I catch a fox to-night the dog have poor eyesight and have become irritable and cranky from be chained what i catch a fox he bark angrily who be you that make fun of I you just come within my reach and i 'll teach you not to fool with I you need not think that i be afraid to come near you say the boy run up to the dog when the dog see he he be so astonished that he could not speak i be the one they call thumbietot who travel with the wild goose say the boy introduce himself have not you hear of I i believe the sparrow have twitter a little about you the dog return they say that you have do wonderful thing for one of you size i have be rather lucky up to the present admit the boy but now it be all up with I unless you help I there be a fox at my heel he be lie in wait for I around the corner do not you suppose i can smell he retort the dog but we 'll soon be rid of he with that the dog spring as far as the chain would allow bark and growl for ever so long now i do not think he will show he face again to-night say the dog it will take something besides a fine bark to scare that fox the boy remark he 'll soon be here again and that be precisely what i wish for i have set my heart on you catch he be you poke fun at I now ask the dog only come with I into you kennel and i 'll tell you what to do the boy and the watch-dog creep into the kennel and crouch there whisper by and by the fox stick he nose out from he hide place when all be quiet he creep along cautiously he scented the boy all the way to the kennel but halt at a safe distance and sit down to think of some way to coax he out suddenly the watch-dog poke he head out and growl at he : go away or i 'll catch you i 'll sit here as long as i please for all of you defy the fox go away repeat the dog threateningly or there will be no more hunting for you after to-night but the fox only grin and do not move a inch i know how far you chain can reach he say i have warn you twice say the dog come out from he kennel now blame yourself with that the dog spring at the fox and catch he without the least effort for he be loose the boy have unbuckle he collar there be a hot struggle but it be soon over the dog be the victor the fox lay on the ground and dare not move do not stir or i 'll kill you snarl the dog then he take the fox by the scruff of the neck and drag he to the kennel there the boy be ready with the chain he place the dog collar around the neck of the fox tighten it so that he be securely chained during all this the fox have to lie still for he be afraid to move now smirre fox i hope you 'll make a good watch-dog laugh the boy when he have finish dunfin the city that float on the water _ Friday may sixth _ no one could be more gentle and kind than the little gray goose dunfin all the wild goose love she and the tame white goosey-gander would have die for she when dunfin ask for anything not even akka could say no as soon as dunfin come to lake mälar the landscape look familiar to she just beyond the lake lay the sea with many wooded island and there on a little islet live she parent and she brother and sister she beg the wild goose to fly to she home before travel farther north that she might let she family see that she be still alive it would be such a joy to they akka frankly declare that she think dunfin 's parent and brother and sister have show no great love for she when they abandon she at öland but dunfin would not admit that akka be in the right what else be there to do when they see that i could not fly she protest surely they could not remain at öland on my account dunfin begin tell the wild goose all about she home in the archipelago to try to induce they to make the trip she family live on a rock island see from a distance there appear to be nothing but stone there but when one come closer there be to be find the choicest goose tidbit in cleft and hollow and one might search long for better nesting place than those that be hide in the mountain crevice or among the osier bush but the best of all be the old fisherman who live there dunfin have hear that in he youth he have be a great shot and have always lie in the offing and hunt bird but now in he old age -- since he wife have die and the child have go from home so that he be alone in the hut -- he have begin to care for the bird on he island he never fire a shot at they nor would he permit other to do so he walk around amongst the bird ' nest and when the mother bird be sit he bring they food not one be afraid of he they all love he dunfin have be in he hut many time and he have feed she with bread crumb because he be kind to the bird they flock to he island in such great number that it be become overcrowded if one happen to arrive a little late in the spring all the nesting place be occupy that be why dunfin 's family have be oblige to leave she dunfin beg so hard that she finally have she way although the wild goose feel that they be lose time and really should be go straight north but a little trip like this to the cliff island would not delay they more than a day so they start off one morning after fortify themselves with a good breakfast and fly eastward over lake mälar the boy do not know for certain where they be go but he notice that the farther east they fly the livelier it be on the lake and the more build up be the shore heavily freight barge and sloop boat and fishing smack be on they way east and these be meet and pass by many pretty white steamer along the shore run country road and railway track -- all in the same direction there be some place beyond in the east where all wish to go to in the morning on one of the island the boy see a big white castle and to the east of it the shore be dot with villa at the start these lay far apart then they become closer and closer and presently the whole shore be line with they they be of every variety -- here a castle there a cottage then a low manor house appear or a mansion with many small tower some stand in garden but most of they be in the wild wood which border the shore despite they dissimilarity they have one point of resemblance -- they be not plain and sombre-looking like other building but be gaudily paint in striking green and blues red and white like child 's playhouse as the boy sit on the goose 's back and glance down at the curious shore mansion dunfin cry out with delight : now i know where i be over there lie the city that float on the water the boy look ahead at first he see nothing but some light cloud and mist roll forward over the water but soon he catch sight of some tall spire and then one and another house with many row of window they appear and disappear -- rolling hither and thither -- but not a strip of shore do he see everything over there appear to be rest on the water nearer to the city he see no more pretty playhouse along the shore -- only dingy factory great heap of coal and wood be stack behind tall plank and alongside black sooty dock lay bulky freight steamer but over all be spread a shimmering transparent mist which make everything appear so big and strong and wonderful that it be almost beautiful the wild goose fly past factory and freight steamer and be near the cloud-enveloped spire suddenly all the mist sink to the water save the thin fleecy one that circle above they head beautifully tint in blues and pink the other cloud roll over water and land they entirely obscure the lower portion of the house : only the upper story and the roof and gable be visible some of the building appear to be as high as the tower of babel the boy no doubt know that they be build upon hill and mountain but these he do not see -- only the house that seem to float among the white drift cloud in reality the building be dark and dingy for the sun in the east be not shine on they the boy know that he be ride above a large city for he see spire and house roof rise from the cloud in every direction sometimes a opening be make in the circle mist and he look down into a run tortuous stream but no land could he see all this be beautiful to look upon but he feel quite distraught -- as one do when happen upon something one can not understand when he have go beyond the city he find that the ground be no longer hide by cloud but that shore stream and island be again plainly visible he turn to see the city better but could not for now it look quite enchanted the mist have take on color from the sunshine and be roll forward in the most brilliant red blues and yellow the house be white as if build of light and the window and spire sparkle like fire all thing float on the water as before the goose be travel straight east they fly over factory and workshop then over mansion edge the shore steamboat and tug swarm on the water but now they come from the east and be steam westward toward the city the wild goose fly on but instead of the narrow mälar fiord and the little island broader water and larger island spread under they at last the land be leave behind and see no more they fly still farther out where they find no more large inhabit island -- only numberless little rock island be scatter on the water now the fiord be not crowd by the land the sea lay before they vast and limitless here the wild goose alight on a cliff island and as soon as they foot touch the ground the boy turn to dunfin what city do we fly over just now he ask i do not know what human being have name it say dunfin we gray goose call it the ` city that float on the water ' the sister dunfin have two sister prettywe and goldeye they be strong and intelligent bird but they do not have such a soft and shiny feather dress as dunfin nor do they have she sweet and gentle disposition from the time they have be little yellow gosling they parent and relative and even the old fisherman have plainly show they that they think more of dunfin than of they therefore the sister have always hate she when the wild goose land on the cliff island prettywing and goldeye be feed on a bit of grass close to the strand and immediately catch sight of the stranger see sister goldeye what fine-looking goose have come to we island exclaim prettywing i have rarely see such graceful bird do you notice that they have a white goosey-gander among they do you ever set eye on a handsomer bird one could almost take he for a swan goldeye agree with she sister that these be certainly very distinguished stranger that have come to the island but suddenly she break off and call : sister prettywe oh sister prettywing do not you see whom they bring with they prettywe also catch sight of dunfin and be so astounded that she stand for a long time with she bill wide open and only hiss it can not be possible that it be she how do she manage to get in with people of that class why we leave she at öland to freeze and starve the worse of it be she will tattle to father and mother that we fly so close to she that we knock she wing out of joint say goldeye you 'll see that it will end in we be drive from the island we have nothing but trouble in store for we now that that young one have come back snapped prettywing still i think it would be best for we to appear as pleased as possible over she return she be so stupid that perhaps she do not even notice that we give she a push on purpose while prettywing and goldeye be talk in this strain the wild goose have be stand on the strand plume they feather after the flight now they march in a long line up the rocky shore to the cleft where dunfin 's parent usually stop dunfin 's parent be good folk they have live on the island longer than any one else and it be they habit to counsel and aid all newcomer they too have see the goose approach but they have not recognize dunfin in the flock it be strange to see wild goose land on this island remark the goose-master it be a fine flock -- that one can see by they flight but it will not be easy to find pasturage for so many say the goose-wife who be gentle and sweet-tempered like dunfin when akka come march with she company dunfin 's parent go out to meet she and welcome she to the island dunfin fly from she place at the end of the line and light between she parent mother and father i be here at last she cry joyously do not you know dunfin at first the old goose-parent could not quite make out what they see but when they recognize dunfin they be absurdly happy of course while the wild goose and morten goosey-gander and dunfin be chatter excitedly try to tell how she have be rescue prettywe and goldeye come run they cry _ welcome _ and pretend to be so happy because dunfin be at home that she be deeply move the wild goose fare well on the island and decide not to travel farther until the follow morning after a while the sister ask dunfin if she would come with they and see the place where they intend to build they nest she promptly accompany they and see that they have pick out secluded and well protect nesting place now where will you settle down dunfin they ask i why i do not intend to remain on the island she say i be go with the wild goose up to lapland what a pity that you must leave we say the sister i should have be very glad to remain here with father and mother and you say dunfin have i not promise the big white -- what shriek prettywing be you to have the handsome goosey-gander then it be -- but here goldeye give she a sharp nudge and she stop short the two cruel sister have much to talk about all the afternoon they be furious because dunfin have a suitor like the white goosey-gander they themselves have suitor but theirs be only common gray goose and since they have see morten goosey-gander they think they so homely and low-bred that they do not wish even to look at they this will grieve I to death whimper goldeye if at least it have be you sister prettywing who have capture he i would rather see he dead than to go about here the entire summer thinking of dunfin 's capture a white goosey-gander pout prettywe however the sister continue to appear very friendly toward dunfin and in the afternoon goldeye take dunfin with she that she might see the one she think of marry he be not as attractive as the one you will have say goldeye but to make up for it one can be certain that he be what he be what do you mean goldeye question dunfin at first goldeye would not explain what she have mean but at last she come out with it we have never see a white goose travel with wild goose say the sister and we wonder if he can be bewitch you be very stupid retorted dunfin indignantly he be a tame goose of course he bring with he one who be bewitch say goldeye and under the circumstance he too must be bewitch be you not afraid that he may be a black cormorant she be a good talker and succeed in frightening dunfin thoroughly you do not mean what you be say plead the little gray goose you only wish to frighten I i wish what be for you good dunfin say goldeye i can not imagine anything worse than for you to fly away with a black cormorant but now i shall tell you something -- try to persuade he to eat some of the root i have gather here if he be bewitch it will be apparent at once if he be not he will remain as he be the boy be sit amongst the wild goose listen to akka and the old goose-master when dunfin come fly up to he thumbietot thumbietot she cry morten goosey-gander be die i have kill he let I get up on you back dunfin and take I to he away they fly and akka and the other wild goose follow they when they get to the goosey-gander he be lie prostrate on the ground he could not utter a word -- only gasp for breath tickle he under the gorge and slap he on the back command akka the boy do so and presently the big white gander cough up a large white root which have stick in he gorge have you be eat of these ask akka point to some root that lay on the ground yes groan the goosey-gander then it be well they stick in you throat say akka for they be poisonous have you swallow they you certainly should have die dunfin bid I eat they say the goosey-gander my sister give they to I protest dunfin and she tell everything you must beware of those sister of yours dunfin warn akka for they wish you no good depend upon it but dunfin be so constitute that she could not think evil of any one and a moment later when prettywe ask she to come and meet she intended she go with she immediately oh he be not as handsome as yours say the sister but he be much more courageous and daring how do you know he be challenge dunfin for some time past there have be weep and wail amongst the sea gull and wild duck on the island every morning at daybreak a strange bird of prey come and carry off one of they what kind of a bird be it ask dunfin we do not know reply the sister one of he kind have never before be see on the island and strange to say he have never attack one of we goose but now my intend have make up he mind to challenge he to-morrow morning and drive he away oh i hope he 'll succeed say dunfin i hardly think he will return the sister if my goosey-gander be as big and strong as yours i should have hope do you wish I to ask morten goosey-gander to meet the strange bird ask dunfin indeed i do exclaimed prettywing excitedly you could not render I a greater service the next morning the goosey-gander be up before the sun he station himself on the highest point of the island and peer in all direction presently he see a big dark bird come from the west he wing be exceedingly large and it be easy to tell that he be a eagle the goosey-gander have not expect a more dangerous adversary than a owl and how he understand that he could not escape this encounter with he life but it do not occur to he to avoid a struggle with a bird who be many time stronger than himself the great bird swoop down on a sea gull and dig he talon into it before the eagle could spread he wing morten goosey-gander rush up to he drop that he shout and do not come here again or you 'll have I to deal with what kind of a lunatic be you say the eagle it be lucky for you that i never fight with goose or you would soon be do for morten goosey-gander think the eagle consider himself too good to fight with he and fly at he incensed bite he on the throat and beat he with he wing this naturally the eagle would not tolerate and he begin to fight but not with he full strength the boy lay sleep in the quarter where akka and the other wild goose sleep when dunfin call : thumbietot thumbietot morten goosey-gander be be tear to piece by a eagle let I get up on you back dunfin and take I to he say the boy when they arrive on the scene morten goosey-gander be badly tear and bleeding but he be still fight the boy could not battle with the eagle all that he could do be to seek more efficient help hurry dunfin and call akka and the wild goose he cry the instant he say that the eagle fly back and stop fight who be speaking of akka he ask he see thumbietot and hear the wild goose honk so he spread he wing tell akka i never expect to run across she or any of she flock out here in the sea he say and soar away in a rapid and graceful flight that be the self-same eagle who once bring I back to the wild goose the boy remark gaze after the bird in astonishment the goose have decide to leave the island at dawn but first they want to feed awhile as they walk about and nibble a mountain duck come up to dunfin i have a message for you from you sister say the duck they dare not show themselves among the wild goose but they ask I to remind you not to leave the island without call on the old fisherman that be so exclaimed dunfin but she be so frightened now that she would not go alone and ask the goosey-gander and thumbietot to accompany she to the hut the door be open so dunfin enter but the other remain outside after a moment they hear akka give the signal to start and call dunfin a gray goose come out and fly with the wild goose away from the island they have travel quite a distance along the archipelago when the boy begin to wonder at the goose who accompany they dunfin always fly lightly and noiselessly but this one labor with heavy and noisy wing-stroke we be in the wrong company it be prettywe that follow we the boy have barely speak when the goose utter such a ugly and angry shriek that all know who she be akka and the other turn to she but the gray goose do not fly away at once instead she bump against the big goosey-gander snatch thumbietot and fly off with he in she bill there be a wild chase over the archipelago prettywing fly fast but the wild goose be close behind she and there be no chance for she to escape suddenly they see a puff of smoke rise up from the sea and hear a explosion in they excitement they have not notice that they be directly above a boat in which a lone fisherman be seat however none of the goose be hurt but just there above the boat prettywe open she bill and drop thumbietot into the sea stockholm skansen a few year ago at skansen -- the great park just outside of stockholm where they have collect so many wonderful thing -- there live a little old man name clement larsson he be from hälsingland and have come to skansen with he fiddle to play folk dance and other old melody as a performer he appear mostly in the evening during the day it be he business to sit on guard in one of the many pretty peasant cottage which have be move to skansen from all part of the country in the beginning clement think that he fare better in he old age than he have ever dare dream but after a time he begin to dislike the place terribly especially while he be on watch duty it be all very well when visitor come into the cottage to look around but some day clement would sit for many hour all alone then he feel so homesick that he fear he would have to give up he place he be very poor and know that at home he would become a charge on the parish therefore he try to hold out as long as he could although he feel more unhappy from day to day one beautiful evening in the beginning of may clement have be grant a few hour ' leave of absence he be on he way down the steep hill lead out of skansen when he meet a island fisherman come along with he game bag the fisherman be a active young man who come to skansen with seafowl that he have manage to capture alive clement have meet he before many time the fisherman stop clement to ask if the superintendent at skansen be at home when clement have reply he in turn ask what choice thing the fisherman have in he bag you can see what i have the fisherman answer if in return you will give I a idea as to what i should ask for it he hold open the bag and clement peep into it once -- and again -- then quickly draw back a step or two good gracious ashbjörn he exclaim how do you catch that one he remember that when he be a child he mother use to talk of the tiny folk who live under the cabin floor he be not permit to cry or to be naughty lest he provoke these small people after he be grow he believe he mother have make up these story about the elf to make he behave himself but it have be no invention of he mother 's it seem for there in ashbjörn 's bag lay one of the tiny folk there be a little of the terror natural to childhood leave in clement and he feel a shudder run down he spinal column as he peep into the bag ashbjörn see that he be frightened and begin to laugh but clement take the matter seriously tell I ashbjörn where you come across he he ask you may be sure that i be not lie in wait for he say ashbjörn he come to I i start out early this morning and take my rifle along into the boat i have just pole away from the shore when i sight some wild goose come from the east shriek like mad i send they a shot but hit none of they instead this creature come tumble down into the water -- so close to the boat that i only have to put my hand out and pick he up i hope you do not shoot he ashbjörn oh no he be well and sound but when he come down he be a little dazed at first so i take advantage of that fact to wind the end of two sail thread around he ankle and wrist so that he could not run away ` ha here 's something for skansen ' i think instantly clement grow strangely trouble as the fisherman talk all that he have hear about the tiny folk in he childhood -- of they vindictiveness toward enemy and they benevolence toward friend -- come back to he it have never go well with those who have attempt to hold one of they captive you should have let he go at once ashbjörn say clement i come precious near be force to set he free return the fisherman you may as well know clement that the wild goose follow I all the way home and they criss-cross over the island the whole morning honk-honking as if they want he back not only they but the entire population -- sea gull sea swallow and many other who be not worth a shot of powder alight on the island and make a awful racket when i come out they flutter about I until i have to turn back my wife beg I to let he go but i have make up my mind that he should come here to skansen so i place one of the child 's doll in the window hide the midget in the bottom of my bag and start away the bird must have fancy that it be he who stand in the window for they permit I to leave without pursue I do it say anything ask clement yes at first he try to call to the bird but i would not have it and put a gag in he mouth oh ashbjörn protest clement how can you treat he so do not you see that he be something supernatural i do not know what he be say ashbjörn calmly let other consider that i be satisfied if only i can get a good sum for he now tell I clement what you think the doctor at skansen would give I there be a long pause before clement reply he feel very sorry for the poor little chap he actually imagine that he mother be stand beside he tell he that he must always be kind to the tiny folk i have no idea what the doctor up there would care to give you ashbjörn he say finally but if you will leave he with I i 'll pay you twenty krone for he ashbjörn stare at the fiddler in amazement when he hear he name so large a sum he think that clement believe the midget have some mysterious power and might be of service for he he be by no means certain that the doctor would think he such a great find or would offer to pay so high a sum for he so he accept clement 's proffer the fiddler poke he purchase into one of he wide pocket turn back to skansen and go into a moss-covered hut where there be neither visitor nor guard he close the door after he take out the midget who be still bind hand and foot and gag and lay he down gently on a bench now listen to what i say say clement i know of course that such as you do not like to be see of man but prefer to go about and busy yourselve in you own way therefore i have decide to give you you liberty -- but only on condition that you will remain in this park until i permit you to leave if you agree to this nod you head three time clement gaze at the midget with confident expectation but the latter do not move a muscle you shall not fare badly continue clement i 'll see to it that you be feed every day and you will have so much to do there that the time will not seem long to you but you must not go elsewhere till i give you leave now we 'll agree as to a signal so long as i set you food out in a white bowl you be to stay when i set it out in a blue one you may go clement pause again expect the midget to give the sign of approval but he do not stir very well say clement then there be no choice but to show you to the master of this place then you 'll be put in a glass case and all the people in the big city of stockholm will come and stare at you this scare the midget and he promptly give the signal that be right say clement as he cut the cord that bind the midget 's hand then he hurry toward the door the boy unloose the band around he ankle and tear away the gag before thinking of anything else when he turn to clement to thank he he have go just outside the door clement meet a handsome noble-looking gentleman who be on he way to a place close by from which there be a beautiful outlook clement could not recall have see the stately old man before but the latter must surely have notice clement sometime when he be play the fiddle because he stop and speak to he good day clement he say how do you do you be not ill be you i think you have grow a bit thin of late there be such a expression of kindliness about the old gentleman that clement pluck up courage and tell he of he homesickness what exclaim the old gentleman be you homesick when you be in stockholm it can not be possible he look almost offended then he reflect that it be only a ignorant old peasant from hälsingland that he talk with -- and so resume he friendly attitude surely you have never hear how the city of stockholm be found if you have you would comprehend that you anxiety to get away be only a foolish fancy come with I to the bench over yonder and i will tell you something about stockholm when the old gentleman be seat on the bench he glance down at the city which spread in all its glory below he and he draw a deep breath as if he wish to drink in all the beauty of the landscape thereupon he turn to the fiddler look clement he say and as he talk he trace with he cane a little map in the sand in front of they here lie uppland and here to the south a point jut out which be split up by a number of bay and here we have sörmland with another point which be just as cut up and point straight north here from the west come a lake fill with island : it be lake mälar from the east come another body of water which can barely squeeze in between the island and islet it be the east sea here clement where uppland join sörmland and mälaren join the east sea come a short river in the center of which lie four little islet that divide the river into several tributary -- one of which be call norriström but be formerly stocksund in the begin these islet be common wooded island such as one find in plenty on lake mälar even to-day and for age they be entirely uninhabited they be well located between two body of water and two body of land but this no one remark year after year pass people settle along lake mälar and in the archipelago but these river island attract no settler sometimes it happen that a seafarer put into port at one of they and pitch he tent for the night but no one remain there long one day a fisherman who live on liding island out in salt fiord steer he boat toward lake mälar where he have such good luck with he fishing that he forget to start for home in time he get no farther than the four islet and the best he could do be to land on one and wait until later in the night when there would be bright moonlight it be late summer and warm the fisherman haul he boat on land lay down beside it he head rest upon a stone and fall asleep when he awake the moon have be up a long while it hang right above he and shone with such splendor that it be like broad daylight the man jump to he foot and be about to push he boat into the water when he see a lot of black speck move out in the stream a school of seal be head full speed for the island when the fisherman see that they intend to crawl up on land he bent down for he spear which he always take with he in the boat but when he straighten up he see no seal instead there stand on the strand the most beautiful young maiden dress in green trail satin robe with pearl crown upon they head the fisherman understand that these be mermaid who live on desolate rock island far out at sea and have assume seal disguise in order to come up on land and enjoy the moonlight on the green islet he lay down the spear very cautiously and when the young maiden come up on the island to play he steal behind and survey they he have hear that sea-nymph be so beautiful and fascinating that no one could see they and not be enchant by they charm and he have to admit that this be not too much to say of they when he have stand for a while under the shadow of the tree and watch the dance he go down to the strand take one of the seal skin lie there and hide it under a stone then he go back to he boat lay down beside it and pretend to be asleep presently he see the young maiden trip down to the strand to don they seal skin at first all be play and laughter which be change to weep and wail when one of the mermaid could not find she seal robe she companion run up and down the strand and help she search for it but no trace could they find while they be seek they notice that the sky be grow pale and the day be break so they could tarry no longer and they all swim away leave behind the one whose seal skin be miss she sit on the strand and weep the fisherman feel sorry for she of course but he force himself to lie still till daybreak then he get up push the boat into the water and step into it to make it appear that he see she by chance after he have lift the oar ` who be you ' he call out ` be you shipwreck ' she run toward he and ask if he have see she seal skin the fisherman look as if he do not know what she be talk about she sit down again and weep then he determine to take she with he in the boat ` come with I to my cottage ' he command ` and my mother will take care of you you can not stay here on the island where you have neither food nor shelter ' he talk so convincingly that she be persuade to step into he boat both the fisherman and he mother be very kind to the poor mermaid and she seem to be happy with they she grow more contented every day and help the older woman with she work and be exactly like any other island lass -- only she be much prettier one day the fisherman ask she if she would be he wife and she do not object but at once say yes preparation be make for the wedding the mermaid dress as a bride in she green trail robe with the shimmering pearl crown she have wear when the fisherman first see she there be neither church nor parson on the island at that time so the bridal party seat themselves in the boat to row up to the first church they should find the fisherman have the mermaid and he mother in he boat and he row so well that he be far ahead of all the other when he have come so far that he could see the islet in the river where he win he bride he could not help smile ` what be you smile at ' she ask ` oh i be think of that night when i hide you seal skin ' answer the fisherman for he feel so sure of she that he think there be no longer any need for he to conceal anything ` what be you say ' ask the bride astonished ` surely i have never possess a seal skin ' it appear she have forget everything ` do not you recollect how you dance with the mermaid ' he ask ' i do not know what you mean ' say the bride ' i think that you must have dream a strange dream last night ' if i show you you seal skin you 'll probably believe I ' laugh the fisherman promptly turn the boat toward the islet they step ashore and he bring the seal skin out from under the stone where he have hide it but the instant the bride set eye on the seal skin she grasp it and draw it over she head it snuggle close to she -- as if there be life in it -- and immediately she throw herself into the stream the bridegroom see she swim away and plunge into the water after she but he could not catch up to she when he see that he could not stop she in any other way in he grief he seize he spear and hurl it he aim better than he have intend for the poor mermaid give a pierce shriek and disappear in the depths the fisherman stand on the strand wait for she to appear again he observe that the water around he begin to take on a soft sheen a beauty that he have never see before it shimmer in pink and white like the colour-play on the inside of sea shell as the glittering water lap the shore the fisherman think that they too be transform they begin to blossom and waft they perfume a soft sheen spread over they and they also take on a beauty which they have never possess before he understand how all this have come to pass for it be thus with mermaid : one who behold they must need find they more beautiful than any one else and the mermaid 's blood be mix with the water that bath the shore she beauty be transfer to both all who see they must love they and yearn for they this be they legacy from the mermaid when the stately old gentleman have get thus far in he narrative he turn to clement and look at he clement nod reverently but make no comment as he do not wish to cause a break in the story now you must bear this in mind clement the old gentleman continue with a roguish glint in he eye from that time on people emigrate to the island at first only fisherman and peasant settle there but other too be attract to they one day the king and he earl sail up the stream they start at once to talk of these island have observe they be so situate that every vessel that sail toward lake mälar have to pass they the earl suggest that there ought to be a lock put on the channel which could be open or close at will to let in merchant vessel and shut out pirate this idea be carry out say the old gentleman as he rise and begin to trace in the sand again with he cane on the largest of these island the earl erect a fortress with a strong tower which be call ` kärnan ' and around the island a wall be build here at the north and south end of the wall they make gate and place strong tower over they across the other island they build bridge these be likewise equip with high tower out in the water round about they put a wreath of pile with bar that could open and close so that no vessel could sail past without permission therefore you see clement the four island which have lie so long unnoticed be soon strongly fortify but this be not all for the shore and the sound tempt people and before long they come from all quarter to settle there they build a church which have since be call ` storkyrkan ' here it stand near the castle and here within the wall be the little hut the pioneer build for themselves they be primitive but they serve they purpose more be not need at that time to make the place pass for a city and the city be name stockholm there come a day clement when the earl who have begin the work go to he final rest and stockholm be without a master builder monk call the gray friar come to the country stockholm attract they they ask permission to erect a monastery there so the king give they a island -- one of the smaller one -- this one face lake mälar there they build and the place be call gray friar ' island other monk come call the black friar they too ask for right to build in stockholm near the south gate on this the larger of the island north of the city a ` holy ghost house ' or hospital be build while on the smaller one thrifty man put up a mill and along the little island close by the monk fish as you know there be only one island now for the canal between the two have fill up but it be still call holy ghost island and now clement all the little wooded island be dot with house but still people keep streaming in for these shore and water have the power to draw people to they hither come pious woman of the order of saint clara and ask for ground to build upon for they there be no choice but to settle on the north shore at norrmalm as it be call you may be sure that they be not over pleased with this location for across norrmalm run a high ridge and on that the city have its gallows hill so that it be a detest spot nevertheless the poor clare erect they church and they convent on the strand below the ridge after they be establish there they soon find plenty of follower upon the ridge itself be build a hospital and a church consecrate to saint goran and just below the ridge a church be erect to saint jacob and even at södermalm where the mountain rise perpendicularly from the strand they begin to build there they raise a church to saint mary but you must not think that only cloister folk move to stockholm there be also many other -- principally german tradesman and artisan these be more skilled than the swede and be well receive they settle within the wall of the city where they pull down the wretched little cabin that stand there and build high magnificent stone house but space be not plentiful within the wall therefore they have to build the house close together with gable face the narrow by-lane so you see clement that stockholm could attract people at this point in the narrative another gentleman appear and walk rapidly down the path toward the man who be talk to clement but he wave he hand and the other remain at a distance the dignified old gentleman still sit on the bench beside the fiddler now clement you must render I a service he say i have no time to talk more with you but i will send you a book about stockholm and you must read it from cover to cover i have so to speak lay the foundation of stockholm for you study the rest out for yourself and learn how the city have thrive and change read how the little narrow wall-enclosed city on the island have spread into this great sea of house below we read how on the spot where the dark tower kärnan once stand the beautiful light castle below we be erect and how the gray friar ' church have be turn into the burial place of the swedish king read how islet after islet be build up with factory how the ridge be lower and the sound fill in how the truck garden at the south and north end of the city have be convert into beautiful park or built-up quarter how the king 's private deer park have become the people 's favorite pleasure resort you must make yourself at home here clement this city do not belong exclusively to the stockholmer it belong to you and to all swede as you read about stockholm remember that i have speak the truth for the city have the power to draw every one to it first the king move here then the noble build they palace here and then one after another be attract to the place so that now as you see stockholm be not a city unto itself or for nearby district it have grow into a city for the whole kingdom you know clement that there be judicial court in every parish throughout the land but in stockholm they have jurisdiction for the whole nation you know that there be judge in every district court in the country but at stockholm there be only one court to which all the other be accountable you know that there be barracks and troops in every part of the land but those at stockholm command the whole army everywhere in the country you will find railroad but the whole great national system be control and manage at stockholm here you will find the govern board for the clergy for teacher for physician for bailiff and juror this be the heart of you country clement all the change you have in you pocket be coin here and the postage stamp you stick on you letter be make here there be something here for every swede here no one need feel homesick for here all swede be at home and when you read of all that have be bring here to stockholm think too of the latest that the city have attract to itself : these old-time peasant cottage here at skansen the old dance the old costume and house-furnishings the musician and story-teller everything good of the old time stockholm have tempt here to skansen to do it honor that it may in turn stand before the people with renew glory but first and last remember as you read about stockholm that you be to sit in this place you must see how the wave sparkle in joyous play and how the shore shimmer with beauty you will come under the spell of they witchery clement the handsome old gentleman have raise he voice so that it ring out strong and commanding and he eye shine then he rise and with a wave of he hand to clement walk away clement understand that the one who have be talk to he be a great man and he bow to he as low as he could the next day come a royal lackey with a big red book and a letter for clement and in the letter it say that the book be from the king after that the little old man clement larsson be lighthead for several day and it be impossible to get a sensible word out of he when a week have go by he go to the superintendent and give in he notice he simply have to go home why must you go home can not you learn to be content here ask the doctor oh i be contented here say clement that matter trouble I no longer but i must go home all the same clement be quite perturb because the king have say that he should learn all about stockholm and be happy there but he could not rest until he have tell every one at home that the king have say those word to he he could not renounce the idea of standing on the church knoll at home and tell high and low that the king have be so kind to he that he have sit beside he on the bench and have send he a book and have take the time to talk to he -- a poor fiddler -- for a whole hour in order to cure he of he homesickness it be good to relate this to the laplander and dalecarlian peasant girl at skansen but what be that compare to be able to tell of it at home even if clement be to end in the poorhouse it would not be so hard after this he be a totally different man from what he have be and he would be respect and honor in a very different way this new yearning take possession of clement he simply have to go up to the doctor and say that he must go home gorgo the eagle in the mountain glen far up among the mountain of lapland there be a old eagle 's nest on a ledge which project from a high cliff the nest be make of dry twig of pine and spruce interlaced one with another until they form a perfect network year by year the nest have be repair and strengthen it be about two metre wide and nearly as high as a laplander 's hut the cliff on which the eagle 's nest be situate tower above a big glen which be inhabit in summer by a flock of wild goose as it be a excellent refuge for they it be so secluded between cliff that not many know of it even among the laplander themselves in the heart of this glen there be a small round lake in which be a abundance of food for the tiny gosling and on the tufted lake shore which be cover with osier bush and dwarf birch the goose find fine nesting place in all age eagle have live on the mountain and goose in the glen every year the former carry off a few of the latter but they be very careful not to take so many that the wild goose would be afraid to remain in the glen the goose in they turn find the eagle quite useful they be robber to be sure but they keep other robber away two year before nil holgersson travel with the wild goose the old leader-goose akka from kebnekaise be stand at the foot of the mountain slope look toward the eagle 's nest the eagle be in the habit of start on they chase soon after sunrise during the summer that akka have live in the glen she have watch every morning for they departure to find if they stop in the glen to hunt or if they fly beyond it to other hunting grounds she do not have to wait long before the two eagle leave the ledge on the cliff stately and terror-striking they soar into the air they direct they course toward the plain and akka breathe a sigh of relief the old leader-goose 's day of nesting and rearing of young be over and during the summer she pass the time go from one goose range to another give counsel regard the brooding and care of the young aside from this she keep a eye out not only for eagle but also for mountain fox and owl and all other enemy who be a menace to the wild goose and they young about noontime akka begin to watch for the eagle again this she have do every day during all the summer that she have live in the glen she could tell at once by they flight if they hunt have be successful and in that event she feel relieved for the safety of those who belong to she but on this particular day she have not see the eagle return i must be get old and stupid she think when she have wait a time for they the eagle have probably be home this long while in the afternoon she look toward the cliff again expect to see the eagle perch on the rocky ledge where they usually take they afternoon rest toward evening when they take they bath in the dale lake she try again to get sight of they but fail again she bemoan the fact that she be grow old she be so accustomed to have the eagle on the mountain above she that she could not imagine the possibility of they not have return the follow morning akka be awake in good season to watch for the eagle but she do not see they on the other hand she hear in the morning stillness a cry that sound both angry and plaintive and it seem to come from the eagle ' nest can there possibly be anything amiss with the eagle she wonder she spread she wing quickly and rise so high that she could perfectly well look down into the nest there she see neither of the eagle there be no one in the nest save a little half-fledged eaglet who be scream for food akka sink down toward the eagle ' nest slowly and reluctantly it be a gruesome place to come to it be plain what kind of robber folk live there in the nest and on the cliff ledge lay bleached bone bloody feather piece of skin hare ' head bird ' beak and the tufted claw of grouse the eaglet who be lie in the midst of this be repulsive to look upon with he big gaping bill he awkward down-clad body and he undeveloped wing where the prospective quill stick out like thorn at last akka conquer she repugnance and alight on the edge of the nest at the same time glance about she anxiously in every direction for each second she expect to see the old eagle come back it be well that some one have come at last cry the baby eagle fetch I some food at once well well do not be in such haste say akka tell I first where you father and mother be that be what i should like to know myself they go off yesterday morning and leave I a lem to live upon while they be away you can believe that be eat long ago it be a shame for mother to let I starve in this way akka begin to think that the eagle have really be shoot and she reason that if she be to let the eaglet starve she might perhaps be rid of the whole robber tribe for all time but it go very much against she not to succor a desert young one so far as she could why do you sit there and stare snap the eaglet do not you hear I say i want food akka spread she wing and sink down to the little lake in the glen a moment later she return to the eagle ' nest with a salmon trout in she bill the eaglet fly into a temper when she drop the fish in front of he do you think i can eat such stuff he shriek push it aside and try to strike akka with he bill fetch I a willow grouse or a lem do you hear akka stretch she head forward and give the eaglet a sharp nip in the neck let I say to you remark the old goose that if i be to procure food for you you must be satisfy with what i give you you father and mother be dead and from they you can get no help but if you want to lie here and starve to death while you wait for grouse and lemming i shall not hinder you when akka have speak she mind she promptly retire and do not show she face in the eagle ' nest again for some time but when she do return the eaglet have eat the fish and when she drop another in front of he he swallow it at once although it be plain that he find it very distasteful akka have impose upon herself a tedious task the old eagle never appear again and she alone have to procure for the eaglet all the food he need she give he fish and frog and he do not seem to fare badly on this diet but grow big and strong he soon forget he parent the eagle and fancy that akka be he real mother akka in turn love he as if he have be she own child she try to give he a good bring up and to cure he of he wildness and overbearing way after a fortnight akka observe that the time be approach for she to moult and put on a new feather dress so as to be ready to fly for a whole moon she would be unable to carry food to the baby eaglet and he might starve to death so akka say to he one day : gorgo i can not come to you any more with fish everything depend now upon you pluck -- which mean can you dare to venture into the glen so i can continue to procure food for you you must choose between starvation and fly down to the glen but that too may cost you you life without a second 's hesitation the eaglet step upon the edge of the nest barely take the trouble to measure the distance to the bottom he spread he tiny wing and start away he roll over and over in space but nevertheless make enough use of he wing to reach the ground almost unhurt down there in the glen gorgo pass the summer in company with the little gosling and be a good comrade for they since he regard himself as a gosling he try to live as they live when they swim in the lake he follow they until he come near drown it be most embarrassing to he that he could not learn to swim and he go to akka and complain of he inability why can not i swim like the other he ask you claw grow too hooked and you toe too large while you be up there on the cliff akka reply but you 'll make a fine bird all the same the eaglet 's wing soon grow so large that they could carry he but not until autumn when the gosling learn to fly do it dawn upon he that he could use they for flight there come a proud time for he for at this sport he be the peer of they all he companion never stay up in the air any longer than they have to but he stay there nearly the whole day and practice the art of fly so far it have not occur to he that he be of another species than the goose but he could not help note a number of thing that surprise he and he question akka constantly why do grouse and lem run and hide when they see my shadow on the cliff he query they do not show such fear of the other gosling you wing grow too big when you be on the cliff say akka it be that which frighten the little wretch but do not be unhappy because of that you 'll be a fine bird all the same after the eagle have learn to fly he teach himself to fish and to catch frog but by and by he begin to ponder this also how do it happen that i live on fish and frog he ask the other gosling do not this be due to the fact that i have no other food to give you when you be on the cliff say akka but do not let that make you sad you 'll be a fine bird all the same when the wild goose begin they autumn move gorgo fly along with the flock regard himself all the while as one of they the air be fill with bird who be on they way south and there be great excitement among they when akka appear with a eagle in she train the wild goose flock be continually surround by swarm of the curious who loudly express they astonishment akka bade they be silent but it be impossible to stop so many wag tongue why do they call I a eagle gorgo ask repeatedly grow more and more exasperated can not they see that i be a wild goose i be no bird-eater who prey upon he kind how dare they give I such a ugly name one day they fly above a barn yard where many chicken walk on a dump heap and pick a eagle a eagle shriek the chicken and start to run for shelter but gorgo who have hear the eagle speak of as savage criminal could not control he anger he snap he wing together and shoot down to the ground striking he talon into one of the hen i 'll teach you i will that i be no eagle he scream furiously and strike with he beak that instant he hear akka call to he from the air and rise obediently the wild goose fly toward he and begin to reprimand he what be you try to do she cry beat he with she bill be it perhaps you intention to tear that poor hen to piece but when the eagle take he punishment from the wild goose without a protest there arise from the great bird throng around they a perfect storm of taunt and gibe the eagle hear this and turn toward akka with flaming eye as though he would have like to attack she but he suddenly change he mind and with quick wing stroke bound into the air soar so high that no call could reach he and he sail around up there as long as the wild goose see he two day later he appear again in the wild goose flock i know who i be he say to akka since i be a eagle i must live as become a eagle but i think that we can be friend all the same you or any of yours i shall never attack but akka have set she heart on successfully train a eagle into a mild and harmless bird and she could not tolerate he want to do as he choose do you think that i wish to be the friend of a bird-eater she ask live as i have teach you to live and you may travel with my flock as heretofore both be proud and stubborn and neither of they would yield it end in akka 's forbid the eagle to show he face in she neighborhood and she anger toward he be so intense that no one dare speak he name in she presence after that gorgo roam around the country alone and shun like all great robber he be often downhearted and certainly long many a time for the day when he think himself a wild goose and play with the merry gosling among the animal he have a great reputation for courage they use to say of he that he fear no one but he foster-mother akka and they could also say of he that he never use violence against a wild goose in captivity gorgo be only three year old and have not as yet think about marry and procure a home for himself when he be capture one day by a hunter and sell to the skansen zoölogical garden where there be already two eagle hold captive in a cage build of iron bar and steel wire the cage stand out in the open and be so large that a couple of tree have easily be move into it and quite a large cairn be pile up in there notwithstanding all this the bird be unhappy they sit motionless on the same spot nearly all day they pretty dark feather dress become rough and lustreless and they eye be rivet with hopeless longing on the sky without during the first week of gorgo 's captivity he be still awake and full of life but later a heavy torpor come upon he he perch himself on one spot like the other eagle and stare at vacancy he no longer know how the day pass one morning when gorgo sit in he usual torpor he hear some one call to he from below he be so drowsy that he could barely rouse himself enough to lower he glance who be call I he ask oh gorgo do not you know I it be thumbietot who use to fly around with the wild goose be akka also capture ask gorgo in the tone of one who be try to collect he thought after a long sleep no akka the white goosey-gander and the whole flock be probably safe and sound up in lapland at this season say the boy it be only i who be a prisoner here as the boy be speak he notice that gorgo avert he glance and begin to stare into space again golden eagle cry the boy i have not forget that once you carry I back to the wild goose and that you spare the white goosey-gander 's life tell I if i can be of any help to you gorgo scarcely raise he head do not disturb I thumbietot he yawn i be sit here dream that i be free and be soar away up among the cloud i do not want to be awake you must rouse yourself and see what go on around you the boy admonish or you will soon look as wretched as the other eagle i wish i be as they be they be so lose in they dream that nothing more can trouble they say the eagle when night come and all three eagle be asleep there be a light scrape on the steel wire stretch across the top of the cage the two listless old captive do not allow themselves to be disturb by the noise but gorgo awaken who be there who be move up on the roof he ask it be thumbietot gorgo answer the boy i be sit here file away at the steel wire so that you can escape the eagle raise he head and saw in the night light how the boy sit and file the steel wire at the top of the cage he feel hopeful for a instant but soon discouragement get the upper hand i be a big bird thumbietot say gorgo how can you ever manage to file away enough wire for I to come out you would better quit that and leave I in peace oh go to sleep and do not bother about I say the boy i 'll not be through to-night nor to-morrow night but i shall try to free you in time for here you 'll become a total wreck gorgo fall asleep when he awake the next morning he see at a glance that a number of wire have be file that day he feel less drowsy than he have do in the past he spread he wing and flutter from branch to branch to get the stiffness out of he joint one morning early just as the first streak of sunlight make its appearance thumbietot awaken the eagle try now gorgo he whisper the eagle look up the boy have actually file off so many wire that now there be a big hole in the wire net gorgo flap he wing and propel himself upward twice he miss and fall back into the cage but finally he succeed in get out with proud wing stroke he soar into the cloud little thumbietot sit and gaze after he with a mournful expression he wish that some one would come and give he he freedom too the boy be domicile now at skansen he have become acquaint with all the animal there and have make many friend among they he have to admit that there be so much to see and learn there that it be not difficult for he to pass the time to be sure he thought go forth every day to morten goosey-gander and he other comrade and he yearn for they if only i be not bind by my promise he think i would find some bird to take I to they it may seem strange that clement larsson have not restore the boy 's liberty but one must remember how excited the little fiddler have be when he leave skansen the morning of he departure he have think of set out the midget 's food in a blue bowl but unluckily he have be unable to find one all the skansen folk -- lapp peasant girl artisan and gardener -- have come to bid he good-bye and he have have no time to search for a blue bowl it be time to start and at the last moment he have to ask the old laplander to help he one of the tiny folk happen to be live here at skansen say clement and every morning i set out a little food for he will you do I the favor of take these few copper and purchase a blue bowl with they put a little gruel and milk in it and to-morrow morning set it out under the step of bollnäs cottage the old laplander look surprised but there be no time for clement to explain further as he have to be off to the railway station the laplander go down to the zoölogical village to purchase the bowl as he see no blue one that he think appropriate he buy a white one and this he conscientiously fill and set out every morning that be why the boy have not be release from he pledge he know that clement have go away but _ he _ be not allow to leave that night the boy long more than ever for he freedom this be because summer have come now in earnest during he travels he have suffer much in cold and stormy weather and when he first come to skansen he have think that perhaps it be just as well that he have be compel to break the journey he would have be freeze to death have he go to lapland in the month of may but now it be warm the earth be green-clad birch and poplar be clothe in they satiny foliage and the cherry tree -- in fact all the fruit tree -- be cover with blossom the berry bush have green berry on they stem the oak have carefully unfold they leaf and pea cabbage and bean be grow in the vegetable garden at skansen now it must be warm up in lapland think the boy i should like to be seat on morten goosey-gander 's back on a fine morning like this it would be great fun to ride around in the warm still air and look down at the ground as it now lie deck with green grass and embellish with pretty blossom he sit muse on this when the eagle suddenly swoop down from the sky and perch beside the boy on top of the cage i want to try my wing to see if they be still good for anything say gorgo you do not suppose that i mean to leave you here in captivity get up on my back and i 'll take you to you comrade no that be impossible the boy answer i have pledge my word that i would stay here till i be liberate what sort of nonsense be you talk protest gorgo in the first place they bring you here against you will then they force you to promise that you would remain here surely you must understand that such a promise one need not keep oh no i must keep it say the boy i thank you all the same for you kind intention but you can not help I oh can not i say gorgo we 'll see about that in a twinkle he grasp nil holgersson in he big talon and rise with he toward the sky disappear in a northerly direction on over gästrikland the precious girdle _ Wednesday June fifteenth _ the eagle keep on fly until he be a long distance north of stockholm then he sink to a wooded hillock where he relax he hold on the boy the instant thumbietot be out of gorgo 's clutch he start to run back to the city as fast as he could the eagle make a long swoop catch up to the boy and stop he with he claw do you propose to go back to prison he demand that be my affair i can go where i like for all of you retort the boy try to get away thereupon the eagle grip he with he strong talon and rise in the air now gorgo circle over the entire province of uppland and do not stop again until he come to the great water-fall at älvkarleby where he alight on a rock in the middle of the rush rapid below the roaring fall again he relax he hold on the captive the boy see that here there be no chance of escape from the eagle above they the white scum wall of the water-fall come tumble down and round about the river rush along in a mighty torrent thumbietot be very indignant to think that in this way he have be force to become a promise-breaker he turn he back to the eagle and would not speak to he now that the bird have set the boy down in a place from which he could not run away he tell he confidentially that he have be bring up by akka from kebnekaise and that he have quarrel with he foster-mother now thumbietot perhaps you understand why i wish to take you back to the wild goose he say i have hear that you be in great favor with akka and it be my purpose to ask you to make peace between we as soon as the boy comprehend that the eagle have not carry he off in a spirit of contrariness he feel kindly toward he i should like very much to help you he return but i be bind by my promise thereupon he explain to the eagle how he have fall into captivity and how clement larsson have leave skansen without set he free nevertheless the eagle would not relinquish he plan listen to I thumbietot he say my wing can carry you wherever you wish to go and my eye can search out whatever you wish to find tell I how the man look who exact this promise from you and i will find he and take you to he then it be for you to do the rest thumbietot approve of the proposition i can see gorgo that you have have a wise bird like akka for a foster-mother the boy remark he give a graphic description of clement larsson and add that he have hear at skansen that the little fiddler be from hälsingland we 'll search for he through the whole of hälsingland -- from ljungby to mellansjö from great mountain to hornland say the eagle to-morrow before sundown you shall have a talk with the man i fear you be promise more than you can perform doubt the boy i should be a mighty poor eagle if i could not do that much say gorgo so when gorgo and thumbietot leave älvkarleby they be good friend and the boy willingly take he mount for a ride on the eagle 's back thus he have a opportunity to see much of the country when clutch in the eagle 's talon he have see nothing perhaps it be just as well for in the forenoon he have travel over upsalum österby 's big factory the dannemora mine and the ancient castle of örbyhus and he would have be sadly disappoint at not see they have he know of they proximity the eagle bear he speedily over gästrikland in the southern part of the province there be very little to tempt the eye but as they fly northward it begin to be interesting this country be clothe in a spruce skirt and a gray-stone jacket think the boy but around its waist it wear a girdle which have not its match in value for it be embroidered with blue lake and green grove the great ironworks adorn it like a row of precious stone and its buckle be a whole city with castle and cathedral and great cluster of house when the traveller arrive in the northern forest region gorgo alight on top of a mountain as the boy dismount the eagle say : there be game in this forest and i can not forget my late captivity and feel really free until i have go a-hunting you will not mind my leave you for a while no of course i will not the boy assure he you may go where you like if only you be back here by sundown say the eagle as he fly off the boy sit on a stone gaze across the bare rocky ground and the great forest round about he feel rather lonely but soon he hear singing in the forest below and see something bright move amongst the tree presently he see a blue and yellow banner and he know by the song and the merry chatter that it be be bear at the head of a procession on it come up the wind path he wonder where it and those who follow it be go he could not believe that anybody would come up to such a ugly desolate waste as the place where he sit but the banner be near the forest border and behind it march many happy people for whom it have lead the way suddenly there be life and movement all over the mountain plain after that there be so much for the boy to see that he do not have a dull moment forest day on the mountain 's broad back where gorgo leave thumbietot there have be a forest fire ten year before since that time the char tree have be fell and remove and the great fire-swept area have begin to deck itself with green along the edge where it skirt the healthy forest however the larger part of the top be still barren and appallingly desolate char stump stand sentinel-like between the rock ledge bear witness that once there have be a fine forest here but no fresh root spring from the ground one day in the early summer all the child in the parish have assemble in front of the schoolhouse near the fire-swept mountain each child carry either a spade or a hoe on its shoulder and a basket of food in its hand as soon as all be assemble they march in a long procession toward the forest the banner come first with the teacher on either side of it then follow a couple of forester and a wagon load of pine shrub and spruce seed then the child the procession do not pause in any of the birch grove near the settlement but march on deep into the forest as it move along the fox stick they head out of the lair in astonishment and wonder what kind of backwoods people these be as they march past old coal pit where charcoal kiln be fire every autumn the cross-beak twist they hooked bill and ask one another what kind of coaler these might be who be now throng the forest finally the procession reach the big burnt mountain plain the rock have be strip of the fine twin-flower creeper that once cover they they have be rob of the pretty silver moss and the attractive reindeer moss around the dark water gather in cleft and hollow there be now no wood-sorrel the little patch of soil in crevice and between stone be without fern without star-flower without all the green and red and light and soft and soothing thing which usually clothe the forest ground it be as if a bright light flash upon the mountain when all the parish child cover it here again be something sweet and delicate something fresh and rosy something young and grow perhaps these child would bring to the poor abandon forest a little new life when the child have rest and eat they luncheon they seize hoe and spade and begin to work the forester show they what to do they set out shrub after shrub on every clear spot of earth they could find as they work they talk quite knowingly among themselves of how the little shrub they be plant would bind the soil so that it could not get away and of how new soil would form under the tree by and by seed would drop and in a few year they would be pick both strawberry and raspberry where now there be only bare rock the little shrub which they be plant would gradually become tall tree perhaps big house and great splendid ship would be build from they if the child have not come here and plant while there be still a little soil in the cleft all the earth would have be carry away by wind and water and the mountain could never more have be clothe in green it be well that we come say the child we be just in the nick of time they feel very important while they be work on the mountain they parent be at home by and by they begin to wonder how the child be get along of course it be only a joke about they plant a forest but it might be amusing to see what they be try to do so presently both father and mother be on they way to the forest when they come to the outlying stock farm they meet some of they neighbor be you go to the fire-swept mountain they ask that be where we be bind for to have a look at the child yes to see what they be up to it be only play of course it be not likely that there will be many forest tree plant by the youngster we have bring the coffee pot along so that we can have something warm to drink since we must stay there all day with only lunch-basket provision so the parent of the child go on up the mountain at first they think only of how pretty it look to see all the rosy-cheeked little child scatter over the gray hill later they observe how the child be work -- how some be set out shrub while other be digging furrow and sowing seed other again be pull up heather to prevent its choke the young tree they see that the child take the work seriously and be so intent upon what they be do that they scarcely have time to glance up the father and mother stand for a moment and look on then they too begin to pull up heather -- just for the fun of it the child be the instructor for they be already train and have to show they elder what to do thus it happen that all the grown-up who have come to watch the child take part in the work then of course it become greater fun than before by and by the child have even more help other implement be need so a couple of long-legged boy be send down to the village for spade and hoe as they run past the cabin the stay-at-home come out and ask : what be wrong have there be a accident no indeed but the whole parish be up on the fire-swept mountain plant a forest if the whole parish be there we can not stay at home so party after party of peasant go crowd to the top of the burnt mountain they stand a moment and look on the temptation to join the worker be irresistible it be a pleasure to sow one 's own acre in the spring and to think of the grain that will spring up from the earth but this work be even more alluring they think not only slender blade would come from that sowing but mighty tree with tall trunk and sturdy branch it mean give birth not merely to a summer 's grain but to many year ' growth it mean the awaken hum of insect the song of the thrush the play of grouse and all kind of life on the desolate mountain moreover it be like raise a memorial for come generation they could have leave a bare treeless height as a heritage instead they be to leave a glorious forest come generation would know they forefather have be a good and wise folk and they would remember they with reverence and gratitude a day in hälsingland a large green leaf _ Thursday June sixteenth _ the following day the boy travel over hälsingland it spread beneath he with new pale-green shoot on the pine tree new birch leave in the grove new green grass in the meadow and sprout grain in the field it be a mountainous country but directly through it run a broad light valley from either side of which branch other valley -- some short and narrow some broad and long this land resemble a leaf think the boy for it be as green as a leaf and the valley subdivide it in about the same way as the vein of a leaf be foliate the branch valley like the main one be fill with lake river farm and village they snuggle light and smile between the dark mountain until they be gradually squeeze together by the hill there they be so narrow that they could not hold more than a little brook on the high land between the valley there be pine forest which have no even ground to grow upon there be mountain stand all about and the forest cover the whole like a woolly hide stretch over a bony body it be a picturesque country to look down upon and the boy see a good deal of it because the eagle be try to find the old fiddler clement larsson and fly from ravine to ravine look for he a little later in the morning there be life and movement on every farm the door of the cattle shed be throw wide open and the cow be let out they be prettily color small supple and sprightly and so sure-footed that they make the most comic leap and bound after they come the calf and sheep and it be plainly to be see that they too be in the best of spirit it grow livelier every moment in the farm yard a couple of young girl with knapsack on they back walk among the cattle a boy with a long switch keep the sheep together and a little dog run in and out among the cow bark at the one that try to gore he the farmer hitch a horse to a cart load with tub of butter box of cheese and all kind of eatables the people laugh and chatter they and the beast be alike merry -- as if look forward to a day of real pleasure a moment later all be on they way to the forest one of the girl walk in the lead and coax the cattle with pretty musical call the animal follow in a long line the shepherd boy and the sheep-dog run hither and thither to see that no creature turn from the right course and last come the farmer and he hire man they walk beside the cart to prevent its be upset for the road they follow be a narrow stony forest path it may have be the custom for all the peasant in hälsingland to send they cattle into the forest on the same day -- or perhaps it only happen so that year at any rate the boy see how procession of happy people and cattle wander out from every valley and every farm and rush into the lonely forest fill it with life from the depths of the dense wood the boy hear the shepherd maiden ' song and the tinkle of the cow bell many of the procession have long and difficult road to travel and the boy see how they tramp through marsh how they have to take roundabout way to get past windfall and how time and again the cart bump against stone and turn over with all they contents but the people meet all the obstacle with joke and laughter in the afternoon they come to a clear space where cattle shed and a couple of rude cabin have be build the cow moo with delight as they tramp on the luscious green grass in the yard between the cabin and at once begin grazing the peasant with merry chatter and banter carry water and wood and all that have be bring in the cart into the larger cabin presently smoke rise from the chimney and then the dairymaid the shepherd boy and the man squat upon a flat rock and eat they supper gorgo the eagle be certain that he should find clement larsson among those who be off for the forest whenever he see a stock farm procession he sink down and scrutinize it with he sharp eye but hour after hour pass without he find the one he seek after much circle around toward evening they come to a stony and desolate tract east of the great main valley there the boy see another outlying stock farm under he the people and the cattle have arrive the man be splitting wood and the dairymaid be milk the cow look there say gorgo i think we have get he he sink and to he great astonishment the boy see that the eagle be right there indeed stand little clement larsson chop wood gorgo alight on a pine tree in the thick wood a little away from the house i have fulfil my obligation say the eagle with a proud toss of he head now you must try and have a word with the man i 'll perch here at the top of the thick pine and wait for you the animal ' new year 's eve the day 's work be do at the forest ranch supper be over and the peasant sit about and chat it be a long time since they have be in the forest of a summer 's night and they seem reluctant to go to bed and sleep it be as light as day and the dairymaid be busy with they needle-work ever and anon they raise they head look toward the forest and smile now we be here again they say the town with its unrest fade from they mind and the forest with its peaceful stillness enfold they when at home they have wonder how they should ever be able to endure the loneliness of the wood but once there they feel that they be have they best time many of the young girl and young man from neighbour ranch have come to call upon they so that there be quite a lot of folk seat on the grass before the cabin but they do not find it easy to start conversation the man be go home the next day so the dairymaid give they little commission and bid they take greeting to they friend in the village this be nearly all that have be say suddenly the eldest of the dairy girl look up from she work and say laughingly : there be no need of we sit here so silent to-night for we have two story-teller with we one be clement larsson who sit beside I and the other be bernhard from sunnasjö who stand back there gaze toward black 's ridge i think that we should ask each of they to tell we a story to the one who entertain we the better i shall give the muffler i be knit this proposal win hearty applause the two competitor offer lame excuse naturally but be quickly persuade clement ask bernhard to begin and he do not object he know little of clement larsson but assume that he would come out with some story about ghost and troll as he know that people like to listen to such thing he think it best to choose something of the same sort some century ago he begin a dean here in delsbo township be ride through the dense forest on a new year 's eve he be on horseback dress in fur coat and cap on the pommel of he saddle hang a satchel in which he keep the communion service the prayer-book and the clerical robe he have be summon on a parochial errand to a remote forest settlement where he have talk with a sick person until late in the evening now he be on he way home but fear that he should not get back to the rectory until after midnight as he have to sit in the saddle when he should have be at home in he bed he be glad it be not a rough night the weather be mild the air still and the sky overcast behind the cloud hang a full round moon which give some light although it be out of sight but for that faint light it would have be impossible for he to distinguish path from field for that be a snowless winter and all thing have the same grayish-brown color the horse the dean ride be one he prize very highly he be strong and sturdy and quite as wise as a human be he could find he way home from any place in the township the dean have observe this on several occasion and he rely upon it with such a sense of security that he never trouble himself to think where he be go when he ride that horse so he come along now in the gray night through the bewildering forest with the rein dangle and he thought far away he be think of the sermon he have to preach on the morrow and of much else besides and it be a long time before it occur to he to notice how far along he be on he homeward way when he do glance up he see that the forest be as dense about he as at the beginning and he be somewhat surprise for he have ride so long that he should have come to the inhabit portion of the township delsbo be about the same then as now the church and parsonage and all the large farm and village be at the northern end of the township while at the southern part there be only forest and mountain the dean see that he be still in the unpopulated district and know that he be in the southern part and must ride to the north to get home there be no star nor be there a moon to guide he but he be a man who have the four cardinal point in he head he have the positive feeling that he be travel southward or possibly eastward he intend to turn the horse at once but hesitate the animal have never stray and it do not seem likely that he would do so now it be more likely that the dean be mistaken he have be far away in thought and have not look at the road so he let the horse continue in the same direction and again lose himself in he reverie suddenly a big branch strike he and almost sweep he off the horse then he realize that he must find out where he be he glance down and see that he be ride over a soft marsh where there be no beaten path the horse trot along at a brisk pace and show no uncertainty again the dean be positive that he be go in the wrong direction and now he do not hesitate to interfere he seize the rein and turn the horse about guide he back to the roadway no sooner be he there than he turn again and make straight for the wood the dean be certain that he be go wrong but because the beast be so persistent he think that probably he be try to find a better road and let he go along the horse do very well although he have no path to follow if a precipice obstruct he way he climb it as nimbly as a goat and later when they have to descend he bunch he hoof and slide down the rocky incline ` may he only find he way home before church hour ' think the dean ' i wonder how the delsbo folk would take it if i be not at my church on time ' he do not have to brood over this long for soon he come to a place that be familiar to he it be a little creek where he have fish the summer before now he see it be as he have fear -- he be in the depths of the forest and the horse be plod along in a south-easterly direction he seem determine to carry the dean as far from church and rectory as he could the clergyman dismount he could not let the horse carry he into the wilderness he must go home and since the animal persist in go in the wrong direction he decide to walk and lead he until they come to more familiar road the dean wind the rein around he arm and begin to walk it be not a easy matter to tramp through the forest in a heavy fur coat but the dean be strong and hardy and have little fear of overexertion the horse meanwhile cause he fresh anxiety he would not follow but plant he hoof firmly on the ground at last the dean be angry he have never beat that horse nor do he wish to do so now instead he throw down the rein and walk away ` we may as well part company here since you want to go you own way ' he say he have not take more than two step before the horse come after he take a cautious grip on he coat sleeve and stop he the dean turn and look the horse straight in the eye as if to search out why he behave so strangely afterward the dean could not quite understand how this be possible but it be certain that dark as it be he plainly see the horse 's face and read it like that of a human be he realize that the animal be in a terrible state of apprehension and fear he give he master a look that be both implore and reproachful ' i have serve you day after day and do you bidding ' he seem to say ` will you not follow I this one night ' the dean be touch by the appeal in the animal 's eye it be clear that the horse need he help to-night in one way or another be a man through and through the dean promptly determine to follow he without further delay he spring into the saddle ` go on ' he say ' i will not desert you since you want I no one shall say of the dean in delsbo that he refuse to accompany any creature who be in trouble ' he let the horse go as he wish and think only of keep he seat it prove to be a hazardous and troublesome journey -- uphill most of the way the forest be so thick that he could not see two foot ahead but it appear to he that they be ascend a high mountain the horse climb perilous steep have the dean be guide he should not have think of ride over such ground ` surely you do not intend to go up to black 's ridge do you ' laugh the dean who know that be one of the highest peak in hälsingland during the ride he discover that he and the horse be not the only one who be out that night he hear stone roll down and branch crackle as if animal be break they way through the forest he remember that wolf be plentiful in that section and wonder if the horse wish to lead he to a encounter with wild beast they mount up and up and the higher they go the more scatter be the tree at last they ride on almost bare highland where the dean could look in every direction he gaze out over immeasurable tract of land which go up and down in mountain and valley cover with sombre forest it be so dark that he have difficulty in see any orderly arrangement but presently he could make out where he be ` why of course it be black 's ridge that i have come to ' he remark to himself ` it can not be any other mountain for there in the west i see jarv island and to the east the sea glitter around ag island toward the north also i see something shiny it must be dellen in the depths below I i see white smoke from nian fall yes i be up on black 's ridge what a adventure ' when they be at the summit the horse stop behind a thick pine as if to hide the dean bent forward and push aside the branch that he might have a unobstructed view the mountain 's bald plate confront he it be not empty and desolate as he have anticipate in the middle of the open space be a immense boulder around which many wild beast have gather apparently they be hold a conclave of some sort near to the big rock he see bear so firmly and heavily build that they seem like fur-clad block of stone they be lie down and they little eye blink impatiently it be obvious that they have come from they winter sleep to attend court and that they could hardly keep awake behind they in tight row be hundred of wolf they be not sleepy for wolf be more alert in winter than in summer they sit upon they haunch like dog whipping the ground with they tail and panting -- they tongue loll far out of they jaw behind the wolf the lynx skulk stiff-legged and clumsy like misshapen cat they be loath to be among the other beast and hiss and spit when one come near they the row back of the lynx be occupy by the wolverine with dog face and bear coat they be not happy on the ground and they stamp they pad impatiently longing to get into the tree behind they cover the entire space to the forest border leap the fox the weasel and the marten these be small and perfectly form but they look even more savage and bloodthirsty than the larger beast all this the dean plainly see for the whole place be illuminate upon the huge rock at the center be the wood-nymph who hold in she hand a pine torch which burn in a big red flame the nymph be as tall as the tallest tree in the forest she wear a spruce-brush mantle and have spruce-cone hair she stand very still she face turn toward the forest she be watch and listen the dean see everything as plain as plain could be but he astonishment be so great that he try to combat it and would not believe the evidence of he own eye ` such thing can not possibly happen ' he think ' i have ride much too long in the bleak forest this be only a optical illusion ' nevertheless he give the closest attention to the spectacle and wonder what be about to be do he have not long to wait before he catch the sound of a familiar bell come from the depths of the forest and the next moment he hear footfall and crackling of branch -- as when many animal break through the forest a big herd of cattle be climb the mountain they come through the forest in the order in which they have march to the mountain ranch first come the bell cow follow by the bull then the other cow and the calf the sheep closely herd follow after they come the goat and last be the horse and colt the sheep-dog trot along beside the sheep but neither shepherd nor shepherdess attend they the dean think it heart-rending to see the tame animal come straight toward the wild beast he would gladly have block they way and call ` halt ' but he understand that it be not within human power to stop the march of the cattle on this night therefore he make no move the domestic animal be in a state of torment over that which they have to face if it happen to be the bell cow 's turn she advance with droop head and falter step the goat have no desire either to play or to butt the horse try to bear up bravely but they body be all of a quiver with fright the most pathetic of all be the sheep-dog he keep he tail between he leg and crawl on the ground the bell cow lead the procession all the way up to the wood-nymph who stand on the boulder at the top of the mountain the cow walk around the rock and then turn toward the forest without any of the wild beast touch she in the same way all the cattle walk unmolested past the wild beast as the creature file past the dean see the wood-nymph lower she pine torch over one and another of they every time this occur the beast of prey break into loud exultant roar -- particularly when it be lower over a cow or some other large creature the animal that see the torch turn toward it utter a pierce shriek as if it have receive a knife thrust in its flesh while the entire herd to which it belong bellow they lamentation then the dean begin to comprehend the meaning of what he see surely he have hear that the animal in delsbo assemble on black 's ridge every new year 's eve that the wood-nymph might mark out which among the tame beast would that year be prey for the wild beast the dean pity the poor creature that be at the mercy of savage beast when in reality they should have no master but man the lead herd have only just leave when another bell tinkle and the cattle from another farm tramp to the mountain top these come in the same order as the first and march past the wood-nymph who stand there stern and solemn indicate animal after animal for death herd upon herd follow without a break in the line of procession some be so small that they include only one cow and a few sheep other consist of only a pair of goat it be apparent that these be from very humble home but they too be compel to pass in review the dean thought of the delsbo farmer who have so much love for they beast ` do they but know of it surely they would not allow a repetition of this ' he think ` they would risk they own life rather than let they cattle wander amongst bear and wolf to be doom by the wood-nymph ' the last herd to appear be the one from the rectory farm the dean hear the sound of the familiar bell a long way off the horse too must have hear it for he begin to shake in every limb and be bath in sweat ` so it be you turn now to pass before the wood-nymph to receive you sentence ' the dean say to the horse ` do not be afraid now i know why you bring I here and i shall not leave you ' the fine cattle from the parsonage farm emerge from the forest and march to the wood-nymph and the wild beast last in the line be the horse that have bring he master to black 's ridge the dean do not leave the saddle but let the animal take he to the wood-nymph he have neither knife nor gun for he defense but he have take out the prayer-book and sit press it to he heart as he expose himself to battle against evil at first it appear as if none have observe he the dean 's cattle file past the wood-nymph in the same order as the other have do she do not wave the torch toward any of these but as soon as the intelligent horse step forward she make a movement to mark he for death instantly the dean hold up the prayer-book and the torchlight fall upon the cross on its cover the wood-nymph utter a loud shrill cry and let the torch drop from she hand immediately the flame be extinguish in the sudden transition from light to darkness the dean see nothing nor do he hear anything about he reign the profound stillness of a wilderness in winter then the dark cloud part and through the opening step the full round moon to shed its light upon the ground the dean see that he and the horse be alone on the summit of black 's ridge not one of the many wild beast be there the ground have not be trample by the herd that have pass over it but the dean himself sit with he prayer-book before he while the horse under he stand tremble and foam by the time the dean reach home he no longer know whether or not it have be a dream a vision or reality -- this that he have see but he take it as a warn to he to remember the poor creature who be at the mercy of wild beast he preach so powerfully to the delsbo peasant that in he day all the wolf and bear be exterminate from that section of the country although they may have return since he time here bernhard end he story he receive praise from all side and it seem to be a foregone conclusion that he would get the prize the majority think it almost a pity that clement have to compete with he but clement undaunted begin : one day while i be live at skansen just outside of stockholm and longing for home -- then he tell about the tiny midget he have ransom so that he would not have to be confine in a cage to be stare at by all the people he tell also that no sooner have he perform this act of mercy than he be reward for it he talk and talk and the astonishment of he hearer grow greater and greater but when he come to the royal lackey and the beautiful book all the dairymaid drop they needle-work and sit stare at clement in open-eyed wonder at he marvellous experience as soon as clement have finish the eldest of the dairymaid announce that he should have the muffler bernhard relate only thing that happen to another but clement have himself be the hero of a true story which i consider far more important in this all concur they regard clement with very different eye after hear that he have talk with the king and the little fiddler be afraid to show how proud he feel but at the very height of he elation some one ask he what have become of the midget i have no time to set out the blue bowl for he myself say clement so i ask the old laplander to do it what have become of he since then i do not know no sooner have he speak than a little pine cone come along and strike he on the nose it do not drop from a tree and none of the peasant have throw it it be simply impossible to tell whence it have come aha clement wink the dairymaid it appear as if the tiny folk be listen to we you should not have leave it to another to set out that blue bowl in medelpad _ Friday June seventeenth _ the boy and the eagle be out bright and early the next morning gorgo hope that he would get far up into west bothnium that day as luck would have it he hear the boy remark to himself that in a country like the one through which they be now travel it must be impossible for people to live the land which spread below they be southern medelpad when the eagle hear the boy 's remark he reply : up here they have forest for field the boy thought of the contrast between the light golden-rye field with they delicate blade that spring up in one summer and the dark spruce forest with its solid tree which take many year to ripen for harvest one who have to get he livelihood from such a field must have a deal of patience he observe nothing more be say until they come to a place where the forest have be clear and the ground be cover with stump and lopped-off branch as they fly over this ground the eagle hear the boy mutter to himself that it be a mighty ugly and poverty-stricken place this field be clear last winter say the eagle the boy thought of the harvester at home who ride on they reap machine on fine summer morning and in a short time mow a large field but the forest field be harvest in winter the lumberman go out in the wilderness when the snow be deep and the cold most severe it be tedious work to fall even one tree and to hew down a forest such as this they must have be out in the open many week they have to be hardy man to mow a field of this kind he say when the eagle have take two more wing stroke they sight a log cabin at the edge of the clearing it have no window and only two loose board for a door the roof have be cover with bark and twig but now it be gaping and the boy could see that inside the cabin there be only a few big stone to serve as a fireplace and two board bench when they be above the cabin the eagle suspect that the boy be wonder who could have live in such a wretched hut as that the reaper who mow the forest field live there the eagle say the boy remember how the reaper in he home have return from they day 's work cheerful and happy and how the best he mother have in the larder be always spread for they while here after the arduous work of the day they must rest on hard bench in a cabin that be worse than a outhouse and what they have to eat he could not imagine i wonder if there be any harvest festival for these labourer he question a little farther on they see below they a wretchedly bad road wind through the forest it be narrow and zigzag hilly and stony and cut up by brook in many place as they fly over it the eagle know that the boy be wonder what be cart over a road like that over this road the harvest be convey to the stack the eagle say the boy recall what fun they have at home when the harvest wagon draw by two sturdy horse carry the grain from the field the man who drive sit proudly on top of the load the horse dance and prick up they ear while the village child who be allow to climb upon the sheaf sit there laugh and shriek half-pleased half-frightened but here the great log be draw up and down steep hill here the poor horse must be work to they limit and the driver must often be in peril i be afraid there have be very little cheer along this road the boy observe the eagle fly on with powerful wing stroke and soon they come to a river bank cover with log chip and bark the eagle perceive that the boy wonder why it look so litter up down there here the harvest have be stack the eagle tell he the boy thought of how the grain stack in he part of the country be pile up close to the farm as if they be they greatest ornament while here the harvest be bear to a desolate river strand and leave there i wonder if any one out in this wilderness count he stack and compare they with he neighbor 's he say a little later they come to ljungen a river which glide through a broad valley immediately everything be so change that they might well think they have come to another country the dark spruce forest have stop on the incline above the valley and the slope be clothe in light-stemmed birch and aspen the valley be so broad that in many place the river widen into lake along the shore lay a large flourishing town as they soar above the valley the eagle realize that the boy be wonder if the field and meadow here could provide a livelihood for so many people here live the reaper who mow the forest field the eagle say the boy be think of the lowly cabin and the hedged-in farm down in skåne when he exclaim : why here the peasant live in real manor it look as if it might be worth one 's while to work in the forest the eagle have intend to travel straight north but when he have fly out over the river he understand that the boy wonder who handle the timber after it be stack on the river bank the boy recollect how careful they have be at home never to let a grain be waste while here be great raft of log float down the river uncared for he could not believe that more than half of the log ever reach they destination many be float in midstream and for they all go smoothly other move close to the shore bump against point of land and some be leave behind in the still water of the creek on the lake there be so many log that they cover the entire surface of the water these appear to be lodge for a indefinite period at the bridge they stick in the fall they be bunch then they be pyramid and break in two afterward in the rapid they be block by the stone and mass into great heap i wonder how long it take for the log to get to the mill say the boy the eagle continue he slow flight down river ljungen over many place he pause in the air on outspread wing that the boy might see how this kind of harvest work be do presently they come to a place where the logger be at work the eagle mark that the boy wonder what they be do they be the one who take care of all the belated harvest the eagle say the boy remember the perfect ease with which he people at home have drive they grain to the mill here the man run alongside the shore with long boat-hook and with toil and effort urge the log along they wade out in the river and be soak from top to toe they jump from stone to stone far out into the rapid and they tramp on the roll log heap as calmly as though they be on flat ground they be daring and resolute man as i watch this i be remind of the iron-moulder in the mining district who juggle with fire as if it be perfectly harmless remark the boy these logger play with water as if they be its master they seem to have subjugate it so that it dare not harm they gradually they near the mouth of the river and bothnium bay be beyond they gorgo fly no farther straight ahead but go northward along the coast before they have travel very far they see a lumber camp as large as a small city while the eagle circle back and forth above it he hear the boy remark that this place look interesting here you have the great lumber camp call svartvik the eagle say the boy thought of the mill at home which stand peacefully embed in foliage and move its wing very slowly this mill where they grind the forest harvest stand on the water the mill pond be crowd with log one by one the helper seize they with they cant-hook crowd they into the chute and hurry they along to the whirling saw what happen to the log inside the boy could not see but he hear loud buzz and roar and from the other end of the house small car run out load with white plank the car run on shine track down to the lumber yard where the plank be pile in row form street -- like block of house in a city in one place they be build new pile in another they be pull down old one these be carry aboard two large vessel which lay wait for cargo the place be alive with workman and in the wood back of the yard they have they home they 'll soon manage to see up all the forest in medelpad the way they work here say the boy the eagle move he wing just a little and carry the boy above another large camp very much like the first with the mill yard wharf and the home of the workman this be call kukikenborg the eagle say he flap he wing slowly fly past two big lumber camp and approach a large city when the eagle hear the boy ask the name of it he cry this be sundsvall the manor of the lumber district the boy remember the city of skåne which look so old and gray and solemn while here in the bleak north the city of sundsvall face a beautiful bay and look young and happy and beam there be something odd about the city when one see it from above for in the middle stand a cluster of tall stone structure which look so impose that they match be hardly to be find in stockholm around the stone building there be a large open space then come a wreath of frame house which look pretty and cosy in they little garden but they seem to be conscious of the fact that they be very much poorer than the stone house and dare not venture into they neighborhood this must be both a wealthy and powerful city remark the boy can it be possible that the poor forest soil be the source of all this the eagle flap he wing again and go over to aln island which lie opposite sundsvall the boy be greatly surprise to see all the sawmill that deck the shore on aln island they stand one next another and on the mainland opposite be mill upon mill lumber yard upon lumber yard he count forty at least but believe there be many more how wonderful it all look from up here he marvel so much life and activity i have not see in any place save this on the whole trip it be a great country that we have wherever i go there be always something new for people to live upon a morning in ångermanland the bread _ Saturday June eighteenth _ next morning when the eagle have fly some distance into ångermanland he remark that to-day he be the one who be hungry and must find something to eat he set the boy down in a enormous pine on a high mountain ridge and away he fly the boy find a comfortable seat in a cleft branch from which he could look down over ångermanland it be a glorious morning the sunshine gilded the treetop a soft breeze play in the pine needle the sweetest fragrance be waft through the forest a beautiful landscape spread before he and the boy himself be happy and care-free he feel that no one could be better off he have a perfect outlook in every direction the country west of he be all peak and table-land and the farther away they be the higher and wilder they look to the east there be also many peak but these sink lower and lower toward the sea where the land become perfectly flat everywhere he see shine river and brook which be have a troublesome journey with rapid and fall so long as they run between mountain but spread out clear and broad as they near the shore of the coast bothnium bay be dot with island and notch with point but farther out be open blue water like a summer sky when the boy have have enough of the landscape he unloose he knapsack take out a morsel of fine white bread and begin to eat i do not think i have ever taste such good bread say he and how much i have leave there be enough to last I for a couple of day as he munch he think of how he have come by the bread it must be because i get it in such a nice way that it taste so good to I he say the golden eagle have leave medelpad the evening before he have hardly cross the border into ångermanland when the boy catch a glimpse of a fertile valley and a river which surpass anything of the kind he have see before as the boy glance down at the rich valley he complain of feeling hungry he have have no food for two whole day he say and now he be famished gorgo do not wish to have it say that the boy have fare worse in he company than when he travel with the wild goose so he slacken he speed why have not you speak of this before he ask you shall have all the food you want there be no need of you starve when you have a eagle for a travel companion just then the eagle sight a farmer who be sowing a field near the river strand the man carry the seed in a basket suspend from he neck and each time that it be empty he refill it from a seed sack which stand at the end of the furrow the eagle reason it out that the sack must be fill with the best food that the boy could wish for so he dart toward it but before the bird could get there a terrible clamor arise about he sparrow crow and swallow come rush up with wild shriek think that the eagle mean to swoop down upon some bird away away robber away away bird-killer they cry they make such a racket that it attract the farmer who come run so that gorgo have to flee and the boy get no seed the small bird behave in the most extraordinary manner not only do they force the eagle to flee they pursue he a long distance down the valley and everywhere the people hear they cry woman come out and clap they hand so that it sound like a volley of musketry and the man rush out with rifle the same thing be repeat every time the eagle sweep toward the ground the boy abandon the hope that the eagle could procure any food for he it have never occur to he before that gorgo be so much hate he almost pity he in a little while they come to a homestead where the housewife have just be bake she have set a platter of sugared bun in the back yard to cool and be stand beside it watch so that the cat and dog should not steal the bun the eagle circle down to the yard but dare not alight right under the eye of the peasant woman he fly up and down irresolute twice he come down as far as the chimney then rise again the peasant woman notice the eagle she raise she head and follow he with she glance how peculiarly he act she remark i believe he want one of my bun she be a beautiful woman tall and fair with a cheery open countenance laugh heartily she take a bun from the platter and hold it above she head if you want it come and take it she challenge while the eagle do not understand she language he know at once that she be offer he the bun with lightning speed he swoop to the bread snatch it and fly toward the height when the boy see the eagle snatch the bread he weep for joy -- not because he would escape suffer hunger for a few day but because he be touch by the peasant woman 's share she bread with a savage bird of prey where he now sit on the pine branch he could recall at will the tall fair woman as she stand in the yard and hold up the bread she must have know that the large bird be a golden eagle -- a plunderer who be usually welcome with loud shot doubtless she have also see the queer changele he bear on he back but she have not think of what they be as soon as she understand that they be hungry she share she good bread with they if i ever become human again think the boy i shall look up the pretty woman who live near the great river and thank she for she kindness to we the forest fire while the boy be still at he breakfast he smell a faint odour of smoke come from the north he turn and see a tiny spiral white as a mist rise from a forest ridge -- not from the one nearest he but from the one beyond it it look strange to see smoke in the wild forest but it might be that a mountain stock farm lay over yonder and the woman be boil they morning coffee it be remarkable the way that smoke increase and spread it could not come from a ranch but perhaps there be charcoal kiln in the forest the smoke increase every moment now it curl over the whole mountain top it be not possible that so much smoke could come from a charcoal kiln there must be a conflagration of some sort for many bird fly over to the nearest ridge hawk grouse and other bird who be so small that it be impossible to recognize they at such a distance flee from the fire the tiny white spiral of smoke grow to a thick white cloud which roll over the edge of the ridge and sink toward the valley spark and flake of soot shoot up from the cloud and here and there one could see a red flame in the smoke a big fire be rage over there but what be burn surely there be no large farm hide in the forest the source of such a fire must be more than a farm now the smoke come not only from the ridge but from the valley below it which the boy could not see because the next ridge obstruct he view great cloud of smoke ascend the forest itself be burn it be difficult for he to grasp the idea that the fresh green pine could burn if it really be the forest that be burn perhaps the fire might spread all the way over to he it seem improbable but he wish the eagle would soon return it would be best to be away from this the mere smell of the smoke which he draw in with every breath be a torture all at once he hear a terrible crackling and sputter it come from the ridge nearest he there on the highest point stand a tall pine like the one in which he sit a moment before it have be a gorgeous red in the morning light now all the needle flash and the pine catch fire never before have it look so beautiful but this be the last time it could exhibit any beauty for the pine be the first tree on the ridge to burn it be impossible to tell how the flame have reach it have the fire fly on red wing or crawl along the ground like a snake it be not easy to say but there it be at all event the great pine burn like a birch stem ah look now smoke curl up in many place on the ridge the forest fire be both bird and snake it could fly in the air over wide stretch or steal along the ground the whole ridge be ablaze there be a hasty flight of bird that circle up through the smoke like big flake of soot they fly across the valley and come to the ridge where the boy sit a horned owl perch beside he and on a branch just above he a hen hawk alight these would have be dangerous neighbor at any other time but now they do not even glance in he direction -- only stare at the fire probably they could not make out what be wrong with the forest a marten run up the pine to the tip of a branch and look at the burning height close beside the marten sit a squirrel but they do not appear to notice each other now the fire come rush down the slope hiss and roar like a tornado through the smoke one could see the flame dart from tree to tree before a branch catch fire it be first envelop in a thin veil of smoke then all the needle grow red at one time and it begin to crackle and blaze in the glen below run a little brook border by elm and small birch it appear as if the flame would halt there leafy tree be not so ready to take fire as fir tree the fire do pause as if before a gate that could stop it it glow and crackle and try to leap across the brook to the pine wood on the other side but could not reach they for a short time the fire be thus restrained then it shoot a long flame over to the large dry pine that stand on the slope and this be soon ablaze the fire have cross the brook the heat be so intense that every tree on the mountain be ready to burn with the roar and rush of the maddest storm and the wildest torrent the forest fire fly over to the ridge then the hawk and the owl rise and the marten dash down the tree in a few seconds more the fire would reach the top of the pine and the boy too would have to be move it be not easy to slide down the long straight pine trunk he take as firm a hold of it as he could and slide in long stretch between the knotty branch finally he tumble headlong to the ground he have no time to find out if he be hurt -- only to hurry away the fire race down the pine like a rage tempest the ground under he foot be hot and smoulder on either side of he run a lynx and a adder and right beside the snake flutter a mother grouse who be hurry along with she little downy chick when the refugee descend the mountain to the glen they meet people fight the fire they have be there for some time but the boy have be gaze so intently in the direction of the fire that he have not notice they before in this glen there be a brook border by a row of leaf tree and back of these tree the people work they fell the fir tree nearest the elm dip water from the brook and pour it over the ground wash away heather and myrtle to prevent the fire from steal up to the birch brush they too think only of the fire which be now rush toward they the flee animal run in and out among the man 's foot without attract attention no one strike at the adder or try to catch the mother grouse as she run back and forth with she little peeping birdling they do not even bother about thumbietot in they hand they hold great char pine branch which have drop into the brook and it appear as if they intend to challenge the fire with these weapon there be not many man and it be strange to see they stand there ready to fight when all other live creature be flee as the fire come roaring and rush down the slope with its intolerable heat and suffocating smoke ready to hurl itself over brook and leaf-tree wall in order to reach the opposite shore without have to pause the people draw back at first as if unable to withstand it but they do not flee far before they turn back the conflagration rage with savage force spark pour like a rain of fire over the leaf tree and long tongue of flame shot hissingly out from the smoke as if the forest on the other side be suck they in but the leaf-tree wall be a obstruction behind which the man work when the ground begin to smoulder they bring water in they vessel and dampen it when a tree become wreathe in smoke they fell it at once throw it down and put out the flame where the fire creep along the heather they beat it with the wet pine branch and smother it the smoke be so dense that it envelop everything one could not possibly see how the battle be go but it be easy enough to understand that it be a hard fight and that several time the fire come near penetrate farther but think after a while the loud roar of the flame decrease and the smoke clear by that time the leaf tree have lose all they foliage the ground under they be char the face of the man be blacken by smoke and drip with sweat but the forest fire be conquer it have cease to flame up soft white smoke creep along the ground and from it peep out a lot of black stump this be all there be leave of the beautiful forest the boy scramble up on a rock so that he might see how the fire have be quench but now that the forest be save he peril begin the owl and the hawk simultaneously turn they eye toward he just then he hear a familiar voice call to he gorgo the golden eagle come sweep through the forest and soon the boy be soar among the cloud -- rescue from every peril westbottom and lapland the five scout once at skansen the boy have sit under the step at bollnäs cottage and have overhear clement larsson and the old laplander talk about norrland both agree that it be the most beautiful part of sweden clement think that the southern part be the best while the laplander favor the northern part as they argue it become plain that clement have never be farther north than härnösand the laplander laugh at he for speak with such assurance of place that he have never see i think i shall have to tell you a story clement to give you some idea of lapland since you have not see it volunteer the laplander it shall not be say of I that i refuse to listen to a story retort clement and the old laplander begin : it once happen that the bird who live down in sweden south of the great saméland think that they be overcrowded there and suggest move northward they come together to consider the matter the young and eager bird wish to start at once but the older and wiser one pass a resolution to send scout to explore the new country ` let each of the five great bird family send out a scout ' say the old and wise bird ` to learn if there be room for we all up there -- food and hide place ' five intelligent and capable bird be immediately appoint by the five great bird family the forest bird select a grouse the field bird a lark the sea bird a gull the fresh-water bird a loon and the cliff bird a snow sparrow when the five choose one be ready to start the grouse who be the largest and most commanding say : ` there be great stretch of land ahead if we travel together it will be long before we cover all the territory that we must explore if on the other hand we travel singly -- each one explore he special portion of the country -- the whole business can be accomplish in a few day ' the other scout think the suggestion a good one and agree to act upon it it be decide that the grouse should explore the midland the lark be to travel to the eastward the sea gull still farther east where the land border on the sea while the loon should fly over the territory west of the midland and the snow sparrow to the extreme west in accordance with this plan the five bird fly over the whole northland then they turn back and tell the assembly of bird what they have discover the gull who have travel along the sea-coast speak first ` the north be a fine country ' he say ` the sound be full of fish and there be point and island without number most of these be uninhabited and the bird will find plenty of room there the human do a little fishing and sailing in the sound but not enough to disturb the bird if the sea bird follow my advice they will move north immediately ' when the gull have finish the lark who have explore the land back from the coast speak : ' i do not know what the gull mean by he island and point ' say the lark i have travel only over great field and flowery meadow i have never before see a country cross by some large stream they shore be dot with homestead and at the mouth of the river be city but for the most part the country be very desolate if the field bird follow my advice they will move north immediately ' after the lark come the grouse who have fly over the midland ' i know neither what the lark mean with he meadow nor the gull with he island and point ' say he ' i have see only pine forest on this whole trip there be also many rush stream and great stretch of moss-grown swamp land but all that be not river or swamp be forest if the forest bird follow my advice they will move north immediately ' after the grouse come the loon who have explore the borderland to the west i do not know what the grouse mean by he forest nor do i know where the eye of the lark and the gull could have be ' remark the loon there be hardly any land up there -- only big lake between beautiful shore glisten clear blue mountain lake which pour into roar water-fall if the fresh-water bird follow my advice they will move north immediately ' the last speaker be the snow sparrow who have fly along the western boundary ' i do not know what the loon mean by he lake nor do i know what country the grouse the lark and the gull can have see ' he say ' i find one vast mountainous region up north i do not run across any field or any pine forest but peak after peak and highland i have see ice field and snow and mountain brook with water as white as milk no farmer nor cattle nor homestead have i see but only lapp and reindeer and hut meet my eye if the cliff bird follow my advice they will move north immediately ' when the five scout have present they report to the assembly they begin to call one another liar and be ready to fly at each other to prove the truth of they argument but the old and wise bird who have send they out listen to they account with joy and calm they fighting propensity ` you must not quarrel among yourselve ' they say ` we understand from you report that up north there be large mountain tract a big lake region great forest land a wide plain and a big group of island this be more than we have expect -- more than many a mighty kingdom can boast within its border ' the move landscape _ Saturday June eighteenth _ the boy have be remind of the old laplander 's story because he himself be now travel over the country of which he have speak the eagle tell he that the expanse of coast which spread beneath they be westbottom and that the blue ridge far to the west be in lapland only to be once more seat comfortably on gorgo 's back after all that he have suffer during the forest fire be a pleasure besides they be have a fine trip the flight be so easy that at time it seem as if they be stand still in the air the eagle beat and beat he wing without appear to move from the spot on the other hand everything under they seem in motion the whole earth and all thing on it move slowly southward the forest the field the fence the river the city the island the sawmill -- all be on the march the boy wonder whither they be bind have they grow tired of stand so far north and wish to move toward the south amid all the object in motion there be only one that stand still : that be a railway train it stand directly under they for it be with the train as with gorgo -- it could not move from the spot the locomotive send forth smoke and spark the clatter of the wheel could be hear all the way up to the boy but the train do not seem to move the forest rush by the flag station rush by fence and telegraph pole rush by but the train stand still a broad river with a long bridge come toward it but the river and the bridge glide along under the train with perfect ease finally a railway station appear the station master stand on the platform with he red flag and move slowly toward the train when he wave he little flag the locomotive belch even darker smoke curl than before and whistle mournfully because it have to stand still all of a sudden it begin to move toward the south like everything else the boy see all the coach door open and the passenger step out while both car and people be move southward he glance away from the earth and try to look straight ahead stare at the queer railway train have make he dizzy but after he have gaze for a moment at a little white cloud he be tire of that and look down again -- think all the while that the eagle and himself be quite still and that everything else be travel on south fancy suppose the grain field just then run along under he -- which must have be newly sow for he have see a green blade on it -- be to travel all the way down to skåne where the rye be in full bloom at this season up here the pine forest be different : the tree be bare the branch short and the needle be almost black many tree be bald at the top and look sickly if a forest like that be to journey down to kolmården and see a real forest how inferior it would feel the garden which he now see have some pretty bush but no fruit tree or linden or chestnut tree -- only mountain ash and birch there be some vegetable bed but they be not as yet hoe or plant if such a apology for a garden be to come trail into sörmland the province of garden would not it think itself a poor wilderness by comparison imagine a immense plain like the one now glide beneath he come under the very eye of the poor småland peasant they would hurry away from they meager garden plot and stony field to begin plow and sowing there be one thing however of which this northland have more than other land and that be light night must have set in for the crane stand sleep on the morass but it be as light as day the sun have not travel southward like every other thing instead it have go so far north that it shine in the boy 's face to all appearance it have no notion of set that night if this light and this sun be only shine on west vemmenhög it would suit the boy 's father and mother to a dot to have a work day that last twenty-four hour _ Sunday June nineteenth _ the boy raise he head and look around perfectly bewildered it be mighty queer here he lay sleep in some place where he have not be before no he have never see this glen nor the mountain round about and never have he notice such puny and shrunken birch as those under which he now lay where be the eagle the boy could see no sign of he gorgo must have desert he well here be another adventure the boy lay down again close he eye and try to recall the circumstance under which he have drop to sleep he remember that as long as he be travel over westbottom he have fancy that the eagle and he be at a standstill in the air and that the land under they be move southward as the eagle turn northwest the wind have come from that side and again he have feel a current of air so that the land below have stop move and he have notice that the eagle be bear he onward with terrific speed now we be fly into lapland gorgo have say and the boy have bent forward so that he might see the country of which he have hear so much but he have feel rather disappoint at not see anything but great tract of forest land and wide marsh forest follow marsh and marsh follow forest the monotony of the whole finally make he so sleepy that he have nearly drop to the ground he say to the eagle that he could not stay on he back another minute but must sleep awhile gorgo have promptly swoop to the ground where the boy have drop down on a moss tuft then gorgo put a talon around he and soar into the air with he again go to sleep thumbietot he cry the sunshine keep I awake and i want to continue the journey although the boy hang in this uncomfortable position he actually doze and dream he dream that he be on a broad road in southern sweden hurry along as fast as he little leg could carry he he be not alone many wayfarer be tramp in the same direction close beside he march grain-filled rye blade blossom corn flower and yellow daisy heavily laden apple tree go puff along follow by vine-covered bean stalk big cluster of white daisy and mass of berry bush tall beech and oak and linden stroll leisurely in the middle of the road they branch sway and they step aside for none between the boy 's tiny foot dart the little flower -- wild strawberry blossom white anemone clover and forget-me-not at first he think that only the vegetable family be on the march but presently he see that animal and people accompany they the insect be buzz around advance bush the fish be swim in move ditch the bird be singing in stroll tree both tame and wild beast be race and amongst all this people move along -- some with spade and scythe other with axis and other again with fishing net the procession march with gladness and gayety and he do not wonder at that when he see who be lead it it be nothing less than the sun itself that roll on like a great shine head with hair of many-hued ray and a countenance beam with merriment and kindliness forward march it keep call out none need feel anxious whilst i be here forward march i wonder where the sun want to take we to remark the boy a rye blade that walk beside he hear he and immediately answer : he want to take we up to lapland to fight the ice witch presently the boy notice that some of the traveller hesitate slow up and finally stand quite still he see that the tall beech tree stop and that the roebuck and the wheat blade tarry by the wayside likewise the blackberry bush the little yellow buttercup the chestnut tree and the grouse he glance about he and try to reason out why so many stop then he discover that they be no longer in southern sweden the march have be so rapid that they be already in svealand up there the oak begin to move more cautiously it pause awhile to consider take a few falter step then come to a standstill why do not the oak come along ask the boy it be afraid of the ice witch say a fair young birch that trip along so boldly and cheerfully that it be a joy to watch it the crowd hurry on as before in a short time they be in norrland and now it matter not how much the sun cry and coax -- the apple tree stop the cherry tree stop the rye blade stop the boy turn to they and ask : why do not you come along why do you desert the sun we dare not we be afraid of the ice witch who live in lapland they answer the boy comprehend that they be far north as the procession grow thinner and thinner the rye blade the barley the wild strawberry the blueberry bush the pea stalk the currant bush have come along as far as this the elk and the domestic cow have be walk side by side but now they stop the sun no doubt would have be almost desert if new follower have not happen along osier bush and a lot of brushy vegetation join the procession lap and reindeer mountain owl and mountain fox and willow grouse follow then the boy hear something come toward they he see great river and creek sweep along with terrible force why be they in such a hurry he ask they be run away from the ice witch who live up in the mountain all of a sudden the boy see before he a high dark turreted wall instantly the sun turn its beam face toward this wall and flood it with light then it become apparent that it be no wall but the most glorious mountain which loom up -- one behind another they peak be rose-coloured in the sunlight they slope azure and gold-tinted onward onward urge the sun as it climb the steep cliff there be no danger so long as i be with you but half way up the bold young birch desert -- also the sturdy pine and the persistent spruce and there too the laplander and the willow brush desert at last when the sun reach the top there be no one but the little tot nil holgersson who have follow it the sun roll into a cave where the wall be bedeck with ice and nil holgersson want to follow but farther than the opening of the cave he dare not venture for in there he see something dreadful far back in the cave sit a old witch with a ice body hair of icicle and a mantle of snow at she foot lay three black wolf who rise and open they jaw when the sun approach from the mouth of one come a pierce cold from the second a bluster north wind and from the third come impenetrable darkness that must be the ice witch and she tribe think the boy he understand that now be the time for he to flee but he be so curious to see the outcome of the meeting between the sun and the ice witch that he tarry the ice witch do not move -- only turn she hideous face toward the sun this continue for a short time it appear to the boy that the witch be begin to sigh and tremble she snow mantle fall and the three ferocious wolf howl less savagely suddenly the sun cry : now my time be up and roll out of the cave then the ice witch let loose she three wolf instantly the north wind cold and darkness rush from the cave and begin to chase the sun drive he out drive he back shriek the ice witch chase he so far that he can never come back teach he that lapland be mine but nil holgersson feel so unhappy when he see that the sun be to be drive from lapland that he awaken with a cry when he recover he sens he find himself at the bottom of a ravine but where be gorgo how be he to find out where he himself be he arise and look all around he then he happen to glance upward and see a peculiar structure of pine twig and branch that stand on a cliff-ledge that must be one of those eagle nest that gorgo -- but this be as far as he get he tear off he cap wave it in the air and cheer now he understand where gorgo have bring he this be the very glen where the wild goose live in summer and just above it be the eagle ' cliff he have arrive he would meet morten goosey-gander and akka and all the other comrade in a few moment hurrah the meeting all be still in the glen the sun have not yet step above the cliff and nil holgersson know that it be too early in the morning for the goose to be awake the boy walk along leisurely and search for he friend before he have go very far he pause with a smile for he see such a pretty sight a wild goose be sleep in a neat little nest and beside she stand she goosey-gander he too sleep but it be obvious that he have station himself thus near she that he might be on hand in the possible event of danger the boy go on without disturb they and peep into the willow brush that cover the ground it be not long before he spy another goose couple these be stranger not of he flock but he be so happy that he begin to hum -- just because he have come across wild goose he peep into another bit of brushwood there at last he see two that be familiar it be certainly neljä that be nesting there and the goosey-gander who stand beside she be surely kolme why of course the boy have a good mind to awaken they but he let they sleep on and walk away in the next brush he see viisus and kuusus and not far from they he find yksus and kaksus all four be asleep and the boy pass by without disturb they as he approach the next brush he think he see something white shimmering among the bush and the heart of he thump with joy yes it be as he expect in there sit the dainty dunfin on a egg-filled nest beside she stand she white goosey-gander although he sleep it be easy to see how proud he be to watch over he wife up here among the lapland mountain the boy do not care to waken the goosey-gander so he walk on he have to seek a long time before he come across any more wild goose finally he see on a little hillock something that resemble a small gray moss tuft and he know that there be akka from kebnekaise she stand wide awake look about as if she be keep watch over the whole glen good morning mother akka say the boy please do not waken the other goose yet awhile for i wish to speak with you in private the old leader-goose come rush down the hill and up to the boy first she seize hold of he and shake he then she stroke he with she bill before she shake he again but she do not say a word since he ask she not to waken the other thumbietot kiss old mother akka on both cheek then he tell she how he have be carry off to skansen and hold captive there now i must tell you that smirre fox short of a ear sit imprison in the fox ' cage at skansen say the boy although he be very mean to we i could not help feeling sorry for he there be many other fox in the cage and they seem quite contented there but smirre sit all the while look dejected longing for liberty i make many good friend at skansen and i learn one day from the lapp dog that a man have come to skansen to buy fox he be from some island far out in the ocean all the fox have be exterminate there and the rat be about to get the better of the inhabitant so they wish the fox back again as soon as i learn of this i go to smirre 's cage and say to he : ` to-morrow some man be come here to get a pair of fox do not hide smirre but keep well in the foreground and see to it that you be choose then you 'll be free again ' he follow my suggestion and now he be run at large on the island what say you to this mother akka if you have be in my place would you not have do likewise you have act in a way that make I wish i have do that myself say the leader-goose proudly it be a relief to know that you approve say the boy now there be one thing more i wish to ask you about : one day i happen to see gorgo the eagle -- the one that fight with morten goosey-gander -- a prisoner at skansen he be in the eagle ' cage and look pitifully forlorn i be think of file down the wire roof over he and let he out but i also think of he be a dangerous robber and bird-eater and wonder if i should be do right in let loose such a plunderer and if it be not better perhaps to let he stay where he be what say you mother akka be it right to think thus no it be not right retort akka say what you will about the eagle they be proud bird and greater lover of freedom than all other it be not right to keep they in captivity do you know what i would suggest this : that as soon as you be well rest we two make the trip together to the big bird prison and liberate gorgo that be just the word i be expect from you mother akka return the boy eagerly there be those who say that you no longer have any love in you heart for the one you rear so tenderly because he live as eagle must live but i know now that it be not true and now i want to see if morten goosey-gander be awake meanwhile if you wish to say a ` thank you ' to the one who bring I here to you i think you 'll find he up there on the cliff ledge where once you find a helpless eaglet osa the goose girl and little mat the year that nil holgersson travel with the wild goose everybody be talk about two little child a boy and a girl who tramp through the country they be from sunnerbo township in småland and have once live with they parent and four brother and sister in a little cabin on the heath while the two child osa and mat be still small a poor homeless woman come to they cabin one night and beg for shelter although the place could hardly hold the family she be take in and the mother spread a bed for she on the floor in the night she cough so hard that the child fancy the house shake by morning she be too ill to continue she wanderings the child 's father and mother be as kind to she as could be they give up they bed to she and sleep on the floor while the father go to the doctor and bring she medicine the first few day the sick woman behave like a savage she demand constant attention and never utter a word of thanks later she become more subdue and finally beg to be carry out to the heath and leave there to die when she host would not hear of this she tell they that the last few year she have roam about with a band of gipsy she herself be not of gipsy blood but be the daughter of a well-to-do farmer she have run away from home and go with the nomad she believe that a gipsy woman who be angry at she have bring this sickness upon she nor be that all : the gipsy woman have also curse she say that all who take she under they roof or be kind to she should suffer a like fate she believe this and therefore beg they to cast she out of the house and never to see she again she do not want to bring misfortune down upon such good people but the peasant refuse to do she bidding it be quite possible that they be alarmed but they be not the kind of folk who could turn out a poor sick person soon after that she die and then along come the misfortune before there have never be anything but happiness in that cabin its inmate be poor yet not so very poor the father be a maker of weaver ' comb and mother and child help he with the work father make the frame mother and the older child do the binding while the smaller one plane the tooth and cut they out they work from morning until night but the time pass pleasantly especially when father talk of the day when he travel about in foreign land and sell weaver ' comb father be so jolly that sometimes mother and the child would laugh until they side ache at he funny quip and joke the week follow the death of the poor vagabond woman linger in the mind of the child like a horrible nightmare they know not if the time have be long or short but they remember that they be always have funeral at home one after another they lose they brother and sister at last it be very still and sad in the cabin the mother keep up some measure of courage but the father be not a bit like himself he could no longer work nor jest but sit from morning till night he head bury in he hand and only brood once -- that be after the third burial -- the father have break out into wild talk which frighten the child he say that he could not understand why such misfortune should come upon they they have do a kindly thing in help the sick woman could it be true then that the evil in this world be more powerful than the good the mother try to reason with he but she be unable to soothe he a few day later the eldest be stricken she have always be the father 's favorite so when he realize that she too must go he flee from all the misery the mother never say anything but she think it be best for he to be away as she fear that he might lose he reason he have brood too long over this one idea : that god have allow a wicked person to bring about so much evil after the father go away they become very poor for awhile he send they money but afterward thing must have go badly with he for no more come the day of the eldest daughter 's burial the mother close the cabin and leave home with the two remain child osa and mat she go down to skåne to work in the beet field and find a place at the jordberga sugar refinery she be a good worker and have a cheerful and generous nature everybody like she many be astonish because she could be so calm after all that she have pass through but the mother be very strong and patient when any one speak to she of she two sturdy child she only say : i shall soon lose they also without a quaver in she voice or a tear in she eye she have accustom herself to expect nothing else but it do not turn out as she fear instead the sickness come upon herself she have go to skane in the beginning of summer before autumn she be go and the child be leave alone while they mother be ill she have often say to the child they must remember that she never regret have let the sick woman stop with they it be not hard to die when one have do right she say for then one could go with a clear conscience before the mother pass away she try to make some provision for she child she ask the people with whom she live to let they remain in the room which she have occupy if the child only have a shelter they would not become a burden to any one she know that they could take care of themselves osa and mat be allow to keep the room on condition that they would tend the goose as it be always hard to find child willing to do that work it turn out as the mother expect : they do maintain themselves the girl make candy and the boy carve wooden toy which they sell at the farm house they have a talent for trading and soon begin buy egg and butter from the farmer which they sell to the worker at the sugar refinery osa be the older and by the time she be thirteen she be as responsible as a grown woman she be quiet and serious while mat be lively and talkative he sister use to say to he that he could outcackle the goose when the child have be at jordberga for two year there be a lecture give one evening at the schoolhouse evidently it be mean for grown-up but the two småland child be in the audience they do not regard themselves as child and few person think of they as such the lecturer talk about the dread disease call the white plague which every year carry off so many people in sweden he speak very plainly and the child understand every word after the lecture they wait outside the schoolhouse when the lecturer come out they take hold of hand and walk gravely up to he ask if they might speak to he the stranger must have wonder at the two rosy baby-faced child stand there talk with a earnestness more in keep with people thrice they age but he listen graciously to they they relate what have happen in they home and ask the lecturer if he think they mother and they sister and brother have die of the sickness he have describe very likely he answer it could hardly have be any other disease if only the mother and father have know what the child learn that evening they might have protect themselves if they have burn the clothing of the vagabond woman if they have scour and air the cabin and have not use the old bedding all whom the child mourn might have be live yet the lecturer say he could not say positively but he believe that none of they dear one would have be sick have they understand how to guard against the infection osa and mat wait awhile before put the next question for that be the most important of all it be not true then that the gipsy woman have send the sickness because they have befriend the one with whom she be angry it be not something special that have stricken only they the lecturer assure they that no person have the power to bring sickness upon another in that way thereupon the child thank he and go to they room they talk until late that night the next day they give notice that they could not tend goose another year but must go elsewhere where be they go why to try to find they father they must tell he that they mother and the other child have die of a common ailment and not something special bring upon they by a angry person they be very glad that they have find out about this now it be they duty to tell they father of it for probably he be still try to solve the mystery osa and mat set out for they old home on the heath when they arrive they be shock to find the little cabin in flame they go to the parsonage and there they learn that a railroad workman have see they father at malmberget far up in lapland he have be work in a mine and possibly be still there when the clergyman hear that the child want to go in search of they father he bring forth a map and show they how far it be to malmberget and try to dissuade they from make the journey but the child insist that they must find they father he have leave home believe something that be not true they must find he and tell he that it be all a mistake they do not want to spend they little savings buy railway ticket therefore they decide to go all the way on foot which they never regret as it prove to be a remarkably beautiful journey before they be out of småland they stop at a farm house to buy food the housewife be a kind motherly soul who take a interest in the child she ask they who they be and where they come from and they tell she they story dear dear dear dear she interpolate time and again when they be speak later she pet the child and stuff they with all kind of goody for which she would not accept a penny when they rise to thank she and go the woman ask they to stop at she brother 's farm in the next township of course the child be delighted give he my greeting and tell he what have happen to you say the peasant woman this the child do and be well treat from every farm after that it be always : if you happen to go in such and such a direction stop there or there and tell they what have happen to you in every farm house to which they be send there be always a consumptive so osa and mat go through the country unconsciously teach the people how to combat that dreadful disease long long ago when the black plague be ravage the country 'twa say that a boy and a girl be see wander from house to house the boy carry a rake and if he stop and rake in front of a house it mean that there many should die but not all for the rake have coarse tooth and do not take everything with it the girl carry a broom and if she come along and sweep before a door it mean that all who live within must die for the broom be a implement that make a clean sweep it seem quite remarkable that in we time two child should wander through the land because of a cruel sickness but these child do not frighten people with the rake and the broom they say rather : we will not content ourselves with merely rake the yard and sweep the floor we will use mop and brush water and soap we will keep clean inside and outside of the door and we ourselves will be clean in both mind and body in this way we will conquer the sickness one day while still in lapland akka take the boy to malmberget where they discover little mat lie unconscious at the mouth of the pit he and osa have arrive there a short time before that morning he have be roam about hope to come across he father he have venture too near the shaft and be hurt by fly rock after the set off of a blast thumbietot run to the edge of the shaft and call down to the miner that a little boy be injure immediately a number of labourer come rush up to little mat two of they carry he to the hut where he and osa be stay they do all they could to save he but it be too late thumbietot feel so sorry for poor osa he want to help and comfort she but he know that if he be to go to she now he would only frighten she -- such as he be the night after the burial of little mat osa straightway shut herself in she hut she sit alone recall one after another thing she brother have say and do there be so much to think about that she do not go straight to bed but sit up most of the night the more she think of she brother the more she realize how hard it would be to live without he at last she drop she head on the table and weep what shall i do now that little mat be go she sob it be far along toward morning and osa spend by the strain of she hard day finally fall asleep she dream that little mat softly open the door and step into the room osa you must go and find father he say how can i when i do not even know where he be she reply in she dream do not worry about that return little mat in he usual cheery way i 'll send some one to help you just as osa the goose girl dream that little mat have say this there be a knock at the door it be a real knock -- not something she hear in the dream but she be so hold by the dream that she could not tell the real from the unreal as she go on to open the door she think : this must be the person little mat promise to send I she be right for it be thumbietot come to talk to she about she father when he see that she be not afraid of he he tell she in a few word where she father be and how to reach he while he be speak osa the goose girl gradually regain consciousness when he have finish she be wide awake then she be so terrify at the thought of talk with a elf that she could not say thank you or anything else but quickly shut the door as she do that she think she see a expression of pain flash across the elf 's face but she could not help what she do for she be beside herself with fright she creep into bed as quickly as she could and draw the cover over she head although she be afraid of the elf she have a feeling that he mean well by she so the next day she make haste to do as he have tell she with the laplander one afternoon in July it rain frightfully up around lake luossajaure the laplander who live mostly in the open during the summer have crawl under the tent and be squat round the fire drinking coffee the new settler on the east shore of the lake work diligently to have they home in readiness before the severe arctic winter set in they wonder at the laplander who have live in the far north for century without even think that better protection be need against cold and storm than thin tent cover the laplander on the other hand wonder at the new settler give themselves so much needless hard work when nothing more be necessary to live comfortably than a few reindeer and a tent they only have to drive the pole into the ground and spread the cover over they and they abode be ready they do not have to trouble themselves about decorate or furnish the principal thing be to scatter some spruce twig on the floor spread a few skin and hang the big kettle in which they cook they reindeer meat on a chain suspend from the top of the tent pole while the laplander be chat over they coffee cup a row boat come from the kiruna side pull ashore at the lapp ' quarter a workman and a young girl between thirteen and fourteen step from the boat the girl be osa the lapp dog bound down to they bark loudly and a native poke he head out of the tent open to see what be go on he be glad when he see the workman for he be a friend of the laplander -- a kindly and sociable man who could speak they native tongue the lapp call to he to crawl under the tent you be just in time söderberg he say the coffee pot be on the fire no one can do any work in this rain so come in and tell we the news the workman go in and with much ado and amid a great deal of laughter and joking place be make for söderberg and osa though the tent be already crowd to the limit with native osa understand none of the conversation she sit dumb and look in wonderment at the kettle and coffee pot at the fire and smoke at the lapp man and lapp woman at the child and dog the wall and floor the coffee cup and tobacco pipe the multi-coloured costume and crude implement all this be new to she suddenly she lower she glance conscious that every one in the tent be look at she söderberg must have say something about she for now both lapp man and lapp woman take the short pipe from they mouth and stare at she in open-eyed wonder and awe the laplander at she side pat she shoulder and nod say in swedish bra bra -lrb- good good -rrb- a lapp woman fill a cup to the brim with coffee and pass it under difficulty while a lapp boy who be about she own age wriggle and crawl between the squatter over to she osa feel that söderberg be tell the laplander that she have just bury she little brother mat she wish he would find out about she father instead the elf have say that he live with the lapp who camp west of lake luossajaure and she have beg leave to ride up on a sand truck to seek he as no regular passenger train come so far both labourer and foreman have assist she as best they could a engineer have send söderberg across the lake with she as he speak lappish she have hope to meet she father as soon as she arrive she glance wander anxiously from face to face but she see only native she father be not there she notice that the lapp and the swede söderberg grow more and more earnest as they talk among themselves the lapp shake they head and tap they forehead as if they be speak of some one that be not quite right in he mind she become so uneasy that she could no longer endure the suspense and ask söderberg what the laplander know of she father they say he have go fishing say the workman they be not sure that he can get back to the camp to-night but as soon as the weather clear one of they will go in search of he thereupon he turn to the lapp and go on talk to they he do not wish to give osa a opportunity to question he further about jon esserson the next morning ola serka himself who be the most distinguished man among the lapp have say that he would find osa 's father but he appear to be in no haste and sit huddle outside the tent thinking of jon esserson and wonder how best to tell he of he daughter 's arrival it would require diplomacy in order that jon esserson might not become alarmed and flee he be a odd sort of man who be afraid of child he use to say that the sight of they make he so melancholy that he could not endure it while ola serka deliberate osa the goose girl and aslak the young lapp boy who have stare so hard at she the night before sit on the ground in front of the tent and chat aslak have be to school and could speak swedish he be tell osa about the life of the saméfolk assure she that they fare better than other people osa think that they live wretchedly and tell he so you do not know what you be talk about say aslak curtly only stop with we a week and you shall see that we be the happiest people on earth if i be to stop here a whole week i should be choke by all the smoke in the tent osa retort do not say that protest the boy you know nothing of we let I tell you something which will make you understand that the longer you stay with we the more contented you will become thereupon aslak begin to tell osa how a sickness call the black plague once rage throughout the land he be not certain as to whether it have sweep through the real saméland where they now be but in jämtland it have rage so brutally that among the saméfolk who live in the forest and mountain there all have die except a boy of fifteen among the swede who live in the valley none be leave but a girl who be also fifteen year old the boy and girl separately tramp the desolate country all winter in search of other human being finally toward spring the two meet aslak continue : the swedish girl beg the lapp boy to accompany she southward where she could meet people of she own race she do not wish to tarry longer in jämtland where there be only vacant homestead i 'll take you wherever you wish to go ' say the boy ` but not before winter it be spring now and my reindeer go westward toward the mountain you know that we who be of the saméfolk must go where we reindeer take we ' the swedish girl be the daughter of wealthy parent she be use to live under a roof sleep in a bed and eating at a table she have always despise the poor mountaineer and think that those who live under the open sky be most unfortunate but she be afraid to return to she home where there be none but the dead ` at least let I go with you to the mountain ' she say to the boy ` so that i sha 'n' t have to tramp about here all alone and never hear the sound of a human voice ' the boy willingly assent so the girl go with the reindeer to the mountain the herd yearn for the good pasture there and every day tramp long distance to feed on the moss there be not time to pitch tent the child have to lie on the snowy ground and sleep when the reindeer stop to graze the girl often sigh and complain of be so tired that she must turn back to the valley nevertheless she go along to avoid be leave without human companionship when they reach the highland the boy pitch a tent for the girl on a pretty hill that slope toward a mountain brook in the evening he lasso and milk the reindeer and give the girl milk to drink he bring forth dry reindeer meat and reindeer cheese which he people have stow away on the height when they be there the summer before still the girl grumble all the while and be never satisfied she would eat neither reindeer meat nor reindeer cheese nor would she drink reindeer milk she could not accustom herself to squat in the tent or to lie on the ground with only a reindeer skin and some spruce twig for a bed the son of the mountain laugh at she woe and continue to treat she kindly after a few day the girl go up to the boy when he be milk and ask if she might help he she next undertake to make the fire under the kettle in which the reindeer meat be to be cook then to carry water and to make cheese so the time pass pleasantly the weather be mild and food be easily procure together they set snare for game fish for salmon-trout in the rapid and pick cloud-berry in the swamp when the summer be go they move farther down the mountain where pine and leaf forest meet there they pitch they tent they have to work hard every day but fare better for food be even more plentiful than in the summer because of the game when the snow come and the lake begin to freeze they draw farther east toward the dense pine forest as soon as the tent be up the winter 's work begin the boy teach the girl to make twine from reindeer sinew to treat skin to make shoe and clothing of hide to make comb and tool of reindeer horn to travel on ski and to drive a sledge draw by reindeer when they have live through the dark winter and the sun begin to shine all day and most of the night the boy say to the girl that now he would accompany she southward so that she might meet some of she own race then the girl look at he astonished ` why do you want to send I away ' she ask ` do you long to be alone with you reindeer ' ' i think that you be the one that long to get away ' say the boy ' i have live the life of the saméfolk almost a year now ' reply the girl i can not return to my people and live the shut-in life after have wander freely on mountain and in forest do not drive I away but let I stay here you way of living be better than ours ' the girl stay with the boy for the rest of she life and never again do she long for the valley and you osa if you be to stay with we only a month you could never again part from we with these word aslak the lapp boy finish he story just then he father ola serka take the pipe from he mouth and rise old ola understand more swedish than he be willing to have any one know and he have overhear he son 's remark while he be listen it have suddenly flash on he how he should handle this delicate matter of tell jon esserson that he daughter have come in search of he ola serka go down to lake luossajaure and have walk a short distance along the strand when he happen upon a man who sit on a rock fishing the fisherman be gray-haired and bent he eye blink wearily and there be something slack and helpless about he he look like a man who have try to carry a burden too heavy for he or to solve a problem too difficult for he who have become broken and despondent over he failure you must have have luck with you fishing jon since you have be at it all night say the mountaineer in lappish as he approach the fisherman give a start then glance up the bait on he hook be go and not a fish lay on the strand beside he he hasten to rebait the hook and throw out the line in the meantime the mountaineer squat on the grass beside he there be a matter that i want to talk over with you say ola you know that i have a little daughter who die last winter and we have always miss she in the tent yes i know say the fisherman abruptly a cloud pass over he face -- as though he dislike be remind of a dead child it be not worth while to spend one 's life grieving say the laplander i suppose it be not now i be think of adopt another child do not you think it would be a good idea that depend on the child ola i will tell you what i know of the girl say olum then he tell the fisherman that around midsummer-time two strange child -- a boy and a girl -- have come to the mine to look for they father but as they father be away they have stay to await he return while there the boy have be kill by a blast of rock thereupon ola give a beautiful description of how brave the little girl have be and of how she have win the admiration and sympathy of everyone be that the girl you want to take into you tent ask the fisherman yes return the lapp when we hear she story we be all deeply touch and say among ourselves that so good a sister would also make a good daughter and we hope that she would come to we the fisherman sit quietly think a moment it be plain that he continue the conversation only to please he friend the lapp i presume the girl be one of you race no say ola she do not belong to the saméfolk perhaps she be the daughter of some new settler and be accustom to the life here no she be from the far south reply ola as if this be of small importance the fisherman grow more interested then i do not believe that you can take she he say it be doubtful if she could stand living in a tent in winter since she be not bring up that way she will find kind parent and kind brother and sister in the tent insist ola serka it be worse to be alone than to freeze the fisherman become more and more zealous to prevent the adoption it seem as if he could not bear the thought of a child of swedish parent be take in by laplander you say just now that she have a father in the mine he be dead say the lapp abruptly i suppose you have thoroughly investigate this matter ola what be the use of go to all that trouble disdain the lapp i ought to know would the girl and she brother have be oblige to roam about the country if they have a father living would two child have be force to care for themselves if they have a father the girl herself think he be alive but i say that he must be dead the man with the tired eye turn to ola what be the girl 's name ola he ask the mountaineer think awhile then say : i can not remember it i must ask she ask she be she already here she be down at the camp what ola have you take she in before know she father 's wish what do i care for she father if he be not dead he be probably the kind of man who care nothing for he child he may be glad to have another take she in hand the fisherman throw down he rod and rise with a alertness in he movement that bespeak new life i do not think she father can be like other folk continue the mountaineer i dare say he be a man who be haunt by gloomy foreboding and therefore can not work steadily what kind of a father would that be for the girl while olum be talk the fisherman start up the strand where be you go query the lapp i be go to have a look at you foster-daughter olum good say the lapp come along and meet she i think you 'll say that she will be a good daughter to I the swede rush on so rapidly that the laplander could hardly keep pace with he after a moment olum say to he companion : now i recall that she name be osa -- this girl i be adopt the other man only keep hurry along and old ola serka be so well pleased that he want to laugh aloud when they come in sight of the tent ola say a few word more she come here to we saméfolk to find she father and not to become my foster-child but if she do not find he i shall be glad to keep she in my tent the fisherman hasten all the faster i might have know that he would be alarm when i threaten to take he daughter into the lapp ' quarter laugh ola to himself when the man from kiruna who have bring osa to the tent turn back later in the day he have two people with he in the boat who sit close together hold hand -- as if they never again want to part they be jon esserson and he daughter both be unlike what they have be a few hour earlier the father look less bent and weary and he eye be clear and good as if at last he have find the answer to that which have trouble he so long osa the goose girl do not glance longingly about for she have find some one to care for she and now she could be a child again homeward bind the first travel day _ Saturday October first _ the boy sit on the goosey-gander 's back and ride up amongst the cloud some thirty goose in regular order fly rapidly southward there be a rustling of feather and the many wing beat the air so noisily that one could scarcely hear one 's own voice akka from kebnekaise fly in the lead after she come yksus and kaksi kolme and neljä viisi and kuusi morten goosey-gander and dunfin the six gosling which have accompany the flock the autumn before have now leave to look after themselves instead the old goose be take with they twenty-two gosling that have grow up in the glen that summer eleven fly to the right eleven to the left and they do they best to fly at even distance like the big bird the poor youngster have never before be on a long trip and at first they have difficulty in keep up with the rapid flight akka from kebnekaise akka from kebnekaise they cry in plaintive tone what be the matter say the leader-goose sharply we wing be tire of move we wing be tire of move wail the young one the longer you keep it up the better it will go answer the leader-goose without slacken she speed and she be quite right for when the gosling have fly two hour longer they complain no more of be tired but in the mountain glen they have be in the habit of eat all day long and very soon they begin to feel hungry akka akka akka from kebnekaise wail the gosling pitifully what be the trouble now ask the leader-goose we be so hungry we can not fly any more whimper the gosling we be so hungry we can not fly any more wild goose must learn to eat air and drink wind say the leader-goose and keep right on fly it actually seem as if the young one be learn to live on wind and air for when they have fly a little longer they say nothing more about be hungry the goose flock be still in the mountain region and the old goose call out the name of all the peak as they fly past so that the youngster might learn they when they have be call out a while : this be porsotjokko this be särjaktjokko this be sulitelma and so on the gosling become impatient again akka akka akka they shriek in heart-rending tone what be wrong say the leader-goose we have not room in we head for any more of those awful name shriek the gosling the more you put into you head the more you can get into they retort the leader-goose and continue to call out the queer name the boy sit think that it be about time the wild goose betake themselves southward for so much snow have fall that the ground be white as far as the eye could see there be no use deny that it have be rather disagreeable in the glen toward the last rain and fog have succeed each other without any relief and even if it do clear up once in a while immediately frost set in berry and mushroom upon which the boy have subsist during the summer be either frozen or decayed finally he have be compel to eat raw fish which be something he dislike the day have grow short and the long evening and late morning be rather tiresome for one who could not sleep the whole time that the sun be away now at last the gosling ' wing have grow so that the goose could start for the south the boy be so happy that he laugh and sing as he ride on the goose 's back it be not only on account of the darkness and cold that he long to get away from lapland there be other reason too the first week of he sojourn there the boy have not be the least bit homesick he think he have never before see such a glorious country the only worry he have have be to keep the mosquito from eat he up the boy have see very little of the goosey-gander because the big white gander think only of he dunfin and be unwilling to leave she for a moment on the other hand thumbietot have stick to akka and gorgo the eagle and the three of they have pass many happy hour together the two bird have take he with they on long trip he have stand on snow-capped mount kebnekaise have look down at the glacier and visit many high cliff seldom tramp by human foot akka have show he deep-hidden mountain dale and have let he peep into cave where mother wolf bring up they young he have also make the acquaintance of the tame reindeer that graze in herd along the shore of the beautiful torne lake and he have be down to the great fall and bring greeting to the bear that live thereabout from they friend and relative in westmanland ever since he have see osa the goose girl he long for the day when he might go home with morten goosey-gander and be a normal human be once more he want to be himself again so that osa would not be afraid to talk to he and would not shut the door in he face yes indeed he be glad that at last they be speed southward he wave he cap and cheer when he see the first pine forest in the same manner he greet the first gray cabin the first goat the first cat and the first chicken they be continually meet bird of passage fly now in greater flock than in the spring where be you bind for wild goose call the pass bird where be you bind for we like yourselve be go abroad answer the goose those gosling of yours be not ready to fly scream the other they 'll never cross the sea with those puny wing laplander and reindeer be also leave the mountain when the wild goose sight the reindeer they circle down and call out : thanks for you company this summer a pleasant journey to you and a welcome back return the reindeer but when the bear see the wild goose they point they out to the cub and growl : just look at those goose they be so afraid of a little cold they do not dare to stay at home in winter but the old goose be ready with a retort and cry to they gosling : look at those beast that stay at home and sleep half the year rather than go to the trouble of travel south down in the pine forest the young grouse sit huddle together and gaze longingly after the big bird flock which amid joy and merriment proceed southward when will we turn come they ask the mother grouse you will have to stay at home with mamma and papa she say legend from härjedalen _ Tuesday October fourth _ the boy have have three day ' travel in the rain and mist and long for some sheltered nook where he might rest awhile at last the goose alight to feed and ease they wing a bit to he great relief the boy see a observation tower on a hill close by and drag himself to it when he have climb to the top of the tower he find a party of tourist there so he quickly crawl into a dark corner and be soon sound asleep when the boy awake he begin to feel uneasy because the tourist linger so long in the tower tell story he think they would never go morten goosey-gander could not come for he while they be there and he know of course that the wild goose be in a hurry to continue the journey in the middle of a story he think he hear honking and the beating of wing as if the goose be fly away but he do not dare to venture over to the balustrade to find out if it be so at last when the tourist be go and the boy could crawl from he hide place he see no wild goose and no morten goosey-gander come to fetch he he call here be i where be you as loud as he could but he travel companion do not appear not for a second do he think they have desert he but he fear that they have meet with some mishap and be wonder what he should do to find they when batakus the raven light beside he the boy never dream that he should greet batakus with such a glad welcome as he now give he dear bataki he burst forth how fortunate that you be here maybe you know what have become of morten goosey-gander and the wild goose i have just come with a greet from they reply the raven akka see a hunter prowl about on the mountain and therefore dare not stay to wait for you but have go on ahead get up on my back and you shall soon be with you friend the boy quickly seat himself on the raven 's back and batakus would soon have catch up with the goose have he not be hinder by a fog it be as if the morning sun have awaken it to life little light veil of mist rise suddenly from the lake from field and from the forest they thicken and spread with marvellous rapidity and soon the entire ground be hide from sight by white rolling mist batakus fly along above the fog in clear air and sparkling sunshine but the wild goose must have circle down among the damp cloud for it be impossible to sight they the boy and the raven call and shriek but get no response well this be a stroke of ill luck say batakus finally but we know that they be travel toward the south and of course i 'll find they as soon as the mist clear the boy be distressed at the thought of be part from morten goosey-gander just now when the goose be on the wing and the big white one might meet with all sort of mishap after thumbietot have be sit worry for two hour or more he remark to himself that thus far there have be no mishap and it be not worth while to lose heart just then he hear a rooster crow down on the ground and instantly he bent forward on the raven 's back and call out : what be the name of the country i be travel over it be call härjedalen härjedalen härjedalen crow the rooster how do it look down there where you be the boy ask cliff in the west wood in the east broad valley across the whole country reply the rooster thank you cry the boy you give a clear account of it when they have travel a little farther he hear a crow caw down in the mist what kind of people live in this country shout the boy good thrifty peasant answer the crow good thrifty peasant what do they do ask the boy what do they do they raise cattle and fall forest caw the crow thanks reply the boy you answer well a bit farther on he hear a human voice yodeling and singing down in the mist be there any large city in this part of the country the boy ask what -- what -- who be it that call cry the human voice be there any large city in this region the boy repeat i want to know who it be that call shout the human voice i might have know that i could get no information when i ask a human be a civil question the boy retort it be not long before the mist go away as suddenly as it have come then the boy see a beautiful landscape with high cliff as in jämtland but there be no large flourish settlement on the mountain slope the village lay far apart and the farm be small batakus follow the stream southward till they come within sight of a village there he alight in a stubble field and let the boy dismount in the summer grain grow on this ground say batakus look around and see if you can not find something eatable the boy act upon the suggestion and before long he find a blade of wheat as he pick out the grain and eat they bataki talk to he do you see that mountain tower directly south of we he ask yes of course i see it say the boy it be call sonfjället continue the raven you can imagine that wolf be plentiful there once upon a time it must have be a ideal place for wolf say the boy the people who live here in the valley be frequently attack by they remark the raven perhaps you remember a good wolf story you could tell I say the boy i have be tell that a long long time ago the wolf from sonfjället be suppose to have waylay a man who have go out to peddle he wares begin batakus he be from hede a village a few mile down the valley it be winter time and the wolf make for he as he be drive over the ice on lake ljusna there be about nine or ten and the man from hede have a poor old horse so there be very little hope of he escape when the man hear the wolf howl and see how many there be after he he lose he head and it do not occur to he that he ought to dump he cask and jug out of the sledge to lighten the load he only whip up the horse and make the best speed he could but he soon observe that the wolf be gain on he the shore be desolate and he be fourteen mile from the nearest farm he think that he final hour have come and be paralyze with fear while he sit there terrify he see something move in the brush which have be set in the ice to mark out the road and when he discover who it be that walk there he fear grow more and more intense wild beast be not come toward he but a poor old woman name finn-malin who be in the habit of roam about on highway and byway she be a hunchback and slightly lame so he recognize she at a distance the old woman be walk straight toward the wolf the sledge have hide they from she view and the man comprehend at once that if he be to drive on without warn she she would walk right into the jaw of the wild beast and while they be rend she he would have time enough to get away the old woman walk slowly bent over a cane it be plain that she be doom if he do not help she but even if he be to stop and take she into the sledge it be by no means certain that she would be safe more than likely the wolf would catch up with they and he and she and the horse would all be kill he wonder if it be not better to sacrifice one life in order that two might be spare -- this flash upon he the minute he see the old woman he have also time to think how it would be with he afterward -- if perchance he might not regret that he have not succour she or if people should some day learn of the meeting and that he have not try to help she it be a terrible temptation ' i would rather not have see she ' he say to himself just then the wolf howl savagely the horse rear plunge forward and dash past the old beggar woman she too have hear the howling of the wolf and as the man from hede drive by he see that the old woman know what await she she stand motionless she mouth open for a cry she arm stretch out for help but she neither cry nor try to throw herself into the sledge something seem to have turn she to stone ` it be i ' think the man ' i must have look like a demon as i pass ' he try to feel satisfied now that he be certain of escape but at that very moment he heart reproach he never before have he do a dastardly thing and he feel now that he whole life be blast ` let come what may ' he say and rein in the horse ' i can not leave she alone with the wolf ' it be with great difficulty that he get the horse to turn but in the end he manage it and promptly drive back to she ` be quick and get into the sledge ' he say gruffly for he be mad with himself for not leave the old woman to she fate ` you might stay at home once in awhile you old hag ' he growl ` now both my horse and i will come to grief on you account ' the old woman do not say a word but the man from hede be in no mood to spare she ` the horse have already tramp thirty-five mile to-day and the load have not lighten any since you get up on it ' he grumble ` so that you must understand he 'll soon be exhaust ' the sledge runner crunch on the ice but for all that he hear how the wolf pant and know that the beast be almost upon he ` it be all up with we ' he say ` much good it be either to you or to I this attempt to save you finn-malin ' up to this point the old woman have be silent -- like one who be accustom to take abuse -- but now she say a few word ' i can not understand why you do not throw out you wares and lighten the load you can come back again to-morrow and gather they up ' the man realize that this be sound advice and be surprise that he have not think of it before he toss the rein to the old woman loose the rope that bind the cask and pitch they out the wolf be right upon they but now they stop to examine that which be throw on the ice and the traveller again have the start of they ` if this do not help you ' say the old woman ` you understand of course that i will give myself up to the wolf voluntarily that you may escape ' while she be speak the man be try to push a heavy brewer 's vat from the long sledge as he tug at this he pause as if he could not quite make up he mind to throw it out but in reality he mind be take up with something altogether different ` surely a man and a horse who have no infirmity need not let a feeble old woman be devour by wolf for they sake ' he think ` there must be some other way of salvation why of course there be it be only my stupidity that hinder I from find the way ' again he start to push the vat then pause once more and burst out laugh the old woman be alarm and wonder if he have go mad but the man from hede be laugh at himself because he have be so stupid all the while it be the simplest thing in the world to save all three of they he could not imagine why he have not think of it before ` listen to what i say to you malin ' he say ` it be splendid of you to be willing to throw yourself to the wolf but you will not have to do that because i know how we can all three be help without endanger the life of any remember whatever i may do you be to sit still and drive down to linsäll there you must waken the townspeople and tell they that i be alone out here on the ice surround by wolf and ask they to come and help I ' the man wait until the wolf be almost upon the sledge then he roll out the big brewer 's vat jump down and crawl in under it it be a huge vat large enough to hold a whole christmas brew the wolf pounce upon it and bit at the hoop but the vat be too heavy for they to move they could not get at the man inside he know that he be safe and laugh at the wolf after a bit he be serious again ` for the future when i get into a tight place i shall remember this vat and i shall bear in mind that i need never wrong either myself or other for there be always a third way out of a difficulty if only one can hit upon it ' with this batakus close he narrative the boy notice that the raven never speak unless there be some special meaning back of he word and the longer he listen to he the more thoughtful he become i wonder why you tell I that story remark the boy i just happen to think of it as i stand here gaze up at sonfjället reply the raven now they have travel farther down lake ljusna and in a hour or so they come to kolsätt close to the border of hälsingland here the raven alight near a little hut that have no window -- only a shutter from the chimney rise spark and smoke and from within the sound of heavy hammering be hear whenever i see this smithy observe the raven i be remind that in former time there be such skilled blacksmith here in härjedalen more especially in this village -- that they could not be match in the whole country perhaps you also remember a story about they say the boy yes return batakus i remember one about a smith from härjedalen who once invite two other master blacksmith -- one from dalecarlium and one from vermland -- to compete with he at nail-make the challenge be accept and the three blacksmith meet here at kolsätt the dalecarlian begin he forge a dozen nail so even and smooth and sharp that they could not be improve upon after he come the vermlander he too forge a dozen nail which be quite perfect and moreover he finish they in half the time that it take the dalecarlian when the judge see this they say to the härjedal smith that it would not be worth while for he to try since he could not forge better than the dalecarlian or faster than the vermlander ' i sha 'n' t give up there must be still another way of excel ' insist the härjedal smith he place the iron on the anvil without heat it at the forge he simply hammer it hot and forge nail after nail without the use of either anvil or bellows none of the judge have ever see a blacksmith wield a hammer more masterfully and the härjedal smith be proclaim the best in the land with these remark batakus subside and the boy grow even more thoughtful i wonder what you purpose be in tell I that he query the story drop into my mind when i see the old smithy again say batakus in a offhand manner the two traveller rise again into the air and the raven carry the boy southward till they come to lillhärdal parish where he alight on a leafy mound at the top of a ridge i wonder if you know upon what mound you be stand say batakus the boy have to confess that he do not know this be a grave say batakus beneath this mound lie the first settler in härjedalen perhaps you have a story to tell of he too say the boy i have not hear much about he but i think he be a norwegian he have serve with a norwegian king get into he bad grace and have to flee the country later he go over to the swedish king who live at upsalum and take service with he but after a time he ask for the hand of the king 's sister in marriage and when the king would not give he such a high-born bride he elope with she by that time he have manage to get himself into such disfavor that it be not safe for he to live either in norway or sweden and he do not wish to move to a foreign country ` but there must still be a course open to I ' he think with he servant and treasure he journey through dalecarlium until he arrive in the desolate forest beyond the outskirts of the province there he settle build house and break up land thus you see he be the first man to settle in this part of the country as the boy listen to the last story he look very serious i wonder what you object be in tell I all this he repeat batakus twisted and turn and screw up he eye and it be some time before he answer the boy since we be here alone he say finally i shall take this opportunity to question you regard a certain matter have you ever try to ascertain upon what term the elf who transform you be to restore you to a normal human be the only stipulation i have hear anything about be that i should take the white goosey-gander up to lapland and bring he back to skåne safe and sound i think as much say batakus for when last we meet you talk confidently of there be nothing more contemptible than deceive a friend who trust one you would better ask akka about the term you know i dare say that she be at you home and talk with the elf akka have not tell I of this say the boy wonderingly she must have think that it be best for you not to know just what the elf _ do _ say naturally she would rather help you than morten goosey-gander it be singular batakus that you always have a way of make I feel unhappy and anxious say the boy i dare say it might seem so continue the raven but this time i believe that you will be grateful to I for tell you that the elf 's word be to this effect : you be to become a normal human be again if you would bring back morten goosey-gander that you mother might lay he on the block and chop he head off the boy leap up that be only one of you base fabrication he cry indignantly you can ask akka yourself say batakus i see she come up there with she whole flock and do not forget what i have tell you to-day there be usually a way out of all difficulty if only one can find it i shall be interested to see what success you have vermland and dalsland _ Wednesday October fifth _ to-day the boy take advantage of the rest hour when akka be feed apart from the other wild goose to ask she if that which batakus have relate be true and akka could not deny it the boy make the leader-goose promise that she would not divulge the secret to morten goosey-gander the big white gander be so brave and generous that he might do something rash be he to learn of the elf 's stipulation later the boy sit on the goose-back glum and silent and hang he head he hear the wild goose call out to the gosling that now they be in dalarne they could see städjan in the north and that now they be fly over österdal river to horrmund lake and be come to vesterdal river but the boy do not care even to glance at all this i shall probably travel around with wild goose the rest of my life he remark to himself and i be likely to see more of this land than i wish he be quite as indifferent when the wild goose call out to he that now they have arrive in vermland and that the stream they be follow southward be klarälven i have see so many river already think the boy why bother to look at one more even have he be more eager for sight-seeing there be not very much to be see for northern vermland be nothing but vast monotonous forest tract through which klarälven wind -- narrow and rich in rapid here and there one can see a charcoal kiln a forest clearing or a few low chimneyless hut occupy by finn but the forest as a whole be so extensive one might fancy it be far up in lapland a little homestead _ Thursday October sixth _ the wild goose follow klarälven as far as the big iron foundry at monk for then they proceed westward to fryksdalen before they get to lake fryken it begin to grow dusky and they light in a little wet morass on a wooded hill the morass be certainly a good night quarter for the wild goose but the boy think it dismal and rough and wish for a better sleeping place while he be still high in the air he have notice that below the ridge lay a number of farm and with great haste he proceed to seek they out they be farther away than he have fancy and several time he be tempt to turn back presently the wood become less dense and he come to a road skirt the edge of the forest from it branch a pretty birch-bordered lane which lead down to a farm and immediately he hasten toward it first the boy enter a farm yard as large as a city marketplace and enclose by a long row of red house as he cross the yard he see another farm where the dwelling-house face a gravel path and a wide lawn back of the house there be a garden thick with foliage the dwelling itself be small and humble but the garden be edge by a row of exceedingly tall mountain-ash tree so close together that they form a real wall around it it appear to the boy as if he be come into a great high-vaulted chamber with the lovely blue sky for a ceiling the mountain-ash be thick with cluster of red berry the grass plot be still green of course but that night there be a full moon and as the bright moonlight fall upon the grass it look as white as silver no human being be in sight and the boy could wander freely wherever he wish when he be in the garden he see something which almost put he in good humor he have climb a mountain-ash to eat berry but before he could reach a cluster he catch sight of a barberry bush which be also full of berry he slide along the ash branch and clamber up into the barberry bush but he be no sooner there than he discover a currant bush on which still hang long red cluster next he see that the garden be full of gooseberry and raspberry and dog-rose bush that there be cabbage and turnip in the vegetable bed and berry on every bush seed on the herb and grain-filled ear on every blade and there on the path -- no of course he could not mistake it -- be a big red apple which shine in the moonlight the boy sit down at the side of the path with the big red apple in front of he and begin cut little piece from it with he sheath knife it would not be such a serious matter to be a elf all one 's life if it be always as easy to get good food as it be here he think he sit and muse as he eat wonder finally if it would not be as well for he to remain here and let the wild goose travel south without he i do not know for the life of I how i can ever explain to morten goosey-gander that i can not go home think he it would be better be i to leave he altogether i could gather provision enough for the winter as well as the squirrel do and if i be to live in a dark corner of the stable or the cow shed i should not freeze to death just as he be think this he hear a light rustle over he head and a second later something which resemble a birch stump stand on the ground beside he the stump twist and turn and two bright dot on top of it glow like coal of fire it look like some enchantment however the boy soon remark that the stump have a hooked beak and big feather wreath around its glowing eye then he know that this be no enchantment it be a real pleasure to meet a living creature remark the boy perhaps you will be good enough to tell I the name of this place mr brown owl and what sort of folk live here that evening as on all other evening the owl have perch on a ring of the big ladder prop against the roof from which she have look down toward the gravel walk and grass plot watch for rat very much to she surprise not a single grayskin have appear she see instead something that look like a human being but much much smaller move about in the garden that be the one who be scare away the rat think the owl what in the world can it be it be not a squirrel nor a kitten nor a weasel she observe i suppose that a bird who have live on a old place like this as long as i have ought to know about everything in the world but this be beyond my comprehension she conclude she have be stare at the object that move on the gravel path until she eye burn finally curiosity get the better of she and she fly down to the ground to have a closer view of the stranger when the boy begin to speak the owl bent forward and look he up and down he have neither claw nor horn she remark to herself yet who know but he may have a poisonous fang or some even more dangerous weapon i must try to find out what he pass for before i venture to touch he the place be call mårbacka say the owl and gentlefolk live here once upon a time but you yourself who be you i think of move in here volunteer the boy without answer the owl 's question would it be possible do you think oh yes -- but it be not much of a place now compare to what it be once say the owl you can weather it here i dare say it all depend upon what you expect to live on do you intend to take up the rat chase oh by no means declare the boy there be more fear of the rat eat I than that i shall do they any harm it can not be that he be as harmless as he say think the brown owl all the same i believe i 'll make a attempt she rise into the air and in a second she claw be fasten in nil holgersson 's shoulder and she be try to hack at he eye the boy shield both eye with one hand and try to free himself with the other at the same time call with all he might for help he realize that he be in deadly peril and think that this time surely it be all over with he now i must tell you of a strange coincidence : the very year that nil holgersson travel with the wild goose there be a woman who think of write a book about sweden which would be suitable for child to read in the school she have think of this from christmas time until the follow autumn but not a line of the book have she write at last she become so tired of the whole thing that she say to herself : you be not fit for such work sit down and compose story and legend as usual and let another write this book which have get to be serious and instructive and in which there must not be one untruthful word it be as good as settle that she would abandon the idea but she think very naturally it would have be agreeable to write something beautiful about sweden and it be hard for she to relinquish she work finally it occur to she that maybe it be because she live in a city with only gray street and house wall around she that she could make no headway with the write perhaps if she be to go into the country where she could see wood and field that it might go better she be from vermland and it be perfectly clear to she that she wish to begin the book with that province first of all she would write about the place where she have grow up it be a little homestead far remove from the great world where many old-time habit and custom be retain she think that it would be entertaining for child to hear of the manifold duty which have succeed one another the year around she want to tell they how they celebrate christmas and new year and easter and midsummer day in she home what kind of house furnishings they have what the kitchen and larder be like and how the cow shed stable lodge and bath house have look but when she be to write about it the pen would not move why this be she could not in the least understand nevertheless it be so true she remember it all just as distinctly as if she be still live in the midst of it she argue with herself that since she be go into the country anyway perhaps she ought to make a little trip to the old homestead that she might see it again before write about it she have not be there in many year and do not think it half bad to have a reason for the journey in fact she have always long to be there no matter in what part of the world she happen to be she have see many place that be more pretentious and prettier but nowhere could she find such comfort and protection as in the home of she childhood it be not such a easy matter for she to go home as one might think for the estate have be sell to people she do not know she feel to be sure that they would receive she well but she do not care to go to the old place to sit and talk with stranger for she want to recall how it have be in time go by that be why she plan it so as to arrive there late in the evening when the day 's work be do and the people be indoors she have never imagine that it would be so wonderful to come home as she sit in the cart and drive toward the old homestead she fancy that she be grow younger and younger every minute and that soon she would no longer be a oldish person with hair that be turn gray but a little girl in short skirt with a long flaxen braid as she recognize each farm along the road she could not picture anything else than that everything at home would be as in bygone day she father and mother and brother and sister would be stand on the porch to welcome she the old housekeeper would run to the kitchen window to see who be come and nero and freja and another dog or two would come bound and jump up on she the nearer she approach the place the happier she feel it be autumn which mean a busy time with a round of duty it must have be all these vary duty which prevent home from ever be monotonous all along the way the farmer be digging potato and probably they would be do likewise at she home that mean that they must begin immediately to grate potato and make potato flour the autumn have be a mild one she wonder if everything in the garden have already be store the cabbage be still out but perhaps the hop have be pick and all the apple it would be well if they be not have house cleaning at home autumn fair time be draw nigh everywhere the cleaning and scour have to be do before the fair open that be regard as a great event -- more especially by the servant it be a pleasure to go into the kitchen on market eve and see the newly scour floor strew with juniper twig the whitewashed wall and the shine copper utensil which be suspend from the ceiling even after the fair festivity be over there would not be much of a breathing spell for then come the work on the flax during dog day the flax have be spread out on a meadow to mould now it be lay in the old bath house where the stove be light to dry it out when it be dry enough to handle all the woman in the neighborhood be call together they sit outside the bath house and pick the flax to piece then they beat it with swingle to separate the fine white fiber from the dry stem as they work the woman grow gray with dust they hair and clothing be cover with flax seed but they do not seem to mind it all day the swingle pound and the chatter go on so that when one go near the old bath house it sound as if a bluster storm have break loose there after the work with the flax come the big hard-tack bake the sheep shearing and the servant ' move time in November there be busy slaughter day with salting of meat sausage make bake of blood pudding and candle steep the seamstress who use to make up they homespun dress have to come at this time of course and those be always two pleasant week -- when the woman folk sit together and busy themselves with sew the cobbler who make shoe for the entire household sit work at the same time in the men-servant ' quarter and one never tire of watch he as he cut the leather and sole and heel the shoe and put eyelet in the shoestring hole but the greatest rush come around christmas time lucia day -- when the housemaid go about dress in white with candle in she hair and serve coffee to everybody at five in the morning -- come as a sort of reminder that for the next two week they could not count on much sleep for now they must brew the christmas ale steep the christmas fish in lye and do they christmas bake and christmas scour she be in the middle of the bake with pan of christmas bun and cooky platter all around she when the driver draw in the rein at the end of the lane as she have request she start like one suddenly awaken from a sound sleep it be dismal for she who have just dream herself surround by all she people to be sit alone in the late evening as she step from the wagon and start to walk up the long lane that she might come unobserved to she old home she feel so keenly the contrast between then and now that she would have prefer to turn back of what use be it to come here she sigh it can not be the same as in the old day on the other hand she feel that since she have travel such a long distance she would see the place at all event so continue to walk on although she be more depress with every step that she take she have hear that it be very much change and it certainly be but she do not observe this now in the evening she think rather that everything be quite the same there be the pond which in she youth have be full of carp and where no one dare fish because it be father 's wish that the carp should be leave in peace over there be the men-servant ' quarter the larder and barn with the farm yard bell over one gable and the weather-vane over the other the house yard be like a circular room with no outlook in any direction as it have be in she father 's time -- for he have not the heart to cut down as much as a bush she linger in the shadow under the big mountain-ash at the entrance to the farm and stand look about she as she stand there a strange thing happen a flock of dove come and light beside she she could hardly believe that they be real bird for dove be not in the habit of move about after sundown it must have be the beautiful moonlight that have awaken these they must have think it be dawn and fly from they dove-cote only to become confused hardly know where they be when they see a human be they fly over to she as if she would set they right there have be many flock of dove at the manor when she parent live there for the dove be among the creature which she father have take under he special care if one ever mention the killing of a dive it put he in a bad humor she be please that the pretty bird have come to meet she in the old home who could tell but the dove have fly out in the night to show she they have not forget that once upon a time they have a good home there perhaps she father have send he bird with a greet to she so that she would not feel so sad and lonely when she come to she former home as she think of this there well up within she such a intense longing for the old time that she eye fill with tear life have be beautiful in this place they have have week of work break by many holiday festivity they have toil hard all day but at evening they have gather around the lamp and read tegner and runeberg _ fru _ lenngren and _ mamsell _ bremer they have cultivate grain but also rose and jasmine they have spin flax but have sing folk-song as they spin they have work hard at they history and grammar but they have also play theater and write verse they have stand at the kitchen stove and prepared food but have learn also to play the flute and guitar the violin and piano they have plant cabbage and turnip pea and bean in one garden but they have another full of apple and pear and all kind of berry they have live by themselves and this be why so many story and legend be stow away in they memory they have worn homespun clothes but they have also be able to lead care-free and independent life nowhere else in the world do they know how to get so much out of life as they do at one of these little homestead in my childhood she think there be just enough work and just enough play and every day there be a joy how i should love to come back here again now that i have see the place it be hard to leave it then she turn to the flock of dove and say to they -- laugh at herself all the while : will not you fly to father and tell he that i long to come home i have wander long enough in strange place ask he if he can not arrange it so that i may soon turn back to my childhood 's home the moment she have say this the flock of dove rise and fly away she try to follow they with she eye but they vanish instantly it be as if the whole white company have dissolve in the shimmering air the dove have only just go when she hear a couple of pierce cry from the garden and as she hasten thither she see a singular sight there stand a tiny midget no taller than a hand 's breadth struggle with a brown owl at first she be so astonished that she could not move but when the midget cry more and more pitifully she step up quickly and part the fighter the owl swing herself into a tree but the midget stand on the gravel path without attempt either to hide or to run away thanks for you help he say but it be very stupid of you to let the owl escape i can not get away from here because she be sit up in the tree watch I it be thoughtless of I to let she go but to make amends can not i accompany you to you home ask she who write story somewhat surprise to think that in this unexpected fashion she have get into conversation with one of the tiny folk still she be not so much surprised after all it be as if all the while she have be await some extraordinary experience while she walk in the moonlight outside she old home the fact be i have think of stop here over night say the midget if you will only show I a safe sleeping place i shall not be oblige to return to the forest before daybreak must i show you a place to sleep be you not at home here i understand that you take I for one of the tiny folk say the midget but i be a human be like yourself although i have be transform by a elf that be the most remarkable thing i have ever hear would not you like to tell I how you happen to get into such a plight the boy do not mind tell she of he adventure and as the narrative proceed she who listen to he grow more and more astonished and happy what luck to run across one who have travel all over sweden on the back of a goose think she just this which he be relate i shall write down in my book now i need worry no more over that matter it be well that i come home to think that i should find such help as soon as i come to the old place instantly another think flash into she mind she have send word to she father by the dove that she long for home and almost immediately she have receive help in the matter she have ponder so long might not this be the father 's answer to she prayer the treasure on the island on they way to the sea _ Friday October seventh _ from the very start of the autumn trip the wild goose have fly straight south but when they leave fryksdalen they veer in another direction travel over western vermland and dalsland toward bohuslän that be a jolly trip the gosling be now so use to fly that they complain no more of fatigue and the boy be fast recover he good humor he be glad that he have talk with a human be he feel encourage when she say to he that if he be to continue do good to all whom he meet as heretofore it could not end badly for he she be not able to tell he how to get back he natural form but she have give he a little hope and assurance which inspire the boy to think out a way to prevent the big white gander from go home do you know morten goosey-gander that it will be rather monotonous for we to stay at home all winter after have be on a trip like this he say as they be fly far up in the air i be sit here think that we ought to go abroad with the goose surely you be not in earnest say the goosey-gander since he have prove to the wild goose he ability to travel with they all the way to lapland he be perfectly satisfy to get back to the goose pen in holger nilsson 's cow shed the boy sit silently a while and gaze down on vermland where the birch wood leafy grove and garden be clothe in red and yellow autumn color i do not think i have ever see the earth beneath we as lovely as it be to-day he finally remark the lake be like blue satin band do not you think it would be a pity to settle down in west vemminghög and never see any more of the world i think you want to go home to you mother and father and show they what a splendid boy you have become say the goosey-gander all summer he have be dream of what a proud moment it would be for he when he should alight in the house yard before holger nilsson 's cabin and show dunfin and the six gosling to the goose and chicken the cow and the cat and to mother holger nilsson herself so that he be not very happy over the boy 's proposal now morten goosey-gander do not you think yourself that it would be hard never to see anything more that be beautiful say the boy i would rather see the fat grain field of söderslätt than these lean hill answer the goosey-gander but you must know very well that if you really wish to continue the trip i can not be part from you that be just the answer i have expect from you say the boy and he voice betray that he be relieve of a great anxiety later when they travel over bohuslän the boy observe that the mountain stretch be more continuous the valley be more like little ravine blast in the rock foundation while the long lake at they base be as black as if they have come from the underworld this too be a glorious country and as the boy see it with now a strip of sun now a shadow he think that there be something strange and wild about it he know not why but the idea come to he that once upon a time there be many strong and brave hero in these mystical region who have pass through many dangerous and daring adventure the old passion of want to share in all sort of wonderful adventure awake in he i might possibly miss not be in danger of my life at least once every day or two he think anyhow it be best to be content with thing as they be he do not speak of this idea to the big white gander because the goose be now fly over bohuslän with all the speed they could muster and the goosey-gander be puff so hard that he would not have have the strength to reply the sun be far down on the horizon and disappear every now and then behind a hill still the goose keep forge ahead finally in the west they see a shine strip of light which grow broader and broader with every wing stroke soon the sea spread before they milk white with a shimmer of rise red and sky blue and when they have circle past the coast cliff they see the sun again as it hang over the sea big and red and ready to plunge into the wave as the boy gaze at the broad endless sea and the red evening sun which have such a kindly glow that he dare to look straight at it he feel a sense of peace and calm penetrate he soul it be not worth while to be sad nil holgersson say the sun this be a beautiful world to live in both for big and little it be also good to be free and happy and to have a great dome of open sky above you the gift of the wild goose the goose stand sleep on a little rock islet just beyond fjällbacka when it draw on toward midnight and the moon hang high in the heaven old akka shake the sleepiness out of she eye after that she walk around and awaken yksus and kaksi kolme and neljä viisi and kuusi and last of all she give thumbietot a nudge with she bill that startle he what be it mother akka he ask spring up in alarm nothing serious assure the leader-goose it be just this : we seven who have be long together want to fly a short distance out to sea to-night and we wonder if you would care to come with we the boy know that akka would not have propose this move have there not be something important on foot so he promptly seat himself on she back the flight be straight west the wild goose first fly over a belt of large and small island near the coast then over a broad expanse of open sea till they reach the large cluster know as the väder island all of they be low and rocky and in the moonlight one could see that they be rather large akka look at one of the smallest island and alight there it consist of a round gray stone hill with a wide cleft across it into which the sea have cast fine white sea sand and a few shell as the boy slide from the goose 's back he notice something quite close to he that look like a jagged stone but almost at once he see that it be a big vulture which have choose the rock island for a night harbor before the boy have time to wonder at the goose recklessly alight so near a dangerous enemy the bird fly up to they and the boy recognize gorgo the eagle evidently akka and gorgo have arrange the meeting for neither of they be take by surprise this be good of you gorgo say akka i do not expect that you would be at the meeting place ahead of we have you be here long i come early in the evening reply gorgo but i fear that the only praise i deserve be for keep my appointment with you i have not be very successful in carry out the order you give I i be sure gorgo that you have do more than you care to admit assure akka but before you relate you experience on the trip i shall ask thumbietot to help I find something which be suppose to be bury on this island the boy stand gaze admiringly at two beautiful shell but when akka speak he name he glance up you must have wonder thumbietot why we turn out of we course to fly here to the west sea say akka to be frank i do think it strange answer the boy but i know of course that you always have some good reason for whatever you do you have a good opinion of I return akka but i almost fear you will lose it now for it be very probable that we have make this journey in vain many year ago it happen that two of the other old goose and myself encounter frightful storm during a spring flight and be wind-driven to this island when we discover that there be only open sea before we we fear we should be sweep so far out that we should never find we way back to land so we lay down on the wave between these bare cliff where the storm compel we to remain for several day we suffer terribly from hunger once we venture up to the cleft on this island in search of food we could not find a green blade but we see a number of securely tie bag half bury in the sand we hope to find grain in the bag and pull and tug at they till we tear the cloth however no grain pour out but shine gold piece for such thing we wild goose have no use so we leave they where they be we have not think of the find in all these year but this autumn something have come up to make we wish for gold we do not know that the treasure be still here but we have travel all this way to ask you to look into the matter with a shell in either hand the boy jump down into the cleft and begin to scoop up the sand he find no bag but when he have make a deep hole he hear the clink of metal and see that he have come upon a gold piece then he dig with he finger and feel many coin in the sand so he hurry back to akka the bag have rot and fall apart he exclaim and the money lie scatter all through the sand that be well say akka now fill in the hole and smooth it over so no one will notice the sand have be disturb the boy do as he be tell but when he come up from the cleft he be astonish to see that the wild goose be line up with akka in the lead and be march toward he with great solemnity the goose pause in front of he and all bow they head many time look so grave that he have to doff he cap and make a obeisance to they the fact be say akka we old goose have be think that if thumbietot have be in the service of human being and have do as much for they as he have for we they would not let he go without reward he well i have not help you it be you who have take good care of I return the boy we think also continue akka that when a human being have attend we on a whole journey he should not be allow to leave we as poor as when he come i know that what i have learn this year with you be worth more to I than gold or land say the boy since these gold coin have be lie unclaimed in the cleft all these year i think that you ought to have they declare the wild goose i think you say something about need this money yourselve remind the boy we do need it so as to be able to give you such recompense as will make you mother and father think you have be work as a goose boy with worthy people the boy turn half round and cast a glance toward the sea then face about and look straight into akka 's bright eye i think it strange mother akka that you turn I away from you service like this and pay I off before i have give you notice he say as long as we wild goose remain in sweden i trust that you will stay with we say akka i only want to show you where the treasure be while we could get to it without go too far out of we course all the same it look as if you wish to be rid of I before i want to go argue thumbietot after all the good time we have have together i think you ought to let I go abroad with you when the boy say this akka and the other wild goose stretch they long neck straight up and stand a moment with bill half open drinking in air that be something i have not think about say akka when she recover herself before you decide to come with we we have better hear what gorgo have to say you may as well know that when we leave lapland the agreement between gorgo and myself be that he should travel to you home down in skåne to try to make better term for you with the elf that be true affirm gorgo but as i have already tell you luck be against I i soon hunt up holger nilsson 's croft and after circle up and down over the place a couple of hour i catch sight of the elf skulk along between the shed immediately i swoop down upon he and fly off with he to a meadow where we could talk together without interruption i tell he that i have be send by akka from kebnekaise to ask if he could not give nil holgersson easier term ' i only wish i could ' he answer ` for i have hear that he have conduct himself well on the trip but it be not in my power to do so ' then i be wrathy and say that i would bear out he eye unless he give in ` you may do as you like ' he retort ` but as to nil holgersson it will turn out exactly as i have say you can tell he from I that he would do well to return soon with he goose for matter on the farm be in a bad shape he father have have to forfeit a bond for he brother whom he trust he have buy a horse with borrow money and the beast go lame the first time he drive it since then it have be of no earthly use to he tell nil holgersson that he parent have have to sell two of the cow and that they must give up the croft unless they receive help from somewhere when the boy hear this he frown and clench he fist so hard that the nail dig into he flesh it be cruel of the elf to make the condition so hard for I that i can not go home and relieve my parent but he sha 'n' t turn I into a traitor to a friend my father and mother be square and upright folk i know they would rather forfeit my help than have I come back to they with a guilty conscience the journey to vemminghög _ Thursday November third _ one day in the beginning of November the wild goose fly over halland ridge and into skåne for several week they have be rest on the wide plain around falköping as many other wild goose flock also stop there the grown goose have have a pleasant time visit with old friend and there have be all kind of game and race between the younger bird nil holgersson have not be happy over the delay in westergötland he have try to keep a stout heart but it be hard for he to reconcile himself to he fate if i be only well out of skåne and in some foreign land he have think i should know for certain that i have nothing to hope for and would feel easier in my mind finally one morning the goose start out and fly toward halland in the begin the boy take very little interest in that province he think there be nothing new to be see there but when the wild goose continue the journey farther south along the narrow coast-land the boy lean over the goose 's neck and do not take he glance from the ground he see the hill gradually disappear and the plain spread under he at the same time he notice that the coast become less rugged while the group of island beyond thin and finally vanish and the broad open sea come clear up to firm land here there be no more forest : here the plain be supreme it spread all the way to the horizon a land that lay so expose with field upon field remind the boy of skåne he feel both happy and sad as he look at it i can not be very far from home he think many time during the trip the gosling have ask the old goose : how do it look in foreign land wait wait you shall soon see the old goose have answer when the wild goose have pass halland ridge and go a distance into skåne akka call out : now look down look all around it be like this in foreign land just then they fly over söder ridge the whole long range of hill be clothe in beech wood and beautiful turreted castle peep out here and there among the tree graze roe-buck and on the forest meadow romp the hare hunter ' horn sound from the forest the loud baying of dog could be hear all the way up to the wild goose broad avenue wind through the tree and on these lady and gentleman be drive in polished carriage or ride fine horse at the foot of the ridge lay ring lake with the ancient bosjö cloister on a narrow peninsula do it look like this in foreign land ask the gosling it look exactly like this wherever there be forest-clad ridge reply akka only one do not see many of they wait you shall see how it look in general akka lead the goose farther south to the great skåne plain there it spread with grain field with acre and acre of sugar beet where the beet-picker be at work with low whitewashed farm - and outhouse with numberless little white church with ugly gray sugar refinery and small village near the railway station little beech-encircled meadow lake each of they adorn by its own stately manor shimmer here and there now look down look carefully call the leader-goose thus it be in foreign land from the baltic coast all the way down to the high alp farther than that i have never travel when the gosling have see the plain the leader-goose fly down the öresund coast swampy meadow slope gradually toward the sea in some place be high steep bank in other drift-sand field where the sand lay heap in bank and hill fishing hamlet stand all along the coast with long row of low uniform brick house with a lighthouse at the edge of the breakwater and brown fishing net hang in the dry yard now look down look well this be how it look along the coast in foreign land after akka have be fly about in this manner a long time she alight suddenly on a marsh in vemminghög township and the boy could not help think that she have travel over skåne just to let he see that he be a country which could compare favourably with any in the world this be unnecessary for the boy be not thinking of whether the country be rich or poor from the moment that he have see the first willow grove he heart ache with homesickness home at last _ Tuesday November eighth _ the atmosphere be dull and hazy the wild goose have be feed on the big meadow around skerup church and be have they noonday rest when akka come up to the boy it look as if we should have calm weather for awhile she remark and i think we 'll cross the baltic to-morrow indeed say the boy abruptly for he throat contract so that he could hardly speak all along he have cherish the hope that he would be release from the enchantment while he be still in skåne we be quite near west vemminghög now say akka and i think that perhaps you might like to go home for awhile it may be some time before you have another opportunity to see you people perhaps i have better not say the boy hesitatingly but something in he voice betray that he be glad of akka 's proposal if the goosey-gander remain with we no harm can come to he akka assure i think you have better find out how you parent be get along you might be of some help to they even if you be not a normal boy you be right mother akka i should have think of that long ago say the boy impulsively the next second he and the leader-goose be on they way to he home it be not long before akka alight behind the stone hedge encircle the little farm strange how natural everything look around here the boy remark quickly clamber to the top of the hedge so that he could look about it seem to I only yesterday that i first saw you come fly through the air i wonder if you father have a gun say akka suddenly you may be sure he have return the boy it be just the gun that keep I at home that Sunday morning when i should have be at church then i do not dare to stand here and wait for you say akka you have better meet we at smygahök early to-morrow morning so that you may stay at home over night oh do not go yet mother akka begged the boy jump from the hedge he could not tell just why it be but he feel as if something would happen either to the wild goose or to himself to prevent they future meeting no doubt you see that i be distressed because i can not get back my right form but i want to say to you that i do not regret have go with you last spring he add i would rather forfeit the chance of ever be human again than to have miss that trip akka breathe quickly before she answer there be a little matter i should have mention to you before this but since you be not go back to you home for good i think there be no hurry about it still it may as well be say now you know very well that i be always glad to do you bidding say the boy if you have learn anything at all from we thumbietot you no longer think that the human should have the whole earth to themselves say the wild goose solemnly remember you have a large country and you can easily afford to leave a few bare rock a few shallow lake and swamp a few desolate cliff and remote forest to we poor dumb creature where we can be allow to live in peace all my day i have be hound and hunt it would be a comfort to know that there be a refuge somewhere for one like I indeed i should be glad to help if i could say the boy but it be not likely that i shall ever again have any influence among human being well we be stand here talk as if we be never to meet again say akka but we shall see each other to-morrow of course now i 'll return to my flock she spread she wing and start to fly but come back and stroke thumbietot up and down with she bill before she fly away it be broad daylight but no human be move on the farm and the boy could go where he please he hasten to the cow shed because he know that he could get the best information from the cow it look rather barren in they shed in the spring there have be three fine cow there but now there be only one -- mayrose it be quite apparent that she yearn for she comrade she head droop sadly and she have hardly touch the feed in she crib good day mayrose say the boy run fearlessly into she stall how be mother and father how be the cat and the chicken what have become of star and gold-lily when mayrose hear the boy 's voice she start and appear as if she be go to gore he but she be not so quick-tempered now as formerly and take time to look well at nil holgersson he be just as little now as when he go away and wear the same clothes yet he be completely change the nil holgersson that go away in the spring have a heavy slow gait a drawling speech and sleepy eye the one that have come back be lithe and alert ready of speech and have eye that sparkle and dance he have a confident bearing that command respect little as he be although he himself do not look happy he inspire happiness in other moo bellow mayrose they tell I that he be change but i could not believe it welcome home nil holgersson welcome home this be the first glad moment i have know for ever so long thank you mayrose say the boy who be very happy to be so well receive now tell I all about father and mother they have have nothing but hardship ever since you go away say mayrose the horse have be a costly care all summer for he have stand in the stable the whole time and not earn he feed you father be too soft-hearted to shoot he and he can not sell he it be on account of the horse that both star and gold-lily have to be sell there be something else the boy want badly

be pass the stable there be nothing quite so hard as be in debt it would be better to sell the cabin if it be not for the boy i should not mind sell it he mother demur but what will become of he if he return some day wretched and poor -- as he be likely to be -- and we not here you be right about that the father agree but we shall have to ask the folk who take the place to receive he kindly and to let he know that he be welcome back to we we sha 'n' t say a harsh word to he no matter what he may be shall we mother no indeed if i only have he again so that i could be certain he be not starve and freezing on the highway i would ask nothing more then he father and mother go in and the boy hear no more of they conversation he be happy and deeply move when he know that they love he so dearly although they believe he have go astray he long to rush into they arm but perhaps it would be a even greater sorrow be they to see I as i now be while he stand there hesitate a cart drive up to the gate the boy smother a cry of surprise for who should step from the cart and go into the house yard but osa the goose girl and she father they walk hand in hand toward the cabin when they be about half way there osa stop she father and say : now remember father you be not to mention the wooden shoe or the goose or the little brownie who be so like nil holgersson that if it be not himself it must have have some connection with he certainly not say jon esserson i shall only say that they son have be of great help to you on several occasion -- when you be try to find I -- and that therefore

thing in the right way osa commend it be only that one particular thing that i do not wish you to mention they go into the cabin and the boy would have like to hear what they talk about in there but he dare not venture near the house it be not long before they come out again and he father and mother accompany they as far as the gate he parent be strangely happy they appear to have gain a new hold on life when the visitor be go father and mother linger at the gate gaze after they i do not feel unhappy any longer since i have hear so much that be good of we nil say he mother perhaps he get more praise than he really deserve put in he father thoughtfully be not it enough for you that they come here specially to say they want to help we because we nil have serve they in many way i think father that you should have accept they offer no mother i do not wish to accept money from any one either as a gift or a loan in the first place i want to free myself from all debt then we will work we way up again we be not so very old be we mother the father laugh heartily as he say this i believe you think it will be fun to sell this place upon which we have expend such a lot of time and hard work protest the mother oh you know why i be laugh the father retort it be the thought of the boy 's have go to the bad that weigh I down until i have no strength or courage leave in I now that i know he still live and have turn out well you 'll see that holger nilsson have some grit leave the mother go in alone and the boy make haste to hide in a corner for he father walk into the stable he go over to the horse and examine its hoof as usual to try to discover what be wrong with it what be this he cry discover some letter scratch on the hoof remove the sharp piece of iron from the foot he read and glance around inquiringly however he run he finger along the under side of the hoof and look at it carefully i verily believe there be something sharp here he say while he father be busy with the horse and the boy sit huddle in a corner it happen that other caller come to the farm the fact be that when morten goosey-gander find himself so near he old home he simply could not resist the temptation of show he wife and child to he old companion on the farm so he take dunfin and the gosling along and make for home there be not a soul in the barn yard when the goosey-gander come along he alight confidently walk all around the place and show dunfin how luxuriously he have live when he be a tame goose when they have view the entire farm he notice that the door of the cow shed be open look in here a moment he say then you will see how i live in former day it be very different from camp in swamp and morass as we do now the goosey-gander stand in the doorway and look into the cow shed there be not a soul in here he say come along dunfin and you shall see the goose pen do not be afraid there be no danger forthwith the goosey-gander dunfin and all six gosling waddle into the goose pen to have a look at the elegance and comfort in which the big white gander have live before he join the wild goose this be the way it use to be : here be my place and over there be the trough which be always fill with oats and water explain the goosey-gander wait there be some fodder in it now with that he rush to the trough and begin to gobble up the oats but dunfin be nervous let 's go out again she say only two more grain insist the goosey-gander the next second he let out a shriek and run for the door but it be too late the door slam the mistress stand without and bolt it they be lock in the father have remove a sharp piece of iron from the horse 's hoof and stand contentedly stroke the animal when the mother come run into the stable come father and see the capture i have make no wait a minute say the father look here first i have discover what ail the horse i believe we luck have turn say the mother only fancy the big white goosey-gander that disappear last spring must have go off with the wild goose he have come back to we in company with seven wild goose they walk straight into the goose pen and i have shut they all in that be extraordinary remark the father but best of all be that we do not have to think any more that we boy steal the goosey-gander when he go away you be quite right father she say but i be afraid we 'll have to kill they to-night in two day

american thanksgiving day -rrb- i think it would be outrageous to butcher the goosey-gander now that he have return to we with such a large family protest holger nilsson if time be easier we would let he live but since we be go to move from here we can not keep goose come along now and help I carry they into the kitchen urge the mother they go out together and in a few moment the boy see he father come along with morten goosey-gander and dunfin -- one under each arm he and he wife go into the cabin the goosey-gander cry : thumbietot come and help I -- as he always do when in peril -- although he be not aware that the boy be at hand nil holgersson hear he yet he linger at the door of the cow shed he do not hesitate because he know that it would be well for he if the goosey-gander be behead -- at that moment he do not even remember this -- but because he shrink from be see by he parent they have a hard enough time of it already he think must i bring they a new sorrow but when the door close on the goosey-gander the boy be arouse he dash across the house yard spring up on the board-walk lead to the entrance door and run into the hallway where he kick off he wooden shoe in the old accustomed way and walk toward the door all the while it go so much against the grain to appear before he father and mother that he could not raise he hand to knock but this concern the life of the goosey-gander he say to himself -- he who have be my best friend ever since i last stand here in a twinkle the boy remember all that he and the goosey-gander have suffer on ice-bound lake and stormy sea and among wild beast of prey he heart swell with gratitude he conquer himself and knock on the door be there some one who wish to come in ask he father open the door mother you sha 'n' t touch the goosey-gander cry the boy instantly both the goosey-gander and dunfin who lay on a bench with they foot tie give a cry of joy so that he be sure they be alive some one else give a cry of joy -- he _

that i have you back again say he mother laughing and cry come in my boy come in welcome add he father and not another word could he utter but the boy still linger at the threshold he could not comprehend why they be so glad to see he -- such as he be then he mother come and put she arm around he and draw he into the room and he know that he be all right mother and father he cry i be a big boy i be a human be again the parting with the wild goose _ Wednesday November ninth _ the boy arise before dawn and wander down to the coast he be stand alone on the strand east of smyge fishing hamlet before sunrise he have already be in the pen with morten goosey-gander to try to rouse he but the big white gander have no desire to leave home he do not say a word but only stick he bill under he wing and go to sleep again to all appearance the weather promise to be almost as perfect as it have be that spring day when the wild goose come to skåne there be hardly a ripple on the water the air be still and the boy thought of the good passage the goose would have he himself be as yet in a kind of daze -- sometimes think he be a elf sometimes a human be when he see a stone hedge alongside the road he be afraid to go farther until he have make sure that no wild animal or vulture lurk behind it very soon he laugh to himself and rejoice because he be big and strong and do not have to be afraid of anything when he reach the coast he station himself big as he be at the very edge of the strand so that the wild goose could see he it be a busy day for the bird of passage bird call sound on the air continuously the boy smile as he think that no one but himself understand what the bird be say to one another presently wild goose come fly one big flock follow another just so it be not my goose that be go away without bidding I farewell he think he want so much to tell they how everything have turn out and to show they that he be no longer a elf but a human be there come a flock that fly faster and cackle louder than the other and something tell he that this must be _ the _ flock but now he be not quite so sure about it as he would have be the day before the flock slacken its flight and circle up and down along the coast the boy know it be the right one but he could not understand why the goose do not come straight down to he they could not avoid see he where he stand he try to give a call that would bring they down to he but only think he tongue would not obey he he could not make the right sound he hear akka 's call but do not understand what she say what can this mean have the wild goose change they language he wonder he wave he cap to they and run along the shore call here be i where be you but this seem only to frighten the goose they rise and fly farther out to sea at last he understand they do not know that he be human have not recognize he he could not call they to he because human being can not speak the language of bird he could not speak they language nor could he understand it although the boy be very glad to be release from the enchantment still he think it hard that because of this he should be part from he old comrade he sit down on the sand and bury he face in he hand what be the use of he gaze after they any more presently he hear the rustle of wing old mother akka have find it hard to fly away from thumbietot and turn back and now that the boy sit quite still she venture to fly nearer to he suddenly something must have tell she who he be for she light close beside he nil give a cry of joy and take old akka in he arm the other wild goose crowd round he and stroke he with they bill they cackle and chatter and wish he all kind of good luck and he too talk to they and thank they for the wonderful journey which he have be privileged to make in they company all at once the wild goose become strangely quiet and withdraw from he as if to say : alas he be a man he do not understand we : we do not understand he then the boy rise and go over to akka he stroke she and pat she he do the same to yksus and kaksus kolme and neljä viisus and kuusus -- the old bird who have be he companion from the very start after that he walk farther up the strand he know perfectly well that the sorrow of the bird do not last long and he want to part with they while they be still sad at lose he as he cross the shore meadow he turn and watch the many flock of bird that be fly over the sea all be shriek they coax call -- only one goose flock fly silently on as long as he could follow it with he eye the wedge be perfect the speed good
