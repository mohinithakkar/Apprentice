that have so long be slumber now burst forth beyond all hindrance or control she stop at salt lake and call upon brigham young and be so disgusted with the mighty prophet that she would not look at he

indispensable to the occasion alonzo ask why she call upon the dreadful man and somewhat maliciously inquire if it be not for the express purpose of be shock and horrify thus afford a fine chance to moralize and display the elevation of she own principle and in fact help to fill out a good article but melissa most vigorously deny the soft impeachment then she see the sad wife whose day of

praiseworthy condition of she own mind and heart this excellent young woman also catch glimpse of the red man and here be another glorious opportunity to display she literary genius -- and she do not let the occasion slip -- o no it produce a plaintive little rhapsody of pity and regret such as mr lo be apt to inspire in the heart of the young and romantic although if melissa be to find herself

file in and out of she drawing-room still she have a most decide objection to see the same impose spectacle in she kitchen woman will be inconsistent melissa particularly admire john 's manner of iron she think it peculiar but genteel and gentility be always desirable there must be something about the climate of californium that be especially inspiring to author -- a kind of magnetism in the atmosphere that draw out all the literary talent which may be lie dormant in they soul -- so that any one desirous of become a writer have only to take a trip to that fascinating region and at some

say that he be wholly unprepared to make a speech but he own a lot of condemn musket which he stand ready to dispose of to the government at four time they original cost he should advise that the fort be cover with several thickness of pennsylvanium railroad iron it would protect we gallant troops and he be now as he have always be in favor of protection besides he know party who could get up a

what be call the navy department come from a inland town he do not exactly know whether the secretary of state or himself have the order about of we national vessel but he rather think he would

popularity of opera among fashionable people in this city vary inversely as the intelligibility of the language in which it be sing to illustrate the italian opera be fashionable though not one in ten of the people compose a average audience understand a word that be say or sing the french opera be less fashionable but perhaps one-third of the audience can understand the less ingenious of the indelicate joke the english opera be not fashionable but every one can understand every word that miss riching or miss hersee pronounce these fact undoubtedly stand in the relation of cause and effect wherefore the axiom with which this column begin to be sure the word of a opera be a matter of very little consequence the music speaking as plainly as the clearest of saxon sentence but the fashionable public know less of music than it know of language and would be quite capable of mistake _ gran dio _ for a comic song and _ libiamo _ for a lover 's lamentation be not the translate libretto of _ travia _ at hand to supply they and the critic of the minor papers with the cue for the display of appropriate emotion singer especially understand the full force of the above state axiom hence those who be deficient in voice avoid the english stage miss kellogg for example never attempt english opera because she know that people who have hear rise hersee or caroline riching would laugh at she claim to be the greatest living prima donna should she compete with those bird of english song wherefore she wisely confine herself to the italian stage sure of please a public that know nothing of music but be confident that a lady who enjoy the friendship of madison avenue must be a great singer parepa on the contrary turn from the italian to the english stage -- but then parepa have a voice how many year be it since caroline riching first sing in english opera it be a ungallant question but the answer would be still more ungallant be it not that miss riching be a
