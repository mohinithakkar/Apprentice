i honor thy father and thy mother well clara say mary as they leave the church shall we go now and take a walk before we go home look there be william johnson and george field wait to see which way we shall turn in order to accompany we not this afternoon answer clara i think we have better go home they continue they way homeward until they reach the street where clara live and be about to part when mary ask she companion at what time she would meet she the next morning to take a long walk add that william and george would go with they i will ask mother reply clara and if she be willing i will meet you at six o'clock how be this say mary you never use to say you would ask you mother besides there can be no possible objection to we go to take a walk true rejoin clara there can be no objection to we take a walk but we have never tell we mother that william and george be in the habit of go with we well i do not see any _ great _ harm in they go with we continue mary with a tone which indicate that she do not see _ any _ harm _ whatever _ in it perhaps there be not and yet mary i have think that there might be therefore i prefer to speak to my mother about it and pray miss clara what have make you so conscientious all at once i will tell you mary you recollect that on the last sabbath we pastor take for he text the fifth commandment yes i do well something which he say cause I to think more about these word than i ever do before and the more i think of they the more convinced i be that we do not consider and reflect upon they so much as we ought to let I see say mary honor thy father and thy mother -- well i be sure i do honor my father and my mother i obey they when they give I a command and i love they with all my heart what more can i do so i reason before but when i sit down alone in my chamber a good many thing come to my mind to convince I that i be wrong well add mary let I have the benefit of you reflection why in this very instance of go to walk i have always ask my mother 's consent and she have give it but i never tell she where we go or who go with we which now appear to I wrong we mother be much older than we be and have have much more experience than we have and there _ may _ be wrong in do what appear to we quite harmless for the life of I interrupted mary i can not think there can possibly be any harm in such a slight occurrence however say nothing to you mother to-night but go with we to-morrow morning and then you can mention it to she and see what she say i beg you pardon mary but you say just now you could not see what possible harm there could be in so slight a occurrence and yet you request to put off mention this to my mother show that you have some misgiving on the subject mary reflect for a moment clara say she if you have no objection i will go home with you and hear what you mother will say i shall be delighted to have you be the answer mary winthrop and clara spaulding have arrive at the age of fourteen and fifteen year a time of life which be peculiarly critical for girl at no age do they more require the advice of a mother and at no age be they less inclined to seek it this would seem to be a natural disinclination so prevalent be it these be both good girl but as may be judge from the conversation we have just related clara be the more thoughtful while mary be very apt to act without much reflection she possess however this noble trait she be always ready to acknowledge she error when it be point out to she and would endeavor to avoid repeat it mr spaulding have reach home when the girl enter she be a woman of excellent sense and a mother indeed to she child mary frankly tell she all the conversation which have pass between clara and herself and then wait for she opinion it make I truly happy say mr s that you have come to I in this free and open manner and i be very glad that my dear clara have reflect so much upon the text in itself there be not much harm in take a walk with william johnson and george field and yet it be not proper for you to do so without the knowledge and consent of you parent william and george be not bad boy and perhaps would be call by people generally good one still i have remark a certain levity in they manner which if only occasional might be call good humor but which recur as it do at all time and on all occasion the sabbath not except make I fear that they training at home be not what i should desire to have it for this reason mary i be not willing that clara should be often in they company nor do i think you mother would differ from I should you ask she i wonder say mary how clara come to think of this slight circumstance of a walk in connection with the commandment ` honor thy father and thy mother ' i think she have sufficiently explain that herself reply mr spauld i wish both of you and not only you but all young person would think a good deal more on this subject i remember when i be of you age that many thing occur which i omit to mention to my mother but which it would have be much better for I if i have tell she sometimes these concerned my bodily health and i be sure that if i have inform she of they at the time i should now have a much better constitution than i possess at other time i neglect to ask she advice about what i think be small matter but the result prove that i should have be save much trouble have i consult she in fact continue mr s the command to honor thy father and thy mother be far more comprehensive and exact many more duty than the young and i be sorry to say the old too be willing to recognize the young be too apt to think when they get into they teens that there be a great many thing about which there be no need of ask they parent ' advice and counsel that they know _ then about _ as well as they parent what they ought to do and by the time they get to be eighteen or nineteen year of age _ a good deal better _ but my dear child it be not so and the young who reason and act thus will soon cease to honor they father and mother no the almighty father in give this as one of the ten commandment to the child of israel know the vanity of we nature he know how unwilling the young be to learn from the experience of the old and he therefore proclaim this command that they might have it constantly before they eye i have say this be a comprehensive command to honor thy father and thy mother be not merely to show they outward respect it embrace numberless duty and among they this the duty while you be young of do nothing without they knowledge and consent when you be in a situation to ask it be assure of one thing if you be about to go anywhere or do anything and a doubt arise in you mind whether it be necessary to ask you mother 's permission be certain that you ought to ask it the very doubt in you own mind be sufficient evidence of the fact get into the habit of talk with you mother upon every subject you diversion you study you health never conceal anything from she be she not you mother do she not give you be who then shall you look up to if not to she o interrupted mary i have sometimes begin to talk to my mother about many thing which i do not exactly understand but somehow or other she be not willing to answer my question perhaps say mr spauld you do not take a proper occasion or she may have be very busy about something else you ought always to endeavor to take a proper time for everything at the same time she continue i be sorry to say that there be some mother who think child can not be talk to and reason with till they be of age this be a mistaken idea child have reasoning faculty and the sooner we begin to converse with they accordingly the sooner will those faculty be develop with this view we ought always to encourage they to give we they confidence on all occasion gratify they curiosity and allow they to talk upon every subject to we if we do not act thus they will soon abstain from that frank manner with which child ought always to lay open they whole heart to they parent o yes cry mary there be emma woodbury -- i do not believe she ever ask she mother 's advice no say clara and there be jane clifton 's mother -- stop my dear interrupted mr spauld these remark of yours remind I that there be another subject about which i should like to have a conversation with you and if you mother mary will give you permission to come home with clara after school to-morrow afternoon i will tell you what it be o yes i know she will reply mary indeed yesterday i should not have think of ask she but now after what i have hear from you lip i shall not do anything or go anywhere without ask she consent i be glad respond mr spauld that you remember this lesson so well now mary you have better go home and may neither of you ever think otherwise than seriously of the divine command to ` honor thy father and thy mother ' and remember that few person have ever come to harm when they grow up who in they youth obey it uncharitable judgment conversation ii cast out the beam from thine own eye then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother 's eye mary 's mother cheerfully give she leave to go home with clara the next day she know and highly esteemed mr spaulding and be very glad that she daughter should be intimate with she family mr spauld greet the girl with a smile and a kind word then say mary you begin last evening to make a remark about emma woodbury will you tell I what you be go to say certainly reply mary i be go to say that emma scarcely ever ask the advice of she mother or she consent to do anything or go anywhere and i know a great many girl who act in the same way and i add clara intend to say that jane clifton 's mother be one of those whom you speak of as never converse with child in a rational and reasoning manner i guess as much say mr spauld i tell you she continue there be another point upon which i wish to say a few word to you can you think what it be i can not say mary nor i either say clara certainly i see no harm in the word we utter true respond mr spauld there be no harm it be not the word you speak but the tone in which they be speak that attract my attention as if you be _ glad _ to be able to point out somebody to whom the reproof could be apply this fail be a common one and we savior may have have it in view when he say to he follower on the mount ` cast out the beam from thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother 's eye ' my object now my dear child be to caution you against a fail which be almost universal namely of see distinctly and reprove fault in other while we appear to be quite unconscious that we ourselves be in the practice of the same or worse defect this blemish develop itself in a variety of way the pastor preach a excellent sermon wherein be contain some allusion to fault which ought to be correct if the people have treasured up in they heart all he exhortation they would not have forget one which he have often endeavor to impress upon they mind i mean the duty of self-communion self-examination and when he should have occasion to allude to fault they would one and all ask themselves ` be i guilty of this wrong let I see and if i be let I correct it in future ' instead of this how frequently do we hear such expression as these : ` the remark in the sermon this morning apply to mr a or mr b very well and it be to be hope they will see it and profit by it ' now if such individual instead of try to find other who be guilty of the wrong indicate would only carefully look within themselves ten chance to one they would find that they deserve the rebuke as much as any one else child insensibly contract the same bad habit of look very sharply for the fault of other never once think that they may have some which if not precisely the same may be even worse thus if the pastor superintendent or one of the teacher address the sabbath school call the attention of the scholar generally to any fault each scholar ought to ask himself at once ` be it i ' and not look round complacently and ask ` who _ can _ it be ' or say ' i guess the speaker mean to refer to lilly a or edgar b ' well say mary i must confess that i have do this often and without be conscious of any wrong feeling some how or other i do not consider that the reproof belong to I or ever ask myself if i have commit the fault which be expose for this reason i remark continue mr s that child insensibly contract this habit from they parent and the defect extend to physical as well as moral error not long since i have a interesting conversation with mr r a well-known philanthropist and physiologist who be devote he life to the alleviation of some of the ill of human existence he tell I that a short time before he deliver a lecture to parent on the physical training of they child and point out the great mistake which be often make on retire say he i overheard many remark but not one speak as if i have address he every one could point to some one else who might well profit by the lecture but not one would believe that i mean to say to each individual present as nathan say unto david ` thou art the man ' i be sure observe clara i never feel the full force of this say of we savior before although i have read it a hundred time i shall read the whole chapter again carefully to-night and so will i add mary do so my child say mr s and read in the same careful spirit the whole sermon on the mount and all we savior 's teaching many people old and young read the new testament because they be tell to without think that there be a active living principle in it a think to be treasured up and carry out in we daily life in almost every word the master utter those who _ do _ read it in the true spirit find new pleasure and new instruction every time they peruse it and finally to come back to we subject when you hear you schoolmate make uncharitable remark about other use all you influence especially by you own example to make they correct the habit and when you hear a sermon in church or a address in the school where any fault be expose ask yourselve if the rebuke apply to you and if it do set about correct the fault immediately do this always ` cast the _ beam _ out of thine own eye ' correct you own error then will you see clearly to ` cast the _ mote _ out of thy brother 's eye ' mary return home that evening well pleased with the two conversation she have take part in and better still she and clara profit by they i be happy to add that they schoolmate be gradually correct many evil habit by the good example of these two girl and thus mary and clara have the double satisfaction of improve they own conduct and of be instrumental in improve that of other boy become man if you be to be boy always and do not need to know anything more than just enough to enable you to enjoy you sport from day to day it would not be so necessary perhaps as it now be to attend strictly to you every-day study though the influence of the Sunday school would be necessary even then boy can not enjoy they sport together unless they be truthful just and kind and it be in the Sunday school that these grace be most successfully acquire but boy will become man and all the knowledge they can acquire in boyhood will become serviceable in manhood therefore boy should be

in god 's eternal rest susan 's repentance and appeal to she elder sister i once know two sister the only companion of a widow mother who though they have no relative and but very few friend and should therefore have be the more closely unite in heart be in the habit oftener of harshly rebuke and blame than of encouraging assist and comforting each other i often wonder at this as they both have many estimable trait of character and could only account for it not excuse it by the fact that they have be much separate in early life and since they reunion have have to encounter many obstacle and bear the weight of many heavy disappointment i confidently hope and believe that the good sense of one or both of they would in time lead they to see they error and the sin of thus fret and irritating each other nor be i disappoint the younger whose conscience be the most sensitive first make the discovery and immediately begin try to remedy the evil and to induce she sister to aid she in the endeavor imagine some of she thought and feeling i have put they in rhyme we have do wrong dear sister and i be very sad to-day : for i have feel how far we have stray from wisdom 's bless way have feel how much of angry strife have dwelt within we heart and how when _ that _ have enter in life 's happiness depart we have do wrong dear sister for we have not patient be but answer often hasty word by hasty word again and when we should with gentle act have soothe each other 's care we have make by cold indifference we lot more hard to bear we have do wrong dear sister i remember how we have grieve we widow mother 's anxious heart so long of joy bereave o be we loving good and kind and all we murmuring o'er might not the smile come back again and light she face once more i know we lot in life thus far have not be smooth and fair that often much of toil and ill have fall to we share but why dear sister why should we _ ourselves _ the load increase why by we jangling and we strife shut out all joy and peace and more : we have offend god this day i feel and know we have forget he command and gain we nought but woe o join with I as fill with grief most earnestly i pray that he will yet be merciful and take we sin away love thou each other love all man and love shall make you free thus say the savior jesus and let this _ we _ watchword be let we each other love and pray that gentle thought may come and gentle word and act may make a eden of we home forgive I now dear sister all the anger i have show and all my past unkindness through the year already fly i 'll love thee faithfully and true and lay all harshness by to be my loving sister then wilt _ thou _ not also try little emma one Saturday afternoon little emma come into she mother 's room and say to she mother may i go with abba to she Sunday school she say they be all so happy there my child say she mother why do you wish to leave you own school and go to a strange one because mother abba have often tell I what a good school they have and how much she love it well as you be very anxious to go i will grant you request this once on condition that it must never be repeat the next morning this pleasant little girl be up very early to make ready to go with she friend to the new sabbath school she be delighted with all she see and hear and when the pastor take she by the hand she say to herself i wish mother would permit I to come here every Sunday i will ask she at any rate after the school be dismiss she go home revolve in she mind what she should say to obtain she mother 's consent she mother observe how thoughtful she appear and say to she emma how do you like abba 's Sunday school oh mother i be so happy do let I go there they sing so sweetly and the pastor be so kind he have a affectionate word for all they superintendent too be so pleasant i know i should love he she mother say to she with a very sorrowful countenance do you know my child that they teach very erroneous doctrine there in regard to a future life they teach that all will be eventually holy and happy both the good and the bad but mother i should think it would make we all happy to believe so the minister tell we that ` god be love ' and that can not be a bad doctrine i be sure i would much rather think so than that he would hate any of we for you have often tell I that hatred be very wicked i can not think that a good and wise be would do that which you have teach I be wrong then they all seem to love each other dearly they be like a pleasant family of brother and sister do let I go will you not dear mother i should be so happy she mother say many thing to convince she that it be not right to change she school but she be very unhappy and say so often do let I go that she mother consent to gratify she thinking perhaps that she would soon tire of it Sunday come and emma be nearly the first one there so anxious be she to be in season she enter the schoolroom with a bright and happy face and when the superintendent come to she she say i have come to join you sabbath school will you receive I to add to she joy the superintendent give she a seat in the same class with she friend abba who be a very kind and good little girl and she find a number of other in the class who be very glad to see she there one little girl lend she a book to study and when the teacher give she a lesson for the next sabbath she say i have a lesson now fanny lend I she book and i have already learn a lesson from it this pleased she teacher very much for she think that there be many little girl who would have be very glad of such a excuse to put off they lesson ever after she be very constant in she attendance always have she lesson very perfect and never stay at home even if it chance to be a rainy clay for she would say my teacher will be there and i be sure if she be there i can go besides i know it will make she very happy to see I always in my place in this way do this good little emma continue to go on acquire knowledge and gain the love and good-will of all who know she she be always happy and cheerful kind to she parent oblige to she brother and sister ever ready to assist the poor and destitute have a kind word and a happy smile for all and this she learn from that one great and ennobling truth that god be love the old sabbath schoolroom a parody how dear to we heart be that old sabbath schoolroom which each Sunday morning present to we view the seat the piano the portrait that be near it and ev'ry loved thing which we memory know we dearly-loved pastor he wife who come with he we superintendent and dear mr g the teacher the pupil and faithful librarian we each sabbath morning invariably see that old sabbath schoolroom that dearly-love schoolroom that bless old schoolroom where all love to be that old sabbath schoolroom we hail as a treasure for often when weary and anxious with care we have find it the place of a heavenly pleasure we seek for with ardor but find not elsewhere how eager we enter with heart that be glowing and quick to we place -- we all know they well -- and then with we song-book and soul overflow the anthem of praise we unitedly swell that old sabbath schoolroom that dearly-love schoolroom that bless old schoolroom where all love to be blest truth -- from we teacher with joy we receive it -- that god be we father we savior and friend there be nought so alluring could tempt we to leave it though fraught with all pleasure the fancy can lend and when far remove to some distant location the tear of regret will intrusively swell as mem ` ry revert to we former vocation and long for the schoolroom we all love so well that old sabbath schoolroom that dearly-love schoolroom that bless old schoolroom we all love so well the hunter and he dog jowler a fable a famous hunter in the woodland country have a dog which be particularly fond of certain kind of game but exceedingly averse to other kind of much better flavor now it happen that whenever the hunter wish to give chase to moose or deer jowler be sure to scare up a woodchuck or some still filthier game leave the deer to make good he escape day after day thus pass away leave the hunter 's labor no suitable reward it be in vain that the hunter expostulate with he dog neither threat nor blow be of any avail when the master would hunt one thing the dog be sure to be hunting something else at length both master and dog seem to tire of they constant conflict and to desire some adjustment whereby each might accommodate he own taste to some extent and yet live in harmony with the other with this view a friendly conference be hold in which jowler appear so tenacious that the hunter well-nigh despaired of any adjustment whatever it be however finally agree that jowler should hunt game to he own taste five day in the week and devote the remain hunting day to such game as he master prefer jowler however be careful to stipulate that if he chance to find himself ill or not in hunting trim on the sixth day he should be considerately deal by and not force to go beyond he strength the arrangement be fully make a paper be draw up contain the article of agreement and both jowler and the hunter affix they name thereto jowler no doubt congratulate himself on have it all to he liking five day out of six while the hunter perhaps flatter himself that the taste of venison one day in the week would so improve the standard of jowler 's taste as to bend he at length altogether to he own wish for a while thing seem to promise well under the new arrangement by and by when the day for hunting venison come round jowler be sick and tell he master he could not hunt that day so he master very considerately excuse he accord to the term of they agreement it be not long however before jowler refuse to hunt for another reason he say he have follow he own game with such constancy and alacrity for the five day that he be too much exhaust to hunt venison on the sixth day he must rest from any farther fatigue and claim the continue indulgence of he master by virtue of they contract the hunter urge in vain that jowler have virtually violate the contract for although it be stipulate that he should not be compel to the chase to he personal detriment yet it be imply of course that he should use the same precaution to be in hunting trim on the sixth day as he do to be so on the other five while the fact be he purposely deprive himself of rest during the five day that he might be compel to employ the sixth as a day of rest thus virtually appropriate the whole time to he own service jowler however pretend not to be convince of he wrong nor do he dishonesty stop here he master soon discover that while he be pretend to be unable from he excessive fatigue to hunt venison he be really continue to hunt he own game as on the other five day thus do he go on he old love gain strength day by day and impel he to a total disregard of he contract in order to indulge they until he master would bear with he no longer but drive he from he door have deprive himself of the care of so good a master he soon fall into still greater irregularity and a neighbor shepherd suspect he of commit depredation upon he flock kill he thus terminate he vicious career moral -- excessive engagedness in worldly labor six day in the week be no sufficient excuse for the neglect of public worship on the seventh and a vicious love continually indulge be quite sure to root out even we good resolution take care of you book suppose you loan a book to a friend would you not consider it he imperative duty to take the best of care of it as though it be he own and return it in as good condition as it be when take certainly you would then the same duty devolve upon you as a member of the Sunday school the school lend you book and expect you to take good care of they and return they early this be no trifling duty if you have a right to be

dream that she sweet angel be but the reflection of she own innocent face and golden ringlet from the mirror surface she love the little brook and walk among the wild flower upon its bank herself as pure and innocent as spring 's earliest blossom she be never lonely in she rural bower for the brook the bird and the flower ever speak to she heart in tone of love but one day she teacher tell she that wicked spirit be ever fly about try to lead away little child into they company and make they as wicked as themselves this much disquieted agatha for she have never learn before that aught exist save innocence and joy at first she fear to wander out alone into the great temple of nature as she be wont lest she should meet some of those malicious being she dare not look into the pure water fear that instead of the beautiful angel which so often meet she gaze hideous form might rise and drag she away into they bad company but she heart be soon quiet again for she teacher also tell she that good being come down from the spirit-land to watch over little child and drive the wicked one away so agatha no longer fear to visit she favorite haunt for she beseech the good spirit to be she guardian and when at night she retire to she little couch she pray the kind angel to watch over and protect she from evil spirit and she prayer be answer for none but good spirit ever visit the heart of agatha she be always punctual at sabbath school and one day after look around in vain for one of she mate she be very much trouble to learn that she have be lead a long way off by a company of evil spirit she long to tear the unfortunate victim from they grasp but she teacher tell she that the celestial being alone could save she and she must pray to they so agatha go home and walk out among the flower think the celestial spirit would delight to linger in so pure a spot and kneel amid a cluster of rose she pray they to fly to the rescue of she mislead companion and everywhere that agatha think pure enough for the abode of the good spirit would she go and pray that she friend might be restore at night she would look up to the star and entreat the same good being to come down from they pure bright dwelling and lead back the stray one she prayer be soon answer and when she next go to sabbath school she be almost overjoy to find she little friend at she accustomed place little mary -lrb- for she it be who have be lead away -rrb- seem very happy to get back again she kiss she schoolmate and say she would never leave they more but she tell they a sad tale of sin-land how the evil one would not suffer she to sleep lest in she slumber the good spirit might visit she and take she away -- that they would not let she walk among the flower for good spirit be there and for a long time they watch she very closely and direct she step in they pathway but at length when she become faint and weary the minister angel come to she assistance take she in they arm and folding she weary limb in they white robe bear she back to she anxious companion no one rejoice more than do agatha that the heavenly messenger have lead mary back they teacher say that she school be a little garden of flower which she be rear for heaven but agatha be the most innocent flower there and ready to bloom in the garden of paradise the kind heavenly guide think she too pure for earth and they would fain have she companionship in they purer region so they bear she away on wing of love to they heavenly home may every sabbath school scholar be like agatha lead by celestial spirit responsibility that teacher alone whose eye be open to the immense value of religious influence and who perceive the importance of trifle in moral can properly feel he great responsibility or be qualify to guide the young in the way of life duty of parent parent should see that they child understand they lesson and that they commit they perfectly they will thus both aid and encourage the superintendent and

forgive injury put himself beyond the reach of harm and secure a peace of soul more valuable than the gold of ophir summer thought a fable i suppose most of the reader of this little volume have be in the country the past summer as you behold the green grass the fine spreading tree and the beautiful flower that spring up in you pathway perhaps the feeling come over you that you could be far happier in the country than in the city we be very apt to suppose that change of place will produce a more delightful state of feeling forget that in a little time we should become familiar with all these object and then we return again to we former self precisely so it be with child in the country they come to this busy city and eagerly gaze at the varied show which attract the eye and would prefer to exchange situation with _ you _ but by and by they become wearied with sightseeing and the home they have leave rise before they as a pleasanter abode than any other dwelling however rich or elegant thus they learn to be _ happy at home _ and this be a most valuable attainment but in order to be permanently happy we must have something to do there be other lesson to be learn besides those we commit in the schoolroom the whole world indeed be a school and we be daily commit we task these teaching be preparation for we future happiness you have all notice the growth of a tree at first only a little twig spring out of the ground and so with the flower you deposit only a tiny seed but in a little time a shoot spring up and by natural but slow process the twig become a large shady tree and the shoot a beautiful bloom flower though they grow very slowly yet they never _ rest _ day and night the hidden process be go on which help to promote they growth just so it be with the mind of child they be daily acquire those habit which will eventually make the whole sum of they character but then great care be requisite how they form these character that they may spring up in fair proportion make they possessor worthy member of society i will illustrate this by a fable which occur to I as i walk over the beautiful garden of a friend with whom i spend a few week the past summer we will suppose for we present purpose that the flower have a articulate voice a stately dahlia grow in a cultivate garden there be many of the same species of flower but no other have the peculiar variegated tint of this particular one every one in pass by it be attract by its beauty it seem as if vain of flattery although we know it have no ear to hear for every day it seem to increase in size and beauty with its lofty head it gain a supremacy above all its neighbor and the heavy shower and furious wind fail to soil its petal or bend its graceful form away off in the farther corner of the garden under a hedge bloom a simple white clover it be entirely unheed by the multitude although it give a sweetness and fragrancy to the air which make the invalid stop to inhale it in its modesty it bloom in its lowly bed it seek no observation and be pass by as a simple white clover by and by the mower 's scythe pass that way and level it among common grass it be gather in the general mass of hay and become a part of the sustenance of the master 's cattle the dahlia be pluck by the horticulturist and place in a glass receptacle among kindred flower where it be gaze at for a time then it fade and be throw among common rubbish during they lifetime we will suppose they to have converse together i say the dahlia be queen of this garden i attract every eye that pass while you little clover be hide by the tall grass and liable to be crush at any moment well reply the clover let it be so _ now _ but look at we _ final end _ you will be place in a glass pluck from you native stem where you will wither and die as a worthless thing while i shall be fell by the scythe after i have reach my maturity and then a thousand tiny seed will i strow around I so that another reason i shall bloom all about the hedge and my usefulness will be appreciate and pray where will you then be the dahlia blush and hang its head for shame here child be a fable design to illustrate pride and humility which appear the most beautiful because the most useful i know you will prefer humility to pride if so you must remember that the peculiar trait you now cultivate be form within you the one or the other by a thousand little kind act you can diffuse happiness in you home and all the while you be disseminate these virtue you be acquire these lasting grace in _ yourselve _ which will spring up like the violet and sweet clover leave a fragrancy and beauty wherever you have trodden a talk with the child dear child -- although i be _ almost _ a stranger among you yet i feel a true interest in you welfare it give I great pleasure when i enter the sabbath school to meet you happy countenance and smile face child you do not assemble together for the purpose of pass a hour that perhaps might pass unpleasantly elsewhere it be for a higher and nobler purpose it be to gain useful and religious instruction from the _ bible _ the best of all book you should not be content with learn and recite you lesson but you should try to remember what you learn and when you grow up to be man and woman you will never regret it it be in the _ bible _ that we be teach to love god and all mankind when we enter the sabbath school may we learn to say to-day be the sabbath day ever bless and beautiful welcome to its holy and happy influence welcome thrice welcome the day of sweet repose and sweeter meditation

winter 's frost and more than all where love unite all heart in one great brotherhood nor separation come to break the chain the influence of sabbath school just as the twig be bent the tree 's inclined -- be a adage as true as it be ancient one 's character happiness and usefulness during he whole life depend in no small measure upon early education the child teach to disregard the sabbath and lightly to esteem the instruction of the sabbath school grow to manhood devoid of aught that can entitle he to the society and respect of the good and virtuous with a soul shroud in midnight darkness he grope he way through life and at the grave sink into oblivion by none esteem by all forget however we may hope for such a soul through the mercy of god as we surely do it be not now qualify to enter upon and fully appreciate the purity and joy of christ 's kingdom we seldom hear of the execution or imprisonment of one who regard in youth the sabbath school indeed i think it impossible for one who have be successfully teach to reverence and to love the teaching of jesus of nazareth to become a outcast from society it be true envy with its envenomed tongue and malice with its still more poisonous breath may assail even such a one but they shaft will fall harmless at he foot the shield of he soul they can not pierce they can not eradicate from the heart the influence of the high and holy lesson which it receive in youth its many source of enjoyment they can not destroy pleasant and important therefore be the duty of teacher the directing of tender affection and the development of youthful power be intrust to they hand if they perform they duty faithfully they may have the satisfaction of see the pupil of they charge useful among man devote to right and obedient unto god such a office be lovely it be more than lovely it be holy it bless he who fill it it exalt he affection ennoble he purpose and enlarge he heart do we not see the fruit of this labor in we own school in the kindness and love of the child for each other in they faithfulness in the duty of the school and in they respectful and affectionate bearing towards they teacher and all other do we not recognize some of the fruit of sabbath school culture and may we not expect that such child will be beloved honor and useful among man do we not also see some of the fruit of these influence in the fraternal regard of teacher for each other in they devotion to they duty as teacher and in they distinguishing virtue as christian have we not especially see the fruit of these influence in the enduring patience calm hopefulness and cheerful trust of one of we number whom we have just follow to she resting-place the lord make we faithful that we end may be like hers memory o memory thou wak ` ner of the dead thou only treasurer of vanish past how welcome art thou when bright hope be flee and sorrow 's mantle o'er the soul be cast back o'er those day too beautiful to last thy gentle hand will lead the saddened thought and though the tear may trickle warm and fast yet thy sweet picture with such peace be fraught the heart beguile exclaim ` this be the fount i seek ' memory who have not feel its influence who of we would wish to part with its delight and quiet teaching beautifully adapt be the twilight hour to the cherishing of the recollection of the past it be then that the hum of busy life be hushed and all nature seem rest from its toil then in undisturbed peace rise before we the loved one we have cherish and whose memory like guardian angel always attend we we recall every affectionate word and kindly deed however trivial or little heed at the time and how sweet then be we thought and we recompense if we have never cause they a unhappy moment half the bitterness of affliction be remove by such bless memory then let we make they ours let we so live that it shall be possible for we to cherish they then will they bring to we many happy hour and sweet solace to the suffering heart each moment as it flit by enter its record upon the tablet of memory to be read with joy or sorrow at some future moment then let each moment find some worthy deed to perform or kind word to be speak that shall cause a glow of pleasure and satisfaction when memory recall it all memory be not alike please yet each may have its mission to perform past sin may bring pain with its recollection it come as a warning lest we should transgress again if then we would treasure up for ourselves pleasant memory for the future we must guard well the present moment it be equally cheer to feel that we ourselves have a place in the memory of we friend what a motive it should be to we then to live in such a manner that they memory of we may be as the memory of the just which the scripture declare to be bless selfishness the selfish man wrong himself in attempt to wrong other in fill he pocket unjustly with gold he drive away joy from he soul he forget he relationship to angel and only remember he affinity to brute trouble worldly trouble be the tonic of the soul affliction at once humble we and give we a relish for spiritual food those providence which teach we the insufficiency of earth make we lean on heaven revenge revenge be the put out of one 's own eye for the sake of put out the eye of another a biographical sketch in admire the virtue and moral excellence of one who hold a high rank in society who fill a distinguished place in the state or occupy a responsible seat in the hall of science or in the church we be liable to be sway in we judgment he social position be a kind of magnify lens through which all he virtue be view but when a comparatively obscure individual from the humbler walk of life claim we attention we be better able to estimate he virtue at they true value such a one we meet with in the subject of this brief sketch miss hannah s shedd be bear in boston February 5 1826 the death of she father precede as it be by the death of she mother leave she a orphan at the age of eight year she be the second of three survive child by they father 's second marriage all of whom be leave in charge of a half sister who be the eldest of five child by a former marriage and who be all to they that a mother even could be one of the parent be a episcopalian in sentiment the other a universalist the elder child be attendant upon universalist worship in the school street church while the younger attend one of the baptist church of the city hannah the subject of we sketch continue under the influence of baptist doctrine and worship until about fifteen year of age when at she own earnest solicitation she be permit to attend the universalist church and become a member of the school street universalist Sunday school the influence upon she feeling of the change in regard to a place of worship be very marked she be naturally incline to religious meditation and reflection but be never satisfy with what she have be accustom to hear nor can she be regard as singular in this respect however true it may be that christianity be adapt in its simplicity to the susceptibility of the young -- and i believe this be eminently true -- it be equally true that the ordinary partialist interpretation of it be not thus adapt to they susceptibility the young be not satisfy with these the clearer they perception and the more comprehensive they think the greater be they dissatisfaction it be so with hannah even when but a child but when the hungering of she soul find they appropriate aliment in the ministration of the venerable hosea ballou then the sole pastor of the church to which she turn for peace the change be in the highest degree salutary she satisfaction be very great she also find great pleasure in accompany she eldest sister to the rev mr streeter 's Friday evening meeting and so highly do she prize these religious privilege that she could scarcely submit to be deprive of they for a single evening or sabbath without shed tear she natural amiability and generosity of disposition -- a generosity especially mark in she demeanor towards she eldest sister who have become a mother to she -- make the universalist interpretation of christianity to be to she indeed the bread of life not only do she seek for this spiritual nutriment in the regular ministration of the sanctuary and in the conference meeting but she turn also to the sabbath school with the same fond devotion to christian truth during the connection of the rev mr soule with the school street society he establish a bible class of which miss shedd become one of the earliest member she have often speak to the writer of this of the great profit she be conscious of have derive therefrom she be also one of the earliest member of the class form by the present junior pastor of the society rev mr miner and in the discharge of she duty in that capacity she show uncommon clearness of perception and not a little vigor of think at the age of fourteen she leave school and take up the needle that she might aid she sister in gain for the family a honorable maintenance she have be know to ply the needle with all diligence till ten o'clock at night and then turn to she Sunday school book to make preparation for the sabbath if this be a example of too severe application to toil it show at the same time a devotion to spiritual culture in the highest degree commendable strict integrity and a strong sense of justice characterize she even in she childhood a little circumstance bearing upon this point i will relate she have be to a apothecary 's shop for some medicine and on reach home find that she have receive back more change than be due of she own accord she propose to return it nor would she willingly delay for a moment the performance of so manifest a act of justice she receive from the apothecary the highest encomium and a reward for she integrity in all she transaction she show the same scrupulousness in matter of right and thus become a bright example for all child to imitate she be not less remarkable for she obedience to the wish of she sister than for she regard for justice she not only obey but obey readily and cheerfully and so sensible be that sister of she great excellence in this respect now that she have pass away that she can not speak of she but with the deepest emotion she seem to have very little power to bear disappointment she feeling be very tender and she sensibility great disappointment therefore bring the ready tear to she eye and solicitous affection if possible remove the pressure which have cause it but some of the later revelation of she life indicate rare ability to endure disappointment and to cherish hope even in the audience-chamber of death thus will it appear in the end that she heart be full of christian confidence and holy trust in the course of June 1850 it be observe by she friend that she health be manifestly decline she be advise to leave she employment at once and seek in relaxation and change of scene the reestablishment of she health and the restoration of she accustomed vigor accordingly accompany by she brother she spend some three week of the month of July in various part of maine but health do not come back to she disease be too deeply seat to be beguile away she return to she home but to languish and die when the news of she mortal illness reach the sabbath school in which she have now be a faithful and beloved teacher for about a year it produce the most intense interest and solicitude all feel that a dearly beloved sister have become the victim of the destroyer that however which be a source of unmingled grief in the begin become a sanctify power in the end when first inform that it be fear she disease would terminate fatally she betray the deepest emotion with scarcely the utterance of a word she natural sensibility make the weight upon she spirit seem insupportable but when the first shock be past and she power have have time to rally she be find equal to the trial that await she that truth which she have long loved and which have produce very little of that christian display by which the world judge have work silently but powerfully upon she understanding and she heart it have beget hope in a naturally hopeful spirit stronger than death itself when she pastor from time to time speak to she of the labor and sacrifice of christ of the love of the father and of the blessedness of immortality lead she sometimes to meditate upon the highest form of christian truth the smile of satisfaction that play upon she countenance show not only that she power be equal to the effort but that she heart be satisfy with its fruit she disease which be consumption be of a very painful character especially as regard difficulty of breathing she be compel to sit up continually almost to the hour of she death yet in the moment of expect dissolution so generous be she nature she heart be yearning for blessing on other rather than herself at one time just before she death she request she pastor to remember in he prayer a absent sister that she might recover from a critical illness and in one of he last interview with she she desire he to attend she funeral and comfort she brother and sister and especially that sister who have be a mother to she _ oh hannah have always be a good girl _ burst from the lip of that sister -- a involuntary tribute to cheerful ready obedience and true excellence of heart she have give some little memento of affection to each of the family and friend and enjoin upon she brother who still remain with the sister to be sure and be kind to they when she quietly fall asleep thus die a excellent young woman oct 2d 1850 aged 24 year and 8 month the strength of she trust and the depth of she christian experience could be see in she meek submission to suffer in that remarkable patience which allow not a word of murmur to escape she lip through the whole progress of she disease and which enable she to believe that every providence of god be order in perfect wisdom humble in she outward position she spiritual attainment be of the most exalted character the store of excellence treasured in she heart be make manifest in the hour of great trial and the christian instruction to which she be accustom to apply herself beget the holiest resignation and the most confident trust the fact that this good be in no small degree work in the sabbath school should lead the sabbath school teacher to understand the dignity and importance of he office the opportunity he enjoy for direct the affection of the young heart and the necessity of a large measure of christian attainment to qualify he for the successful discharge of so great responsibility may the example of we depart sister be sanctify to the good of all thus employ the sabbath school boy what do we go to the sabbath school for ask a little boy of he companion who be some year older than himself and who have as i discover by they conversation attend the school for a long time that be compare with the time which many child boy especially think it of any use to go to the sabbath school some boy when at the age of twelve or fourteen year think they be too old to receive any benefit from sabbath school instruction hear the question of this little boy and observe the look of intelligence and sincerity in he companion and be desirous of know what answer would be give i remain within hearing of they conversation and will try to present to the scholar in we school through the medium of we gift the good reason which he give to he little companion -lrb- who be he younger brother -rrb- why he go to the sabbath school _ eld b _ i go because i like to go and i like to go because i always enjoy myself there better than i do anywhere else i find pleasure in the singing in the prayer and in the lesson the lesson be not hard to learn when i understand they and the learning of they be even a pleasant task for my teacher have a way of make we lesson interesting to we in hear we recite he ask we question about the subject of the lesson before use the book and he generally find some interesting matter relate to it and we become so much engage that the time be go before we be aware of it and we have to stop and wait for the next session of the school _ young b _ i like the school too though i have be only twice how old be you when you first go to the sabbath school brother _ eld b _ i be seven year old and i be now fourteen and i mean to continue till i be able to take a class myself i want to have the pleasure of be a teacher in we school and i hope soon to do so for the school be increase very fast in number there be a good many small child come into the school and i think that i shall be want for i observe that there be not male teacher enough sometimes one teacher have to attend to two or more class and the time of a session in the school be not sufficient to do this with much advantage what do you learn in twice go to the school tell I that and then we shall know at least what you go to the sabbath school for _ young b _ i will tell you after i have say a short lesson my teacher give I a little piece call the child 's first hymn which she say she find in a paper publish in england it be publish for the child of the sabbath school of old england she say it would do for we the child of new england and wish I to learn it _ eld b _ well brother i be sure you have improve the few time that you have attend the school have you learn the hymn and how do you like it let I hear you repeat it i should like to know what the child be teach in the sabbath school of old england will you please to repeat it to I _ young b _ i will i do as well as i could i have learn the hymn and be much pleased with it i think of it the last thing when i fall asleep at night and awake in the morning with it on my mind but i will repeat it to you and you will see that i have not be to the sabbath school though for so short a time for nothing _ the child 's first hymn _ listen father to my prayer guard I with thy tender care teach a humble child to know the path of duty here below set a watch upon my heart lest a evil thought should start make I gentle kind and good through the savior 's cleanse blood all i have and all i see ever come great god from thee help I from my earliest day in thankful hymn to sing thy praise bless my parent with thy grace on my kindred turn thy face through the darkness of the night give I rest till morning bright teach I day by day thy will with pure love my spirit fill till i be fit for that rest in the mansion of the blest _ eld b _ it be indeed a very pretty hymn and i be glad you have learn it so well i hope you will never forget it here come my teacher and as it will be ten minute before the school commence we shall have time for conversation here the teacher draw near and speak to the boy : -- _ teach _ good morning my boy how do you do this fine morning _ eld b _ good morning sir we be well i thank you _ teach _ you be in good season this morning and i be glad to see that you be it be so much better to be before we time than to be a little late we get along so much better with the business of the school and have time to converse together besides to be in school at the opening of the exercise show that you value and wish to improve its privilege _ eld b _ we be talk about the school and why we go there i tell my brother that i go because i like to go will you please to tell we the advantage of attendance on the sabbath school _ teach _ i will my dear boy so far as i can it be well to know what we be do how we be accomplish we work and what be to be the result of we labor _ eld b _ i be very often ask what i learn at the sabbath school and i sometimes answer that i learn what there be in the bible and that my lesson be subject derive principally from that book _ teach _ you answer rightly so far you might add also that you learn by the example of other do you see punctuality you will learn to be punctual do you see system in the arrangement of the school in the method of instruction in the library department and in the general discipline of the school you will be orderly and correct in you deportment _ eld b _ as i be almost old enough to be a teacher and desire to take a class as soon as i be wanted i should like to know the best way to make my scholar interested in they study so that they will attend and be correct with they lesson _ teach _ it be often the case that child feel no interest or pleasure in the school because they do not understand its object they may recite well so far as to repeat the word of the lesson yet if it be above they capacity they will not be benefit _ eld b _ this have be the case with I sometimes after i have recite my lesson correctly by the book i have feel that i do not know much about it and do not understand what i have learn to repeat _ teach _ it be of great importance in teaching that the subject should be present to the pupil in the simplest form possible that he may be profit by he instruction i read a anecdote the other day which illustrate this matter and i will repeat it to you it be related of dr green of philadelphium that in early life he be one day return from the service of the sanctuary and be accost by a woman in the humble walk of life she find difficulty in understand he and take the liberty of give she youthful pastor a hint ` mr green ' say she ` what do you think be the great duty of the shepherd ' ` no doubt to feed the flock madam ' be the reply ` that be my notion too ' she add ` and therefore i think he should not hold the hay so high that the sheep can not reach it ' this admonition be kindly receive in the spirit in which it be give and have a influence in make he afterwards ` hold the hay lower ' this fact should cause you to see to it as the old lady do with she pastor that you teacher present they instruction in such a form that you will understand they the hay may be of very good quality but it will give no nourishment to the hungry sheep if it be beyond they reach it will not benefit they any more than if it be not provide at all so with you lesson if you do not feel a interest in they if they be beyond you reach they may be of no benefit to you no lasting principle be gain but the whole may be lose as the word of the lesson be lose to memory and forget _ eld b _ what be the result of attendance on the sabbath school _ teach _ that question we answer partly in faith and partly by knowledge faith be good -- and we know that we school be a good school we know that we enjoy ourselves there and we know what be learn there be good it be there that divine influence and joyful communion fill with gladness the hour we enjoy they and if we could say no more we think that this would be sufficient _ eld b _ that be true _ teach _ but that be not all the result go still further they be not confine to the hour pass in the schoolroom the scholar be better and happier for have be there be it not so with you _ eld b _ yes sir i always feel better when i have be to the school when i have say my lesson converse upon the subject of it and obtain my library book i be always glad to have be there _ teach _ you answer be full of hope and promise for if you now find you enjoyment in learn the thing of the kingdom of god those evil day will never come to you when you will say you have no pleasure in they the sabbath school scholar who be prompt in he duty be in a safe path -- one which while afford happiness by the way result in the fulness of joy to he the example of christ be a example of love and goodness draw he to the father by these divine influence and attraction he see god not only as the creator but as he be manifest in the world by he providence which show we that he not only _ make _ the world but that he _ make _ the world that he be the same in the creation of the flower and stream as in the creation of storm and tempest that he be not far off but near ever blessing we with the favor of he parental providence that he power be over everything that motion be he power for there can be no motion without mind that god be present in the child it can not live by bread alone communion must be hold with god -- spirit with spirit it be record of we savior that he be lead into the water and be bury in baptism the spirit descend upon he he hear the encouragement of that voice which proclaim he sonship to the most high and in the enjoyment of that holy time he come up from the river then come the tempter in the strength of the spirit of the baptism he resist the temptation and be victorious over all its form so with the object and mission of we sabbath school you be lead to the river of divine truth that you may be baptize in its pure water you be there show the father and we trust that when you go out into the world you will in the strength of you sabbath school baptism resist and overcome all temptation to wrong and be always engage for the right and living in the light of the gospel you will pass through life undefined thus may a christian character be the result of you attendance on the sabbath school fear of death he who rightly understand life will not fear death he who have learn to trust will never cease to hope he who always cherish a love of right will never be without god in the world treasure -- knowledge and virtue be the greatest treasure in the universe gratitude -- every faithful sabbath school teacher have the unfailing gratitude of he class faith be the eye with which the mind survey the future ill temper it be the season of vacation when child 's mind be give to play instead of study it be during this interval that a little girl whom we will call jane come from a neighboring town to visit one of she school-mate another little girl whose name we will call emily the disposition of emily be very different from that of jane she be always pleasant and kind willing to confer favor upon other even though she should not receive the same in return jane be ill-tempered tell wrong story and do many thing which render she a very disagreeable companion she parent could see no fault in she therefore she be permit to give way to she temper which be the cause of she losing friend and gain enemy when she be in these violent fit of passion she would accuse she companion of thing which would wind they feeling very much during vacation emily accept a invitation which have be give she to spend a few day with jane she enjoy herself very much while there and invite jane to come and see she soon after jane go to visit emily the first part of the time she enjoy very much but as she visit be draw to a close she give way to a violent fit of temper she take this opportunity to relate to emily many thing she parent say about she after she have leave they she tell she that if she know what she father and mother say about she she would never visit they again whether they do talk about she or whether it be jane 's ugly temper that lead she to taunt emily i do not know but it cause emily to feel very much grieve because she be not conscious of have do anything which would cause they to talk about she emily have never visit jane since nor have she desire to she think that those who treat she well when she be present and talk about she when she be absent can not be she true friend thus we see that those who govern they temper and endeavor to make themselves pleasant and agreeable be much more loved and respect than those who give way to this wicked passion reading in my experience both as teacher and scholar i have observe among the young those who read a great many book but at the end appear but little wiser they may have a confused and indistinct recollection of event and character and may be able perhaps to follow out the plan of a story out of the mass that they have read they may have retain a great many fact but be without connection or object they be nearly useless bad habit be form they reading be to no purpose and they time therefore misspend i fear there be too few among those whose year should enable they to understand and appreciate the object for which we live that do appreciate they there be too many who suppose that reading be only a very pleasant amusement they think of printing as a very ingenious invention and have no thought higher they may look about and see a great deal of misery and unhappiness but its alleviation be nothing to they the great mission of life be something that be very well to be talk of in the pulpit and minister and reformer will accomplish it no doubt but life have no responsibility for they one of we first duty be to seek we own moral and intellectual culture let both these portion of we nature be cultivate together do not separate they for by so do both be threaten with danger heart without mind be generally weak but mind without heart be always dangerous do not suppose because you have leave the schoolroom and no longer have lesson set and be no longer reprimand if they be not commit that you education be finish rather regard the _ school _ as the place where you shall learn to study life as you term-time and consider you education finish when there be nothing more for you to learn it be not necessary that study should be confine to book accustom yourself to study action and they influence and effect public lecture conversation in short every event of you life will present question and you own mind with a little reflection will present the answer if it do not do not let the fear of ridicule prevent you ask but it be through book chiefly that we be to look for improvement every person should appropriate some part of each day to read young person should early be teach the advantage of a method for appropriate they time let each duty have its time in this way much time be save let the time you appropriate to read be one that will be the least liable to interruption defer it not if it can be avoid till late in the evening when you be wearied with the fatigue of the day at the present day when book be so easily obtain there be no need of the excuse of inability to procure they circulate library be easy of access -- though caution should be use in select from they -- and each sabbath school have a library open for all there have be much say and much write about book of fiction whether they may be read with safety by the young fiction as such need not be condemn though work of fiction should be sparingly read but if read at all let they be select by person of experience there be much in the current fiction of the day that be pernicious and unfit for publication but if we set aside the light reading there be standard work enough to furnish reading for one generation the better newspaper of the day should be carefully read the newspaper of this week be the history of the world for this week in each particular branch of literature there be book without number not only worthy of perusal but deserving of careful study in history we have rollin hume smollet prescott macaulay and robertson philosophy theology and science each in its turn bring name as illustrious but there be one book above all other never complain for want of reading while we have such historian as mose poet before whom shakspeare dwindle into insignificance philosopher of a higher and holier school and truth that exceed the most astonishing fiction where have scott a heroine that can compare with ruth grand as be the beauty of the bible life-giving as be its wisdom and imperishable as be its truth it be too frequently leave unread as a general thing too much be read more than can be well retain one page well read be more beneficial than a whole volume merely glance over never read the second line until the first be fully understand make the author 's sentiment you own in read history it be highly important you should have a clear idea of the locality where the event occur i have find by experience that the best method deeply to impress what i have read be to have at hand write material and after each reading write out as fully as possible whatever new idea have be present but in all that you read keep in view the great object of you reading -- _ self improvement _ a sabbath school excursion the morning break a hundred voice rise in shout of gladness echo to the sky the happy time draw near the day be fair to festive scene and rural joy

nature 's sweet how blest the change to breathe the scented air steal for the moment every sense of care its healing power to all new life impart expand the mind and elevate the heart but now arrive at the appoint place -- a rural spot adorn with every grace which nature from she bounty could bestow to make the world a paradise below -- we party pause a moment to reflect then towards a path they several step direct which lead the way to some sequestered seat secure by foliage from the noonday heat or to the various sport they taste incline where art and nature toil and skill combine to give to all a welcome warm and kind that every weary heart sweet rest may find here a few friend in social cheer be meet discourse topic which such scene beget and there a crowd intent on sport more gay in lively measure tread the hour away some roam in group through field and meadow green and laden with the fragrant spoil be see bedeck with crown from flora 's own fair hand a radiant company from fairy-land apart from this another group behold a burden sweet they little arm unfold -- lily fit emblem when by childhood twine of purity and innocence combined but hark what sound be peal through the air a summons from they sport to join in prayer come one and all you voice mingle here to bless he presence who be ever near from east and west they come from south and north from every path and thicket issue forth till all together seat once again the song of worship and of praise begin up to the throne of heaven they prayer ascend together rich and poor they voice blend while with they song unite the feathered choir with gratitude each spirit to inspire till hill and valley echo all around and god 's first temple with he praise resound and look for now again the scene be change a group before that rustic altar range with bend knee the throne of grace implore on infant head its shower of love to pour that infant tongue may lisp the praise of god to guide they foot in path by jesus trod sure angel hallow scene like this below and holy spirit at that altar bow like winged messenger from heaven to bear these offering and ever guard they there that every bud of promise rear below may bloom in heaven and to perfection grow but fast in scene like this the day be spend again toward home they weary step be bent weary with pleasure they reluctant go once more the toil and care of earth to know : but purify and strengthen for the strife of labor and the busy scene of life while the remembrance of those happy hour shall deck the barren path of toil with flower and pray each that as the year roll on laden with pleasure soon forever go each year shall bring but add virtue forth and leave behind the impress of they worth till every heart to innocence be tune nor sinful pleasure ever dare intrude to mar the image god have make and bless with means of pleasure happiness and rest that all may find in holy joy and pure relief from care for every sorrow cure and live to be in holy pleasure bless till earthly toil be change for heavenly rest christ and duty it be profitable for we to meditate on such a character as christ 's if by dwelling upon it we become even in one respect like he the more we know of he the more we shall love he for he character be love we should imitate the example of mary who be first at the door of the sepulchre where jesus be lay she have great love for he and she faith in he be as strong as she love she be not a stranger to the miracle which he perform while here on earth she have see he and she know that in he perfection dwelt so we should try to be first in do any act of kindness or benevolence not in a spirit of unholy emulation but from a love of do good by cultivate this spirit we shall be happy in life and prepare for death we shall be far happier than those who seek worldly honor and more than all we shall leave a name behind we more precious than fame or wealth can bestow when i be young as be many of you to whom i be now speak i have not the privilege of worship god as we now do i be teach that a greater part of the human family will be destroy and will have no part in the heavenly kingdom but thanks be to god that he have now open the eye of many to see he a father to the fatherless and a sure help in time of need when such thought take possession of the heart we view he in he true character in order to serve he as we ought we should commence in youth christ say they that seek I early shall find I the whole life be short if happily spend in he service we have every encouragement to trust wholly in he kind care and keep for he watchful eye be ever over we if you seek christ in youth nothing will be lose but much will be gain when i look back upon the early day of my life i regard they as lose to the true service of christ it be impress upon my young mind that god be fill with anger and wrath and still i be tell that i must love he with my whole heart i be sorry to say it but i fear i have no true love for he at that time if the path in which i have walk have be desolate and dreary i do not desire that other should walk in it if god be see in he true loveliness the young as well as the old will love he holy name in this regard i think much good can be do in the sabbath school and many profitable and lasting impression may be make upon the young mind i can not think we meet together every sabbath in vain the blessing of god will surely rest upon we and we shall be profit by we assembling we must not be forgetful of god for he be not forgetful of we when we lie down on we pillow at night we ought not to close we eye to sleep without thank he for he kind care of we through the day and in the morning we should thank he for he watchful care through the night in time of sorrow and trouble we at once fly to he this be right but still it be we duty and privilege to call on he in time of prosperity as well as in time of adversity never forget to seek he divine blessing without this we can not enjoy life or be prepare for death and when the day on earth be all pass and we be call to lay ourselves on the bed of death if we can but look back upon a life well spend it will smooth the pillow of pain and make even death itself sweet salvation be the right direction of all one 's power and activity hope be the sunshine of the soul end of the project gutenberg ebook of we
