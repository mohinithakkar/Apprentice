borderer at twenty-three he fight gallantly at the siege of bergen-op-zoom four year later -lrb- 1751 -rrb- he be a lieutenant in the grenadier guard he be one of those quiet man whose sterling value be appreciate only by the few till some crisis make it stand forth before the world at large pitt wolfe and george ii all recognize he solid virtue at thirty he be still some way down the list of lieutenant in the grenadier while wolfe two year he junior in age have be four year in command of a battalion with the rank of lieutenant-colonel yet he have long be ` my friend carleton ' to wolfe he be soon to become one of ` pitt 's young man ' and he be enough of a ` coming man ' to incur the king 's displeasure he have criticize the hanoverian and the king never forgive he the third george ` glory in the name of englishman ' but the first two be hanoverian all through and for a english guardsman to disparage the hanoverian army be consider next door to _ lese-majeste _ lady dorchester burn all she husband 's private papers after he death in 1808 so we have lose some of the most intimate record concern he but ` grave carleton ' appear so frequently in the letter of he friend wolfe that we can see he character as a young man in almost any aspect short of self-revelation the first reference have nothing to do with affair of state in 1747 wolfe aged twenty write to miss lacey a english girl in brussels and sign himself ` most sincerely you friend and admirer ' say : ' i be do the greatest injustice to the dear girl to admit the least doubt of they constancy perhaps with respect to ourselves there may be cause of complaint carleton i be afraid be a recent example of it ' from this we may infer that carleton be less ` grave ' as a young man than wolfe find he later on six year afterwards wolfe strongly recommend he for a position which he have himself be ask to fill that of military tutor to the young duke of richmond who be to get a company in wolfe 's own regiment write home from pari in 1753 wolfe tell he mother that the duke ` want some skilful man to travel with he through the low country and into lorraine i have propose my friend carleton whom lord albemarle approve of ' lord albemarle be the british ambassador to france so carleton get the post and travel under the happiest auspices while learn the frontier on which the belgian french and british ally be to fight the german in the great world war of 1914 it be during this military tour of fortify place that carleton acquire the engineering skill which a few year later prove of such service to the british cause in canada in 1754 george washington at that time a young virginian officer of only twenty-two fire the first shot in what presently become the world-wide seven year ' war the immediate result be disastrous to the british arm and washington have to give up the command of the ohio by surrender fort necessity to the french on -- of all date -- the 4th of July in 1755 come braddock 's defeat in 1756 montcalm arrive in canada and win he first victory at oswego in 1757 wolfe distinguish himself by formulate the plan which if properly execute would have prevent the british fiasco at rochefort on the coast of france but carleton remain as undistinguished as before he simply become lieutenant-colonel command the 72nd foot now the seaforth highlander in 1758 he chance appear to have come at last amherst have ask for he service at louisbourg but the king have neither forget nor forgive the remark about the hanoverian and so refuse point-blank to wolfe 's ` very great grief and disappointment it be a public loss carleton 's not go ' wolfe 's confidence in carleton either as a friend or as a officer be stronger than ever write to george warde afterwards the famous cavalry leader he say : ` accident may happen in the family that may throw my little affair into disorder carleton be so good as to say he will give what help be in he power may i ask the same favor of you my oldest friend ' write to lord george sackville of whom we shall hear more than enough at the crisis of carleton 's career wolfe say : ` amherst will tell you he opinion of carleton by which you will probably be better convinced of we loss ' again ` we want grave carleton for every purpose of the war ' and yet again after the fall of louisbourg : ` if he majesty have think proper to let carleton come with we as engineer it would have cut the matter much shorter and we might now be ruin the wall of quebec and complete the conquest of new france ' a little later on wolfe blaze out with indignation over carleton 's supersession by a junior ` can sir john ligonier -lrb- the commander-in-chief -rrb- allow he majesty to remain unacquainted with the merit of that officer and can he see such a mark of displeasure without endeavor to soften or clear the matter up a little a man of honor have the right to expect the protection of he colonel and of the commander of the troops and he can not serve without it if i be in carleton 's place i would not stay a hour in the army after be aim at and distinguish in so remarkable a manner ' but carleton bide he time at the beginning of 1759 wolfe be appoint to command the army destine to besiege quebec he immediately submit carleton 's name for appointment as quartermaster-general pitt and ligonier heartily approve but the king again refuse ligonier go back a second time to no purpose pitt then send he in for the third time say in a tone mean for the king to overhear : ` tell he majesty that in order to render the general -lrb- wolfe -rrb- completely responsible for he conduct he should be make as far as possible inexcusable if he should fail and that whatever a officer entrust with such a service of confidence request ought therefore to be grant ' the king then consent thus begin carleton 's long devoted and successful service for canada the empire and the crown early in this memorable empire year of 1759 he sail with wolfe and saunder from spithead on the 30th of April the fleet rendezvous at halifax where admiral durell second-in-command to saunder have spend the winter with a squadron intend to block the st lawrence directly navigation open in the spring durell be a good commonplace officer but very slow he have lose many hand from sickness during a particularly cold season and he be not enterprising enough to start cruise round cabot strait before the month of may saunder greatly annoy by this delay send he off with eight man-of-war on the 5th of may wolfe give he seven hundred soldier under carleton these force be sufficient to turn back capture or destroy the twenty-three french merchantman which be then bind for quebec with supplies and soldier as reinforcement for montcalm but the french ship be a week ahead of durell and when he land carleton at isle-aux-coudre on the 28th of may the last of the enemy 's transport have already discharge she cargo at quebec sixty mile above isle-aux-coudre so name by jacque cartier in 1535 be a point of great strategic importance for it command the only channel then use it be the place wolfe have choose for he winter quarter that be in case of failure before quebec and suppose he be not recall none but a particularly good officer would have be appoint as its first commandant carleton spend many busy day here prepare a advanced base for the come siege while the subsequently famous captain cook be equally busy ` a-sounding of the channell of the traverse ' which the fleet would have to pass on its way to quebec some of durell 's ship destroy the french ` long-shore battery near this traverse at the lower end of the island of orlean while the rest keep ceaseless watch to seaward anxiously scan the offing day after day to make out the color of the first fleet up no one know what the french west indium fleet would do and there be a very disconcerting chance that it might run north and slip into the st lawrence ahead of saunder in the same way as the french reinforcement have just slip in ahead of durell presently at the first streak of dawn on the 23rd of June a strong squadron be see advance rapidly under a press of sail instantly the officer of the watch call all hand up from below the boatswain ' whistle shrill across the water as the seaman run to quarter and clear the deck for action carleton 's camp be equally astir the guard turn out the bugle sound the man fall in and wait then the flag-ship signal ashore that the stranger have just answer correctly in private code that all be well and that wolfe and saunder be aboard next to wolfe himself carleton be the busiest man in the army throughout the siege of quebec in addition to he arduous and very responsible duty as quartermaster-general he act as inspector of engineer and as a special-service officer for work of a exceptionally confidential nature as quartermaster-general he superintend the supply and transport branch consider that the army be operate in a devastate hostile country a thousand mile away from its basis at halifax and louisbourg and that the interaction of the different service -- naval and military imperial and colonial -- require adjustment to a nicety at every turn it be wonderful that so much be do so well with means which be far from be adequate war price of course rule in the british camp but they compare very favourably with the famine price in quebec where most ` luxury ' soon become unobtainable at any price there be no canteen or camp-follower scandal under carleton then as now every soldier have a regulation ration of food and a regulation allowance for he service kit but ` extra ' be always acceptable the price-list of these ` extra ' read strangely to modern ear but under the circumstance it be not exorbitant and it be slightly temper by be reckon in halifax currency of four dollar to the pound instead of five the british tommy atkin of that and many a later day think canada a wonderful country for make money go a long way when he could buy a pot of beer for twopence and get back thirteen penny halifax currency as change for he english shilling beef and ham run from ninepence to a shill a pound mutton be a little dearer salt butter be eightpence to one-and-threepence cheese be tenpence potato from five to ten shilling a bushel ' a reasonable loaf of good soft bread ' cost sixpence soap be a shill a pound tea be prohibitive for all but the officer ` plain green tea and very badd ' be fifteen shilling ` couchon ' twenty shilling ` hyson ' thirty leaf tobacco be tenpence a pound roll one-and-tenpence snuff two-and-threepence sugar be a shilling to eighteen penny lemon be sixpence apiece the non-intoxicating ` bad sproo beer ' be only twopence a quart and help to keep off scurvy real beer like wine and spirit be more expensive ` bristol beer ' be eighteen shilling a dozen ` bad malt drink from hellifax ' ninepence a quart rum and claret be eight shilling a gallon each port and madeira ten and twelve respectively the term ` bad ' do not then mean noxious but only inferior it stand against every low-grade article in the price-list no goods be over-classified while carleton be quartermaster-general the engineer be under-staffed under-manned and overworked there be no royal engineer as a permanent and comprehensive corps till the time of wellington wolfe complain bitterly and often of the lack of man and material for scientific siege work but he ` rely on carleton ' to good purpose in this respect as well as in many other in he celebrated dispatch to pitt he mention carleton twice it be carleton whom he send to seize the west end of the island of orlean so as to command the basin of quebec and carleton whom he send to take prisoner and gather information at pointe-aux-tremble twenty mile above the city whether or not he reveal the whole of he final plan to carleton be probably more than we shall ever know since carleton 's papers be destroy but we do know that he do not reveal it to any one else not even to he three brigadier monckton townshend and murray carleton be wound in the head during the battle of the plain but soon return to duty wolfe show he confidence in he to the last carleton 's be the only name mention twice in the will which wolfe hand over to jervi the future lord st vincent the night before the battle ' i leave to colonel oughton colonel carleton colonel howe and colonel warde a thousand pound each ' ` all my book and papers both here and in england i leave to colonel carleton ' wolfe 's mother who die five year later show the same confidence by appoint carleton she executor with the fall of quebec in 1759 carleton disappear from the canadian scene till 1766 but so many pregnant event happen in canada during these seven year while so few happen in he own career that it be much more important for we to follow she history than he biography in 1761 he be wound at the storm of port andro during the attack on belle isle off the west coast of france in 1762 he be wound at havana in the west indy after that he enjoy four year of quietness at home then come the exceedingly difficult task of guide canada through twelve year of turbulent politics and most subversive war chapter ii general murray 1759-1766 both army spend a terrible winter after the battle of the plain there be better shelter for the french in montreal than for the british among the ruin of quebec but in the matter of food the position be reverse nevertheless the french gallantly refuse the truce offer they by murray who have now succeed wolfe they be determine to make a supreme effort to regain quebec in the spring and they be equally determine that the habitant should not be free to supply the british with provision in spite of the state of war however the french and british officer even as prisoner and captor begin to make friend they have find each other foeman worthy of they steel a distinguished french officer the comte de malartic write to levi montcalm 's successor say : ' i can not speak too highly of general murray although he be we enemy ' murray on he part be equally loud and generous in he praise of the french the canadian seigneur find fellow-gentleman among the british officer the priest and nun of quebec find many fellow-catholic among the scottish and irish troops and nothing but courteous treatment from the soldier of every rank and form of religion murray direct that ` the compliment of the hat ' should be pay to all religious procession the ursuline nun knit long stocking for the bare-legged highlander when the winter come on and present each scottish officer with a embroidered st andrew 's cross on the 30th of November st andrew 's day the whole garrison win the regard of the town by give up part of they ration for the hungry poor while the habitant from the surrounding country presently begin to find out that the british be honest to deal with and most humane though sternly just as conqueror in the follow April levi make he desperate throw for victory and actually do succeed in defeat murray outside the wall of quebec but the british fleet come up in may and that summer three british army converge on montreal where the last doomed remnant of french power on the st lawrence stand despairingly at bay when levi find he two thousand effective french regular surround by eight time as many british troops he have no choice but to lay down the arm of france for ever on the 8th of September 1760 he gallant little army be include in the capitulation of montreal by which the whole of canada pass into the possession of the british crown great britain have a different general idea for each one of the four decade which immediately follow the conquest of canada in the sixty the general idea be to kill refractory old french way with a double dose of new british liberty and kindness so that canada might gradually become the loyal fourteenth colony of the empire in america but the fate be against this benevolent scheme the french canadian be firmly wed to they old way of life except in so far as the new liberty enable they to throw off irksome duty and restraint while the new english-speaking ` colonist ' be so few and mostly so bad that they become the cause of endless discord where harmony be essential in the seventy the idea be to restore the old french-canadian life so as not only to make canada proof against the disaffection of the thirteen colony but also to make she a safe base of operation against rebellious american in the eighty the great concern of the government be to make a harmonious whole out of two very widely differ part -- the long-settled french canadian and the newly arrive unite empire loyalist in the ninety each of these part be set to work out its own salvation under its own provincial constitution carleton 's be the only personality which link together all four decade -- the would-be american sixty the french-canadian seventy the anglo-french-canadian eighty and the bi-constitutional ninety -- though as mention already murray rule canada for the first seven year 1759-66 jame murray the first british governor of canada be a younger son of the fourth lord elibank he be just over forty warm-hearted and warm-temper a excellent french scholar and every inch a soldier he have be a witness for the defense of mordaunt at the court-martial hold to try the author of the rochefort fiasco in 1757 wolfe who be a witness on the other side refer to he later on as ` my old antagonist murray ' but wolfe know a good man when he see one and give he full confidence to he ` old antagonist ' both at louisbourg and quebec murray be not bear under a lucky star he see three defeat in three successive war he begin he service with the abortive attack on pestilential cartagena where wolfe 's father be present as adjutant-general in mid-career he lose the battle of ste foy -lrb- footnote : see _ the winning of canada _ chap viii see also for the best account of this battle and other event of the year between wolfe 's victory and the surrender of montreal _ the fall of canada _ by george m wrong oxford 1914 -rrb- and he active military life end with he surrender of minorca in 1782 but he be greatly distinguish for honor and steadfastness on all occasion a admiring contemporary describe he as a model of all the military virtue except prudence but he have more prudence and less genius than he admirer thought and he show a marked talent for general government the problem before he be harder than he superior could believe he be expect to prepare for assimilation some sixty-five thousand ` new subject ' who be mostly alien in religion and wholly alien in every other way but for the moment this prove the least of he many difficulty because no immediate result be require while the war go on in europe canada remain nominally a part of the enemy 's dominion and so of course be subject to military rule sir jeffery amherst the british commander-in-chief in america take up he headquarters in new york under he murray command canada from quebec under murray colonel burton command the district of three river while general gage command the district of montreal which then extend to the western wild -lrb- footnote : see _ the war chief of the ottawa _ chap iii -rrb- murray 's first great trouble arise in 1761 it be cause by a outrageous war office order that fourpence a day should be stop from the soldier to pay for the ration they have always get free such gross injustice come in time of war and apply to soldier who richly deserve reward make the veteran ` mad with rage ' quebec promise to be the scene of a wild mutiny murray like all he officer think the stoppage nothing short of robbery but he throw himself into the breach he assemble the officer and explain that they must die to the last man rather than allow the mutineer a free hand he then hold a general parade at which he order the troops to march between two flag-pole on pain of instant death promise to kill with he own hand the first man who refuse he add that he be ready to hear and forward any well-founded complaint but that since insubordination have be openly threaten he would insist on subordination be publicly show then amid tense silence he give the word of command -- _ quick march _ -- while every officer feel he trigger to the immense relief of all concern the man step off march straight between the flag and back to quarter tame the criminal war office blunder be rectify and peace be restore in the rank ` murray 's report ' of 1762 give we a good view of the canada of that day and show the attitude of the british towards they new possession canada have be conquer by great britain with some help from the american colony for three main reason : first to strike a death-blow at french dominion in america secondly to increase the opportunity of british seaborne trade and thirdly to enlarge the area available for british settlement when murray be instruct to prepare a report on canada he have to keep all this in mind for the government wish to satisfy the public both at home and in the colony he have to examine the military strength of the country and the disposition of its population in case of future war with france he have to satisfy the natural curiosity of man like the london merchant and he have to show how and where english-speaking settler could go in and make canada not only a british possession but the fourteenth british colony in north america burton and gage be also instruct to report about they own district of three river and montreal the document they prepare be tack on to murray 's by June 1762 the work be complete and send on to amherst who send it to england in ample time to be study there before the opening of the impending negotiation for peace murray be greatly concern about the military strength of quebec then as always the key of canada like the unfortunate montcalm he find the wall of quebec badly build badly place and fall into ruin and he think they could not be defend by three thousand man against ' a well conduct _ coup-de-main _ ' he propose to crown cape diamond with a proper citadel which would overawe the disaffected in quebec itself and defend the place against a outside enemy long enough to let a british fleet come up to its relief the rest of the country be defend by little garrison at three river and montreal as well as by several small detachment distribute among the trading-post where the white man and the red meet in the depths of the western wilderness the relation between the british garrison and the french canadian be so excellent that what gage report from montreal might be take as equally true of the rest of the country : ` the soldier live peaceably with the inhabitant and they reciprocally acquire a affection for each other ' the french canadian number sixty-five thousand altogether exclusive of the fur trader and coureurs de bois barely fifteen thousand live in the three little town of quebec montreal and three river while over fifty thousand live in the country nearly all the official have go back to france the three class of greatest importance be the seigneur the clergy and the habitant the lawyer be not of much account the petty commercial class of less account still the coureurs de bois and other fur trader form a important link between the savage and the civilized life of the country apart from fur the trade of canada be contemptibly small in the eye of man like the london merchant but the opportunity of foster all the fur trade that could be carry down the st lawrence be very well worth while and if there be no other exist trade worth capture there seem to be some kind worth create murray hold out well-grounded hope of the fishery and forest ' a most immense cod fishery can be establish in the river and gulph of st lawrence a rich tract of country on the south side of the gulph will be settle and improve and a port or port furnish with every material requisite to repair ship ' he then go on to enumerate the other kind of fishery the abundance of whale seal and walrus in the gulf and of salmon up all the tributary river burton recommend immediate attention to the iron mine behind three river all the governor expatiate on the vast amount of forest wealth and remind the home government that under the french regime the king when make out patent for the seigneur reserve the right of take wood for ship-building and fortification from any of the seigneury agriculture be find to be in a very backward state the habitant would raise no more than they require for they own use and for a little local trade but the fault be attribute to the gambling attraction of the fur trade to the bad governmental system and to the frequent interruption of the _ corvee _ a kind of force labor which be mean to serve the public interest but which bigot and other thievish official always turn to they own private advantage on the whole the report be most encouraging in the prospects they hold out to honest labor trade and government while murray and he lieutenant have be collect information for they report the home government have be undergo many change for the worse the master-statesman pitt have go out of power and the back-stairs politician bute have come in pitt 's ` bloody and expensive war ' -- the war that more than any other lay the foundation of the present british empire -- be to be end on any term the country could be persuade to bear thus the end of the seven year ' war or as the british part of it be more correctly call the ` maritime war ' be no more glorious in statesmanship than its beginning have be in arm but the spirit of its mighty heart still live on in the empire 's grateful memory of pitt and quicken the english-speaking world enough to prevent any really disgraceful surrender of the hard-won fruit of victory the treaty of pari sign on the 10th of February 1763 and the king 's proclamation publish in October be duly follow by the inauguration of civil government in canada the incompetent bute anxious to get pitt out of the way try to induce he to become the first british governor of the new colony even bute probably never dare to hope that pitt would actually go out to canada but he do hope to lower he prestige by make he the holder of a sinecure at home however this may be pitt mightiest of all parliamentary minister of war refuse to be make either a jobber or a exile whereupon murray 's position be change from a military command into that of ` governor and captain-general ' the change which ensue in the law of canada be heartily welcome so far as the adoption of the humaner criminal code of england be concern the new law relate to debtor and creditor also give general satisfaction except as we shall presently see when they involve imprisonment for debt but the tentative effort to introduce english civil law side by side with the old french code result in great confusion and much discontent the land law have become so unworkable under this dual system that they have to be leave as they be a court of common plea be set up specially for the benefit of the french canadian if either party demand a jury one have to be swear in and french canadian be to be juror on equal term with ` the king 's old subject ' the roman catholic church be to be completely tolerate but not in any way establish lord egremont in give the king 's instruction to murray remind he that the proviso in the treaty of paris -- _ as far as the law of great britain permit _ -- should govern he action whenever dispute arise it must be remember that the last jacobite rise be then a comparatively recent affair and that france be equally ready to upset either the protestant succession in england or the british regime in canada the indian be also a object of special solicitude in the royal proclamation ` the indian who live under we protection should not be molest in the possession of such part of we dominion and territory as not have be cede to or purchase by we be reserve to they ' the home government be far in advance of the american colonist in its humane attitude towards the indian the common american attitude then and long afterwards -- indeed up to a time well within live memory -- be that indian be a kind of human vermin to be exterminate without mercy unless of course more money be to be make out of they alive the result be a endless struggle along the ever-receding frontier of the west and just at this particular time the ` conspiracy of pontiac ' have bring about something like a real war the story of this great effort of the indian to stem the encroachment of the exterminate colonist be tell in another chronicle of the present series -lrb- footnote : the war chief of the ottawa -rrb- the french trader in the west undoubtedly have a hand in stir up the indian pontiac a sort of indian napoleon be undoubtedly cruel as well as crafty and the indian undoubtedly fight just as the ancestor of the french and british use to fight when they be at the corresponding stage of social evolution but the mere fact that so many jealously distinct tribe unite in this common cause prove how much they all must have suffer at the hand of the colonist while pontiac 's war continue in the west murray have to deal with a political war in canada which rise to its height in 1764 the king 's proclamation of the previous October have ` give express power to we governor that so soon as the state and circumstance of the say colony will admit thereof he shall call a general assembly in such manner and form as be use in those colony and province in america which be under we immediate government ' the intention of establish parliamentary institution be therefore perfectly clear but it be equally clear that the introduction of such institution be to depend on ` circumstance ' and it be well to remember here that these ` circumstance ' be not hold to warrant the opening of a canadian parliament till 1792 now the military government have be a great success there be every reason to suppose that civil government by a governor and council would be the next best thing and it be quite certain that call a ` general assembly ' at once would defeat the very end which such body be design to serve more than ninety-nine per cent of the population be dead against a assembly which none of they understand and all distrust on the other hand the clamorous minority of less than one per cent be in favor only of a parliament from which the majority should be rigorously exclude even if possible as voter the immense majority comprise the entire french-canadian community the absurdly small minority consist mostly of americanized camp-following trader who have come to fish in troubled water naturally want the law make to suit poacher the british garrison the govern official and the very few other english-speaking people of a more enlighten class all look down on the rancorous minority the whole question resolve itself into this : should canada be hand over to the licensed exploitation of a few hundred low-class camp-follower who have do nothing to win she for the british empire who be despise by those who have and who promise to be a dangerous thorn in the side of the new colony what this ridiculous minority of grab-all really want be not a parliament but a rump many a representative assembly have end in a rump the grab-all wish to begin with one and stop there it might be suppose that such pretension would defeat themselves but there be a twofold difficulty in the way of get the truth understand by the english-speaking public on both side of the atlantic in the first place the french canadian be practically dumb to the outside world in the second the vociferous rumpite have the ear of some english and more american commercial people who be not anxious to understand while the great mass of the general public be incline to think if they ever think at all that parliamentary government must mean more liberty for every one concern a singularly apt commentary on the pretension of the camp-follower be supply by the famous or infamous ` presentment of the grand jury of quebec ' in October 1764 the move spirit of this precious jury be aspirant to membership in the strictly exclusive rumpish little parliament of they own seek the signature of the french-canadian member be obtain by fraud as be subsequently prove by a swear official protestation the first presentment tell its own tale as it refer to the only court in which french-canadian lawyer be allow to plead ` the great number of inferior court be tiresome litigious and expensive to this poor colony ' then come a hit at the previous military rule -- ` that decree of the military court may be amend -lrb- after have be confirm by legal ordinance -rrb- by allow appeal if the matter decide exceed ten pound ' which would put it out of the reach of the ` inferior court ' and into the clutch of ` the king 's old subject ' but the gist of it all be contain in the following : ` we represent that as the grand jury must be consider at present as the only body representative of the colony we propose that the publick account be lay before the grand jury at least twice a year ' that the grand jury be to be purge of all its french-canadian member be evident from the addendum slip in behind they back this addendum be a fine specimen of verbose invective against ` the church of rome ' the pope bull briefs absolution etc the empanel ` en grand and petty jury ' of ` papist or popish recusant convict ' and so on the ` presentment of the grand jury ' be presently follow by _ the humble petition of you majesty 's most faithful and loyal subject british merchant and trader in behalf of themselves and they fellow subject inhabitant of you majesty 's province of quebec _ ` they fellow subject ' do not of course include any ` papist or popish recusant convict ' among the ` grievance and distress ' enumerate be ` the oppressive and severely feel military government ' the inability to ` reap the fruit of we industry ' under such a martinet as murray who in one paragraph be accuse of ` suppressing dutyfull remonstrance in silence ' and in the next of ` treat they with a rage and rudeness of language and demeanor as dishonourable to the trust he hold of you majesty as painfull to those who suffer from it ' finally the petitioner solemnly warn he majesty that they ` life in the province be so very unhappy that we must be under the necessity of remove from it unless timely prevent by a removal of the present governor ' in forwarding this document murray pour out the vial of he wrath on ` the licentious fanatick trade here ' while he boldly champion the cause of the french canadian ' a race who could they be indulge with a few priveledge which the law of england deny to roman catholick at home would soon get the better of every national antipathy to they conqueror and become the most faithful and most useful set of man in this american empire ' while these charge and counter-charge be cross the atlantic another and much more violent trouble come to a head as there be no barracks in canada billeting be a necessity it be make as little burdensome as possible and the house of magistrate be specially exempt this however do not prevent the magistrate from bait the military whenever they get the chance fine imprisonment and other sentence out of all proportion to the offence commit be heap on every redcoat in much the same way as be then be practice in boston and other hotbed of disaffection the redcoat have do they work in rid america of the old french menace they be do it now in rid the colony of the last serious menace from the indian and so the colonist have no further use for they begin try to make the land they have deliver too hot to hold they there be of course exception and the american colonist have some real as well as pretended grievance but wantonly bait the redcoat have already become a most discreditable general practice montreal be most in touch with the disaffected people to the south it also have a magistrate of the name of walker the most rancorous of all the disaffected magistrate in canada this walker well mate with a equally rancorous wife be the same man who entertain benjamin franklin and the other commissioner send by congress into canada in 1776 the year in which both the american republic and a truly british canada be bear he would not have be flatter could he have see the entry franklin make about he and he wife in a diary which be still extant the gist of it be that wherever the walker might be they would soon set the place by the ear walker of course be foremost in the persecution of the redcoat and he eagerly seize he opportunity when a officer be billet in a house where a brother magistrate happen to be live as a lodger under such circumstance the magistrate could not claim exemption but this make no difference either to he or to walker captain payne the gentleman whose presence enrage these boor be seize and throw into gaol the chief justice grant a writ of habeas corpus but the mischief be do and resentment wax high the french-canadian seigneur sympathize with payne which add fuel to the magisterial flame and murray scent danger summon the whole bench down to quebec but before this bench of bumble start some mask man seize walker in he own house and give he a good sound thrashing unfortunately they spoil the fair reprisal by cut off he ear that very night the news have run round montreal and make a start for boston and quebec feeling run high and higher still when a few week later the civil magistrate vent they rage on several redcoat by impose sentence exceed even the utmost limit of they previous vindictive action montreal become panic-stricken lest the soldier bait past endurance should break out in open violence murray drive up post-haste from quebec order the affect regiment to another station reprove the offend magistrate and re-established public confidence official and private reward be offer to any witness who would identify walker 's assailant but in vain the smoulder fire burst out again under carleton but the mystery be never clear up thing have now come to a crisis the london merchant know nothing about the internal affair of canada back the petition of the quebec trader who be quite unworthy of such support from man of real business probity and knowledge the magisterial faction in canada advertise they side of the case all over the colony and in any sympathetic quarter they could find in england the seigneur send home a warm defense of murray and murray himself send cramahe a very able swiss officer in the british army the home government thus have plenty of contradictory evidence before it in 1765 the result be that murray be call home in 1766 rather in a spirit of open-minded and sympathetic inquiry into he conduct than with any idea of censure he he never return to canada but as he hold the titular governorship for some time longer and as he be afterwards employ in position of great responsibility and trust the verdict of the home authority be clearly give in he favor the troublous year of 1764 see another innovation almost as revolutionary compare with the old regime as the introduction of civil government itself this be the issue of the first newspaper in canada where indeed it be also the first print thing of any kind nova scotium have produce a earlier paper the _ halifax gazette _ which live a intermittent life from 1752 to 1800 but no press have ever be allow in new france the few document that require printing have always be do in the mother country brown and gilmore two philadelphian be

length during the first he be busily employ settle as many difficulty as he could examine the general state of the country and gradually grow into the change that be develop in the mind of the home government the change that be from the americanize sixty to the french-canadian seventy during the second period he be in england help to shape the famous quebec act during the third he be defend canada from american attack and aid the british counterstroke by every means in he power on the 22nd of September 1766 carleton arrive at quebec and begin he thirty year ' experience as a canadian administrator by take over the government from colonel irving who have hold it since murray 's departure in the spring irving have succeed murray simply because he happen to be the senior officer present at the time carleton himself be technically murray 's lieutenant till 1768 but neither of these fact really affect the course of canadian history the council the magistrate and the trader each present the new governor with a address contain the usual profession of loyal devotion carleton remark in he dispatch that these separate address and the marked absence of any united address show how much the population be divide he also note that a good many of the english-speaking minority have object to the address on account of they own opposition to the stamp act and that there have be some broken head in consequence trouble enough soon engage he anxious attention -- trouble over the indian trade the rights and wrong of the canadian jesuit the wounded dignity of some member of the council and the still smoulder and ever mysterious walker affair the strife between canada and the thirteen colony over the indian trade of the west remain the same in principle as under the old regime the conquest have merely change the old rivalry between two foreign power into one between two widely differ british possession and this because of the general unrest among the american make the competition more bitter if possible than ever the jesuit press they claim for recognition for they original estate and for compensation but they order have fall on evil day all over the world it be not popular even in canada and the arrangement be that while the exist member be to be treat with every consideration the society itself be to be allow to die out the offended councillor go so far as to present carleton with a remonstrance which irve himself have the misfortune to sign carleton have consult some member on point with which they be specially acquaint the member who have not be consult thereupon protest to irve who assure they that carleton must have do so by accident not design but when carleton receive a joint letter in which they say ` as you be pleased to signifye to we by coll irving that it be accident & not intention ' he at once reply : ` as lieutenant colonel irving have signify to you that the part of my conduct you think worthy of you reprehension happen by accident let he explain he reason for so do he have no authority from I ' carleton then go on to say that he would consult any ` man of good sense truth candor and impartial justice ' whenever he choose no matter whether they be councillor or not the walker affair which now break out again be much more serious than the storm in the council 's teacup it agitate the whole of canada and threaten to range the population of montreal and quebec into two irreconcilable faction the civil and the military for the whole of the two year since murray have be call upon to deal with it cleverly present version of walker 's view have be spread all over the colony and work into influential opposition circle in england the invective against the redcoat and they friend the seigneur be of the usual abusive type but they have a unusually powerful effect at that particular time in the thirteen colony as well as in what they author hope to make a fourteenth colony after a fashion of they own and they look plausible enough to mislead a good many moderate man in the mother country too walker 's case be that he have a actual witness as to the identity of he assailant in the person of mcgovoch a discharge soldier who lay information against one civilian three british officer and the celebrated french-canadian leader la corne de st luc all the accuse be arrest in they bed in montreal and throw into the common gaol walker object to bail on the plea that he life would be in danger if they be allow at large he also seek to postpone the trial in order to punish the accuse as much as possible guilty or innocent but william hey the chief justice a able and upright man would consent to postponement only on condition that bail should be allow so the trial proceed when the grand jury throw out the case against one of the prisoner walker let loose such a flood of virulent abuse that moderate man be turn against he in the end all the accuse be honourably acquit while mcgovoch who be prove to have be a false witness from the first be convict of perjury carleton remain absolutely impartial all through and even dismiss colonel irving and another member of the council for head a petition on behalf of the military prisoner the walker affair be a instance of a bad case in which the law at last work well but there be many other in which it do not what with the _ coutume de paris _ which be still quote in the province of quebec the other complexity of the old french law the doubtful meaning draw from the capitulation the treaty the proclamation and the various ordinance the instinctive opposition between the french canadian and the english-speaking civilian and finally what with the portent of subversive change that be already begin to overshadow all america -- what with all this and more carleton find himself face with a problem which no man could have solve to the satisfaction of every one concerned each side in a lawsuit take whatever amalgam of french and english code be best for its own argument but generally speak the ingrained feeling of the french canadian be against any change of they own law that be not visibly and immediately beneficial to they own particular interest moreover the use of the unknown english language the worthlessness of the rapacious english-speaking magistrate and the detest innovation of imprisonment for debt all combine to make every part of english civil law hate simply because it happen to be english and not french the home authority be anxious to find some workable compromise in 1767 carleton exchange several important dispatch with they and in 1768 they send out maurice morgan to study and report after consultation with the chief justice and ` other well instruct person ' morgan be a indefatigable and clear-sighted man who deserve to be gratefully remember by both race for he be a good friend both to the french canadian before the quebec act and to the unite empire loyalist just before they great migration when he be carleton 's secretary at new york in 1769 the official correspondence enter the ` secret and confidential ' stage with a dispatch from the home government to carleton suggest a house of representative to which practically speak the town would send protestant member and the country district roman catholic in 1770 carleton sail for england he carry a good deal of hard-won experience with he both on this point and on many other he go home with a strong opinion not only against a assembly but against any immediate attempt at anglicization in any form the royal instruction that have accompany he commission as ` captain-general and governor-in-chief ' in 1768 contain direction for establish the church of england with a view to convert the whole population to its tenet later on but no step have be take and needless to say the french canadian remain as roman catholic as ever a increasingly important question soon to overshadow all other be defense in April 1768 carleton have propose the restoration of the seigneurial militia system ` all the land here be hold of he majesty 's castle of st lewi -lrb- the governor 's official residence in quebec -rrb- the oath which the vassal -lrb- seigneur -rrb- take be very solemn and binding they be oblige to appear in arm for the king 's defense in case he province be attack ' carleton point out that a hundred man of the canadian seigneurial family be be keep on full pay in france ready to return and raise the canadian at the first opportunity ` on the other hand there be only about seventy of these officer in canada who have be in the french service not one of they have be give a commission in the king 's -lrb- george 's -rrb- service nor be there one who from any motive whatever be induce to support he government ' the few french canadian raise for pontiac 's war have of course be properly pay during the continuance of they active service but they have be disband like mere militia afterwards without either gratuity or half-pay for the officer this naturally make the class from which officer be draw think that no career be open to they under the union jack and turn they thought towards france where they fellow be enjoy full pay without a break what make this the more serious be the weakness of the regular garrison all of which put together number only 1627 man carleton calculate that about five hundred of ` the king 's old subject ' be capable of bear arm though most of they be better at talk than fight he have nothing but contempt for ` the flimsy wall round montreal ' and rely little more on the very defective work at quebec thus with all he wonderful equanimity ` grave carleton ' leave canada with no light heart when he take six month ' leave of absence in 1770 and he would have be more anxious still if he could have foresee that he absence be to be prolong to no less than four year he have however two great satisfaction he be represent at quebec by a most steadfast lieutenant the quiet alert discreet and determine cramahe and he be leave canada after have give proof of a disinterestedness which be worthy of the elder pitt himself when pitt become paymaster-general of england he at once decline to use the two chief perquisite of he office the interest on the government balance and the half per cent commission on foreign subsidy though both be regard as a kind of indirect salary when carleton become governor of canada he at once issue a proclamation abolish all the fee and perquisite attach to he position and explain he action to the home authority in the follow word : ` there be a certain appearance of dirt a sort of meanness in exacting fee on every occasion i think it necessary for the king 's service that he representative should be think unsullied ' murray who have accept the fee at first take umbrage but carleton soon put matter straight with he the fact be that fee and even certain perquisite be no dishonor to receive as they nearly always form a recognize part and often the whole of a perfectly legal salary but fee and perquisite could be abused and they do lead to misunderstanding even when they be not abuse while fix salary be free from both objection so carleton surround by shamelessly rapacious magistrate and the whole vile camp-following gang as well as by french canadian who have suffer from the robbery of bigot and he like decide to sacrifice everything but he indispensable fixed salary in order that even the most malicious critic could not bring any accusation however false against the man who represent britain and she king a interesting personal interlude which be not without considerable effect on canadian history take place in the middle of carleton 's four year ' stay in england he be forty-eight and still a bachelor tradition whisper that these long year of single life be the result of a disappointing love affair with jane carleton a pretty cousin when both he and she be young however that may be he now propose to lady anne howard whose father the earl of effingham be one of he greatest friend but he be doom to a second though doubtless very minor disappointment lady anne who probably look on ` grave carleton ' as a sort of amiable middle-aged uncle have fall in love with he nephew whom she presently married and with whom she afterwards go out to canada where she husband serve under the reject uncle himself what add spice to this peculiar situation be the fact that carleton actually marry the younger sister of the too-youthful lady anne when lady anne rejoin she sister and they bosom friend miss seymor after the disconcerting interview with carleton she explain she tear by say they be due to she have be ` oblige to refuse the best man on earth ' ` the more fool you ' answer the younger sister lady marium then just eighteen ' i only wish he have give I the chance ' there for the time the matter end carleton go back to he official duty in furtherance of the quebec act he nephew and the elder sister make mutual love lady marium hold she tongue but miss seymor have not forget and one day she muster up courage to tell carleton the story of ` the more fool you ' this decide he to act at once he propose be accept and live happily marry for the rest of he long life lady marium be small fair-haired and blue-eyed which heighten she girlish appearance when like madame de champlain she come out to canada with a husband more than old enough to be she father but she have be bring up at versaille she know all the aristocratic grace of the old regime and she slight upright figure -- erect as any soldier 's to she die day -- almost match she husband 's stalwart form in dignity of carriage the quebec act of 1774 -- the magna charta of the french-canadian race -- finally pass the house of lord on the 18th of June the general idea of the act be to reverse the unsuccessful policy of ultimate assimilation with the other american colony by make canada a distinctly french-canadian province the maritime province with a population of some thirty thousand be to be as english as they choose but a greatly enlarged quebec with a population of ninety thousand and stretch far into the unsettled west be to remain equally french-canadian though the rights of what it be then think would be a perpetual english-speaking minority be to be safeguard in every reasonable way the whole country between the american colony and the domain of the hudson 's bay company be include in this new quebec which comprise the southern half of what be now the newfoundland labrador practically the whole of the modern province of quebec and ontario and all the western land between the ohio and the great lake as far as the mississippus that be the modern american state of ohio indiana illinoi michigan and wisconsin the act give canada the english criminal code it recognize most of the french civil law include the seigneurial tenure of land roman catholic be give ` the free exercise ' of they religion ` subject to the king 's supremacy ' as define ` by a act make in the first year of queen elizabeth ' which act with a magnificently prophetic outlook on the future british empire be to apply to ` all the dominion and country which then do or thereafter should belong to the imperial crown ' the roman catholic clergy be authorize to collect ` they accustomed due and rights ' from member of they own communion the new oath of allegiance to the crown be silent about difference of religion so that roman catholic might take it without question the clergy and seigneur be thus restore to a acknowledged leadership in church and state those who want a parliament be distinctly tell that ` it be at present inexpedient to call a assembly ' and that a council of from seventeen to twenty-three member all appoint by the crown would attend to local government and have power to levy tax for road and public building only land hold ` in free and common socage ' be to be deal with by the law of england as be all property which could be freely will away a possible establishment of the church of england be provide for but never put in operation in some way the act do in other way it do not fulfil the object of its framer it be undoubtedly a generous concession to the lead french canadian it do help to keep canada both british and canadian and it do open the way for what ought to have be a crush attack on the american revolutionary force but it be not and neither it nor any other act could possibly have be at that late hour completely successful it conciliate the seigneur and the parochial clergy but it do not and it could not also conciliate the lesser townsfolk and the habitant for the last fourteen year the habitant have be gradually drift away from they former habit of obedience and former obligation towards they leader in church and state the leader have lose they old follower the follower have find no new leader of they own naturally enough there be great satisfaction among the seigneur and the clergy with a general feeling among government supporter both in england and canada that the best solution of a very refractory problem have be find at last on the other hand the opposition in england nearly every one in the american colony and the great majority of english-speaking people in newfoundland the maritime province and canada itself be dead against the act while the habitant resent the privilege already reaffirm in favor of the seigneur and clergy and suspicious of further change in the same unwelcome direction be neutral at the best and hostile at the worst the american colonist would have be anger in any case but when they see canada proper make as unlike a ` fourteenth colony ' as could be and when they also see the gate of the coveted western land close against they by the same detested act -- the last of the ` five intolerable act ' to which they most object -- they fury know no bound they curse the king the pope and the french canadian with as much violence as any temporal or spiritual ruler have ever curse heretic and rebel the ` infamous and tyrannical ministry ' in england be accuse of ` contemptible subservience ' to the ` bloodthirsty idolatrous and hypocritical creed ' of the french canadian to think that people whose religion have spread ` murder persecution and revolt throughout the world ' be to be entrench along the st lawrence be bad enough but to see crown protection give to the indian land which the american consider they own western ` birthright ' be infinitely worse be the king of england to steal the valley of the mississippus in the same way as the king of france it be easy to be wise after the event and hard to follow any counsel of perfection but it must always be a subject of keen if unavailing regret that the french canadian be not guarantee they own way of life within the limit of the modern province of quebec immediately after the capitulation of montreal in 1760 they would then have enter the british empire as a whole people on term which they must all have understand to be exceedingly generous from any conquer power and which they would have soon find out to be far better than anything they have experience under the government of france in return for such unexampled generosity they might have become convinced defender of the only flag in the world under which they could possibly live as french canadian they relation to each other to the rest of a change canada and to the empire would have follow the natural course of political evolution with the burning question of language law and religion safely remove from general controversy in after year the rights of the english-speaking minority could of course have be still better safeguard under this system than under the distracting series of half-measure which take its place there should have be no question of a parliament in the immediate future then with the peopling of ontario by the unite empire loyalist and the growth of the maritime province on the other side quebec could have enter carleton 's propose confederation in the ninety to she own and every one else 's best advantage on the other hand the delay of fourteen year after the capitulation of 1760 and the unwarrantable extension of the provincial boundary be cardinal error of the most disastrous kind the delay fill with a futile attempt at mistaken americanization breed doubt and dissension not only between the two race but between the different kind of french canadian when the hour of trial come disintegration have already go too far the mistake about the boundary be equally bad the western wild ought to have be administer by a lieutenant-governor under the supervision of a governor-general even lease they for a short term of year to the hudson 's bay company would have be better than annex they to a preposterous province of quebec the american colonist would have doubtless object to either alternative but both could have be defend on sound principle of administration while the sudden invasion of a new and inflated quebec into the colonial hinterland be little less than a declaration of war the whole problem bristle with enormous difficulty and the circumstance under which it have to be face make a ideal solution impossible but a earlier quebec act without its outrageous boundary clause would have be well worth the risk of pass for the delay lead many french canadian to suppose however falsely that the empire 's need might always be they opportunity and this idea however repugnant to they best mind and better feeling have persist among they extreme particularist until the present day chapter iv invasion 1775 carleton 's first eight year as governor of canada be almost entirely occupy with civil administration the next four be equally occupy with war so much so indeed that the quebec act could not be put in force on the 1st of may 1775 as provide for in the act itself but only bit by bit much later on there be one short session of the new legislative council which open on the 17th of August but all man 's mind be even then turn towards the montreal frontier whence the american invasion threaten to overspread the whole country and make this opening session the last that might ever be hold most of the member be soon call away from the council-chamber to the field no further session could be hold either that year or the next and carleton be oblige to nominate the judge himself the fifteen year of peace be over and canada have once more become a object of contention between two fiercely hostile force the war of the american revolution be a long and exceedingly complicated struggle and its many vary fortune naturally have a profound effect on those of canada but canada be directly engage in no more than the first three campaign when the american invade she in 1775 and '76 and when the british use she as the base from which to invade the new american republic in 1777 these first three campaign form a purely civil war within the british empire on each side stand three party opponent be range against each other in the mother country in the thirteen colony and in canada in the mother country the king and he party government be range against the opposition and all who hold radical or revolutionary view here the strife be merely political but in the thirteen colony the force of the crown be range against the force of the new continental congress the small minority of colonist who be afterwards know as the unite empire loyalist side with the crown a majority side with the congress the rest keep as selfishly neutral as they could among the english-speaking civilian in canada many of whom be now of a much better class than the original camp-follower the active loyalist comprise only the smaller half the larger half side with the american as be only natural see that most of they be immigrant from the thirteen colony but by no means all these sympathizer be ready for a fight among the french canadian the loyalist include very few besides the seigneur the clergy and a handful of educate people in montreal three river and quebec the mass of the habitant be more or less neutral but many of they be anti-british at first while most of they be anti-american afterwards event move quickly in 1775 on the 19th of April the ` shot hear round the world ' be fire at lexington in massachusett on the 1st of may the day appoint for the inauguration of the quebec act the statue of the king in montreal be grossly defaced and hung with a cross a necklace of potato and a placard bear the inscription _ here be the canadian pope and english fool -- voilum le pape du canada et le sot anglais _ large reward be offer for the detection of the culprit but without avail excitement run high and many a argument end with a bloody nose meanwhile three american be plot a attack along the old line of lake champlain two of they be outlaw from the colony of new york which be then dispute with the neighbouring colony of new hampshire the possession of the lawless region in which all three have take refuge and which afterwards become vermont ethan allen the gigantic leader of the wild green mountain boy have a price on he head seth warner he assistant be a outlaw of a somewhat humbler kind benedict arnold the third invader come from connecticut he be a horse-dealer carry on business with quebec and montreal as well as the west indy he be just thirty-four a excellent rider a dead shot a very fair sailor and captain of a crack militia company immediately after the affair at lexington he have turn out he company reinforce by undergraduate from yale have seize the new haven powder magazine and march over to cambridge where the massachusett committeeman take such a fancy to he that they make he a colonel on the spot with full authority to raise man for a immediate attack on ticonderoga the opportunity seem too good to be lose though the continental congress be not then in favor of attack canada as its member hope to see the canadian throw off the yoke of empire on they own account the british post on lake champlain be absurdly undermanned ticonderoga contain two hundred cannon but only forty man none of whom expect a attack crown point have only a sergeant and a dozen man to watch its hundred and thirteen piece fort george at the head of lake george be no better off and nothing more have be do to man the fortification at st john on the richelieu where there be a excellent sloop as well as many cannon in charge of the usual sergeant 's guard this want of preparation be no fault of carleton 's he have frequently report home on the need of more man now he have less than a thousand regular to defend the whole country : and not another man be to arrive till the spring of next year when gage be hard press for reinforcement at boston in the autumn of 1774 carleton have immediately send he two excellent battalion that could ill be spare from canada but when carleton himself make a similar request in the autumn of 1775 admiral grave to he lasting dishonor refuse to sail up to quebec so late as October the first move of the three american smack strongly of a well-staged extravaganza in which the smart yankee never fail to score off the dunderheaded british the green mountain boy assemble on the east side of the lake spy walk in and out of ticonderoga exactly opposite and report to ethan allen that the commandant and he whole garrison of forty unsuspecting man would make a easy prey allen then send eighty man down to skenesborough -lrb- now whitehall -rrb- at the southern end of the lake to take the tiny post there and bring back boat for the cross on the 10th of may then arnold turn up with he colonel 's commission but without the four hundred man it authorize he to raise allen however have make himself a colonel too with warner as he second-in-command so there be no less than three colonel for two hundred and thirty man arnold claim the command by virtue of he massachusett commission but the green mountain boy declare they would follow no colonel but they own and so arnold after be threaten with arrest be appoint something like chief of the staff on the understanding that he would make himself generally useful with the boat this appointment be make at dawn on the 10th of may just as the first eighty man be advance to the attack after cross over under cover of night the british sentry 's musket miss fire whereupon he and the guard be rush while the rest of the garrison be surprise in they bed ethan allen who know the fort thoroughly hammer on the commandant 's door and summon he to surrender ` in the name of the great jehovah and the continental congress ' the astonished commandant see that resistance be impossible put on he dressing-gown and parade he disarmed garrison as prisoner of war seth warner presently arrive with the rest of allen 's man and soon become the hero of crown point which he take with the whole of its thirteen man and a hundred and thirteen cannon then arnold have he own turn in command of a expedition against the sergeant 's guard cannon store fort and sloop at st john on the richelieu all of which he capture in the same absurdly simple way when he come sailing back the three victorious commander parade all they man and fire off many straggle fusillade of joy in the meantime the continental congress at philadelphium with a delightful touch of unconscious humor be gravely debate the follow resolution which be pass on the 1st of June : _ that no expedition or incursion ought to be undertake or make by any colony or body of colonist against or into canada _ the same congress however find reason enough for change its mind before the month of may be out the british force in canada have already begin to move towards the threaten frontier they have occupy and strengthen st john and the american be begin to fear lest the command of lake champlain might again fall into british hand on the 27th of may the congress close the phase of individual raid and inaugurate the phase of regular invasion by commission general schuyler to ` pursue any measure in canada that may have a tendency to promote the peace and security of these colony ' philip schuyler be a distinguished member of the family whose head have formulate the ` glorious enterprize ' of conquer new france in 1689 -lrb- footnote : see in this series _ the fight governor _ -rrb- so it be quite in line with the family tradition for he to be under order to ` take possession of st john montreal and any other part of the country ' provide always add the cautious congress that ` general schuyler find it practicable and that it will not be disagreeable to the canadian ' a few day later arnold be try to get a colonelcy from the convention of new york whose member just then happen to be think of give commission to he rival the leader of the green mountain boy while to make the complication quite complete these boy themselves have every intention of electing officer on they own account in the meantime connecticut determine not to be forestall by either friend or foe order a thousand man to ticonderoga and commission a general call wooster to command they thus early be sow the seed of those dissension between congress troops and colony troops which nearly drive washington mad schuyler reach ticonderoga in mid-july and assume he position as congressional commander-in-chief unfortunately for the good of the service he have only a few hundred man with he so wooster who have a thousand think himself the bigger general of the two the connecticut man follow wooster 's lead by jeer at schuyler 's man from new york while the vermonter add to the confusion by elect seth warner instead of ethan allen in mid-august a second congressional general arrive make three general and half a dozen colonel for less than fifteen hundred

battery could not be move without consult a council of war schuyler though far more phlegmatic than montgomery agree with he heartily about this and many other exasperating point ` if job have be a general in my situation he memory have not be so famous for patience ' wear out by he worry schuyler fall ill and be send to command the base at albany montgomery then succeed to the command of the force destine for the front the plan of invasion approve by washington be first to sweep the line of the richelieu by take st john and chambly then to take montreal next to secure the line of the st lawrence and finally to besiege quebec montgomery 's force be to carry out all the preliminary part alone but arnold be to join he at quebec after advance across country from the kennebec to the chaudiere with a fly column of virginian and new englander carleton open the melancholy little session of the new legislative council at quebec on the very day montgomery arrive at ticonderoga -- the 17th of August when he close it to take up the defense of canada the prospect be already black enough though it grow blacker still as time go on immediately on hear the news of ticonderoga crown point and st john at the end of may he have send every available man from quebec to montreal whence colonel templer have already send off a hundred and forty man to st john while call for volunteer to follow the seigneurial class come forward at once but all attempt to turn out the militia en masse _ prove utterly futile fourteen year of kindly british rule have loosen the old french bond of government and the habitant be no longer unite as part of one people with the seigneur and the clergy the rebel have be busy spread insidious perversion of the belated quebec act poisoning the mind of the habitant against the british government and fill they imagination with all sort of terrifying doubt the habitant be ignorant credulous and suspicious to the last degree the most absurd story obtain ready credence and run like wildfire through the province seven thousand russian be say to be come up the st lawrence -- whether as friend or foe matter nothing compare with the awful fact that they be all outlandish bogey carleton be say to have a plan for burn alive every habitant he could lay he hand on montgomery 's thousand be say to be five thousand with many more to follow and later on when arnold 's man come up the kennebec it be satisfactorily explain to most of the habitant that it be no good resist dead-shot rifleman who be bullet-proof themselves carleton issue proclamation the seigneur wave they sword the clergy thunder from they pulpit but all in vain two month after the american exploit on lake champlain carleton give a guinea to the sentry mount in he honor by the local militia colonel m de tonnancor because this man be the first genuine habitant he have yet see arm in the whole district of three river what must carleton have feel when the home government authorize he to raise six thousand of he majesty 's loyal french-canadian subject for immediate service and inform he that the arm and equipment for the first three thousand be already on the way to canada seven year earlier it might still have be possible to raise french-canadian counterpart of those highland regiment which wolfe have recommend and pitt have so cordially approve carleton himself have recommend this excellent scheme at the proper time but though the home government even then agree with he they think such a measure would raise more parliamentary and public clamor than they could safely face the chance once lose be lose for ever carleton have do what he could to keep the enemy at arm 's length from montreal by put every available man into chambly and st john he know nothing of arnold 's force till it actually reach quebec in November quebec be think secure for the time be and so be leave with a handful of man under cramahe montreal have a few regular and a hundred ` royal emigrant ' mostly old highlander who have settle along the new york frontier after the conquest for the rest it have many american and a few british sympathizer ready to fly at each other ' throat and a good many neutral ready to curry favor with the winner sorel be a mere post without any effective garrison chambly be hold by only eighty man under major stopford but its strong stone fort be well armed and quite proof against anything except siege artillery while its little garrison consist of good regular who be well provision for a siege the mass of carleton 's little force be at st john under major preston who have 500 man of the 7th and 26th -lrb- royal fusilier and cameronian -rrb- 80 gunner and 120 volunteer mostly french-canadian gentleman preston be a excellent officer and he seven hundred man be able to give a very good account of themselves as soldier but the fort be not nearly so strong as the one at chambly it have no natural advantage of position and it be short of both store and provision the three successive step for montgomery to take be st john chambly and montreal but the natural order of event be completely upset by that headstrong yankee ethan allen who would have he private war at montreal and by that contemptible british officer major stopford who would not defend chambly montgomery lay siege to st john on the 18th of September but make no substantial progress for more than a month he probably have no use for allen at anything like a regular siege so allen and a major brown go on to ` preach politick ' and concert a rise with man like livingston and walker livingston as we have see already belong to a lead new york family which be very active in the rebel cause and livingston walker allen and brown would have make a dangerous anti-british combination if they could only have work together but they could not livingston hurry off to join montgomery with four hundred ` patriot ' who serve they cause fairly well till the invasion be over walker have no military quality whatever so allen and brown be leave to they own disunited device montreal seem a easy prey it have plenty of rebel sympathizer nearly all the surround habitant be either neutral or incline to side with the american though not as fight man carleton 's order to bring in all the ladder so as to prevent a escalade of the wall have meet with general opposition and evasion nothing seem want but a good work plan brown or possibly allen himself then hit upon the idea of treat montreal very much as allen have treat ticonderoga in any case allen jump at it he jump so far indeed that he forestall brown who fail to appear at the critical moment thus on the 24th of September allen find himself alone at long point with a hundred and twenty man in face of three time as many under the redoubtable major carden a skilled veteran who have win wolfe 's admiration year before carden 's force include thirty regular two hundred and forty militiaman and some indian probably not over a hundred strong the militia be mostly of the seigneurial class with a following of habitant and townsman of both french and british blood carden break allen 's flank round up he center and win the little action easily though at the expense of he own most useful life allen be very indignant at be handcuff and march off like a common prisoner after have make himself a colonel twice over but carleton have no respect for self-commissioned officer and have no soldier to spare for guard dangerous rebel so he ship allen off to england where that eccentric warrior be confine in pendenni castle near falmouth in cornwall this affair small as it be revive british hope in montreal and induce a few more militiaman and indian to come forward but within a month more be lose at chambly than have be gain at montreal on the 18th of October a small american detachment attack chambly with two little field-gun and induce it to surrender on the 20th if ever a officer deserve to be shoot it be major stopford who tamely surrender he well-armed and well-provided fort to a insignificant force after a flimsy resistance of only thirty-six hour without even take the trouble to throw he store into the river that flow beside he strong stone wall the news of this disgraceful surrender diligently spread by rebel sympathizer frighten the indian away from st john thus deprive major preston the commandant of he best courier at the very worst time but the evil do not stop there for nearly all the few french-canadian militiaman whom the more distant seigneur have be able to get under arm desert _ en masse _ with many threat against any one who should try to turn they out again chambly be only a short day 's march from montreal to the west and st john to the south so its capture mean that st john be entirely cut off from the richelieu to the north and dangerously expose to be cut off from montreal as well its ample store and munitions of war be a priceless boon to montgomery who now redouble he effort to take st john but preston hold out bravely for the remainder of the month while carleton do he best to help he a fortnight earlier carleton have arrest that firebrand walker who have previously refuse to leave the country though carleton have give he the chance of do so mrs walker as much a rebel as she husband interview carleton and note in she diary that he ` say many severe thing in very soft & polite terme ' carleton be firm walker 's action word and correspondence all prove he a dangerous rebel whom no governor could possibly leave at large without break he oath of office walker who have himself cause so many outrageous arrest now not only resist the legal arrest of he own person but fire on the little party of soldier who have be send to bring he into montreal the soldier then begin to burn he out whereupon he carry he wife to a window from which the soldier rescue she he then surrender and be bring into montreal where the sight of he as a prisoner make a considerable impression on the waverer a few hundred neighbouring militiaman be scrape together every one of the handful of regular who could be spare be turn out and carleton set off to the relief of st john but seth warner 's green mountain boy reinforce by many more sharpshooter prevent carleton from landing at longueuil opposite montreal the remain indian begin to slink away the french-canadian militiaman desert fast -- ` thirty or forty of a night ' there be not two hundred regular available for a march across country and on the 30th carleton be force to give up in despair within the week st john surrender with 688 man who be take south as prisoner of war preston have be completely cut off and threaten with starvation as well so when he destroy everything likely to be need by the enemy he have do all that could be expect of a brave and capable commander it be the 3rd of November when st john surrender ten day later montgomery occupy montreal and arnold land at wolfe 's cove just above quebec the race for the possession of quebec have be a very close one the race for the capture of carleton be to be closer still and on the fate of either depend the immediate and perhaps the ultimate fate of canada the race for quebec have be none the less desperate because the british have not know of the danger from the south till after arnold have suddenly emerge from the wild of maine and be well on he way to the mouth of the chaudiere which fall into the st lawrence seven mile above the city arnold 's subsequent change of side earn he the execration of the american but there can be no doubt whatever that if he have get through in time to capture quebec he would have become a national hero of the united state he have the advantage of lead pick man though nearly three hundred faint-heart do turn back half-way but even with pick man he feat be one of surpass excellence he force go in eleven hundred strong it come out reduce by desertion as well as by almost incredible hardship with barely seven hundred it begin its toilsome ascent of the kennebec towards the end of September carry six week ' supplies in the bad hastily build boat or on the man 's back daniel morgan and he virginian rifleman lead the way aaron burr be present as a young volunteer the portage be many and try the settlement be few at first and then want altogether early in October the drench portager be already sleep in they frozen clothes the boat begin to break up quantity of provision be lose soon there be scarcely anything left but flour and salt pork it take nearly a fortnight to get past the great carry place in sight of mount bigelow rock bog and freezing slime tell on the man some of whom begin to fall sick then come the chain of pond lead into dead river then the last climb up to the height-of-land beyond which lay the headwater of the chaudiere which take its rise in lake megantic there be sixty mile to go beyond the lake and a badly broken sixty mile they be before the first settlement of french canadian could be reach there be no trail provision be almost at a end sickness increase the sick begin to die ` and what be it all for a chance to get kill the end of the march be quebec -- impregnable ' on the 24th of October arnold with fifteen other man begin ' a race against time a race against starvation ' by push on ahead in a desperate effort to find food within a week he have reach the first settlement after lose three of he five boat with everything in they three day later and not one day too soon the french canadian meet he seven hundred famishing man with a drive of cattle and plenty of provision the rest of the way be toilsome enough but it seem easy by comparison the habitant be friendly but very shy about enlist in spite of washington 's invitation to ` range yourselve under the standard of general liberty ' the indian be more responsive and nearly fifty join on they own term by the 8th of November arnold be march down the south shore of the st lawrence from the chaudiere to point levi in full view of quebec he have just receive a dispatch ten day old from montgomery by which he learn that st john be expect to fall immediately and that schuyler be no longer with the army at the front but he could not tell when the junction of force would be make and he see at once that quebec be on the alert because every boat have be either destroy or take over to the other side the spring and summer have be anxious time enough in quebec but the autumn be a great deal worse bad news keep come down from montreal the disaffected get more and more restless and begin ` to act as though no opposition might be show the rebel force ' and in October it do seem as if nothing could be do to stop the invader there be only a few hundred militiaman that could be depend on the regular under colonel maclean have go up to help carleton on the montreal frontier the fortification be in no state to stand a siege but cramahe be full of steadfast energy he have muster the french-canadian militia on September 11 the very day arnold be leave cambridge in massachusett for he daring march against quebec these man have answer the call far better in the city of quebec than anywhere else there be also a larger proportion of english-speaking loyalist here than in montreal but no transport bring troops up the st lawrence from boston or the mother country and no vessel bring carleton down the loyalist be however encourage by the presence of two small men-of-war one of which the _ hunter _ have be the guide-ship for wolfe 's boat the night before the battle of the plain some minor reinforcement also keep arrive : veteran from the border settlement and a hundred and fifty man from newfoundland on the 3rd of November the day st john surrender to montgomery a intercept dispatch have warn cramahe of arnold 's approach and lead he to seize all the boat on the south shore opposite quebec this be by no mean he first precaution he have send some man forty mile up the chaudiere as soon as the news of the raid on lake champlain and st john have arrive at the end of may thus though neither of they have anticipate such a bolt from the blue both carleton and cramahe have take all the reasonable means within they most restricted power to provide against unforeseen contingency arnold 's chance of surprising quebec have be lose ten day before he be able to cross the st lawrence and when the habitant on the south shore be help he man to make scaling-ladder the british garrison on the north have already become too strong for he but he be indefatigable in collect boat and canoe at the mouth of the chaudiere and at other point higher up than cramahe 's man have reach when on they mission of destruction or removal and he be as capable as ever when on the pitch-black night of the 13th he lead he little flotilla through the gap between the two british men-of-war the _ hunter _ and the _ lizard _ the next day he march across the plain of abraham and salute quebec with three cheer but meanwhile colonel maclean who have set out to help carleton at montreal and turn back on hear the news of st john have slip into quebec on the 12th so arnold find himself with less than seven hundred effective against the eleven hundred british who be now behind the wall after vainly summon the city to surrender he retire to pointe-aux-tremble more than twenty mile up the north shore of the st lawrence there to await the arrival of the victorious montgomery meanwhile montgomery be race for carleton and carleton be race for quebec montgomery 's advance-guard have hurry on to sorel at the mouth of the richelieu forty-five mile below montreal to mount gun that would command the narrow channel through which the fugitive governor would have to pass on he way to quebec they have ample time to set the trap for a incessant nor ' - easter blow up the st lawrence day after day and hold carleton fast in montreal while only a league away montgomery 's main body be prepare to cross over escape by land be impossible as the american hold berthier on the north shore and have win over the habitant all the way down from montreal on both side of the river at last on the afternoon of the 11th the wind shift immediately a single cannon-shot be fire a bugle sound the _ fall in _ and ` the whole military establishment ' of montreal form up in the barrack square -- one hundred and thirty officer and man all tell carleton ` wring to the soul ' as one of he officer write home come on parade ` firm unshaken and serene ' the little column then march down to the boat through shutter street of timid neutral and scowling rebel the few loyalist who come to say good-bye to carleton at the wharf might well have think it be the last handshake they would ever get from a british ` captain-general and governor-in-chief ' as they see he step aboard in the dreary dusk of that November afternoon and if he and they have know the worst they might well have think they fate be seal for neither of they then know that both side of the st lawrence be occupy in force at two different place on the perilous way to quebec the little flotilla of eleven vessel get safely down to within a few mile of sorel when one ground and delay the rest till the wind fail altogether at noon on the 12th the next three day it blow upstream without a break no progress could be make as there be no room to tack in the narrow passage opposite sorel on the third day a american float battery suddenly appear firing hard behind it come a boat with a flag of truce and the follow summons from colonel easton who command montgomery 's advance-guard at sorel : sir -- by this you will learn that general montgomery be in possession of the fortress montreal you be very sensible that i be in possession at this place and that from the strength of the unite colony on both side you own situation be render very disagreeable i be therefore induce to make you the follow proposal viz : -- that if you will resign you fleet to I immediately without destroy the effect on board you and you man shall be use with due civility together with woman & child on board to this i shall expect you direct and immediate answer should you neglect you will cherefully take the consequence which will follow carleton be surprise : and well he might be he have not suppose that montgomery 's man be in any such commanding position but like cramahe at quebec he refuse to answer whereupon easton 's battery open both from the south shore and from isle st ignace carleton 's heaviest gun be a 9-pounder while easton have four 12-pounder one of they mount on a rowing battery that soon force the british to retreat the skipper of the schooner contain the powder magazine want to surrender on the spot especially when he hear that the american be get some hot shot ready for he but carleton retreat upstream twelve mile above sorel to lavaltrie just above berthier on the north shore where on attempt to land he be drive back by some american and habitant next morning the 16th a fateful day for canada the same major brown who have fail ethan allen at montreal come up with a flag of truce to propose that carleton should send a officer to see for himself how well all chance of escape have now be cut off the offer be accept and brown explain the situation from the rebel point of view ` this be my small battery and even if you should chance to escape i have a grand battery at the mouth of the sorel -lrb- richelieu -rrb- which will infallibly sink all of you vessel wait a little till you see the 32-pounder that be now within half-a-mile ' there be a good deal of yankee bluff in this warning especially as the 32-pounder could not be mount in time but the british officer seem perfectly satisfy that the way be completely block and so the american feel sure that carleton would surrender the follow day carleton however be not the man to give in till the very last and one desperate chance still remain he flotilla be doom but he might still get through alone without it one of the french-canadian skipper better know as ` le tourte ' or ` wild pigeon ' than by he own name of bouchette because of he wonderfully quick trip be persuade to make the dash for freedom so carleton have order prescott he second-in-command not to surrender the flotilla before the last possible moment arrange for he own escape in a whaleboat it be with infinite precaution that he make he preparation as the enemy though confident of take he be still on the alert to prevent such a prize from slip through they finger he dress like a habitant from head to foot put on a tasselled _ bonnet rouge _ and a _ etoffe du pay _ -lrb- gray homespun -rrb- suit of clothes with a red sash and _ botte sauvage _ like indian moccasin then the whaleboat be quietly bring alongside the crew get in and ply they muffle oar noiselessly down to the narrow passage between isle st ignace and the isle du pas where they ship the oar and lean over the side to paddle past the nearest battery with the palm of they hand it be a moment of breathless excitement for the hope of canada be in they keep and no turn back be possible but the american sentry see no furtive french canadian glide through that dark November night and hear no suspicious noise above the regular ripple of the eddy island current one tense half-hour and all be over the oar be run out again the man give way with a will and three river be safely reach in the morning here carleton meet captain napier who take he aboard the armed ship _ fall _ in which he continue he journey to quebec he be practically safe aboard the _ fall _ for arnold have neither a army strong enough to take quebec nor any craft big enough to fight a ship but the flotilla above sorel be doom after throw all its powder into the st lawrence it surrender on the 19th the very day carleton reach quebec the astonished american be furious when they find that carleton have slip through they finger after all they get prescott whom they hate and they release walker whom carleton be take as a prisoner to quebec but no friend and foe like walker and prescott could make up for the loss of carleton who be the heart as well as the head of canada at bay the exultation of the british more than match the disappointment of the american thoma ainslie collector of custom and captain of militia at quebec only express the feeling of all he fellow-loyalist when he make the follow entry in the extremely accurate diary he keep throughout those troublous time : ` on the 19th -lrb- a happy day for quebec -rrb- to the unspeakable joy of the friend of the government and to the utter dismay of the abettor of sedition and rebellion general carleton arrive in the _ fall _ arm would ship accompany by a arm would schooner we see we salvation in he presence ' chapter v beleaguerment 1775-1776 when carleton finally turn at bay within the wall of quebec the british flag wave over less than a single one out of the more than a million square mile that have so recently be include within the boundary of canada the landward wall cut off the last half-mile of the tilted promontory which rise three hundred foot above the st lawrence but only one hundred above the valley of the st charle this promontory be just a thousand yard wide where the landward wall run across it and not much wider across the world-famous height and plain of abraham which then cover the first two mile beyond the whole position make one of nature 's stronghold when the enemy can be keep at arm 's length but carleton have no man to spare for more than the actual wall and the narrow little strip of the lower town between the base of the cliff and the st lawrence so the enemy close in along the height ' and among the suburb besides occupy any point of vantage they choose across the st lawrence or st charle the wall be by no means fit to stand a siege a fact which carleton have frequently report but as the american have neither the man nor the material for a regular siege they be oblige to confine themselves to a mere beleaguerment with the chance of take quebec by assault one of carleton 's first act be to proclaim that every able-bodied man refuse to bear arm be to leave the town within four day but though this have the desire effect of clear out nearly all the dangerous rebel the american still believe they have enough sympathizer inside to turn the scale of victory if they could only manage to take the lower town with all its commercial property and shipping or gain a footing anywhere within the wall there be five thousand soul leave in quebec which be well provision for the winter the woman child and man unfit to bear arm number three thousand the ` exempt ' amount to a hundred and eighty as there be a grow suspicion about many of these last carleton parade they for medical examination at the beginning of march when a good deal more than half be find quite fit for duty these man have be malinger all winter in order to skulk out of danger so he treat they with extreme leniency in only put they on duty as a ` company of invalid ' but the slur stick fast the only other exception to the general efficiency be a very few instance of cowardice and many more of slackness the militia order-book have repeat entry about man who turn up late for even important duty as well as about other whose authorized substitute be no better than themselves but it should be remember that as a whole the garrison do exceedingly good service and that all the malingerer and serious delinquent together do not amount to more than a tenth of its total which be a small proportion for such a mixed body the effective strength at the beginning of the siege be eighteen hundred of all rank only one hundred of these belong to the regular british garrison in canada -- a few staff-officer twenty-two man of the royal artillery and seventy man of the 7th royal fusilier a regiment which be to be command in quebec sixteen year later by queen victorium 's father the duke of kent the fusilier and two hundred and thirty ` royal emigrant ' be form into a little battalion under colonel maclean a first-rate officer and carleton 's right-hand man in action ` he majesty 's royal highland regiment of emigrant ' which subsequently become the 84th foot now know as the 2nd york and lancaster be hastily raise in 1775 from the highland veteran who have settle in the american colony after the peace of 1763 maclean 's two hundred and thirty be the first man he could get together in time to reach quebec the only other professional fighter be four hundred blue-jacket and thirty-five marine of hmss _ lizard _ and _ hunter _ who be form into a naval battalion under they own officer captain hamilton and mckenzie hamilton be make a lieutenant-colonel and mckenzie a major while do duty ashore fifty master and mate of trading vessel be enrol in the same battalion the whole of the shipping be lay up for the winter in the cul de sac which alone make the lower town a prize worth take the ` british militia ' muster three hundred and thirty the ` canadian militia ' five hundred and forty-three these two corps include practically all the official and business class in quebec and form nearly half the total combatant some of they take no pay and be not bind to service beyond the neighborhood of quebec thus be very much like the home guard raise all over canada and the rest of the empire during the great world war of 1914 all the militia wear dark green coat with buff waistcoat and breeches the total of eighteen hundred be complete by a hundred and twenty ` artificer ' that be man who would now belong to the engineer ordnance and army service corps as the composition of this garrison have be so often misrepresent it may be as well to state distinctly that the past or present regular of all kind soldier and sailor together number eight hundred and the militia and other non-regular a thousand the french canadian very few of whom be or have be regular form less than a third of the whole montgomery and arnold have about the same total number of man sometimes there be more sometimes less but what make the real difference and what really turn the scale be that the american have hardly any regular and that they effective rarely average three-quarter of they total strength the balance be also against they in the matter of armament for though morgan 's virginian have many more rifle than be to be find among the british the american in general be not so well off for bayonet and not so well able to use those they have while the artillery odds be still more against they carleton 's artillery be not of the best but it be better than that of the american he decidedly overmatch they in the combined strength of all kind of ordnance -- cannon carronade howitzer mortar and swivel cannon and howitzer fire shot and shell at any range up to the limit then reach between two and three mile carronade be on the principle of a gigantic shotgun firing mass of bullet with great effect at very short range -- less than that of a long musket-shot then reckon at two hundred yard the biggest mortar throw 13-inch 224-lb shell to a great distance but they main use be for high-angle fire such as that from the suburb of st roch under the wall of quebec swivel be the smallest kind of ordnance firing one - two - or three-pound ball at short or medium range they be use at convenient point to stop rush much like modern machine-gun thanks chiefly to cramahe the defence be not nearly so ` ruinous ' as arnold at first have think they the wall however useless against the best siege artillery be formidable enough against irregular troops and makeshift battery while the warehouse and shipping in the lower town be protect by two stockade one straight under cape diamond the other at the corner where the lower town turn into the valley of the st charle the first be call the pres-de-ville the second the sault-au-matelot the shipping be open to bombardment from the levi shore but the american have no gun to spare for this till April montgomery 's advance be greatly aid by the little flotilla which easton have capture at sorel montgomery meet arnold at pointe-aux-tremble twenty mile above quebec on the 2nd of December and supply he little half-clad force with the british uniform take at st john and chambly he be greatly please with the magnificent physique of arnold 's man the fittest of a originally well-picked lot he still have some ` pusillanimous wretch ' among he own new yorker who resent the air of superiority affect by arnold 's new englander and morgan 's virginian he feel a well-deserved confidence in livingston and some of the english-speaking canadian ` patriot ' whom livingston have bring into he camp before st john in September but he begin to feel more and more doubtful about the french canadian most of whom begin to feel more and more doubtful about themselves on the 6th he arrive before quebec and take up he quarter in holland house two mile beyond the wall at the far end of the plain of abraham the same day he send carleton the follow summons : sir -- notwithstanding the personal ill-treatment i have receive at you hand -- notwithstanding you cruelty to the unhappy prisoner you have take the feeling of humanity induce I to have recourse to this expedient to save you from the destruction which hang over you give I leave sir to assure you that i be well acquaint with you situation a great extent of work in they nature incapable of defense man with a motley crew of sailor the greatest part we friend of citizen who wish to see we within they wall & a few of the worst troops who ever stile themselves soldier the impossibility of relief and the certain prospect of want every necessary of life should you opponent confine they operation to a simple blockade point out the absurdity of resistance such be you situation i be at the head of troops accustom to success confident of the righteousness of the cause they be engage in inure to danger & so highly incensed at you inhumanity illiberal abuse and the ungenerous means employ to prejudice they in the mind of the canadian that it be with difficulty i restrain they till my battery be ready from assault you work which afford they a fair opportunity of ample vengeance and just retaliation firing upon a flag of truce hitherto unprecedented even among savage prevent my take the ordinary mode of communicate my sentiment however i will at any rate acquit my conscience should you persist in a unwarrantable defense the consequence be upon you own head beware of destroy store of any kind publick or private as you have do at montreal and in three river -- if you do by heaven there will be no mercy show though montgomery write bunkum like the common politician of that and many a later age he be really a brave soldier what gall he into fury be ` grave carleton 's ' quiet refusal to recognize either he or any other rebel commander as the accredited leader of a hostile army it certainly must have be exasperate for the general of the continental congress to be reduce to such expedient as tie a grandiloquent ultimatum to a arrow and shooting it into the beleaguered town the charge of firing on flag of truce be another instance of ` talk for buncombe ' carleton never fire on any white flag but he always send the same answer : that he could hold no communication with any rebel unless they come to implore the king 's pardon this of course be a aggravation of he offensive calmness in the face of so much revolutionary rage to individual rebel of all sort he be if anything over-indulgent he would not burn the suburb of quebec till the enemy force he to it though many of the house that give the american the best cover belong to rebel canadian he go out of he way to be kind to all prisoner especially if sick or wounded and it be entirely owe to he restrain influence that the friendly indian have not raid the border settlement of new england during the summer nor be he animated only by the very natural desire of bring back rebellious subject to what he think they true allegiance as he subsequent action amply prove he simply act with the calm dignity and impartial justice which he position require three day before christmas the bombardment begin in earnest the non-combatant soon find to they equal amazement and delight that a good many shell do very little damage if fire about at random but news intend to make they flesh creep come in at the same time and probably have more effect than the shell on the weak-kneed member of the community seven hundred scaling-ladder no quarter if carleton persist in hold out and a prophecy attribute to montgomery that he would eat he christmas dinner either in quebec or in hell -- these be some of the blood-curdling item that come in by petticoat or arrow post one of the most active purveyor of all this bombast be jerry duggan a canadian ` patriot ' barber now become a continental major but there be a serious side deserter and prisoner as well as british adherent who have escape all begin to tell the same tale though with many variation montgomery be evidently bent on storm the wall the first dark night he own order show it head quarter holland house near quebec 15th decr 1755 the general have in vain offer the most favourable term of accommodation to the governor of quebec & have take every possible step to prevail on the inhabitant to desist from second he in he wild scheme of defend the town -- for the speedy reduction of the only hold possess by the ministerial troops in this province -- the soldier flush with continual success confident of the justice of they cause & rely on that providence which have uniformly protect they will advance with alacrity to the attack of work incapable of be defend by the wretched garrison post behind they consist of sailor unacquainted with the use of arm of citizen incapable of soldier ' duty & of a few miserable emigrant the general be confident that a vigorous & spirited attack must be attend with success the troops shall have the effect of the governor garrison & of such as have be active in mislead the inhabitant & distressing the friend of liberty equally divide among they except the 100th share out of the whole which shall be at the disposal of the general to be give to such soldier as distinguish themselves by they activity & bravery to be sell at public auction : the whole to be conduct as soon as the city be in we hand and the inhabitant disarm it be a week after these order have be write before the first positive news of the threaten assault be bring into town by a escape british prisoner who strangely enough bear the name of wolfe wolfe 's escape naturally cause a postponement of montgomery 's design and a further council of war unlike most council of war this one be full of fight three feint be to be make at different point while the real attack be to be drive home at cape diamond but just after this decision have be reach two rebel montrealer come down and in another debate carry the day for another plan these man antell and price be really responsible for the final plan which like its predecessor do not meet with montgomery 's approval montgomery want to make a breach before try the wall but he be no more than the chairman of a committee and this egregious committee first decide to storm the unbroken wall and then change to a attack on the lower town only antell be montgomery 's engineer price be a red-hot agitator both be better at politics than soldier they argument be that if the lower town could be take the quebec militia would force carleton to surrender in order to save the warehouse shipping and other valuable property along the waterfront and that even if carleton hold out in debate he would soon be bring to he knee by the american who would march through the gate which be to be open by the ` patriot ' inside another week pass and montgomery have not eat he christmas dinner either in quebec or in the other place but both side know the crisis must be fast approach for the new yorker have swear that they would not stay a minute later than the end of the year when they term of enlistment be up thus every day that pass make a immediate assault more likely as montgomery have to strike before he own man leave he yet new year 's eve itself begin without the sign of a alarm carleton have be sleep in he clothes at the recollet ' night after night so that he might be first on parade at the general rendezvous on the place d'arme which stand near the top of mountain hill the only road between the upper and the lower town officer and man off duty have be follow he example and every one be ready to turn out at a moment 's notice a north-easterly snowstorm be blow furiously straight up the st lawrence make quebec a partly see blur to the nearest american patrol and the height of abraham a wild sea of whirling drift to the nearest british sentry one o'clock pass and nothing stir but when two o'clock strike at holland house montgomery rise and begin to put the council 's plan in operation the lower town be to be attack at both end the pres-de-ville barricade be to be carry by montgomery and the sault-au-matelot by arnold while livingston be to distract carleton 's attention as much as possible by make a feint against the landward wall where the british still expect the real attack livingston 's canadian fighting ` patriot ' wade through the drift against the storm across the plain and take post close in on the far side of cape diamond only eighty yard from the same wall that be to have be storm some day before jerry duggan 's parasitic canadian ` patriot ' take post in the suburb of st john and thence round to palace gate montgomery lead he own column straight to wolfe 's cove whence he march in along the narrow path between the cliff and the st lawrence till he reach the spot at the foot of cape diamond just under the right of livingston 's line arnold whose quarter be in the valley of the st charle take post in st roch with a mortar battery to fire against the wall and a column of man to storm the sault-au-matelot livingston 's and jerry duggan 's whole command number about four hundred man montgomery 's five hundred arnold 's six the oppose total be fifteen hundred american against seventeen hundred british there be considerable risk of confusion between friend and foe as most of the american especially arnold 's man wear capture british uniform with nothing to distinguish they but odds and end of they former kit and a sort of paper hatband bear the inscription _ liberty or death _ a little after four the sentry on the wall at cape diamond see light flash about in front of they and be just go to call the guard when captain malcolm fraser of the royal emigrant come by on he round and see other light be set out in regular order like lamp in a street he instantly turn out the guard and picket the drum beat to arm every church bell in the city peal forth its alarm into that wild night the bugle blow the man off duty swarm on to the place d'arme where carleton calm and intrepid as ever take post with the general reserve and wait there be nothing for he to do just yet everything that could have be foresee have already be amply provide for and in he quiet confidence he follower find they own towards five o'clock two green rocket shoot up from montgomery 's position beside the anse des meres under cape diamond this be the signal for attack montgomery 's column immediately struggle on again along the path lead round the foot of the cape towards the pres-de-ville barricade livingston 's serious ` patriot ' on the top of the cape change they drop shot into a hot fire against the wall while jerry duggan 's little mob of would-be looter shout and blaze away from safer cover in the suburb of st john and st roch arnold 's mortar pitch shell all over the town while he storming-party advance towards the sault-au-matelot barricade carleton naturally anxious about the landward wall send some of the british militia to reinforce the man at cape diamond which as he know montgomery consider the best point of attack the wall lower down do not seem to be in any danger from jerry duggan 's ` patriot ' whose noisy demonstration be at once understand to be nothing but a empty feint the wall face the st charle be well manned and well gun by the naval battalion those face the st lawrence though weak in themselves be practically impregnable as the cliff could not be scale by any form body the lower town however be by no means so safe in spite of its two barricade the general uproar be now so great that carleton could not distinguish the firing there from what be go on elsewhere but it be at these two point that the real attack be rapidly develop the first decisive action take place at pres-de-ville the guard there consist of fifty man -- john coffin who be a merchant of quebec sergeant hugh mcquarter of the royal artillery captain barnsfair a merchant skipper with fifteen mate and skipper like himself and thirty french canadian under captain chabot and lieutenant picard these fifty man have to guard a front of only as many foot on they right cape diamond rise almost sheer on they left rage the stormy st lawrence they have a tiny block-house next to the cliff and four small gun on the barricade all double-charged with canister and grape they have hear the drop shot on the top of the cape for nearly a hour and have be quick to notice the change to a regular hot fire but they have no idea whether they own post be to be attack or not till they suddenly see the head of montgomery 's column halt within fifty pace of they a man come forward cautiously and look at the barricade the storm be in he face the defence be wreathe in whirling snow and the man inside keep silent as the grave when he go back a little group stand for a couple of minute in hurry consultation then montgomery wave he sword call out ` come on brave boy quebec be ours ' and lead the charge the defender let the american get about half-way before barnsfair shout ` fire ' then the gun and musket volley together cut down the whole front of the densely mass column montgomery he two staff-officer and he ten lead man be instantly kill some more farther back be wound and just as the fifty british fire they second round the rest of the five hundred american turn and run in wild confusion a few minute later a man whose identity be never establish come run from the lower town to say that arnold 's man have take the sault-au-matelot barricade if this be true it mean that the pres-de-ville fifty would be catch between two fire some of they make as if to run back and reach mountain hill before the american could cut they off but coffin at once threaten to kill the first man to move and by the time a artillery officer have arrive with reinforcement perfect order have be restore this officer finding he be not want there send back to know where else he be to go and receive a answer tell he to hurry to the sault-au-matelot when he arrive there less than half a mile off he find that desperate street fighting have be go on for over a hour arnold 's advance have begin at the same time as livingston 's demonstration and montgomery 's attack but he task be very different and the time require much longer there be three obstacle to be overcome first he man have to run the gauntlet of the fire from the bluejacket range along the grand battery which face the st charle at its mouth and overlook the narrow little street of sous-le-cap at a height of fifty or sixty foot then they have to take the small advanced barricade which stand a hundred yard on the st charle side of the actual sault-au-matelot or sailor 's leap which be the north-easterly point of the quebec promontory and nearly a hundred foot high finally they have to round this point and attack the regular sault-au-matelot barricade this second barricade be about a hundred yard long from the rock to the river it cross sault-au-matelot street and st peter street which be the same then as now but it end on a wharf half-way down the modern st jame street as the outer half of this street be then a natural strand completely cover at high tide it be much closer than the pres-de-ville barricade be to mountain hill at the top of which carleton hold he general reserve ready in the place d'arme and it be fairly strong in material and armament but it be at first defend by only a hundred man the american forlorn hope under captain oswald get past most of the grand battery unscathed but by the time the main body be follow under morgan the british blue-jacket be firing down from the wall at less than point-blank range the drive snow the clump of bush on the cliff and the little house in the street below all give the american some welcome cover but many of they be hit while the gun they be tow through the drift on a sleigh stick fast and have to be abandon captain dearborn the future commander-in-chief of the american army in the war of 1812 note in he diary that he ` meet the wound man very thick ' as he be bring up the rear when the forlorn hope reach the advanced barricade arnold halt it till the support have come up the loss of the gun and the worry he main body be receive from the sailor along the grand battery spoil he original plan of smashing in the barricade by shell fire while morgan circle round its outer flank on the ice of the tidal flat and take it in rear so he decide on a frontal attack when he think he have a fair chance he step to the front and shout ` now boy all together rush ' but before he could climb the barricade he be shoot through the leg for some time he prop himself up against a house and lean on he rifle continue encourage he man who be soon firing through the port-hole as well as over the top but presently grow faint from loss of blood he have to be carry off the field to the general hospital on the bank of the st charle the man now call out for a lead from morgan who climb a ladder leap the top and fall under a gun inside in another minute the whole forlorn hope have follow he while the main body come close behind the guard not strong in number and weak in be compose of young militiaman give way but keep on firing ` down with you arm if you want quarter ' yell morgan whose man be in overwhelming strength and the guard surrender a little way beyond just under the bluff of the sault-au-matelot the british support many of whom be seminary student also surrender to morgan who at once press on round the corner of the sault-au-matelot and halt in sight of the second or regular barricade what be to be do now where be montgomery how strong be the barricade and have it be reinforce it could not be turn because the cliff rise sheer on one flank while the icy st lawrence lash the other have morgan know that there be only a hundred man behind it when he attack its advanced barricade he might have press on at all cost and carry it by assault but it look strong there be gun on its platform and it run across two street he hurry council of war over-rule he as montgomery 's council have over-rule the original plan of storm the wall and so he man begin a desultory fight in the street and from the house this be fatal to american success the original british hundred be rapidly reinforce the artillery officer who have find that he be not need at the pres-de-ville after montgomery 's defeat and who have hurry across the intervene half-mile now occupy the corner house enlarged the embrasure and train he gun on the house occupy by the enemy detachment of fusilier and royal emigrant also arrive as do the thirty-five master and mate of merchant vessel who be not on guard with barnsfair at the pres-de-ville thus what with soldier sailor and militiaman of both race the main sault-au-matelot barricade be make secure against be rush like the outer one but there be plenty of fight with some confusion at close quarter cause by the british uniform which both side be wear a herculean sailor seize the first ladder the american set against the barricade haul it up and set it against the window of a house out of the far end of which the enemy be firing major nairne and lieutenant dambourge of the royal emigrant at once climb in at the head of a storming-party and wild work follow with the bayonet all the american inside be either kill or capture meanwhile a vigorous british nine-pounder have be turn on another house they occupy this house be likewise batter in so that its survive occupant have to run into the street where they be well ply with musketry by the regular and militiaman the chance for a sortie then seem favourable lieutenant anderson of the navy head he thirty-five merchant mate and skipper in a rush along sault-au-matelot street but he effort be premature morgan shoot he dead and morgan 's virginian drive the seaman back inside the barricade carleton have of course keep in perfect touch with every phase of the attack and defense and now fear no surprise against the wall in the grow daylight have decide on take arnold 's man in rear to do this he send captain lawe of the royal engineer and captain mcdougall of the royal emigrant with a hundred and twenty man out through palace gate this detachment have hardly reach the advanced barricade before they fall in with the enemy 's rearguard which they take by complete surprise and capture to a man leave mcdougall to secure these prisoner before follow on lawe push eagerly forward round the corner of the sault-au-matelot cliff and run in among the american face the main barricade call out ` you be all my prisoner ' ` no we be not you be ours ' they answer ` no no ' reply lawe as coolly as if on parade ` do not mistake yourselve i vow to god you be mine ' ` but where be you man ' ask the astonished american and then lawe suddenly find that he be utterly alone the roar of the storm and the work of secure the prisoner on the far side of the advanced barricade have prevent the man who should have follow he from understand that only a few be need with mcdougall but lawe put a bold face on it and answer ' o ho make yourselve easy my man be all round here and they 'll be with you in a twinkle ' he be then seize and disarm some of the american call out ` kill he kill he ' but a major meig protect he the whole parley have last about ten minute when mcdougall come run up with the miss man release lawe and make prisoner of the nearest american lawe at once step forward and call on the rest to surrender morgan be for cut he way through a few man run round by the wharf and escape on the tidal flat of the st charle but after a hurry consultation the main body include morgan lay down they arm this be decisive the british have win the fight the complete british loss in kill and wound be wonderfully small only thirty just one-tenth of the corresponding american loss which be large out of all proportion nearly half of the fifteen hundred american have go -- over four hundred prisoner and about three hundred kill and wound nor be the mere number the most telling point about it for the worse half escape -- livingston 's montreal ` patriot ' many of whom have do very little fight montgomery 's time-expired new yorker most of whom want to go home and jerry duggan 's miscellaneous rabble all of whom want a maximum of plunder with a minimum of war the british victory be as nearly perfect as could have be desire it mark the turn of the tide in a desperate campaign which might have result in the total loss of canada and it be of the greatest significance and happiest augury because all the racial element of this new and vast domain have here unite for the first time in defense of that which be to be they common heritage in carleton 's little garrison of regular and militia of bluejacket marine and merchant seaman there be frenchman and french canadian there be englishman irishman scotsman welshman orcadian and channel islander there be a few newfoundlander and there mere a good many of those steadfast royal emigrant who may be fitly call the forerunner of the unite empire loyalist yet in spite of this remarkable significance no public memorial of carleton have ever be set up and it be only in the twentieth century that the dominion first thought of commemorate he most pregnant victory by place tablet to mark the site of the two famous barricade as soon as thing have quiet down within the wall carleton send out search-party to bring in the dead for decent burial and to see if any of the wound have be overlook jame thompson the assistant engineer see a frozen hand protrude from a snowdrift at pres-de-ville it be montgomery 's the thirteen body be dig out and thompson be order to have a ` genteel coffin make for mr montgomery ' who be bury in the wall just above st loui gate by the anglican chaplain thompson keep montgomery 's sword which be give to the livingston family more than a century later the beleaguerment continue in a half-hearted way till the spring the american receive various small reinforcement which eventually bring they total up to what it have be under montgomery 's command but there be no more assault arnold grow dissatisfied and finally go to montreal while wooster the new general who arrive on the 1st of April be himself succeed by thoma a ex-apothecary on the 1st of may the suburb of st roch be burn down after the victory so the american sniper be bereft of some very favorite cover and this with other cause keep the bulk of the besieger at a ineffective distance from the wall the british garrison have certain little trouble of its own for discipline always tend to become irksome after a great effort carleton be oblige to stop the retailing of spirit for fear the slacker man would be get out of hand the guard and duty be make as easy as possible especially for the militia but the ` snow-shovel parade ' be a imperative necessity the winter be very stormy and the drift would have frequently cover the wall and even the gun if they have not promptly be dig out the cold be also unusually severe one early morning in January a angry officer be ask a sentry why he have not challenge he when the sentry say ` god bless you honor and i be glad you be come for i be blind ' then it be find that he eyelid be frozen fast together news come in occasionally from the outside world there be intense indignation among the garrison when they learn that the american commander in montreal be imprison every canadian officer who would not surrender he commission such a unheard-of outrage be worthy of walker but other must have think of it for walker be now in philadelphium give all the evidence he could against prescott and other british officer bad news for the rebel be naturally welcome especially anything about they grow failure to raise troops in canada on hearing of montgomery 's defeat the continental congress have pass a resolution address to the ` inhabitant of canada ' declare that ` we will never abandon you to the unrelenting fury of you and we enemy ' but there be no trained soldier to back this up and the raw militia though often fill with zeal and courage could do nothing to redress the increasingly adverse balance in the middle of march the american send in a summons but carleton refuse to receive it and the garrison put a wooden horse and a bundle of hay on the wall with a placard bear the inscription ` when this horse have eat this bunch of hay we will surrender ' some excellent practice make with 13-inch shell send the american fly from they new battery at levi and by the 17th of march one of the several exultant british diarist whose anonymity must have cover a irish name be able to record that ` this be st patrick 's day the governor who be a true hibernian have request the garrison to put off keep it till the 17th of may when he promise they shall be enable to do it properly and with the usual solemnity ' a fortnight later a plot concerted between the american prisoner and they friend outside be discover just in time with tool supply by traitor they be to work they way out of they quarter overpower the guard at the nearest gate set fire to the nearest house in three different street turn the nearest gun inwards on the town and shout ` liberty for ever ' as a additional signal to the storming-party that be to be wait to confirm they success carleton seize the chance of turn this scheme against the enemy three safe bonfire be set ablaze the marked gun be turn inwards and fire at the town with blank charge and the preconcerted shout be raise with a will but the besieger never stir after this the old-countryman among the prisoner who have take the oath and enlist in the garrison be disarm and confine while the rest be more strictly watch two brave attempt be make by french canadian to reach quebec with reinforcement one head by a seigneur the other by a parish priest carleton have send word to m de beaujeu seigneur of crane island forty mile below quebec ask he to see if he could cut off the american detachment on the levi shore de beaujeu raise three hundred and fifty man but arnold send over reinforcement a habitant betray he fellow-countryman 's advance-guard a dozen french canadian be then kill or wound while forty be take prisoner whereupon the rest disperse to they home the other attempt be make by father bailly whose little force of about fifty man be also betray entrap in a country-house these man fight bravely till nearly half they number have be kill or wound and the valiant priest have be mortally hit they then surrender to a much stronger force which have lose more man than they this be on the 6th of April just before arnold be leave in disgust wooster make a effort to use he new artillery to advantage by converge the fire of three battery one close in on the height of abraham another from across the mouth of the st charle and the third from levi but the combination fail : the battery be too light for the work and overmatch by the gun on the wall the practice be bad and the effect be nil on the 3rd of may the new general thoma a enterprising man try a fireship which be mean to destroy all the shipping in the cul de sac it come on under full sail in a very threatening manner but the crew lose they nerve at the critical moment take to the boat too soon and forget to lash the helm the vessel immediately fly up into the wind and as the tidal stream be already change begin to drift away from the cul de sac just when she burst into flame the result as describe by a enthusiastic british diarist be that ` she affoard would a very pritty prospect while she be float down the river every now & then send up sky racket firing of cannon or bursting of shell & so continued till she disappear would in the channell ' three day later on the 6th of may when the beleaguerment have last precisely five month the sound of distant gunfire come faintly up the st lawrence with the first breath of the dawn wind from the east the sentry listen to make sure then call the sergeant of the guard who send word to the officer on duty who in they turn send word to carleton by this time there could be no mistake the breeze be freshen the sound be gradually near quebec and there could hardly be room for doubt that it come from the vanguard of the british fleet the drum beat to arm the church bell ring the news fly round to every household in quebec and before the top of the _ surprise _ frigate be see over the point of levy every battery be fully man every battalion be stand ready on the grand parade and every non-combatant man woman and child be line the seaward wall the regulation shot be fire across she bow as she near the city whereupon she fire three gun to leeward hoist the private signal and show the union jack then at last a cheer go up that tell both friend and foe of british victory and american defeat by a strange coincidence the parole for this triumphal day be st george while the parole appoint for the victorious new year 's eve have be st deni so that the patron saint of france and england happen to be associate with the two great day on which the stronghold of canada be save by land and sea the same tide bring in two other men-of-war some soldier of the 29th who be on board the _ surprise _ be immediately land together with the marine from all three vessel carleton call for volunteer from the militia to attack the american at once and nearly every man both of the french - and of the english-speaking corps step forward there be joy in every heart that the day for striking back have come at last the column march gaily through the gate and deploy into line at the double on the height outside the american fire a few hurry shot and then run for dear life leave they dinner cooking and in some case even they arm behind they the plain be cover with fly enemy and strew with every sort of impediment to flight from a cannon to a loaf of bread quebec have be save by british sea-power and with it the whole vast dominion of which it be the key chapter vi deliverance 1776 the continental congress have always be anxious to have delegate from the fourteenth colony but as these never come the congress finally decide to send a special commission to examine the whole civil and military state of canada and see what could be do the news of montgomery 's death and defeat be a very unwelcome surprise but reinforcement be be send the canadian could surely be persuade and a congressional commission must be able to set thing right this commission be a very strong one benjamin franklin be the chairman samuel chase of maryland and charle carroll of carrollton be the other member carroll 's brother the future archbishop of baltimore accompany they as a sort of ecclesiastical diplomatist franklin 's prestige and the fact that he be to set up a ` free ' printing-press in montreal be to work wonder with the educate class at once and with the uneducated mass later on chase would appeal to all the reasonable ` moderate ' carroll a great landlord and the nearest approach yet make to a american millionaire be expect to charm the canadian noblesse while the fact that he and he exceedingly diplomatic brother be devout roman catholic be think to be by itself a powerful argument with the clergy when they reach st john towards the end of April the commissioner send on a courier to announce they arrival and prepare for they proper reception in montreal but the ferryman at laprairie positively refuse to accept continental paper money at any price and it be only when a ` friend of liberty ' give he a dollar in silver that he consent to cross the courier over the st lawrence the same hitch occur in montreal where the same friend of liberty have to pay in silver before the cab-driver consent to accept a fare either from he or from the commissioner even the name of carroll of carrollton be conjure with in vain the french canadian remember bigot 's bad french paper they worst suspicion be be confirm about the equally bad american paper so they demand nothing but hard cash -- _ argent dur _ however the first great obstacle have be successfully overcome and so on the strength of five borrow silver dollar the accredit commissioner of the continental congress of the thirteen colony make they state entry into what they still hope to call the fourteenth colony but silver dollar be scarce and on the 1st of may the crestfallen commissioner have to send the congress a financial report which may best be sum up in a pithy phrase which soon become proverbial -- ` not worth a continental ' on the 10th of may they hear the bad news from quebec and increase the panic among they montreal sympathizer by hastily leave the city lest they should be cut off by a british man-of-war franklin foresee the end and leave for philadelphium accompany by the reverend john carroll whose twelve day of disheartening experience with the lead french-canadian clergy have convince he that they be impervious to any argument or blandishments emanate from the continental congress it be a sad disillusionment for the commissioner who have expect to be settle the affair of a fourteenth colony instead of be oblige to leave the city from which they be to have enlighten the people with a free press in they first angry ignorance they lay the whole blame on they unfortunate army for its ` disgraceful flight ' from quebec a week later when chase and charle carroll ought to have know better they be still assure the congress that this ` shameful retreat ' be ` the principal cause of all the disorder ' in the army and even after the whole story ought to have be understand neither they nor the congress give they army its proper due but as a matter of fact the american position have become untenable the moment the british fleet begin to threaten the american line of communication with montreal for the rest the american volunteer all thing consider have do very well indeed arnold 's march be a truly magnificent feat morgan 's man have fight with great courage at the sault-au-matelot and though montgomery 's assault might well have be better plan and execute we must remember that the good plan which have be reject be the military one while the bad plan which have be adopt be concoct by mere politician nor be ` all the disorder ' so severely condemn by the commissioner due to the army alone far from it indeed the root of ` all the disorder ' lay in the fact that a makeshift government be oblige to use makeshift levy for a invasion which require a regular army support by a fleet on the 19th of may another disaster happen this time above montreal the congress have not feel strong enough to attack the western post so captain forster of the 8th foot finding that he be free to go elsewhere have come down from oswegatchie -lrb- the modern ogdensburg -rrb- with a hundred whites and two hundred indian and make prisoner of four hundred and thirty american at the cedar about thirty mile up the st lawrence from montreal forster be a very good officer butterfield the american commander be a very bad one and that make all the difference after two day of feeble and misdirected defense butterfield surrender three hundred and fifty man the other eighty be reinforcement who walk into the trap next day forster now have four american prisoner for every white soldier of he own while arnold be near by have come up from sorel to lachine with a small but determine force so forster carefully point out to he prisoner they danger if the indian should be reinforce and run wild offer they they freedom on condition that they should be regard as be exchange for a equal number of british prisoner in american hand this be agree to and never make a matter of dispute afterwards but the second article butterfield accept be a stipulation that while the release british be to be free to fight again the release american be not and it be over this point that a bitter controversy rage the british authority maintain that all the term be bind because they have be accept by a officer commission by the congress the congress maintain that the disputed article be obtain by a unfair threat of a indian massacre and that it be so one-sided as to be good for nothing but repudiation ` the affair at the cedar ' thus become a sorely vex question in itself it would have die out among later and more important issue if it have not be use as a torch to fire american public opinion at a time when the congress be particularly anxious to make the thirteen colony as anti-british as possible most of forster 's man be indian he have remind butterfield how dangerous a increase number of indian might become butterfield be naturally anxious to prove that he have yield only to overwhelming odds and horrifying risk american in general be ready to believe anything bad about the indian and the british the temptation and the opportunity seem make for each other and so a quite imaginary indian massacre conveniently appear in the american news of the day and help to form the kind of public opinion which be ardently desire by the party of revolt the british evidence in this and many another embitter dispute about the indian need not be cite since the follow item of american evidence do ample justice to both side in the spring of 1775 the massachusett provincial congress send samuel kirkland to exhort the iroquois ` to whet they hatchet and be prepare to defend we liberty and life ' while ethan allen ask the indian round vermont to treat he ` like a brother and ambush the regular ' in 1776 the continental congress secretly resolve ` that it be highly expedient to engage the indian in the service of the unite colony ' this be before the member know about the affair at the cedar a few day later washington be secretly authorize to raise two thousand indian while agent be secretly send ` to engage the six nation in we interest on the best term that can be procure ' within three week of this secret arrangement the declaration of independence publicly accuse the king of try ` to bring on the inhabitant of we frontier the merciless indian savage ' four day after this public accusation the congress give order for raise indian along ` the penobscot the st john and in nova scotium ' and a entry to that effect be make in its secret journal yet before the month be out the same congress publicly appeal to ` the people of ireland ' in the follow word : ` the wild and barbarous savage of the wilderness have be solicit by gift to take up the hatchet against we and instigate to deluge we settlement with the blood of defenceless woman and child ' the american defeat at quebec and at the cedar completely change the position of the two remain commissioner they have expect to control a victorious advance they find themselves the highest authority present with a disastrous retreat thereupon they make blunder after blunder public interest and parliamentary control be the very life of army and navy in every country which enjoy the blessing of self-government but civilian interference be death yet chase and carroll practically abolish rank in the disintegrate army by become a open court of appeal to every junior with a grievance or a plan there never be a occasion on which military rule be more essential in military matter yet though they candidly admit that they have ` neither ability nor inclination ' to command these wretched misruler try to do they duty both to the congress and the army by turn the camp into a sort of town meeting where the best order have no chance whatever against the loudest ` sentiment ' they have themselves find the root of all evil in the retreat from quebec they army like every impartial critic find it in ` the commissioner and the smallpox ' -- with the commissioner easily first the smallpox have be bad enough at quebec it become far worse at sorel there be few doctor fewer medicine and not a single hospital the reinforcement melt away with the army they be mean to strengthen famine threaten both even in may finally the commissioner leave for home at the end of the month but even they departure could no longer make the army 's burden light enough to bear thoma the ex-apothecary who do he best to stem the adverse tide of trouble catch the smallpox become blind and die at the beginning of June sullivan the fourth commander in less than half a year have determine that one more effort should be make arrive at sorel with new battalion after innumerable difficulty by the way he be lead to believe that carleton 's reinforcement have come from nova scotium not from england and this encourage he to push on farther he be naturally of a very sanguine temper and thompson he second-in-command heartily approve of the dash the new troops cheer up and thought of take quebec itself but after get mislead by they guide flounder about in bottomless bog and lose a great deal of very precious time they find three river defend by entrenchment superior number and the vanguard of the british fleet nevertheless they attack bravely on the 8th of June but take in front and flank by well-drilled regular and well-handled men-of-war they presently break and flee every avenue of escape be close as they wander about the wood and bog but carleton who come up from quebec after the battle be all over purposely open the way to sorel he have do he best to win the heart of he prisoner at quebec and have succeed so well that when they return to crown point they be keep away from the rest of the american army lest they account of he kindness should affect its anti-british zeal now that he be in overwhelming force he think he see a even better chance of earn gratitude from rebel and win convert to the loyal side by a still greater act of clemency the battle of three river be the last action fight on canadian soil the american army retreat to sorel and up the richelieu to st john where it be join by arnold who have just evacuate montreal most of the friend of liberty in canada flee either with or before they beaten force so like the ebbing of a whole river system the main and tributary stream of fugitive draw south towards lake champlain the neutral french canadian turn against they at once though not to the extent of make a actual attack the habitant care nothing for the incomprehensible constitutionality over which different kind of british foreigner be fight they exasperating civil war but he do know what the king 's big fleet and army mean he do begin to feel that he own way of life be safer with the loyal than with the rebel side and he quite understand that he have be force to give a good deal for nothing ever since the american commissioner have authorize they famishing army to commandeer he supplies and pay he with they worthless ` continental ' from st john the worn-out american crawl homewards in stray exhaust party drop fast by the way as they go ' i do not look into a hut or a tent ' write a horrified observer ` in which i do not find a dead or die man ' disorganization become so complete that no exact return be ever make up but it be know that over ten thousand armed man cross into canada from first to last and that not far short of half this total either find they death beyond the line or bring it back with they to lake champlain it be on what long afterwards become dominion day -- the 1st of July -- that the ruin american force reassemble at crown point have abandon all hope of make canada the fourteenth colony three day later the disappointed thirteen issue the declaration of independence which virtually proclaim that canadian and american should thenceforth live a separate life chapter vii the counterstroke 1776-1778 six thousand british troops command by burgoyne and four thousand german command by baron riedesel have arrive at quebec before the battle of three river quebec itself have then be leave to the care of a german garrison under a german commandant ` that excellent man colonel baum ' while the great bulk of the army have march up the st lawrence as we have see already such a force as this new one of carleton 's be expect to dismay the rebel colony and so to a great extent it do with a much larger force in the colony themselves the king be confidently expect to master he unruly subject no matter how much they proclaim they independence the loyalist be encourage the trimmer prepare to join they only those steadfast american who hold they cause dearer than life itself be still determine to venture all but they form the one party that really know its own mind this give they a great advantage over the king 's party which hamper at every turn by the opposition in the mother country be never quite sure whether it ought to strike hard or gently in america on one point however everybody be agree the command of lake champlain be essential to whichever side would hold its own the american force at crown point might be too weak for the time be but arnold know that even ten thousand british soldier could not overrun the land without a naval force to help they so he get together a flotilla which have everything its own way during the time that carleton be laboriously build a rival flotilla on the richelieu with a very scanty supply of ship-wright and material arnold moreover could devote he whole attention to the work makeshift as it have to be while carleton be oblige to keep move about the province in a effort to bring it into some sort of order after the late invasion throughout the summer the british army hold the line of the richelieu all the way south as far as isle-aux-noix very near the lake and the line but carleton 's flotilla could not set sail from st john till October 5 by which time the main body of he army be concentrated round pointe-au-fer at the northern end of the lake ninety mile north of the american camp at crown point it be a curious situation for a civil and military governor to be hoist he flag as a naval commander-in-chief however small the fleet might be but it be commonly ignore that down to the present day the governor-general of canada be appoint ` vice-admiral of the same ' in he commission from the crown carleton of course carry expert naval officer with he and have enough professional seaman to work the vessel and lay the gun but though captain pringle manoeuvre the flotilla and lieutenant dacre handle the flagship _ carleton _ the actual command remain in carleton 's own hand the capital ship -lrb- and the only real square-rigged ` ship ' -rrb- of this lilliputian fleet be pringle 's _ inflexible _ which have be take up the richelieu in section and haul past the portage with immense labor before reach st john whence there be a clear run upstream to lake champlain the _ inflexible _ carry thirty gun mostly 12-pounder and be a overmatch for quite the half of arnold 's decidedly weaker flotilla the _ lady marium _ be a sort of sister ship to the _ carleton _ the little armada be complete by a ` gondola ' with six 9-pounder by twenty gunboat and four longboat each carry a single piece and by many small craft use as transport on the 11th of October carleton 's whole naval force be sail south when one of arnold 's vessel be see make for valcor island a few mile still farther south on the same or western side of lake champlain presently the yankee run ashore on the southern end of the island where she be immediately attack by some british small craft while the _ inflexible _ sail on then to the intense disgust of the _ inflexible _ 's crew arnold 's complete flotilla be suddenly discover draw up in a masterly position between the mainland and the island it be too late for the _ inflexible _ to beat back now but the rest of carleton 's flotilla turn in to the attack arnold 's flank rest on the island and the mainland he rear could be approach only by beat back against a bad wind all the way round the outside of valcor island and even if this maneuver could have be perform the british attack on he rear from the north could have be make only in a piecemeal way because the channel be there at its narrowest with a bad obstruction in the middle so for every reason a frontal attack from the south be the one way of close with he the fight be furious while it last and seemingly decisive when it end arnold 's best vessel the _ royal savage _ which he have take at st john the year before be drive ashore and capture the other be so severely maul that when the victorious british anchor they superior force in line across arnold 's front there seem to be no chance for he to escape the follow day but that night he perform a even more daring and wonderful feat than bouchette have perform the year before when paddle carleton through the american line among the island opposite sorel use muffle sweep with consummate skill he slip all he remain vessel between the mainland and the nearest british gunboat and be well on he way to crown point before he escape have be discover next day carleton chase south the day after he destroy the whole of the enemy 's miniature sea-power as a fight force but the only three serviceable vessel get away while arnold burnt everything else likely to fall into british hand so carleton have no more than he own reduce flotilla to depend on when he occupy crown point a vexed question destine to form part of a momentous issue now arise should ticonderoga be attack at once or not it command the only feasible line of march from montreal to new york and no force from canada could therefore attack the new republic effectively without take it first but the season be late the fort be strong well gun and well manned carleton 's reconnaissance convinced he that he could have little chance of reduce it quickly if at all with the means at hand especially as the american have supplies close by at lake george while he be now a hundred mile south of he base a winter siege be impossible sufficient supplies could never be bring through the dense snow-encumbered bush all the way from canada even if the long and harass line of communication have not be everywhere open to american attack moreover carleton 's army be in no way prepare for a midwinter campaign even if it could have be supply with food and warlike store so he very sensibly turn he back on lake champlain until the following year that be the gayest winter quebec have see since montcalm 's first season twenty year before carleton have be knight for he service and be naturally suppose to be the choose leader for the next campaign the ten thousand troops give confidence to the loyalist and promise success for the come campaign the clergy be get they disillusioned parishioner back to the fold beneath the union jack while _ jean ba ` tis ` e _ himself be fain to admit that he own way of life and the money he get for he goods be very much safer with _ les angla 's _ than with the revolutionist whom he call _ les bastonna 's _ because most trade between quebec and the thirteen colony be carry on by vessel hail from the port of boston the seigneur be delighted they still hope for commission as regular which too few of they ever receive and they be charm with the little viceregal court over which lady marium carleton despite she youthful two-and-twenty summer preside with a dignity inherit from the premier ducal family of england and bring to the acme of conventional perfection by she intimate experience of versaille on new year 's eve carleton give a public fete a state dinner and a ball to celebrate the anniversary of the british victory over montgomery and arnold the bishop hold a special thanksgiving and make all notorious renegade do open penance nothing seem want to bring the new year in under the happiest auspices since british rule begin but quite unknown to carleton mischief be brewing in the colonial office of that unhappy government which do so many stupid thing and get the credit for so many more in 1775 the well-meaning earl of dartmouth be supersede by lord george germain who continue the mismanagement of colonial affair for seven disastrous year few character have abuse civil and military position more than the man who first as a british general disgrace the noble name of sackville on the battlefield of minden in 1759 and then as a cabinet minister disgrace throughout america the plebeian one of germain which he take in 1770 with a suitable legacy attach to it he crime at minden be set down by the thoughtless public to sheer cowardice but sackville be no coward he have bear himself with conspicuous gallantry at fontenoy he be admire before minden by two very brave soldier wolfe and the duke of cumberland and he afterwards fight a famous duel with as much sang-froid as any one would care to see he real crime at minden be admirably expose by the court-martial which find he ` guilty of have disobey the order of prince ferdinand of brunswick whom he be by he commission bind to obey as commander-in-chief accord to the rule of war ' this court also find he ` unfit to serve he majesty in any military capacity whatever ' and george ii direct that the follow ` remark ' should be add when the sentence be read out on parade to every regiment in the service : ` it be he majesty 's pleasure that the above sentence be give out in public order not only in britain but in america and in every quarter of the globe where british troops happen to be so that all officer be convince that neither high birth nor great employment can shelter offence of such a nature and see they be subject to censure worse than death to a man who have any sense of honor may avoid the fatal consequence arise from disobedience of order ' this seem to mark the end of sackville 's sinister career but when george ii die and george iii begin to reign with a very different set of man to help he the bad general reappear as a equally bad politician haughty cantankerous and self-opinionated to the last degree germain who have many perverse ability fitting he for the meaner side of party politics be appoint to the post for which he be least qualified just when canada and the thirteen colony most need a master mind worse still he cherish a contemptible grudge against carleton for have refuse to turn out a good officer and put in a bad one who happen to be a pampered favorite at first however carleton be allow to do he best but in the summer of 1776 germain restricted carleton 's command to canada and put burgoyne a junior officer in command of the army destine to make the counterstroke the ship bearing this malicious order have to put back so it be not till the middle of may 1777 that carleton be disillusion by its arrival as well as by a second and still more exasperating dispatch accuse he of neglect of duty for not have take ticonderoga in November and thus prevent washington from capture the hessian at trenton the physical impossibility of a winter siege the three hundred mile of hostile country between trenton and ticonderoga and the fact that the other lead british general howe have thirty thousand troops in the colony while carleton have only ten thousand with which to hold canada that year and act as order next year all go for nothing when germain find a chance to give a good stab in the back on may 20 carleton write a pungent reply point out the utter impossibility of follow up he victory on lake champlain by carry out germain 's arm-chair plan of operation in the middle of winter ' i regard it as a particular blessing that you lordship 's dispatch do not arrive in due time ' as for the disaster at trenton he ` beg to inform he lordship ' that if howe 's thirty thousand man have be properly use the hessian could never have be take ` though all the rebel from ticonderoga have reinforce mr washington 's army ' moreover ' i never could imagine why if troops so far south -lrb- as howe 's -rrb- find it necessary to go into winter quarter you lordship could possibly expect troops so far north to continue they operation ' a week later carleton write again and send in he resignation ` finding that i can no longer be of use under you lordship 's administration i flatter myself i shall obtain the king 's permission to return home this fall i shall embark with great satisfaction still entertain the ardent wish that after my departure the dignity of the crown in this unfortunate province may not appear beneath you lordship 's concern ' burgoyne have spend the winter in london and have arrive at quebec about the same time as germain 's dispatch he have loyally represent carleton 's plan at headquarters but he do not know america and he be not great enough to see the weak point in the plan which germain propose to carry out with wholly inadequate means there be nothing wrong with the actual idea of this plan washington carleton and every other lead man on either side see perfectly well that the british army ought to cut the rebel in two by hold the direct line from montreal to new york throughout the come campaign of 1777 give the irresistible british command of the sea fifty thousand troops be enough the general idea be that half of these should hold the four-hundred-mile line of the richelieu lake champlain and the hudson while the other half seize strategic point elsewhere and still further divide the american force but the troops employ be ten thousand short of the proper number many of they be foreign mercenary and the general be not the man to smash the enemy at all cost they be ready to do they duty but they affinity be rather with the opposition which be against the war than with the government which be for it howe be a strong whig burgoyne become a follower of fox clinton have many whig connection cornwallis vote against colonial taxation to make matter worse the government itself waver between out-and-out war and some sort of compromise both with its political opponent at home and its armed opponent in america under these circumstance carleton be in favor of a modify plan ticonderoga have be abandon by the american and occupy by the british as burgoyne march south carleton 's idea be to use it as a base of operation against new england while howe 's main body strike at the main body of the rebel and break they up as much as possible germain however be all for the original plan so burgoyne set off for the hudson expect to get into touch with howe at albany but germain in he haste to leave town for a holiday forget to sign howe 's order at the proper time and afterwards forget they altogether so howe pro-american in politics and temporizer in the field manoeuvre round he own headquarters at new york until October when he sail south to philadelphium receive no order from germain and have no initiative of he own he have make no attempt to hold the line of the hudson all the way north to albany where he could have meet burgoyne and complete the union of the force which would have cut the colony in two meanwhile burgoyne ignorant of germain 's neglect and howe 's futility be struggle to he fate at saratoga north of albany he have be receive constant aid from carleton 's scanty resource though carleton know full well that the send of any aid beyond the limit of the province expose he to personal ruin in case of a reverse in canada but it be all in vain and on the 17th of October burgoyne -- much more sin against than sinning -- lay down he arm the british garrison immediately evacuate ticonderoga and retire to st john thus make carleton 's position fairly safe in canada but germain only too glad to oust he have now notify he that haldimand the new governor be on the point of sailing for quebec haldimand to he great credit have ask to have he own appointment cancel when he hear of germain 's shameful attitude towards carleton and have only consent to go after be satisfy that carleton really wish to come home the exchange however be not to take place that year contrary wind blow haldimand back and so canada have to remain under the best of all possible governor in spite of germain germain have provoke carleton past endurance both by he public blunder and by he private malice even in 1776 there be hate on one side contempt on the other when germain have blame carleton for not carry out the idiotic winter siege of ticonderoga carleton in he official reply ` could only suppose ' that he lordship have act ` in other place with such great wisdom that without we assistance the rebel must immediately be compel to lay down they arm and implore the king 's mercy ' after that germain have murder in he heart to the bitter end of carleton 's rule carleton have frequently report the critical state of affair in canada ` there be nothing to fear from the canadian so long as thing be in a state of prosperity nothing to hope from they when in distress there be some of they who be guide by sentiment of honor the multitude be influence by hope of gain or fear of punishment ' the recent invasion have prove this up to the hilt then welcome reaction begin the defeat of the invader the arrival of burgoyne 's army and the effort of the seigneur and the clergy have considerably brighten the prospects of the british cause in canada the partial mobilization of the militia which follow burgoyne 's surrender be not indeed a great success but it be far better than the fiasco of two year before there be also a corresponding improvement in civil life the judge whom carleton have be oblige to appoint in haste all prove at leisure the wisdom of he choice and there seem to be every chance that other nominee would be equally fit for they position because the quebec act which annul every appointment make before it come into force open the way for the exclusion of bad official and the inclusion of the good but the chance of pervert this excellent intention be too much for germain who succeed in foist one worthless nominee after another on the province just as carleton be do he best to heal old sore one of the worst case be that of livius a low-down money-grubbing german portuguese who oust the future master of the roll sir william grant a man most admirably fit to interpret the law of canada with knowledge sympathy and absolute impartiality livius as chief justice be more than carleton could stand in silence this mongrel lawyer have pick up all the yankee vice without acquire any of the countervail yankee virtue he be ` greedy of power more greedy of gain imperious and impetuous in he temper but learn in the way and eloquence of the new england province and value himself particularly on he knowledge of how to manage governor ' he have be send by germain ` to administer justice to the canadian when he understand neither they law manners custom nor language ' other like nominee follow ` character regardless of the public tranquility but zealous to pay court to a powerful minister and -- provide they can obtain advantage -- unconcerned should the means of obtain they prove ruinous to the king 's service ' these pettifogger so turn and twist the law about for the sake of screw out the maximum of fee that carleton pointedly refuse to appoint livius as a member of the legislative council livius then lay he case before the privy council in england but this great court of ultimate appeal pronounce such a damning judgment on he gross pretension that even germain could not prevent he final dismissal from all employment under the crown wound in the house of those who should have be he friend thwart in every measure of he self-sacrificing rule carleton serve on devotedly through six weary month of 1778 -- the year in which a vindictive government of bourbon france become the first of the several foreign enemy who make the new american republic a accomplished fact by take side in a british civil war he burden be now far more than any man could bear yet he close he answer to germain 's parting shot with word which be as noble as he deed : ' i have long look out for the arrival of a successor happy at last to learn he near approach i resign the important command with which i have be entrust into hand less obnoxious to you lordship thus for the king 's service as willingly i lay they down as for he service i take they up ' chapter viii guard the loyalist 1782-1783 burgoyne 's surrender mark the turning of the tide against the british arm true the three campaign of purely civil war begin in 1775 have reach no decisive result true also that the independence declare in 1776 have no apparent chance of become a accomplished fact but 1777 be the fatal year for all that the long political strife in england the gross mismanagement of colonial affair under germain and the shameful blunder that make saratoga possible all combine to encourage foreign power to take the field against the king 's incompetent and distract ministry france spain and holland join the american in arm while russium sweden denmark prussium and all the german seaboard country form the armed neutrality of the north this make stupendous odds -- no less than ten to one first of the ten come the political opposition at home which in regard to the american rebellion itself be at least equal to the most powerful enemy abroad next come the four enemy in arm : the american rebel france spain and holland finally come the five armed neutral all ready to use they navy on the slightest provocation from this it may be see that not one-half perhaps not a quarter of all the various force that win the revolutionary war be purely american nor be the american and they ally together victorious over the mother country but only over one sorely hamper party in it yet from the nature of the case the american get much more than the lion 's share of the spoil while even in they own eye they seem to have gain honor and glory in the same proportion the last real campaign be fight in 1781 and end with the british surrender at yorktown from that time on peace be in the air the unfortunate ministry now on the eve of political defeat at home be sick of civil war and only too anxious for a chance of unite all party against the foreign foe but they have first to settle with the american who have consider themselves a independent sovereign power for the last five year and who be determine to make the most of england 's difficulty no darker new year 's day have ever dawn on any cabinet than that of 1782 on north 's in spite of he change from repression to conciliation and in spite of dismiss germain to the house of lord with a ill-earned peerage lord north find he majority dwindle away at last on the 20th of march he resign meanwhile every real statesman in either party have feel that the crisis require the master-hand of carleton with germain the empire-wrecker go carleton would doubtless have serve under any cabinet for no government could have do without he but he actual commission come through the rockingham administration on the 4th of April after three quiet year of retirement at he country seat in hampshire he be again call upon to face a situation of extreme difficulty for once with a wisdom rare enough in any age and almost unknown in that one the government give he a free hand and almost unlimited power the only question over which he have no final power be those of make treaty he be appoint ` general and commander-in-chief of all he majesty 's force within the colony lie in the atlantic ocean from nova scotium to the florida and inclusive of newfoundland and canada should they be attack ' he be also appoint commissioner for execute the term of any treaty that might be make and he instruction contain two passage which bear eloquent witness to the universal confidence repose in he ` it be impossible to judge of the precise situation at so great a distance ' and ` he majesty 's affair be so situate that further deliberation give way to instant decision we be satisfied that whatever inconvenience may arise they will be compensate by the presence of a commander-in-chief of whose discretion conduct and ability he majesty have long entertain the highest opinion ' thus the great justifier of british rule beyond the sea arrive in new york on the 9th of may 1782 with at least some hope of reconcile enough american to turn the scale before it be too late for three month the prospect though worse than he have anticipate do not seem utterly hopeless it have be considerably brighten by rodney 's great victory over the french fleet which be on its way to attack jamaica but a unfortunate incident happen to be exasperating loyalist and revolutionist at this very time some revolutionist have kill a loyalist name philip white apparently out of pure hate some loyalist under captain lippincott then seize and hang joshua huddy a captain in the congress militia out of sheer revenge a paper leave pin on huddy 's breast bear the inscription : ` up go huddy for philip white ' washington then demand that lippincott should be deliver up and on carleton 's refusal choose a british prisoner by lot instead the lot fall on a young lieutenant asgill of the guard whose mother appeal to the king and queen of france and to they powerful minister vergenne the american congress want blood for blood which would have lead to a endless vendetta but vergenne point out that asgill a youth of nineteen be as much a prisoner of the king of france as of the continental congress at this the congress gnash its tooth but have to give way while the asgill affair be still run its course and embitter loyalist and rebel more than ever carleton be suddenly inform that the government have decide to grant complete independence this be more than he could stand and he at once ask to be recall he have be all for honorable reconciliation from the first he have be particularly kind to he american prisoner in canada and have purposely refrain from annihilate the american army after the battle of three river but he be not prepare for independence nor have he be send out with this ostensible object in view he official instruction be to inform the american that ` the most liberal sentiment have take root in the nation and that the narrow policy of monopoly be totally extinguish ' now he be call upon to surrender without have try either he arm or he diplomacy with british sea-power begin to reassert its age-long superiority over all possible rival with practically all constitutional point of dispute concede to the revolutionist and with the certain knowledge that by no mean the majority of all american be absolute anti-british out-and-outer he think it no time to dismember the empire he intelligence department have be busily collect information which seem surprising enough as we read it over to-day but which be base on the solid fact of that unhappy time one member of the continental congress be anxious to know what would become of the american army if reconciliation should be effect on the understanding that there would be no more imperial taxation or custom duty -- would it become part of the imperial army or what but speculation on all such contingency be suddenly cut short by the complete change of policy at home the idea be to end the civil war that have divide the empire and to concentrate on the foreign war that at least unite the people of great britain no matter at what cost this policy have now to be carry out and carleton be the only man that every one would trust to do it so sacrifice he own feeling and conviction he make the best of a exceedingly bad business he have to safeguard the prisoner and loyalist while prepare to evacuate the few remain foothold of british power in the face of a implacable foe at the same time he have to watch every other point in north america and keep in touch with he excellent naval colleague admiral digby lest he own rear might be attack by the three foreign enemy of england he be even order off to the west indy in the autumn but counter-order fortunately arrive before he could start thus surround by enemy in front and rear and on both flank he spend the seven month between August and the follow march at the end of march 1783 news arrive that the preliminary treaty of peace have be sign the final treaty be not sign till he fifty-ninth birthday the 3rd of the follow September the signature of the preliminary simplify the naval and military situation but it make the situation of the loyalist worse than ever compare with they the prisoner of war have be most highly favor from the first and yet the british prisoner have little to thank the congress for that they be badly feed and badly house be not always the fault of the american but that political favorite and underling be allow to prey on they be a inexcusable disgrace when a prisoner complain he be tell it be the fault of the british government which would not pay for he keep this answer so contrary to all the accept usage of war which reserve such payment till after the conclusion of peace be no empty gibe for when some time before the preliminary have be sign the british and american commissioner meet to effect a exchange of prisoner the american begin by claim the immediate payment of what the british prisoner have cost they this of course break up the meeting at once in the meantime the german prisoner in british pay be offer they freedom at eighty dollar a head then farmer come forward to buy up these prisoner at this price but the farmer find competitor in the recruiting sergeant who urge the german with only too much truth not to become ` the slave of farmer ' but to follow ` the glorious trade of war ' against they employer the british government to they honor be it say these german keep faith with the british much to the surprise of the american who like many modern writer could not understand that these foreign mercenary take a professional pride in carry out a swear contract even when it would pay they better to break it the british prisoner be not put up for sale in the same way but money send to they have a habit of disappear on the road -- one item mention by carleton amount to six thousand pound if such be the happy lot of prisoner during the war what be the wretched lot of loyalist after the treaty of peace the word of one of the many petition send in to carleton will suggest the answer ` if we have to encounter this inexpressible misfortune we beg consideration for we life fortune and property _ and not by mere term of treaty _ ' what this mean can not be appreciate unless we fully realize how strong the spirit of hate and greed have grow and why it have grow so strong the american revolution have not be provoke by oppression violence and massacre the ` chain and slavery ' of revolutionary orator be only a figure of speech the real cause be constitutional and personal and the actual crux of the question be one of payment for defense of course there be many other cause at work the social religious and political grudge with which so many emigrant have leave the mother country have not be forget and be now revive commercial restriction however well they agree with the spirit of the age be galling to such keen trader and the mere difference between colony and motherland have produce misunderstanding on both side but the main provocative cause be imperial taxation for local defense the thirteen colony could not have hold they own by land or sea much less could they have conquer they french rival without the imperial force which indeed have do by far the greater part of the fight how be the cost to be share between the mother country and themselves the colony have not be ask to pay more than they share the point be whether they could be tax at all by the imperial government when they have no representation in the imperial parliament the government say yes the colony and the opposition at home say no as the colony would not pay of they own accord and as the government do not see why they should be parasite on the armed strength of the mother country parliament proceed to tax they they then refuse to pay under compulsion and a complete deadlock ensue the personal factor in this perhaps insoluble problem be still more refractory than the constitutional all the great question of peace and war and other foreign relation be settle by the mother country which be the only sovereign power and which alone possess the force to make any british rights respect the american supply subordinate means and so become subordinate man when they and the imperial force work together this to use a homely phrase make they leader feel out of it everything that breed trouble between militiaman and regular colonial and mother-countrymen fan the flame of colonial resentment till the leader be able to set they follower on fire it be a leader ' rebellion : there be no maddening cruelty or even oppression such as those which have produce so many revolution elsewhere it be a leader ' victory : there be no general feeling that death or independence be the only alternative from the first but as the fight go on and loyalist and revolutionist grow more and more bitter towards one another the revolutionary follower find the same cause for hate the loyalist as they leader have find for hate the government many of the loyalist belong to the well-educated and well-to-do class so the envy and greed of the revolutionary follower be add to the personal and political rage of they leader the british government have do its best for the loyalist in the treaty of peace and have urge carleton who need no urge in such a cause to do he best as well but the treaty be make with the congress and the congress have no authority over the internal affair of the thirteen new state each one of which could do as it like with its own envied and detest loyalist the revolutionist want some tangible spoil the safety of peace have make the trimmer equally ` patriotic ' and equally clamorous so the confiscation of loyalist property soon become the order of the day it be not the custom of that age to confiscate private property simply because the owner be on the lose side still less to confiscate it under local instead of national authority but need greed and resentment be stronger than any scruple need be the weakest resentment the strongest of all the animate motive the american army be in rag and its pay greatly in arrears while the british force under carleton be feed clothed and pay in the regular way but it be the passionate resentment of the revolutionist that pervert this exasperating difference into another ` intolerable wrong ' washington be above such meaner measure but when he say the loyalist be only fit for suicide and when adam another future president say they ought to be hang it be little wonder that lesser man think the time have come for legal looting those loyalist who best understand the temper of they late fellow-countryman leave at once they be right even to be a woman be no protection against confiscation in the case of mary phillip sister-in-law to beverley robinson a well-known loyalist who settle in new brunswick after the revolution she case be not nearly so hard as many another but she historic love-affair make it the most romantic eight-and-twenty year before this general braddock have march to death and defeat beside the monongahelum with two handsome and gallant young aides-de-camp washington and morri both fall in love with bewitching mary phillip but while washington leave she fancy-free morri win she heart and hand now that the strife be no longer against a foreign foe but between two british party the former aides-de-camp find themselves rival in arm as well as love for colonel morri be carleton 's right-hand man in all that concern the loyalist be the official head of the department of claim and succor : morri morgan and carleton be the three busiest man in new york forty thick manuscript volume still show maurice morgan 's assiduous work as carleton 's confidential secretary but morri have the more heart-breaking duty of the three with no relief day after sorrow-laden day from the anguishing appeal of loyalist widow orphan and other ruin refugee no sooner have the dire news arrive that peace have be make with the congress and that each of the thirteen united state be free to show uncovenanted mercy towards its own loyalist than the exodus begin five thousand five hundred and ninety-three loyalist sail for halifax in the first convoy on the 17th of April with a strong recommendation from carleton to governor parr of nova scotium ` many of these be of the first family and bear to the fairest possession i therefore beg that you will have they properly consider ' shipping be scarce for the hostility of the whole foreign naval world have make enormous demand on the british navy and mercantile marine so six thousand loyalist have to march overland to join carleton 's vessel at new york some of they from as far south as charlottesville virginium they be carefully shepherd by colonel alured clarke of whom we shall hear again meanwhile carleton and washington have exchange the usual compliment on the conclusion of peace and have meet each other on the 6th of may at tappan where they discuss the exchange of prisoner by the term of the treaty the british be to evacuate new york they last foothold in the new republic with all practicable dispatch so as summer change into autumn the congress become more and more impatient to see the last of they but carleton would not go without the loyalist whose many tributary stream of misery be still flow into new york in September when the treaty of peace be ratify in europe the congress ask carleton point-blank to name the date of he own departure but he reply that this be impossible and that the more the loyalist be persecute the longer he would be oblige to stay the correspondence between he and the congress teem with complaint and explanation the american be very anxious lest the loyalist should take away any goods and chattel not they own particularly slave carleton be dispose to consider slave as human being though slavery be still the law in the british oversea dominion and so the american feel uneasy lest he might discriminate between they slave and other chattel ream of the carleton papers be cover with descriptive list of claim and counter-claimed nigger -- julius caesar jupiter venus diana and so on who be either ` stout wench ' and ` likely fellow ' or ` incurably lazy ' and ` old worn-out ' perhaps when a slave wish to remain british and he case be nicely balanced between the claimant and the counter-claimant carleton be a little inclined to give he the benefit of the doubt but with other form of dispute property he be too severe to please all loyalist a typical case of restitution in canada will show how differently the two government view the rights of private property mercier and halst two quebec rebel own a wharf and the frame of a warehouse in 1775 it be arnold 's intercept letter to mercier that give carleton 's lieutenant cramahe the first warning of danger from the south halsted be major caldwell 's miller at the time and take advantage of he position to give he employer 's flour to arnold 's army in which he serve as commissary throughout the siege just after the peace of 1783 mercier and halst lay claim to they former property which they have abandon for eight year and on which the government have meanwhile build a provision store make use of the original frame the case be complicate by many detail too long for notice here but the british government finally give the two rebel the original property plus thirteen year ' rent less the cost of government work erect in the meantime all the document be still in quebec property be troublesome enough but people be worse and carleton 's difficulty increase as the autumn wear on the first great harrying of the loyalist drive more than thirty thousand from they home and about twenty-five thousand of these embark at new york then there be the remnant of twenty loyalist corps to pension settle or employ there be also the british prisoner to receive besides ten thousand german mercenary add to all this the regular garrison and the general oversight of every british interest in north america from the florida to labrador remember the implacable enemy in front and we may faintly imagine what carleton have to do before he could report that ` he majesty 's troops and such remain loyalist as choose to emigrate be successfully withdraw on the 25th -lrb- of November -rrb- without the smallest circumstance of irregularity ' thus end one of the greatest act in the drama of the british empire the english-speaking people or the world and thus for the second time carleton now in he sixtieth year apparently end he own long service in america he have leave canada after save she from obliteration because so long as he remain she governor the war minister at home remain she enemy he have then return to serve in new york and have stay there to the bitter end because there be no other man whom the new government would trust to command the rearguard of the empire in retreat chapter ix founding modern canada 1786-1796 carleton now enjoy two year of uninterrupted peace at he country seat in england he active career seem to have close at last he have no taste for party politics he be not anxious to fill any position of civil or military trust even if it have be press upon he and he have say farewell to america for good and all when he have leave new york though as full of public spirit as before and only just turn sixty he bid fair to spend the rest of he life as a english country gentleman he young wife be well contented with she lot he manly boy promise to become worthy follower of the noble profession of arm and the oversee of he little estate occupy he time very pleasantly indeed like most healthy englishman he be devote to horse and unlike some other he be very successful with he thoroughbred he have first buy a place near maidenhead beside the thame which be nowhere lovelier than in that sylvan neighborhood then he buy the present family seat of greywill hill near the little village of odiham in hampshire as a ex-governor and commander-in-chief a county magnate a personage of great importance to the empire and the one victorious british general in the unhappy american war he have more than earn a peerage but it be not till 1786 on the eve of he sixty-second birthday and at a time when he service be urgently require again that he receive it needless to say this peerage have nothing whatever to do with he acceptance of another self-sacrificing duty it be not give till several month after he have promise to return to canada and he would certainly have refuse it if it have be hold out to he as a inducement to go there he become baron dorchester and be grant the not very extravagant addition to he income of a thousand pound a year payable during four life he own he wife 's and those of he two eldest son he elevation to the house of lord meet with the almost unanimous approval of he fellow-peer in marked contrast to the open hostility they have show towards he old enemy lord george germain when that vile wrecker have be ` kick upstairs ' among they the carleton motto crest and supporter be all most appropriate the crest be a strong right arm with the hand clench firmly on a arrow the motto be _ quondam he vicimus armi _ -- _ we use to conquer with these arm _ the supporter be two beaver typify canada while they respective collar one a naval the other a military coronet show how she british life be win and save and have be keep carleton be a man of great reserve and self-control but he kindly nature must have respond to the cordial welcome which he receive on he return to quebec in October 1786 it be not without reason that the people of canada rejoice to have he back as they leader all that the indian imagine the great white father to be towards themselves he be in reality towards both red man and white stern when the occasion force he to be stern just in all he dealings between man and man dignified and courteous in all he way a soldier through every inch of he stalwart six foot he be a ruler with whom no one ever dream of take liberty but neither do any deserving one in trouble ever hesitate to lay the most confidential case before he in the full assurance that he head and heart be at the service of all commit to he care and no other governor before he time or since ever inspire he follower with such a firm belief that all would turn out for the best so long as he be in command this power of inspiring confidence be now badly need everything in canada be still provisional owe to the war the quebec act of 1774 have never be thoroughly enforce then when the war be over the loyalist arrive and completely change the circumstance which the act have be design to meet the next constitution the canada act of 1791 be of a very different character during the seventeen year between these two constitution all that could be do be to make the best of a very confusing state of flux not that the quebec act be a dead letter -- far from it -- but simply that it could not go beyond restore the privilege of the french-canadian priest and seigneur within the area then effectively occupy by the french-canadian race carleton as we have see have face its problem for the first four year haldimand have carry on the government under its provision for the follow six hamilton and hope successive lieutenant-governor have bridge the two year between haldimand 's retirement and carleton 's second appointment now carleton be to pick up the thread and make what he could of the tangled skein for the next five year haldimand have not be popular with either of the two chief party into which the lead french canadian be divide the seigneur have nothing like the same regard for a swiss soldier of fortune that they have for aristocratic british commander like murray and carleton the clergy also prefer these anglican to such a strong swiss protestant the habitant and agitator who be far less favourable to the new regime have passionately resent haldimand 's firmness at time of crisis but despite all this french-canadian animus he be not such a absolute martinet as some writer would have we think the war with france and with the american revolutionist require strong government in canada while the influx of loyalist have introduce a entirely new set of most perplexing circumstance on the whole haldimand have do very well in spite of many personal and public drawback and it be through no special fault of he nor yet of hope 's that the thread which carleton pick up form such a perversely tangled skein the trouble that now dog the great conciliator 's every step be of all kind -- racial religious social political military diplomatic legal the confusion result from the intermixture of french and english civil law have become a great deal more confound since he have leave canada eight year before the old proportion of race and religion to each other have change most disturbingly the loyalist be of quite a different social class from the english-speaking immigrant of earlier day they want a parliament public school and many other thing new to the country and they be the sort of people who have a right to have they the problem of defense be always a vex one with the inadequate military force at hand and the insuperable difficulty concern the militia the british still hold the western fort pend the settlement of the frontier and the execution of the treaty of peace in full this naturally annoyed the american government and give carleton endless trouble but more serious still be the ceaseless western march of the american backwoodsman who be everywhere in conflict with the indian the indian in they turn be confuse between the british and american under the new condition they and they ever-receding rights and territory have not be mention in the treaty but see that they would be better off under british than under american rule they be incline to take side accordingly there be now no openly hostile side to take but for all that the british post in the hinterland look like weak little island which might be suddenly engulf in the sea of indian trouble rage round they then at the other end of the british line there be the three maritime province to watch over new brunswick have be divide off from nova scotium and prince edward island have be take from the direct supervision of the home authority and place under the command of the new governor at quebec thus carleton have to deal directly with everything that happen from the far west to gaspe while deal indirectly with the three maritime province and all the trouble that prove too much for they own lieutenant-governor there be no chance of concentrate on one thing at a time nothing would wait the governor have to watch the writhe tangle as a whole during every minute he devote to any one kinked and knotted thread fortunately there be some good man in office on both side of the atlantic lord sydney and grenville the two cabinet minister with whom carleton have most to do be both sensible and sympathetic year afterwards grenville the favorite cousin of pitt become the colleague of fox at the head of the celebrated ` ministry of all the talent ' hope be a acceptable lieutenant-governor and he successor sir alure clarke be better still francoi bailly the coadjutor roman catholic bishop of quebec who have go to england as french tutor to carleton 's child be a most enlighten cleric so too be charle ingli the anglican bishop of nova scotium appoint in 1787 he be the first canadian bishop of the anglican communion and he diocese comprise the whole of british north america william smith the new chief justice be as different from carleton 's last chief justice livius as angel be from devil smith have be a excellent chief justice of he native new york in the old colonial day and like ingli be a very ardent loyalist he respect all reasonable french-canadian peculiarity but he favor the british-constitutional way of ` broaden down from precedent to precedent ' rather than the french way of refer to a supposedly infallible written regulation we shall soon meet he as a far-seeing statesman but he well deserve a honor place in canadian history for he legal service alone to he more than to any other man be due the nicely balanced adjustment which eventually harmonize the french and english code into a body of law adapt to the extraordinary circumstance of the province of quebec besides the committee on law carleton have nominate three other active committee of he council one on police another on education and a third on trade and commerce the police committee be of the usual kind and deal with usual problem in the usual way but the education committee bring out all the vex question of french and english protestant and roman catholic progressive and reactionary strangely enough the sharpest personal controversy be that between hubert the roman catholic bishop of quebec and he coadjutor bailly hubert enumerate all the institution already engage in educational work and suggest that ` rest and be thankful ' be the only proper attitude for the committee to assume but bailly very neatly point out that he respected superior 's real opinion could not be those attribute to he over he own signature because they be at variance with the fact hubert have say that the cure be spread education with most commendable zeal have repudiate the base insinuation that only three or four people in each parish could read and write and have wind up by think that while there be so much land to clear the farmer would do better to keep they son at home than send they to a university where they would be under professor so ` unprejudiced ' as to have no definite view on religion bailly argue that the bishop could not mean what these word seem to imply as the logical conclusion would be to wait till canada be clear right up to the polar circle in the end the committee make three very sanguine recommendation : a free common school in every parish a secondary school in every town or district and a absolutely non-sectarian central university this educational ladder be never set up there be nothing to support either end of it the financial side be one difficulty the jesuit ' estate be intend to be make over into educational endowment under government control but amherst 's claim that they have be grant to he in 1760 be not settle for forty year and by that time all chance of carry out the committee 's intention be see to be hopeless commerce be another burn question and one of much more immediate concern in 1791 the united population of all the province amount to only a quarter of a million of whom at least one-half be french canadian quebec and montreal have barely ten thousand citizen apiece but the commercial class mostly english-speaking have greatly increase in number ability and social stand the camp-following gang of twenty year before have now either disappear or sink down to they appropriate level so petition from the ` british merchant ' require and receive much more consideration than formerly the loyalist have not yet have time to start in business all they energy be need in hew out they future home but two part of the american republic vermont and kentucky be very anxious to do business with the british at any reasonable price some of they citizen be even ready for a change of allegiance if the term be only good enough vermont want a ` free trade ' outlet to the st lawrence by way of the richelieu the rapid between st john and chambly lay in british territory but vermont be ready to join in build a canal and would even become british to make sure the old green mountain boy have change they tune ethan allen himself have bury the hatchet and like he brother become carleton 's friendly correspondent he frankly explain that what vermonter really want be ` property not liberty ' and add that they would stand no coercion from the american government about the same time kentucky be bent on get a equally ` free trade ' outlet to the gulf of mexico by way of the mississippus the fact that france spain the british empire and the united state might all be involve in war over it do not trouble the conspirator in the least the central authority of the new republic be still weak the individual state be still ready to fly asunder federal taxation be greatly fear anything that savor of federal interference with state rights be passionately resent the general spirit of the westerner be that of the exploit pioneer in a virgin wilderness -- a law unto itself alone there be various plan for open the coveted mississippus one be to join spain another be to seize new orlean turn out the french and bring in the british then to make the plot complete the french minister to the united state be ask permission to make a tour through canada at the very time when carleton be send home ream of document bear on the impending trouble the letter exchange on this subject be perfect model of politeness but carleton 's answer be a emphatic no foreign complication be thicken fast the french revolution have already begin though its effect be not yet feel in canada the american government be anxiously watch its refractory state while a anti-british political party be make headway in the south as if this be not enough to engage whatever attention carleton have to spare from the internal affair of canada he suddenly hear that the spaniard have be seize british vessel trade to a british post on vancouver island -lrb- footnote : _ see pioneer of the pacific coast _ in this series -rrb- this nootka affair which nearly bring on a war with spain in 1790 be settle in london and madrid but the threat of war add to carleton 's anxiety meanwhile the governor be busily employ with a immigration problem it be desirable that the english-speaking immigrant should settle on the land with the least possible friction between they and the french canadian the french canadian differ among themselves but no such difference bring they any closer to they new neighbor on question of land settlement the french have grant land in seigneury the british would hear of nothing but free and common socage french farm be measure by the arpent and be stake out in long and narrow oblong british farm be measure by the acre and stake out ` on the square ' language law religion manners and custom way of life be also different so there be hardly any intermixture of settlement the french canadian remain where they be most of the new anglo-canadian settle in the maritime province or move west into what be now ontario a few settle in rural quebec on land outside the line of seigneury the eastern township that part of the province lie east of the richelieu and nearest the american frontier absorb many english irish and scot as well as a good many american who be attract by cheap land ontario or upper canada receive still more american who be to be a thorn in the side of the british during the war of 1812 but carleton 's work comprise much more than this there be the church of england the post office a refractory lieutenant-governor down in prince edward island two royal visitor and many other distracting matter the only anglican see thus far establish be at halifax but the bishop there have authority over the whole country and the government intend to establish the church of england in canada and endow it the presbyterian also petition for the establishment of the scottish church the fortune or misfortune of the clergy reserve belong to another chapter of canadian history but the root of they good or evil be plant in the time of carleton the postal service be surround by enormous difficulty -- the vast extent of wild country the few town the long winter the poverty of the people the question of the winter port be even then a live one between st john and halifax each of these town assert its advantage and promise twelve trip a year and connection with quebec overland by means of walk postman till a bush road should be cut from quebec to the sea in prince edward island the old lieutenant-governor walter patterson decline to make way for the new one edmund fanning in the end patterson give up the contest but the incident trivial as it now appear show what a governor-general have to face in the early day when each province have queer little way of its own patterson have no precise official reason but he say he could not go home to answer charge he do not understand and leave a island which have be he very successful hobby for so many year the people side with he so vigorously that time have to be give they to cool down before the transfer could be peaceably effect a judge whose court be in perpetual session or a commander whose inadequate force be continually surround by prospective enemy have little time for the amenity of purely social life so carleton generally leave he young consort to rule the viceregal court at the chateau st loui with a perfect blend of london and versaille two prince of the blood however demand more than the usual attention from the governor prince william henry afterwards king william iv be the first member of the royal family to set foot in the new world when he arrive in hm _ pegasus _ in 1787 he be the proverbial jolly jack tar extremely affable to everybody and he quickly win golden opinion from all who meet he except perhaps from lady dorchester and sundry would-be partner for he duty dance philippe aubert de gaspe and other privileged chronicler record with slightly shocked delight how often he would break loose from lady dorchester 's design care long before she think it right for he to do so and ` command ' he partner for they pretty face instead of by precedence at sorel the people be so carry away by they enthusiasm that they insist on change the name of they little town to william henry happily this name never take root in public sentiment and the old one soon come back to stay the second member of the royal family to come to canada be prince edward duke of kent fourth son of george iii father of queen victorium and grandfather of prince arthur duke of connaught who become the first royal governor-general in 1911 exactly a hundred and twenty year later the duke of kent would have gladly return to quebec as governor-general and the people would have gladly welcome he but he be not a favorite with the government at home and so he never come there be no doubt about he be a popular favorite in quebec during the three year he spend there as colonel of the 7th fusilier nor have he be forget to the present day kent house be still the name of he quarter in the town as well as of he country residence at montmorency fall seven mile away while the only new opening ever make in the wall be call kent gate the duke make fast friend with several of the seigneurial family more especially with the de salaberrys whose manor-house at beauport stand half-way between montmorency and quebec and not far from montcalm 's headquarters in 1759 the de salaberrys be a military family all the son go into the army and one become the hero of chateauguay in the war of 1812 but the duke mixed freely with many other people than the local aristocracy he be young high-spirited and love adventure as be prove by he subsequent gallantry at martinique he be also fond of drive round incognito a habit which on at least one occasion oblige he to put he skill at boxing to good use this be at charlesbourg a village near quebec where he be watch the fun at the first election ever hold perhaps from a meticulously constitutional point of view the scene of a hotly contest election be not quite the place for prince of the blood but however that might be when the duke see two elector pommell a third who happen to be a friend of he he dash in to the rescue and floor both of they with a neatly plant right and leave one of these man who live to see king edward vii arrive in 1860 as prince of wale always take the greatest pride in tell successive generation of voter how queen victorium 's father have knock he down like he brother before he the duke be very fond of dancing and keep many a reluctant senior and many a tired-out chaperone up till all hour at the grand ball give in honor of he twenty-fourth birthday also like he brother he be incline to reduce he duty dance to a minimum much to lady dorchester 's dismay she have go home with she husband for two year shortly after the duke 's arrival but she have see enough of he and be to see enough again on she return to make she regret the good old time of more exacting ceremony to she die day half a century later she keep up a prodigious stateliness of manner before meal she expect the whole company to assemble and remain standing till she have make she royal progress through the room she be a living anachronism for many year before she death with she high-heeled gold-buttoned scarlet-coloured shoe she marie-antoinette _ coiffure _ raise high above she head and interlaced with ribbon she elaborately gorgeous dress she intricate array of ornament and she long jet-black official-looking cane but she be no anachronism to herself for she still live in the light of other day in the fondly remembered time when as the vice-reine of the chateau st loui she help she consort to settle nice point of etiquette and maintain a dignity befitting he majesty 's choose representative how do the seigneurs rank among themselves and with the lead english-speaking people who be to dance in the state minuet should dancing cease when the bishop come in and for how long be that curtsy drop quite low enough to she viceregal self and do that _ debutante _ offer she blushing cheek in quite the proper way to carleton when he graciously give she the presentation kiss how immeasurably far away it all seem now that stately little court where the echo of a dead versaille live on for seven year after the fall of the bastille and yet there be still one citizen o quebec whose early partner be chaperon by lady who have dance the minuet with lord and lady dorchester the two royal visit be not without they political significance -- use the word political in its larger meaning but the three year between they -- that be 1788-89-90 -- form the really pregnant time of constitutional development when the canada act of 1791 be take shape in the mind of its chief author -- carleton and smith in canada grenville and pitt in england the loyalist and the english-speaking merchant of quebec and montreal take good care to make themselves hear at every stage of the proceedings most french canadian would have prefer to be leave without the suspect blessing of a parliament the clergy and seigneur wish for a continuance of the quebec act and the habitant want they know not what provide it would enable they to get more and give less the english-speaking people on the other hand be all for a parliament but they differ widely as to what kind of parliament would suit they purpose best as a rule they acquiesce with a more or less bad grace in the necessity of admit french canadian on the same term as themselves if canada without the maritime province should be take as a whole then the french canadian would only be in a moderate majority if however two province upper canada and lower canada be to be erect then the english-speaking minority in lower canada would be outvote three or four to one there be a third alternative : no less than the establishment of a regular dominion of british north america in 1790 a step which might have save much trouble between that time and the confederation of 1867 william smith be its strongest advocate carleton its most cautious and judicious supporter the chief justice be in favor of federate upper and lower canada with the maritime province and newfoundland into a single dominion each of the six province would have its own parliament under a lieutenant-governor while there would also be a central parliament under a governor-general carleton forward the suggestion to the home government but he nowhere commit himself to any very definite scheme he own preference be for keep the exist province of quebec a little longer then divide it and afterwards draw in the other province the chief justice prefer to make a constitution the governor prefer to let it grow the home government 's preference could not be state better than in grenville 's dispatch to carleton of the 20th of October 1789 : ` the general object be to assimilate the constitution to that of great britain as nearly as the difference arise from the manners of the people and from the present situation of the province will admit attention be due to the prejudice and habit of the french inhabitant and every caution should be use to continue to they the enjoyment of those civil and religious rights which be secure to they by the capitulation or which have since be grant by the liberal and enlighten spirit of the british government ' except for its rather too self-righteous conclusion this confidential announcement really be a admirable statement of the ` liberal and enlighten ' view which prevail at westminster the bill postpone in 1790 be introduce by pitt himself in the house of common on the 7th of march 1791 sixteen day later adam lymburner a representative merchant of quebec whom carleton describe as ' a quiet decent man not unfriendly to the administration ' plead for hour before the committee of the house of common against the division of the province all the english-speaking minority in the prospective province of lower canada be afraid of be swamp by the french-canadian vote and so of be hamper in liberty and trade the london merchant naturally back lymburner fox oppose the bill as not be liberal enough burke flare up into the speech which lead to he final breach with fox pitt the pilot who be to weather far greater storm in the year to come eventually get the bill through both house with substantial majority on the 14th of may it become law quebec and ontario be part for good notwithstanding the legislative union of fifty year later the canada act or as it be better know the constitutional act cut off upper canada lower canada be now the old quebec reduce to its right size endowed with clarify law and a brand-new parliament and make as acceptable as possible to the english-speaking minority without any injustice to the vastly greater french majority quebec three river montreal and sorel get each two member in the new parliament a allotment which ensure a certain representation of the ` british ' merchant the franchise be the same in both province : in the country part a forty-shilling freehold or its equivalent and in the town either a five-pound annual ownership value or twice that for a tenant the crown give up all taxation except commercial duty which be to be apply solely for the benefit of the province land outside the seigneury be to be in free and common socage while seigneurial tenure itself could be convert into freehold on petition one-seventh of the crown land be reserve for the endowment of the church of england the crown keep all rights of veto and appointment the legislature be small in membership the upper house could be make hereditary though the actual tenure be never more than for life during good behavior carleton favor the hereditary principle whenever it could be apply with advantage but he know the up and downs of colonial fortune too well to believe that canada be ready for any such experiment no one dream of have what be now know as responsible government that be a executive sit in the legislature and responsible to the legislature for its act nor be the greatest of all parliamentary power -- the power of the purse -- give outright this however be owe to simple force of circumstance and not to any desire of abridge the liberty of the people the fact be that at this time eighty per cent of the total civil expenditure have to be pay by the home government it be frequently ignore that the mother country pay most of canada 's bill till long after the war of 1812 that she pay nearly all the naval and military account for longer still and that she have bear far more than she own share of the common defense down to the present day the new constitution come into force on the 26th of December 1791 and for the first time upper and lower canada have the right to elect they own representative assembly of course be nothing new in british north america nova scotium have a assembly in 1758 the year that louisbourg be take prince edward island have one in 1773 the year before the quebec act be pass new brunswick have one in 1786 the year carleton begin he second term but assembly still have all the charm of novelty in ` canada proper ' perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that upper canada experience more charm than novelty while lower canada experience more novelty than charm the anglo-canadian in all five province be use to parliament in america they ancestor have be use to they for century in england so the little parliament of upper canada at newark pass as many bill in five week as that of lower canada pass in seven month the fact that there be fifty member in the assembly at quebec while there be only half as many in both chamber at newark doubtless have something to do with it but the fact that the quebec parliament be a innovation while the one at newark be a simple development have very much more there be no need to follow the course of legislation in any of the five province as most of the civil and practically all the naval and military expenditure have to be meet by the imperial treasury and as canada be five part and no whole from she own parliamentary point of view the legislation require for a grand total of two hundred and fifty thousand people could not be of the national kind but at quebec the scene the setting and the unheard-of innovation itself all give a special interest to every detail of the opening ceremony on the 17th of December 1792 carleton be in england so the speech from the throne be read by the lieutenant-governor major-general sir alured clarke half of the upper house and two-third of the lower be french canadian a french-canadian member be nominate for the speakership and elect unanimously both race be for the most part represent by member whose official title of ` honorable gentleman ' be not at all a misnomer the french member of the assembly be half distrustful both of it and of themselves but they know how to add grace and dignity to a very notable occasion the old bishop 's palace serve as the house of parliament and so continue for many year to come it be a solid rather than a stately pile but it stand on a command site at the head of mountain hill between the grand battery and the chateau st loui every one be in uniform or in what correspond to court dress round the throne stand many officer in they red and gold conspicuous among they the duke of kent in front sit the executive and legislative councillor correspond to the modern cabinet minister and senator they roll as well as the assembly 's bear many name that recall the glory of the old regime -- st ours longueuil de lanaudiere boucherville de salaberry de lotbiniere and many more the council chamber be crowd in every part long before the governor arrive ` the lady introduce into the house ' be ` without hat cloak or bonnet ' the ` doorkeeper of he majesty 's council ' have take good care to see they ` leave the same in the great committee room previous to they introduction ' ` the lady attach to he excellency 's suite ' be admit ` within the railing or body of the house ' and ` accommodate with the seat of the member as far as possible ' outwardly it be all very much the same in principle as the opening of any other british parliament -- the escort guard and band the royal salute the brilliant staff the scarlet cloth of state the few and quiet member of the upper house the many of the lower jostle each other to get a good place near mr speaker at the bar the radiant lady the crowded gallery cornice with inquire face and crane neck the gentleman usher and they quaint bow the speech from the throne and the occasional lifting of he excellency 's hat the retire in full state and then the ebb away of all the sightseer they eddy current of packed humanity in the hall and passage the porch the door the empty street but inwardly what a world of difference for here be the first british parliament in which legislator of foreign birth and blood and language be shape british law as british subject in September 1793 carleton return from he two year ' absence and be welcome more warmly than ever quebec blaze with illuminations the street swarm with eager crowd the first session of the first parliament have be better than any one have dare to hope for there be a general tendency to give the new constitution a fair trial and all class look to carleton to make the harmony that have be attain both permanent and universal dr jacob mountain first anglican bishop of quebec also arrive shortly afterwards and be warmly greet by the roman catholic prelate who embrace he say ` it be time you come to shepherd you own flock ' mountain be statesman and churchman in one he have be choose by the elder pitt to be the younger 's tutor and then choose by the younger to be he private secretary the fact that the anglican bishop of quebec be then and for many year afterwards a sort of canadian chaplain-general to the imperial troops and that most of the lead official and lead loyalist belong to the church of england make he a personage of great importance it be fortunate that as in the case of inglis down in halifax the choice could not have fall on a better man or on one who know better how to win the esteem of communion other than he own this same year -lrb- 1793 -rrb- die william smith full of honor but the next year he excellent successor arrive in the person of william osgoode the new chief justice a eminent english lawyer who have serve for two year as chief justice of upper canada and whose name be commemorate in osgoode hall toronto he have come out on the distinct understanding that no fee be to be attach to he office only a definite salary this be a great triumph for carleton who certainly practice what he preach so far so good but the third conspicuous new arrival john grave simcoe lieutenant-governor of upper canada who have come out the year before be a great deal less to carleton 's liking simcoe be a good officer who throw himself heart and soul into the work of settle the new province he win the affectionate regard of he people and be gratefully remember by they posterity but he be too exclusively of he own province in he civil and military outlook and be dispose to ignore carleton as he official chief moreover he be appoint in spite of carleton 's strongly express preference for sir john johnson who to all appearance be the very man for the post sir william johnson the first baronet have be the great british leader of the indian and a person of much consequence throughout america he son john inherit many of he good quality thoroughly understand the west and its problem be a devoted loyalist all through the revolution when he raise the king 's royal regiment of new york and would have be second only to carleton himself in the eye of all canadian old and new but the government think he private interest too great for he public duty -- a excellent general principle though misapply in this particular case at any rate simcoe come instead and the friction begin at once simcoe 's commission clearly make he subordinate to carleton yet simcoe make appointment without consult he superior and argue the point after he have be bring to book he communicate directly with the home government over he superior 's head and be not rebuke by the minister to whom he write -- henry dunda afterwards first viscount melville dunda indeed be half inclined to snub carleton simcoe desire to establish military post wherever he think they would best promote immediate settlement a policy which would tend to sap both the government 's resource and the self-reliance of the settler he also wish to fix the capital at london instead of york now toronto and to make york instead of kingston the naval base for lake ontario thus the friction continue at length carleton write to the duke of portland pitt 's home secretary say : ` all command civil and military be thus disorganized and without remedy you grace will i hope excuse my anxiety for the arrival of any successor who may have authority sufficient to restore order lest these insubordination should extend to mutiny among the troops and sedition among the people ' that be in November 1795 the government however take no decisive action and next year both carleton and simcoe leave canada for ever when this unfortunate quarrel begin -lrb- 1793 -rrb- canada be in grave danger of be attack by both the french and the american republic the danger however have be greatly lessen by jay 's treaty of 1794 and be to be still further lessen -lrb- 1796 -rrb- by the transfer of the western post to the united state and by the presidential election which give the federal party a new lease of power though no longer under washington have carleton remain in canada these felicitous event would have offer he a unique opportunity of strengthen the friendly tie between the british and the american in a way which might have save some trouble later on but that be not to be to understand the danger which threaten canada during the last three year of carleton 's rule we must go back to February 1793 when revolutionary france declare war on england and there then begin that titanic struggle which only end twenty-two year later on the field of waterloo the american be divide into two party one disposed to be friendly towards great britain the other unfriendly the name these party then bear must not be confuse with those bear by they political offspring at the present day the federal progenitor of the present republican form the friendly party under washington hamilton and jay the republican progenitor of the present democrat form the unfriendly party under jefferson madison and randolph the federal be in power the republican in opposition when the republican get into power in 1801 under jefferson they pursue they anti-british policy till they finally bring on the war of 1812 under the presidency of madison the strength of the peace party lay in the north that of the war party lay in the south the peaceful federal now that independence have be gain be in favor of meet the amicable british government half-way when pitt come into power in 1783 he at once hold out the olive branch now ten year later the more far-seeing statesman on both side be prepare to confirm the new friendship in the practical form of jay 's treaty which put the united state into what be at present know as a most-favoured-nation position with regard to british trade and commerce moreover washington and he northern federal much prefer a british canada to a french one while jefferson and the southern republican think any stick be good enough to beat the british dog with the jeffersonian eagerly seize on the report of a speech which carleton make to the miami who live just south of detroit and use it to the utmost as a means of stir up anti-british feeling carleton have say : ` you be witness that we have act in the most peaceable manner and bear the language and conduct of the united state with patience but i believe we patience be almost exhaust ' apply to the vex question of the western post of the lawless way of the exterminate american pioneer and of the infinitely worse jobbing politician behind they this language be mildness itself but in view of the high statesmanship of washington and he government it be injudicious all the same dunda more especially because he be a cabinet minister be even more injudicious when he adopt a tone of reproof towards carleton whose great service past and present entitle he to unusual respect and confidence the negotiation for jay 's treaty be then in progress in london and jefferson see he chance of injure both the american and british government by magnify carleton 's speech into a ` unwarrantable outrage ' he also hope that a indian war would upset the treaty and bring on a british war as well and the prospect do look encouragingly black in the west where the american general wayne be ready wait south of lake erie while the trade in scalp be unusually brisk forty dollar be the regular market price for a ordinary indian 's scalp but as much as a thousand be offer for simon girty 's in the hope of get that inconvenient british scout put quickly out of the way nearer home jefferson and he band of demagogue have other argument as well the federal north would suffer most by war while the republican south might use war as a means of repudiate all the debt she owe to englishmen this would have be a very different thing from the insolvency of the continental congress during the revolution it be dire want not financial infamy that make the revolutionary paper money ` not worth a continental ' but it would have be sheer theft for the jeffersonian south to have make its honest obligation ` rotten as a pennsylvanian bond ' the wild french-revolutionary rage that sweep through the south now fan the flame and make the spark fly over into canada in April 1793 a fiery red republican name genet land at charleston as french minister to the united state and make a triumphal progress to philadelphium nobody bother about the fundamental difference between the french and american revolution france and england be go to war and that be enough genet be one of those ` impossible ' whom revolution throw into ridiculous power when he begin he campaign the republican south be at he foot planter and legislator don cap of liberty and dance themselves so crazy over the rights of abstract man that they have no enthusiasm leave for such concrete instance as loyalist englishman and they own plantation slave then genet make he next step in the new diplomacy by fitting out french privateer in american harbor and seize british vessel in american water this bring washington down on he at once then he lose he head completely abuse everybody include jefferson and retire from public life as a american citizen be afraid to go home genet 's absurd career be short but very meteoric while it last and full of anti-british mischief-making he agent be everywhere and he successor adet carry on the underground agitation with equal zeal and more astuteness vermont offer a excellent base of operation find that its british proclivity have not produce the chambly canal for its trade with the st lawrence it have become more violently anti-british than ever before and even propose take canada single-handed this time its new policy remain at fever heat for over three year and only cool down when a british man-of-war capture the incongruously name _ olive branch _ in which ira allen be try to run the blockade from ostend with twenty thousand musket and other arm which he represent as be solely for the annual drill of the vermont militia thus carleton have to watch the rage south the dangerous west and bellicose vermont all together besides take whatever measure he could against the swarm of secret enemy within the gate the american immigrant who want ` property not liberty ' be ready enough for a change of flag whenever it suit they but they be few compare with the mass of french canadian who be be stir into disaffection the seigneur the clergy and the very few enlighten people of other class have no desire for be conquer by a regicide france or a obliterate american republic but many of the habitant and of the uneducated in the town lend a willing ear to those who promise they all kind of liberty and property put together the danger be all the greater because it be no longer one foreigner intriguing against another as in 1775 but french against british and class against class some of the appeal be still ridiculous the habitant find themselves credit with a unslakable thirst for higher education they be promise ` free ' maritime intercommunication between the old world and the new a wonderful extension of representative institution and much more to the same effect universal revolutionary brotherhood include but when frenchman come promising fleet and army when these emissary be back by french canadian who have leave home for good reason after the trouble of 1775 and when the habitant be positively assure by all these credible witness that france and the united state be go to drive the british out of canada and make a heaven on earth for all who would turn against carleton then there really be something that sensible man could believe everything for nothing -- or next to nothing only turn against the british and the rest would be easy no more tithe to the cure no more seigneurial due no more tax to a government which put half the money in its own pocket and send the other half to the king who spend it buy palace and crown ` nothing be too absurd for they to believe write carleton who feel all the old trouble of 1775 come back in a greatly aggravate form he lose no time in vain regret however but get a militia bill through parliament improve the defence of quebec and issue a proclamation enjoin all good subject to find out report and seize every sedition-monger they could lay they hand on a attempt to embody two thousand militiaman by ballot be a dead failure the few english-speaking militiaman require come forward ` with alacrity ' the habitant hang back or break into riotous mob the ordinary habitant could hardly be blame he see little difference between one kind of english-speaking people and another so he naturally think it best to be on the side of the prospective winner especially when they persuade he that he would get back everything take from he by ` the infamous quebec act ' there really be no way whatever of get he to see the truth under these circumstance the mere fact that he condition have improve so much under british rule make he all the readier to cry for the franco-american moon thing presently go from bad to worse a glowing bombastic address from ` the free french to they canadian brother ' -lrb- who of course be ` slave ' -rrb- be even read out at more than one church door then the quebec assembly unanimously pass a alien act in may 1794 and suspect character begin to find that two could play at the game this stringent act be not pass a day too soon by its provision the habeas corpus act could be suspend or suppress and the strongest measure take against sedition in every form monk the attorney-general report that ` it be astonishing to find the same savagery exhibit here as in france ' the habitant and lower class of townsfolk have beer well work up ` to follow france and the united state by destroy a throne which be the seat of hypocrisy imposture despotism greed cruelty ' and all the other deadly sin the first step be to be the assassination of all obnoxious official and lead british patriot the minute the promise invasion begin to prove successful no war come and as we have see already carleton 's last year 1796 be more peaceful than he first but even then the external danger make the governor-general 's post a very try one especially when internal trouble be equally rife thus carleton never enjoy a single day without its anxious moment till old and grow weary though devoted as ever he finally leave quebec on the 9th of July this be the second occasion on which he have be force to resign by unfair treatment at the hand of those who should have be he best support it be infinitely worse the first time when he be stab in the back by that shameless political assassin lord george germain but the second be also inexcusable because there could be no doubt whatever as to which of the incompatible should have leave he post -- the replaceable simcoe or the irreplaceable carleton yet as hm _ active _ round point levy and the great stronghold of quebec fade from he view carleton have at least the satisfaction of know that he have be the principal savior of one british canada and the principal founder of another chapter x ` nunc dimittis ' 1796-1808 we tale be tell the _ active _ be wreck on the island of anticostus where the estuary of the st lawrence join the gulf no life be lose and the carleton reach perce in gaspe quite safely in a little coast vessel then a ship come round from halifax and sail the family over to england at the end of September just thirty year after carleton have come out to canada to take up a burden of oversea governance such as no other viceroy in any part of the world-encircling british empire have ever bear so long he live to become a wonderful link with the past when he die at home in england he be in the sixty-seventh year of he connection with the army and in the eighty-fifth of he age more than any other man of note he bring the day of marlborough into touch with those of wellington though a century lay between at the time he receive he first commission most of the senior officer be old marlburian at the time of he death nelson have already win trafalgar napoleon have already be emperor of the french for nearly three year and wellington have already begin the great peninsular campaign carleton 's own life thus constitute a most remarkable link between two very different era of imperial history but he and he wife together constitute a still more remarkable link between two era of canadian history which be still farther apart at first sight it seem almost impossible that he who be the trust friend o wolfe and she who learn deportment at versaille in the reign of loui quinze should together make up a living link between 1690 when frontenac save quebec from the american colonial under phip and 1867 when the new dominion be proclaim there but it be true carleton bear in the first quarter of the eighteenth century know several old man who have serve at the battle of the boyne which be fight three month before frontenac send he defiance to phip ` from the mouth of my cannon ' carleton 's wife living far on into the second quarter of the nineteenth century know several rise young man who see the dominion of canada well start on its great career all carleton 's son go into the army and all die on active service the fourth be kill in 1814 at bergen-op-zoom carry the same sword that carleton himself have use there sixty-seven year before a picture of the first siege of bergen-op-zoom hang in the dining-room of the family seat at greywell hill to remind successive generation of they martial ancestor but no carleton need to be remind of a man 's first duty at the call to arm the present holder of the dorchester estate and title be a woman but she son and heir go straight to the front with the cavalry of the first british army corps to take the field in belgium during the great world war of 1914 carleton spend most of he last twelve year at kempshot near basingstoke because he keep he stud there and horse be he chief delight but he die at stubbing he place near maidenhead beside the silver thame on the 10th of November 1808 thus after a unadventurous youth and early manhood he spend he long maturity steer the ship of state through troublous sea abroad then pass life 's evening in the quiet haven of he home

's journal _ be print word for word _ arnold 's expedition to quebec _ by j codman be another careful work these be the complement of the british book mention above as they emphasize the american point of view and draw more from american than from british source of original information the unfortunate defect of _ we struggle for the fourteenth colony _ be that the author 's effort to be sprightly at all cost tend to repel the serious student while he very thoroughness itself repel the merely casual reader so many absurd or perverting mistake be still make about the life and time of carleton and a full understanding of he career be of such vital importance to canadian history that no account give in the general run of book -- include many so-called ` standard work ' -- should be
