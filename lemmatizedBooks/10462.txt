likewise for she skill at the needle as for she defect i can easily forgive that she be very likely and genteel -- too genteel indeed i think for a servant but what i like least of all in she she have a strange sly eye i never see such a eye half-confident i think but indeed mr sinclair herself -lrb- for that be the widow 's name -rrb- have a odd wink eye and she respectfulness seem too much study methink for the london ease and freedom but people can not help they look you know and after all she be extremely civil and oblige -- and as for the young woman -lrb- dorca be she name -rrb- she will

of my grief have give he a right as he seem to think of address I with all the freedom of a approve lover i see by this man that when once a woman embark with this sex there be no recede one concession be but the prelude to another with they he have be ever since Sunday last continually complain of the distance i keep he at and think himself entitle now to call in question my value for he strengthen he doubt by my former declare readiness to give he up to a reconciliation with my friend and yet have himself fall off from that obsequious tenderness if i may couple the word which draw from I the concession he build upon while we be talk at the door my new servant come up with a invitation to we both to tea i say he might accept of it if he please : but i must pursue my writing and not choose either tea or supper i desire he to make my excuse below as to both and inform they of my choice to be retire as much as possible yet to promise for I my attendance on the widow and she

horton the name of the two niece \*\*\* i be exceedingly out of humor with mr lovelace : and have great reason to be so as you will allow when you have read the conversation i be go to give you a account of for he would not let I rest till i give he my company in the dining-room he begin with let I know that he have be out to inquire after the character of the widow which be the more necessary he say as he suppose that i would expect he frequent absence i do i say and that he would not think of take up he lodging in the same house with I but what say i be the result of you inquiry why indeed the widow 's character be in the main what he like well enough but as it be miss howe 's opinion as i have tell he that my brother have not give over he scheme as the widow live by let lodgings and have other to let in the same part of the house which might be take by a enemy he know no better way than for he to take they all as it could not be for a long time unless i would think of remove to other so far be well enough but as it be easy for I to see that he speak the slighter of the widow in order to have a pretence to lodge here himself i ask he he intention in that respect and he frankly own that if i choose to stay here he could not as matter stand think of leave I for six hour together and he have prepare the widow to expect that we should be here but for a few day only till we could fix ourselves in a house suitable to we condition and this that i might be under the less embarrassment if i pleased to remove fix our-self in a house and we and we mr lovelace -- pray in what light -- he interrupt I -- why my dearest life if you will hear I with patience -- yet i be half afraid that i have be too forward as i have not consult you upon it -- but as my friend in town accord to what mr doleman have write in the letter you have see conclude we to be marry -- surely sir you have not presume -- hear I out my dearest creature -- you have receive with favor my address : you have make I hope for the honor of you consent hand : yet by decline my most fervent tender of myself to you at mr sorling 's have give I apprehension of delay : i would not for the world be think so ungenerous a wretch now you have honor I with you confidence as to wish to precipitate you yet you brother 's scheme be not give up singleton i be afraid be actually in town he vessel lie at rotherhithe -- you brother be absent from harlowe - place indeed not with singleton yet as i can hear if you be know to be mine or if you be but think to be so there will probably be a end of you brother 's contrivance the widow 's character may be as worthy as it be say to be but the worthier she be the more danger if you brother 's agent should find we out since she may be persuade that she ought in conscience to take a parent 's part against a child who stand in opposition to they but if she believe we marry she good character will stand we instead and give she a reason why two apartment be requisite for we at the hour of retirement i perfectly rave at he i would have fling from he in resentment but he would not let I : and what could i do whither go the evening advance i be astonish at you say i -- if you be a man of honor what need of all this strange obliquity you delight in crooked way -- let I know since i must stay in you company -lrb- for he hold my hand -rrb- let I know all you have say to the people below -- indeed indeed mr lovelace you be a very unaccountable man my dearest creature need i to have mention any thing of this and could i not have take up my lodgings in this house unknown to you if i have not intend to make you the judge of all my proceedings -- but this be what i have tell the widow before she kinswoman and before you new servant -- ` that indeed we be privately marry at hertford but that you have preliminarily bind I under a solemn vow which i be most religiously resolve to keep to be contented with separate apartment and even not to lodge under the same roof till a certain reconciliation shall take place which be of high consequence to both ' and further that i might convince you of the purity of my intention and that my whole view in this be to prevent mischief i have acquaint they ` that i have solemnly promise to behave to you before every body as if we be only betrothed and not marry not even offer to take any of those innocent freedom which be not refuse in the most punctilious love ' and then he solemnly vow to I the strictest observance of the same respectful behavior to I i say that i be not by any means satisfy with the tale he have tell nor with the necessity he want to lay I under of appear what i be not : that every step he take be a wry one a needless wry one : and since he think it necessary to tell the people below any thing about I i insist that he should unsay all he have say and tell they the truth what he have tell they he say be with so many circumstance that he could sooner die than contradict it and still he insist upon the propriety of appear to be marry for the reason he have give before -- and dearest creature say he why this high displeasure with I upon so well-intended a expedient you know that i can not wish to shun you brother or he singleton but upon you account the first step i would take if leave to myself would be to find they out i have always act in this manner when any body have presume to give out threatening against it ` tis true i would have consult you first and have you leave but since you dislike what i have say let I implore you dearest madam to give the only proper sanction to it by name a early day would to heaven that be to be to-morrow -- for god 's sake let it be to-morrow but if not -lrb- be it he business my dear before i speak -lrb- yet he seem to be afraid of I -rrb- to say if not -rrb- let I beseech you madam if my behavior shall not be to you dislike that you will not to-morrow at breakfast-time discredit what i have tell they the moment i give you cause to think that i take any advantage of you concession that moment revoke it and expose I as i shall deserve -- and once more let I remind you that i have no view either to serve or save myself by this expedient it be only to prevent a probable mischief for you own mind 's sake and for the sake of those who deserve not the least consideration from I what could i say what could i do -- i verily think that have he urge I again in a proper manner i should have consent -lrb- little satisfied as i be with he -rrb- to give he a meeting to-morrow morning at a more solemn place than in the parlor below but this i resolve that he shall not have my consent to stay a night under this roof he have now give I a stronger reason for this determination than i have before \*\*\* alas my dear how vain a thing to say what we will or what we will not do when we have put ourselves into the power of this sex -- he go down to the people below on my desire to be leave to myself and staid till they supper be just ready and then desire a moment 's audience as he call it he beseech my leave to stay that one night promise to set out either for lord m 's or for edgeware to he friend belford 's in the morning after breakfast but if i be against it he say he would not stay supper and would attend I about eight next day -- yet he add that my denial would have a very particular appearance to the people below from what he have tell they and the more as he have actually agree for all the vacant apartment -lrb- indeed only for a month -rrb- for the reason he before hint at : but i need not stay here two day if upon converse with the widow and she niece in the morning i should have any dislike to they i think notwithstanding my resolution above-mention that it would seem too punctilious to deny he under the circumstance he have mention : have besides no reason to think he would obey I for he look as if he be determine to debate the matter with I and now as i see no likelihood of a reconciliation with my friend and as i have actually receive he address i think i would not quarrel with he if i could help it especially as he ask to stay but for one night and could have do so without my know it and you be of opinion that the proud wretch distrust he own merit with I or at least my regard for he will probably bring I to some concession in he favor -- for all these reason i think proper to yield this point : yet i be so vex with he on the other that it be impossible for I to comply with that grace which a concession should be make with or not make at all this be what i say -- what you will do you must do i think you be very ready to promise very ready to depart from you promise you say however that you will set out to-morrow for the country you know how ill i have be i be not well enough now to debate with you upon you encroach way i be utterly dissatisfied with the tale you have tell below nor will i promise to appear to the people of the house to-morrow what i be not he withdraw in the most respectful manner beseech I only to favor he with such a meeting in the morning as might not make the widow and she niece think he have give I reason to be offend with he i retire to my own apartment and dorca come to I soon after to take my command i tell she that i require very little attendance and always dress and undressed myself she seem concern as if she think i have repulse she and say it should be she whole study to oblige I i tell she that i be not difficult to be please : and should let she know from time to time what assistance i should expect from she but for that night i have no occasion for she further attendance she be not only genteel but be well breed and well speak -- she must have have what be generally think to be the polite part of education : but it be strange that father and mother should make so light as they generally do of that preferable part in girl which would improve they mind and give a grace to all the rest as soon as she be go i inspect the door the window the wainscot the dark closet as well as the light one and find very good fastening to the door and to all the window i again have recourse to my pen \*\*\*

o'clock i be more and more displeased with mr lovelace on reflection for he boldness in hope to make I though but passively as i may say testify to he great untruth and i shall like he still less for it if he view in it do not come out to be the hope of accelerate my resolution in he favor by the difficulty it will lay I under as to my behavior to he he have send I he compliment by dorca with a request that i will permit he to attend I in the dining-room -- meet he in good humor or not : but i have answer that as i shall see he at breakfast-time i desire to be excuse ten o'clock i try to adjust my countenance before i go down to a easier air than i have a heart and be receive with the highest token of respect by the widow and she two niece : agreeable young woman enough in they person but they seem to put on a air of reserve while mr lovelace be easy and free to all as if he be of long acquaintance with they : gracefully enough i can not but say a advantage which travel gentleman have over other people the widow in the conversation we have after breakfast give we a account of the military merit of the colonel she husband and upon this occasion put she handkerchief to she eye twice or thrice i hope for the sake of she sincerity she wet it because she would be think to have do so but i see not that she do she wish that i might never know the loss of a husband so dear to I as she beloved colonel be to she : and she again put the handkerchief to she eye it must no doubt be a most affect thing to be separate from a good husband and to be leave in difficult circumstance besides and that not by he fault and expose to the insult of the base and ungrateful as she represent she case to be at he death this move I a good deal in she favor you know my dear that i have a open and free heart and naturally have as open and free a countenance at least my complimenter have tell I so at once where i like i mingle mind without reserve encouraging reciprocal freedom and be forward to dissipate diffidence but with these two niece of the widow i never can be intimate -- i do not know why only that circumstance and what pass in conversation encourage not the notion or i should have be apt to think that the young lady and mr lovelace be of longer acquaintance than of yesterday for he by stealth as it be cast glance sometimes at they when they return and on my ocular notice they eye fall as i may say under my eye as if they could not stand its examination the widow direct all she talk to I as to mr lovelace and i with a very ill grace bear it and once she express more forwardly than i thank she for she wonder that any vow any consideration however weighty could have force enough with so charming a couple as she call he and I to make we keep separate bed they eye upon this hint have the advantage of mine yet be i not conscious of guilt how know i then upon recollection that my censure upon theirs be not too rash there be no doubt many truly modest person -lrb- put myself out of the question -rrb- who by blush at a injurious charge have be suspect by those who can not distinguish between the confusion which guilt will be attend with and the noble consciousness that overspread the face of a fine spirit to be think but capable of a imputed evil the great roman as we read who take he surname from one part in three -lrb- the fourth not then discover -rrb- of the world he have triumph over be charge with a great crime to he soldiery choose rather to suffer exile -lrb- the punishment due to it have he be find guilty -rrb- than to have it say that scipio be question in public on so scandalous a charge and think you my dear that scipio do not blush with indignation when the charge be first communicate to he mr lovelace when the widow

force upon he than the oath by which he have bind himself rebuke both he and the widow i say it be strange to I to hear a oath or vow so lightly treat as to have it think but of second consideration whatever be the first the observation be just miss martin say for that nothing could excuse the breaking of a solemn vow be the occasion of make it what it would i ask she after the nearest church for i have be too long a stranger to the sacred worship they name st jame 's st anne 's and another in bloomsbury and the two niece say they oftenest go to st jame 's church because of the good company as well as for the excellent preaching mr lovelace say the royal chapel be the place he oftenest go to when he be in town poor man little do i expect to hear he go to any place of devotion i ask if the presence of the visible king of comparatively but a small territory do not take off too generally the requisite attention to the service of the invisible king and maker of a thousand world he believe this might be so with such as come for curiosity when the royal family be present but otherwise he have see as many contrite face at the royal chapel as any where else : and why not since the people about court have as deep score to wipe off as any people whatsoever he speak this with so much levity that i could not help say that nobody question but he know how to choose he company you servant my dear bow be he word and turn to they you will observe upon numberless occasion lady as we be further acquaint that my beloved never spare I upon these topic but i admire she as much in she reproof as i be fond of she approbation miss horton say there be a time for every thing she could not but say that she think innocent mirth be mighty become in young people very true join in miss martin and shakespeare say well that youth be the spring of life the bloom of gaudy year -lrb- with a theatrical air she speak it : -rrb- and for she part she could not but admire in my spouse that charming vivacity which so well suit he time of life mr lovelace bow the man be fond of praise more fond of it i doubt than of deserving it yet this sort of praise he do deserve he have you know a easy free manner and no bad voice : and this praise so expand he gay heart that he sing the follow line from congreve as he tell we they be : youth do a thousand pleasure bring which from decrepid age will fly sweet that wanton in the bosom of the spring in winter 's cold embrace die and this for a compliment as he say to the two niece nor be it throw away upon they they encore it and he compliance fix they in my memory we have some talk about meal and the widow very civilly offer to conform to any rule i would set she i tell she how easily i be pleased and how much i choose to dine by myself and that from a plate send I from any single dish but i will not trouble you my dear with such particulars they think I very singular and with reason : but as i like they not so very well as to forego my own choice in compliment to they i be the less concerned for what they think -- and still the less as mr lovelace have put I very much out of humor with he they however caution I against melancholy i say i should be a very unhappy creature if i could not bear my own company mr lovelace say that he must let the lady into my story and then they would know how to allow for my way but my dear as you love I say the confident wretch give as little way to melancholy as possible nothing but the sweetness of you temper and you high notion of a duty that never can be deserve where you place it can make you so uneasy as you be -- be not angry my dear love for say so -lrb- see I frown i suppose : -rrb- and snatch my hand and kiss it -- i leave he with they and retire to my closet and my pen just as i have write thus far i be interrupt by a message from he that he be set out on a journey and desire to take my command -- so here i will leave off to give he a meeting in the dining-room i be not displeased to see he in he riding-dress he seem desirous to know how i like the gentlewoman below i tell he that although i do not think they very exceptionable yet as i want not in my present situation new acquaintance i should not be fond of cultivate theirs he urge I still farther on this head i could not say i tell he that i greatly like either of the young gentlewoman any more than they aunt : and that be my situation ever so happy they have much too gay a turn for I he do not wonder he say to hear I say so he know not any of the sex who have be accustom to show themselves at the town diversion and amusement that would appear tolerable to I silence and blush madam be now no grace with we fine lady in town harden by frequent public appearance they would be as much ashamed to be find guilty of these weakness as man do you defend these two gentlewoman sir by reflection upon half the sex but you must second I mr lovelace -lrb- and yet i be not fond of be think particular -rrb- in my desire of breakfast and sup -lrb- when i do sup -rrb- by myself if i would have it so to be sure it should be so the people of the house be not of consequence enough to be apologize to in any point where my pleasure be concerned and if i should dislike they still more on further knowledge of they he hope i would think of some other lodgings he express a good deal of regret at leave I declare that it be absolutely in obedience to my command : but that he could not have consent to go while my brother 's scheme be on foot if i have not do he the credit of my countenance in the report he have make that we be marry which he say have bind all the family to he interest so that he could leave I with the greater security and satisfaction he hope he say that on he return i would name he happy day and the rather as i might be convince by my brother 's project that no reconciliation be to be expect i tell he that perhaps i might write one letter to my uncle harlowe he once love I i should be easier when i have make one direct application i might possibly propose such term in relation to my grandfather 's estate as might procure I they attention and i hope he would be long enough absent to give I time to write to he and receive a answer from he that he must beg my pardon he could not promise he would inform himself of singleton 's and my brother 's motion and if on he return he find no reason for apprehension he would go directly for berk and endeavor to bring up with he he cousin charlotte who he hope would induce I to give he a earlier day than at present i seem to think of -- i seem to think of my dear very acquiescent as i should imagine i tell he that i should take that young lady 's company for a great favor i be the more pleased with this motion as it come from himself and with no ill grace he earnestly press I to accept of a bank note : but i decline it and then he offer I he servant william for my attendant in he absence who he say might be dispatch to he if any thing extraordinary fall out i consent to that he take he leave of I in the most respectful manner only kiss my hand he leave the bank note unobserved by I upon the table you may be sure i shall give it he back at he return i be in a much better humor with he than i be where doubt of any person be remove a mind not ungenerous be willing by way of amends for have conceive those doubt to construe every thing that happen capable of a good instruction in that person 's favor particularly i can not but be please to observe that although he speak of the lady of he family with the freedom of relationship yet it be always of tenderness and from a man 's kindness to he relation of the sex a woman have some reason to expect he good behavior to herself when marry if she be willing to deserve it from he and thus my dear be i bring to sit down satisfied with this man where i find room to infer that he be not by nature a savage but how could a creature who -lrb- treat herself unpolitely -rrb- give a man a opportunity to run away with she expect to be treat by that man with a very high degree of politeness but why now when fairer prospects seem to open why these melancholy reflection will my beloved friend ask of she clarissa why can you ask why my dearest miss howe of a creature who in the world 's eye have enrol she name among the giddy and inconsiderate who labor under a parent 's curse and the cruel uncertainty which must arise from reflect that equally against duty and principle she have throw herself into the power of a man and that man a immoral one -- must not the sense she have of she inconsideration darken she most hopeful prospects must it not even rise strongest upon a thoughtful mind when she hope be the fairest even she pleasure be the man to prove better than she expect come to she with a abatement like that which person who be in possession of ill-gotten wealth must then most poignantly experience -lrb- if they have reflect and unseared mind -rrb- when

brother-varlet from blunder for as thou must have observe from what i have write we have the most watchful and most penetrate lady in the world to deal with a lady worth deceive but whose eye will piece to the bottom of you shallow soul the moment she hear you open do you therefore place thyself between mowbray and tourville : they toe to be play upon and command by thine if they go wrong : thy elbow to be the minister of approbation as to you general behavior no hypocrisy -- i hate it : so do my charmer if i have study for it i believe i could have be a hypocrite : but my general character be so well know that i should have be suspect at once have i aim at make myself too white but what necessity can there be for hypocrisy unless the generality of the sex be to refuse we for we immorality the best of they love to have the credit for reform we let the sweet soul try for it : if they fail they intent be good that will be a consolation to they and as to we we work will be the easier we sin the fewer : since they will draw themselves in with a very little of we help and we shall save a parcel of cursed falsehood and appear to be what we be both to angel and man -- mean time they very grandmother will acquit we and reproach they with they self-do self-have and as have err against knowledge and venture against manifest appearance what folly therefore for man of we

and congratulating she upon she nuptials and that she receive such they compliment and congratulation with no other visible displeasure or repugnance than such as a young bride full of blush and pretty confusion might be suppose to express upon such contemplative revolving as those compliment would naturally inspire ' nor do thou rave at I jack nor rebel dost think i bring the dear creature hither for nothing and here be a faint sketch of my plot -- stand by varlet -- tanta-ra-ra-ra -- veil you bonnet and confess you master letter v mr lovelace to john belford esq Sunday have be at church jack -- behave admirably well too my charmer be please with I now : for i be exceedingly attentive to the discourse and very ready in the auditor 's part of the service -- eye do not much wander how could they when the loveliest object infinitely the loveliest in the whole church be in my view dear creature how fervent how amiable in she devotions i have get she to own that she pray for I i hope a prayer from so excellent a mind will not be make in vain there be after all something beautifully solemn in devotion the sabbath be a charming institution to keep the heart right when it be right one day in seven how reasonable -- i think i 'll go to church once a day often i fancy it will go a great way towards make I a reform man to see multitude of well-appearing people all join in one reverend act a exercise how worthy of a rational being yet it add a sting or two to my former sting when i think of my project with regard to this charming creature in my conscience i believe if i be to go constantly to church i could not pursue they i have a scheme come into my head while there but i will renounce it because it obtrude itself upon I in so good a place excellent creature how many ruin have she prevent by attach I to herself -- by engross my whole attention but let I tell thee what pass between we in my first visit of this morning and then i will acquaint thee more largely with my good behavior at church i could not be admit till after eight i find she ready prepared to go out i pretend to be ignorant of she intention have charge dorca not to own that she have tell I of it go abroad madam -- with a air of indifference yes sir : i intend to go to church i hope madam i shall have the honor to attend you no : she design to take a chair and go to the next church this startle I : -- a chair to carry she to the next church from mr sinclair 's she right name not sinclair and to bring she back hither in the face of people who might not think well of the house -- there be no permit that yet i be to appear indifferent but say i should take it for a favor if she would permit I to attend she in a coach as there be time for it to st paul 's she make objection to the gaiety of my dress and tell I that if she go to st paul 's she could go in a coach without I i object singleton and she brother and offer to dress in the plainest suit i have i beg the favor of attend you dear madam say i i have not be at church a great while we shall sit in different stall and the next time i go i hope it will be to give myself a title to the greatest blessing i can receive she make some further objection : but at last permit I the honor of attend she i get myself place in she eye that the time might not seem tedious to I for we be there early and i gain she good opinion as i mention above by my behavior the subject of the discourse be particular enough : it be about a prophet 's story or parable of a ewe-lamb take by a rich man from a poor one who dearly love it and whose only comfort it be : design to strike remorse into david on he adultery with uriah 's wife bathsheba and he murder of the husband these woman jack have be the occasion of all manner of mischief from the begin now when david full of indignation swear -lrb- king david would swear jack : but how shouldst thou know who king david be -- the story be in the bible -rrb- that the rich man should surely die nathan which be the prophet 's name and a good ingenious fellow cry out -lrb- which be the word of the text -rrb- thou art the man by my soul i think the parson look directly at I and at that moment i cast my eye full on my ewe-lamb -- but i must tell thee too that that i think a good deal of my rosebud -- a better man than king david in that point however think i when we come home we talk upon the subject and i show my charmer my attention to the discourse by let she know where the doctor make the most of he subject and where it might have be touch to greater advantage : for it be really a very affect story and have as pretty a contrivance in it as ever i read and this i do in such a grave way that she seem more and more pleased with I and i have no doubt that i shall get she to favor I to-morrow night with she company at my collation Sunday evening we all dine together in mr sinclair 's parlor : -- all excessively right the two niece have top they part -- mr sinclair she 's never be so easy as now -- ` she really think a little oddly of these people at first she say mr sinclair seem very forbid she niece be person with whom she could not wish to be acquaint but really we should not be too hasty in we censure some people improve upon we the widow seem tolerable ' she go no farther than tolerable -- ` miss martin and miss horton be young people of good sense and have read a great deal what miss martin particularly say of marriage and of she humble servant be very solid she believe with such notion she can not make a bad wife ' i have say sally 's humble servant be a woolen - draper of great reputation and she be soon to be marry i have be let she into thy character and into the character of my other three esquire in hope to excite she curiosity to see you to-morrow night i have tell she some of the worst as well as best part of you character in order to exalt myself and to obviate any sudden surprize as well as to teach she what sort of man she may expect to see if she will oblige I with she company by she after-observation upon each of you i shall judge what i may or may not do to obtain or keep she good opinion what she will like or what not and so pursue the one or avoid the other as i see proper so while she be penetrate into you shallow head i shall enter she heart and know what to bid my own to hope for the house be to be take in three week -- all will be over in three week or bad will be my luck -- who know but in three day -- have i not carry that great point of make she pass for my wife to the people below and that other great one of fix myself here night and day -- what woman ever escape I who lodge under one roof with I -- the house too the house the people -- people after my own heart she servant will and dorca both my servant -- three day do i say pho pho pho -- three hour \*\*\* i have carry my third point : but so extremely to the dislike of my charmer that i have be threaten for suffering miss partington to be introduce to she without she leave which lay she under a necessity to deny or comply with the urgent request of so fine a young lady who have engage to honor I at my collation on condition that my beloved would be present at it to be oblige to appear before my friend as what she be not she be for insist that i should acquaint the woman here with the truth of the matter and not go on propagate story for she to countenance make she a sharer in my guilt but what point will not perseverance carry especially when it be cover over with the face of yield now and parthian-like return to the charge anon do not the sex carry all they point with they man by the same method have i converse with they so freely as i have do and learn nothing of they do thou ever know that a woman 's denial of any favor whether the least or the greatest that my heart be set upon stand she in any stead the more perverse she the more steady i -- that be my rule but the point thus so much against she will carry i doubt thou will see in she more of a sullen than of a oblige charmer : for when miss partington be withdraw ` what be miss partington to she in she situation she want no new acquaintance and what be my four friend to she in she present circumstance she would assure I if ever again ' -- and there she stop with a twirl of she hand when we meet i will in she presence tip thee a wink show thee the motion for it be a very pretty one quite new yet have i see a hundred pretty passionate twirl too in my time from other fair-one how universally engage be it to put a woman of sense to whom a man be not marry in a passion let the reception give to every ranting scene in we play testify take care my charmer now thou art come to delight I with thy angry twirl that thou temptest I not to provoke a variety of they from one whose every motion whose every air carry in it so much sense and soul but angry or pleased this charming creature must be all loveliness she feature be all harmony and make for one another no other feature could be substitute in the place of any one of she 's but most abate of she perfection : and think you that i do not long to have you opinion of my fair prize if you love to see feature that glow though the heart be frozen and never yet be thaw if you love fine sense and adage flow through tooth of ivory and lip of coral a eye that penetrate all thing a voice that be harmony itself a air of grandeur mingle with a sweetness that can not be describe a politeness that if ever equal be never excel -- you 'll see all these excellency and ten time more in this my gloriana mark she majestic fabric -- she be a temple sacred by birth and build by hand divine she soul the deity that lodge there : nor be the pile unworthy of the god or to describe she in a softer style with rowe the bloom of op ` ning flow ` r unsully would beauty softness and sweetest innocence she wear and look like nature in the world 's first spring adieu varlet four -- at six on Monday evening i expect ye all letter vi miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe Sunday April 30 -lrb- mr lovelace in he last letter have take notice of the most material passage contain in this letter the follow extract from it be only insert she give pretty near the same account that he do of what pass between they on she resolution to go to church and of he proposal of st paul 's and desire of attend she -- she praise he good behavior there as also the discourse and the preacher -- be pleased with its seasonableness -- give particulars of the conversation between they afterwards and commend the good observation he make upon the sermon -rrb- i be willing say she to have hope of he : but be so unable to know how to depend upon he seriousness for a hour together that all my favourable account of he in this respect must be take with allowance be very much press i could not tell how to refuse dining with the widow and she niece this day i be better pleased with they than i ever think i should be i can not help blame myself for my readiness to give severe censure where reputation be concerned people 's way humor constitution education and opportunity allow for my dear many person as far as i know may appear blameless whom other of different humor and education be too apt to blame and who from the same fault may be as ready to blame they i will therefore make it a rule to myself for the future -- never to judge peremptorily on first appearance : but yet i must observe that these be not people i should choose to be intimate with or whose way i can like : although for the station they be in they may go through the world with tolerable credit mr lovelace 's behavior have be such as make I call this so far as it be pass a agreeable day yet when easiest as to he my situation with my friend take place in my thought and cause I many a tear i be the more pleased with the people of the house because of the person of rank they be acquaint with and who visit they Sunday evening i be still well pleased with mr lovelace 's behavior we have have a good deal of serious discourse together the man have really just and good notion he confess how much he be please with this day and hope for many such nevertheless he ingenuously warn I that he unlucky vivacity might return : but he doubt not that he should be fix at last by my example and conversation he have give I a entertaining account of the four gentleman he be to meet to-morrow night -- entertaining i mean for he humourous description of they person manners & c but such a description as be far from be to they praise yet he seem rather to design to divert my melancholy by it than to degrade they i think at bottom my dear that he must be a good-natured man but that he be spoil young for want of check or controul i can not but call this my circumstance consider a happy day to the end of it indeed my dear i think i could prefer he to all the man i ever know be he but to be always what he have be this day you see how ready i be to own all you have charge I with when i find myself out it be a difficult thing i believe sometimes for a young creature that be able to deliberate with herself to know when she love or when she hate : but i be resolve as much as possible to be determine both in my hatred and love by action as they make the man worthy or unworthy -lrb- she date again Monday and declare herself highly displeased at miss partington 's be introduce to she : and still more for be oblige to promise to be present at mr lovelace 's collation she foresee she say a murder would evening -rrb- letter vii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe Monday night may 1 i have just escape from a very disagreeable company i be oblige so much against my will to be in as a very particular relation of this evening 's conversation would be painful to I you must content yourself with what you shall be able to collect from the outline as i may call they of the character of the person assist by the little history mr lovelace give I of each yesterday the name of the gentleman be belton mowbray tourville and belford these four with mr sinclair miss partington the great heiress mention in my last mr lovelace and myself make up the company i give you before the favourable side of miss partington 's character such as it be give to I by mr sinclair and she niece i will now add a few word from my own observation upon she behavior in this company in better company perhaps she would have appear to less disadvantage : but notwithstanding she innocent look which mr lovelace also highly praise he be the last person whose judgment i would take upon real modesty for i observe that upon some talk from the gentleman not free enough to be easily censure yet too indecent in its implication to come from well-bred person in the company of virtuous prople -lrb- sic -rrb- this young lady be very ready to apprehend and yet by smile and simpering to encourage rather than discourage the culpable freedom of person who in what they go out of they way to say must either be guilty of absurdity meaning nothing or meaning something of rudeness \* \* mr belford in letter xiii of vol v remind mr lovelace of some particular topic which pass in they conversation extremely to the lady 's honor but indeed i have see no woman of whom i have a better opinion than i can say of mr sinclair who have allow gentleman and themselves too in greater liberty of this sort than i have think consistent with that purity of manners which ought to be the distinguish characteristic of we sex : for what be word but the body and dress of thought and be not the mind of a person strongly indicate by outward dress but to the gentleman -- as they must be call in right of they ancestor it seem for no other do they appear to have : -- mr belton have have university education and be design for the gown but that not suit with the gaiety of he temper and a uncle die who devise to he a good estate he quit the college come up to town and commence fine gentleman he be say to be a man of sense -- mr belton dress gaily but not quite foppishly drink hard keep all hour and glory in do so game and have be hurt by that pernicious diversion : he be about thirty year of age : he face be a fiery red somewhat bloated and pimply and he irregularity threaten a brief duration to the sensual dream he be in : for he have a short consumption cough which seem to denote bad lung yet make himself and he friend merry by he stupid and inconsiderate jest upon very threatening symptom which ought to make he more serious mr mowbray have be a great traveller speak as many language as mr lovelace himself but not so fluently : be of a good family : seem to be about thirty-three or thirty-four : tall and comely in he person : bold and daring in he look : be a large-boned strong man : have a great scar in he forehead with a dent as if he skull have be beat in there and a seamed scar in he right cheek : he likewise dress very gaily : have he servant always about he whom he be continually call upon and send on the most trifling message -- half a dozen instance of which we have in the little time i be among they while they seem to watch the turn of he fierce eye to be ready to run before they have half he message and serve he with fear and tremble yet to he equal the man seem tolerable : he talk not amiss upon public entertainment and diversion especially upon those abroad : yet have a romance air and aver thing strongly which seem quite improbable indeed he doubt nothing but what he ought to believe for he jest upon sacred thing and profess to hate the clergy of all religion he have high notion of honor a world hardly ever out of he mouth but seem to have no great regard to moral mr tourville occasionally tell he age just turn of thirty-one he be also of a ancient family but in he person and manners more of what i call the coxcomb than any of he companion he dress richly would be think elegant in the choice and fashion of what he wear yet after all appear rather tawdry than fine -- one see by the care he take of he outside and the notice he bespeak from every one by he own notice of himself that the inside take up the least of he attention he dance finely mr lovelace say be a master of music and singing be one of he principal excellency they prevail upon he to sing and he oblige they both in italian and french and to do he justice he song in both be decent they be all highly delighted with he performance but he greatest admirer be mrs sinclair miss partington and himself to I he appear to have a great deal of affectation mr tourville 's conversation and address be insufferably full of those really gross affront upon the understanding of we sex which the modern call compliment and be intend to pass for so many instance of good breeding though the most hyperbolical unnatural stuff that can be conceive and which can only serve to show the insincerity of the complimenter and the ridiculous light in which the complimented appear in he eye if he suppose a woman capable of relish the romantic absurdity of he speech he affect to introduce into he common talk italian and french word and often answer a english question in french which language he greatly prefer to the barbarously hiss english but then he never fail to translate into this he odious native tongue the word and the sentence he speak in the other two -- lest perhaps it should be question whether he understand what he say he love to tell story : always call they merry facetious good or excellent before he begin in order to bespeak the attention of the hearer but never give himself concern in the progress or conclusion of they to make good what he promise in he preface indeed he seldom bring any of they to a conclusion for if he company have patience to hear he out he break in upon himself by so many parenthetical intrusion as one may call they and have so many incident spring in upon he that he frequently drop he own thread and sometimes sit down satisfied half way or if at other time he would resume it he apply to he company to help he in again with a devil fetch he if he remember what he be drive at -- but enough and too much of mr tourville mr belford be the fourth gentleman and one of whom mr lovelace seem more fond than any of the rest for he be a man of try bravery it seem and this pair of friend come acquaint upon occasion of a quarrel -lrb- possibly about a woman -rrb- which bring on a challenge and a meeting at kensington gravel-pit which end without unhappy consequence by the mediation of three gentleman stranger just as each have make a pass at the other mr belford it seem be about seven or eight and twenty he be the youngest of the five except mr lovelace and they be perhaps the wickedest for they seem to lead the other three as they please mr belford as the other dress gaily but have not those advantage of person nor from he dress which mr lovelace be too proud of he have however the appearance and air of a gentleman he be well read in classical author and in the best english poet and writer and by he means the conversation take now and then a more agreeable turn and i who endeavor to put the best face i could upon my situation as i pass for mr lovelace with they make shift to join in it at such time and receive abundance of compliment from all the company on the observation i make \* \* see letter xiii of vol v above refer to mr belford seem good-natured and oblige and although very complaisant not so fulsomely so as mr tourville and have a polite and easy manner of express he sentiment on all occasion he seem to delight in a logical way of argumentation as also do mr belton these two attack each other in this way and both look at we woman as if to observe whether we do not admire this learning or when they have say a smart thing they wit but mr belford have visibly the advantage of the other have quicker part and by take the worst side of the argument seem to think he have upon the whole of he behavior and conversation he put I in mind of that character of milton : -- -------- he tongue dropt manna and could make the worse appear the better reason to perplex and dash maturest counsel for he thought be low to vice industrious : but to nobler deed tim ` rous and slothful : yet he please the ear how little soever matter in general may be to we liking we be apt when hope be strong enough to permit it to endeavor to make the best we can of the lot we have draw and i could not but observe often how much mr lovelace excel all he four friend in every thing they seem desirous to excel in but as to wit and vivacity he have no equal there all the other give up to he when he lip begin to open the haughty mowbray would call upon the prate tourville for silence when lovelace be go to speak and when he have speak the word charming fellow with a free word of admiration or envy fall from every mouth he have indeed so many advantage in he person and manner that what would be inexcusable in another would if one watch not over one 's self and do not endeavor to distinguish what be the essence of right and wrong look become in he mr belford to my no small vexation and confusion with the forwardness of a favored and intrusted friend single I out on mr lovelace 's be send for down to make I congratulatory compliment on my suppose nuptials which he do with a caution not to insist too long on the rigorous vow i have impose upon a man so universally admire -- ` see he among twenty man ' say he ` all of distinction and nobody be regard but mr lovelace ' it must indeed be confess that there be in he whole deportment a natural dignity which render all insolent or imperative demeanor as unnecessary as inexcusable then that deceive sweetness which appear in he smile in he accent in he whole aspect and address when he think it worth he while to oblige or endeavor to attract how do this show that he be bear innocent as i may say that he be not naturally the cruel the boisterous the impetuous creature which the wicked company he may have fall into have make he for he have besides as open and i think a honest countenance do not you think so my dear on all these specious appearance have i found my hope of see he a reform man but it be amazing to I i own that with so much of the gentleman such a general knowledge of book and man such a skill in the learn as well as modern language he can take so much delight as he do in the company of such person as i have describe and in subject of frothy impertinence unworthy of he talent and he natural and acquire advantage i can think but of one reason for it and that must argue a very low mind -- he vanity which make he desirous of be consider as the head of the people he consort with -- a man to love praise yet to be content to draw it from such contaminate spring one compliment pass from mr belford to mr lovelace which hasten my quit the shocking company -- ` you be a happy man mr lovelace ' say he upon some fine speech make he by mr sinclair and assent to by miss partington : -- ` you have so much courage and so much wit that neither man nor woman can stand before you ' mr belford look at I when he speak : yes my dear he smilingly look at I and he look upon he complimented friend and all they assent and therefore affront eye both man 's and woman 's be turn upon you clarissa at least my self-reproaching heart make I think so for that would hardly permit my eye to look up oh my dear be but a woman who give reason to the world to think she to be in love with a man -lrb- and this must be believe to be my case or to what can my suppose voluntary go off with mr lovelace be imputed -rrb- to reflect one moment on the exaltation she give he and the disgrace she bring upon herself -- the low pity the silent contempt the insolent sneer and whisper to which she make herself obnoxious from a censure world of both sex -- how would she despise herself and how much more eligible would she think death itself than such a discover debasement what i have thus in general touch upon will account to you why i could not more particularly relate what pass in this evening 's conversation : which as may be gather from what i have write abound with approbatory accusation and suppose witty retort letter viii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe Monday midnight i be very much vex and disturb at a odd incident mr sinclair have just now leave I i believe in displeasure on my decline to comply with a request she make I : which be to admit miss partington to a share in my bed she house be crowd by she niece 's guest and by they attendant as well as by those of miss partington there might be nothing in it and my denial carry a stiff and ill - natured appearance but instantly upon she make the request it come into my thought ` that i be in a manner a stranger to every body in the house : not so much as a servant i could call my own or of whom i have any great opinion : that there be four man of free manners in the house avowed supporter of mr lovelace in matter of offence himself a man of enterprise all as far as i know -lrb- and as i have reason to think by they noisy mirth after i leave they -rrb- drinking deeply : that miss partington herself be not so bashful a person as she be represent to I to be : that officious pain be take to give I a good opinion of she : and that mr sinclair make a greater parade in preface the request than such a request need to deny thought i can carry only a appearance of singularity to people who already think I singular to consent may possibly if not probably be attend with inconveniency the consequence of the alternative so very disproportionate i think it more prudent to incur the censure than to risque the inconvenience ' i tell she that i be write a long letter : that i should choose to write till i be sleepy and that a companion would be a restraint upon I and i upon she she be loth she say that so delicate a young creature and so great a fortune as miss partington should be put to lie with dorca in a press-bed she should be very sorry if she have ask a improper thing she have never be so put to it before and miss would stay up with she till i have do write alarm at this urgency and it be easier to persist in a denial give than to give it at first i say miss partington should be welcome to my whole bed and i would retire into the dining-room and there lock myself in write all the night the poor thing she say be afraid to lie alone to be sure miss partington would not put I to such a inconvenience she then withdraw -- but return -- beg my pardon for return but the poor child she say be in tear -- miss partington have never see a young lady she so much admire and so much wish to imitate as I the dear girl hope that nothing have pass in she behavior to give I dislike to she -- should she bring she to I i be very busy i say : the letter i be write be upon a very important subject i hope to see the young lady in the morning when i would apologize to she for my particularity and then mr sinclair hesitate and move towards the door -lrb- though she turn round to I again -rrb- i desire she -lrb- light she -rrb- to take care how she go down pray madam say she on the stairs-head do not give yourself all this trouble god know my heart i mean no affront : but since you seem to take my freedom amiss i beg you will not acquaint mr lovelace with it for he perhaps will think I bold and impertinent now my dear be not this a particular incident either as i have make it or as it be design i do not love to do a uncivil thing and if nothing be mean by the request my refusal deserve to be call uncivil then i have show a suspicion of foul usage by it which surely dare not be mean if just i ought to apprehend every thing and fly the house and the man as i would a infection if not just and if i can not

not altogether so happy as be to be wish and be moreover forbid to enter into the cruel subject i can only offer as i do my best and faithfullest service and wish you a happy deliverance from all you trouble for i be most excellent young lady you faithful and most obedient servant ch hickman letter xiii mr lovelace to john belford esq Tuesday may 2 mercury as the fabulist tell we have the curiosity to know the estimation he stand in among mortal descend in disguise and in a statuary 's shop cheapen a jupiter then a juno then one then another of the dii majore and at last ask what price that same statue of mercury bear o sir say the artist buy one of the other and i 'll throw you in that for nothing how sheepish must the god of thief look upon this rebuff to he vanity so thou a thousand pound wouldst thou give for the good opinion of this single lady -- to be only think tolerably of and not quite unworthy of she conversation would make thee happy and at parting last night or rather this morning thou madest I promise a few line to edgware to let thee know what she think of thee and of thy brethren thy thousand pound jack be all thy own : for most heartily do she dislike ye all -- thee as much as any of the rest i be sorry for it too as to thy part for two reason -- one that i think thy motive for thy curiosity be fear of consciousness : whereas that of the arch-thief be vanity intolerable vanity : and he be therefore justly send away with a blush upon he cheek to heaven and could not brag -- the other that i be afraid if she dislike thee she dislike I : for be we not bird of a feather i must never talk of reformation she tell I have such companion and take such delight as i seem to take in they frothy conversation i no more than you jack imagine she could possibly like ye : but then as my friend i think a person of she education would have be more sparing of she censure i do not know how it be belford but woman think themselves entitle to take any freedom with we while we be unpolite forsooth and i can not tell what if we do not tell a pack of curse lie and make black white in they favor -- teach we to be hypocrite yet stigmatize we at other time for deceiver i defend ye all as well as i could : but you know there be no attempt aught but a palliative defense to one of she principle i will summarily give thee a few of my plea ` to the pure every little deviation seem offensive : yet i see not that there be any thing amiss the whole evening either in the word or behavior of any of my friend some people could talk but upon one or two subject : she upon every one : no wonder therefore they talk to what they understand best and to mere object of sense have she honor we with more of she conversation she would have be less disgusted with ours for she see how every one be prepare to admire she whenever she open she lip you in particular have say when she retire that virtue itself speak when she speak but that you have such a awe upon you after she have favor we with a observation or two on a subject start that you should ever be afraid in she company to be find most exceptionable when you intend to be least so ' plainly she say she neither like my companion nor the house she be in i like not the house any more than she : though the people be very obliging and she have own they be less exceptionable to herself than at first : and be we not about another of we own she do not like miss partington -- let she fortune be what it would and she have hear a great deal say of she fortune she should not choose a intimacy with she she think it be a hardship to be put upon such a difficulty as she be put upon the precede night when there be lodger in the front-house whom they have reason to be freer with than upon so short a acquaintance with she i pretend to be a utter stranger as to this particular and when she explain herself upon it condemn mr sinclair 's request and call it a confident one she artfully make lighter of she denial of the girl for a bedfellow than she think of it i could see that for it be plain she suppose there be room for I to think she have be either over-nice or over - cautious i offer to resent mr sinclair 's freedom no there be no great matter in it it be best to let it pass it might be think more particular in she to deny such a request than in mr sinclair to make it or in miss partington to expect it to be comply with but as the people below have a large acquaintance she do not know how often she might indeed have she retirement invade if she give way and indeed there be levity in the behavior of that young lady which she could not so far pass over as to wish a intimacy with she i say i like miss partington as little as she could miss partington be a silly young creature who seem to justify the watchfulness of she guardian over she -- but nevertheless as to she own that i think the girl -lrb- for girl she be as to discretion -rrb- not exceptionable only carry herself like a free good-natured creature who believe herself secure in the honor of she company it be very well say of I she reply : but if that young lady be so well satisfy with she company she must need say that i be very kind to suppose she such a innocent -- for she own part she have see nothing of the london world : but think she must tell I plainly that she never be in such company in she life nor ever again wish to be in such there belford -- worse off than mercury -- art thou not i be nettle hard would be the lot of more discreet woman as far as i know that miss partington be they to be judge by so rigid a virtue as hers not so she say : but if i really see nothing exceptionable to a virtuous mind in that young person 's behavior my ignorance of better behavior be she must need tell I as pitiable as hers : and it be to be wish that mind so paired for they own sake should never be separate see jack what i get by my charity i thank she heartily but say that i must take the liberty to observe that good folk be generally so uncharitable that devil take I if i would choose to be good be the consequence to be that i must think hardly of the whole world besides she congratulate I upon my charity but tell I that to enlarge she own she hope it would not be expect of she to approve of the low company i have bring she into last night no exception for thee belford -- safe be thy thousand pound i see not i say beg she pardon that she like any body -- -lrb- plain deal for plain deal jack -- why then do she abuse my friend -rrb- however let I but know whom and what she do or do not like and if possible i would like and dislike the very same person and thing she bid I then in a pet dislike myself curse severe -- do she think she must not pay for it one day or one night -- and if one many that be my comfort i be in such a train of be happy i say before my earnestness to procure she to favor my friend with she company that i wish the devil have have as well my friend as miss partington -- and yet i must say that i see not how good people could answer half they end which be to reform the wicked by precept as well as example be they to accompany only with the good i have the like to have be blast by two or three flash of lightning from she indignant eye and she turn scornfully from I and retire to she own apartment once more jack safe as thou seest be thy thousand pound she say i be not a polite man but be she in the instance before we more polite for a woman and now dost thou not think that i owe my charmer some revenge for she cruelty in oblige such a fine young creature and so vast a fortune as miss partington to crowd into a press-bed with dorca the maid-servant of the proud refuser -- miss partington too -lrb- with tear -rrb- declare by mr sinclair that would mr lovelace do she the honor of a visit at barnet the best bed and best room in she guardian 's house should be at she service thinkest thou that i could not guess at she dishonourable fear of I -- that she apprehend that the suppose husband would endeavor to take possession of he own -- and that miss partington would be willing to contribute to such a piece of justice thus then thou both remindest and defiest I charmer -- and since thou reliest more on thy own precaution than upon my honor be it unto thee fair one as thou apprehendest and now jack let I know what thy opinion and the opinion of thy brother varlet be of my gloriana i have just now hear that hannah hope to be soon well enough to attend she young lady when in london it seem the girl have have no physician i must send she one out of pure love and respect to she mistress who know but medicine may weaken nature and strengthen the disease -- as she malady be not a fever very likely it may do so -- but perhaps the wench 's hope be too forward bluster weather in this month yet -- and that be bad for rheumatic complaint letter xiv mr lovelace to john belford esq Tuesday may 2 just as i have seal up the enclosed come a letter to my beloved in a cover to I direct to lord m 's from whom thinkest thou -- from mr howe and what the contents how should i know unless the dear creature have communicate they to I but a very cruel letter i believe it be by the effect it have upon she the tear run down she cheek as she read it and she color change several time no end of she persecution i think ` what a cruelty in my fate ' say the sweet lamenter -- ` now the only comfort of my life must be give up ' miss howe 's correspondence no doubt but should she be so much grieve at this this correspondence be prohibit before and that to the daughter in the strongest term : but yet carry on by both although a brace of impeccable a not please ye could they expect that a mother would not vindicate she authority -- and find she prohibition ineffectual with she perverse daughter be it not reasonable to suppose she would try what effect it would have upon she daughter 's friend -- and now i believe the end will be effectually answer : for my beloved i dare say will make a point of conscience of it i hate cruelty especially in woman and should have be more concerned for this instance of it in mr howe have i not have a stronger instance of the same in my beloved to miss partington : for how do she know since she be so much afraid for herself whom dorca might let in to that innocent and less watchful young lady but nevertheless i must need own that i be not very sorry for this prohibition let it originally come from the harlowe or from whom it will because i make no doubt that it be owe to miss howe in a great measure that my beloved be so much upon she guard and think so hardly of I and who can tell as character here be so tender and some disguise so flimsy what consequence might follow this undutiful correspondence -- i say therefore i be not sorry for it : now will she not have any body to compare note with : any body to alarm she : and i may be save the guilt and disobligation of inspect into a correspondence that have long make I uneasy how every thing work for I -- why will this charming creature make such contrivance necessary as will increase my trouble and my guilt too as some will account it but why rather i should ask will she fight against she star letter xv mr belford to robert lovelace esq edgware Tuesday night may 2 without stay for the promise letter from you to inform we what the lady say of we i write to tell you that we be all of one opinion with regard to she which be that there be not of she age a finer woman in the world as to she understanding as for she person she be at the age of bloom and a admirable creature a perfect beauty : but this poorer praise a man who have be honor with she conversation can hardly descend to give and yet she be bring amongst we contrary to she will permit I dear lovelace to be a mean of save this excellent creature from the danger she hourly run from the most plot heart in the world in a former i plead you own family lord m 's wish particularly and then i have not see she : but now i join she sake honor 's sake motive of justice generosity gratitude and humanity which be all concern in the preservation of so fine a woman thou knowest not the anguish i should have have -lrb- whence arise i can not devise -rrb- have i not know before i set out this morning that the incomparable creature have disappoint thee in thy curse view of get she to admit the specious partington for a bed-fellow i have do nothing but talk of this lady ever since i see she there be something so awful and yet so sweet in she aspect that be i to have the virtue and the grace all draw in one piece they should be take every one of they from different air and attribute in she she be bear to adorn the age she be give to and would be a ornament to the first dignity what a pierce yet gentle eye every glance i think mingle with love and fear of you what a sweet smile dart through the cloud that overspread she fair face demonstrate that she have more apprehension and grief at she heart than she care to express you may think what i be go to write too flighty : but by my faith i have conceive such a profound reverence for she sense and judgment that far from think the man excusable who should treat she basely i be ready to regret that such a angel of a woman should even marry she be in my eye all mind : and be she to meet with a man all mind likewise why should the charming quality she be mistress of be endanger why should such a angel be plunge so low as into the vulgar office of a domestic life be she mine i should hardly wish to see she a mother unless there be a kind of moral certainty that mind like hers could be propagate for why in short should not the work of body be leave to mere body i know that you yourself have a opinion of she little less exalted belton mowbray tourville be all of my mind be full of she praise and swear it would be a million of pity to ruin a woman in whose fall none but devil can rejoice what must that merit and excellence be which can extort this from we freeliver like yourself and all of you just resentment against the rest of she family and offer we assistance to execute you vengeance on they but we can not think it reasonable that you should punish a innocent creature who love you so well and who be in you protection and have suffer so much for you for the fault of she relation and here let I put a serious question or two thinkest thou truly admirable as this lady be that the end thou proposest to thyself if obtain be answerable to the means to the trouble thou givest thyself and to the perfidy trick stratagem and contrivance thou have already be guilty of and still meditatest in every real excellence she surpass all she sex but in the article thou seekest to subdue she for a mere sensualist a partington a horton a martin would make a sensualist a thousand time happier than she either will or can sweet be the joy that come with willingness and wouldst thou make she unhappy for she whole life and thyself not happy for a single moment hitherto it be not too late and that perhaps be as much as can be say if thou meanest to preserve she esteem and good opinion as well as person for i think it be impossible she can get out of thy hand now she be in this accursed house o that damned hypocritical sinclair as thou callest she how be it possible she should behave so speciously as she do all the time the lady staid with we -- be honest and marry and be thankful that she will condescend to have thee if thou dost not thou wilt be the worst of man and wilt be condemn in this world and the next : as i be sure thou oughtest and shouldest too wert thou to be judge by one who never before be so much touch in a woman 's favor and whom thou knowest to be thy partial friend j belford we companion consent that i should withdraw to write to the above effect they can make nothing of the character we write in and so i read this to they they approve of it and of they own motion each man would set he name to it i would not delay send it for fear of some detestable scheme take place thoma belton richard mowbray jame tourville just now be bring I both yours i vary not my opinion nor forbear my earnest prayer to you in she behalf notwithstanding she dislike of I letter xvi mr lovelace to john belford esq Wednesday may 3 when i have already take pain to acquaint thee in full with regard to my view design and resolution with regard to this admirable woman it be very extraordinary that thou shouldst vapor as thou dost in she behalf when i have make no trial no attempt : and yet givest it as thy opinion in a former letter that advantage may be take of the situation she be in and that she may be overcome most of thy reflection particularly that which respect the difference as to the joy to be give by the virtuous and libertine of she sex be fitter to come in as after-reflection than as antecedency i own with thee and with the poet that sweet be the joy that come with willingness -- but be it to be expect that a woman of education and a lover of form will yield before she be attack and have i so much as summon this to surrender i doubt not but i shall meet with difficulty i must therefore make my first effort by surprise there may possibly be some cruelty necessary : but there may be consent in struggle there may be yield in resistance but the first conflict over whether the follow may not be weaker and weaker till willingness ensue be the point to be try i will illustrate what i have say by the simile of a bird new catch we begin when boy with bird and when grow up go on to woman and both perhaps in turn experience we sportive cruelty hast thou not observe the charming gradation by which the ensnare volatile have be bring to bear with its new condition how at first refuse all sustenance it beat and bruise itself against its wire till it make its gay plumage fly about and over-spread its well-secured cage now it get out its head stick only at its beautiful shoulder : then with difficulty draw back its head it gasp for breath and erectly perch with meditate eye first survey and then attempt its wire canopy as it get its pretty head and side bite the wire and peck at the finger of its delighted tamer till at last find its effort ineffectual quite tired and breathless it lay itself down and pants at the bottom of the cage seem to bemoan its cruel fate and forfeit liberty and after a few day its struggle to escape still diminish as it find it to no purpose to attempt it its new habitation become familiar and it hop about from perch to perch resume its wonted cheerfulness and every day sing a song to amuse itself and reward its keeper now let I tell thee that i have know a bird actually starve itself and die with grief at its be catch and cage but never do i meet with a woman who be so silly -- yet have i hear the dear soul most vehemently threaten they own life on such a occasion but it be say nothing in a woman 's favor if we do not allow she to have more sense than a bird and yet we must all own that it be more difficult to catch a bird than a lady to pursue the comparison -- if the disappointment of the captivate lady be very great she will threaten indeed as i say : she will even refuse she sustenance for some time especially if you entreat she much and she think she give you concern by she refusal but then the stomach of the dear sullen one will soon return ` tis pretty to see how she come to by degree : press by appetite she will first steal perhaps a weep morsel by herself then be bring to piddle and sigh and sigh and piddle before you now-and-then if she viand be unsavoury swallow with they a relish tear or two : then she come to eat and drink to oblige you : then resolve to live for you sake : she exclamation will in the next place be turn into blandishments she vehement upbraiding into gentle murmuring -- how dare you traitor -- into how could you dearest she will draw you to she instead of push you from she : no longer with unsheathed claw will she resist you but like a pretty playful wanton kitten with gentle paw and conceal talon tap you cheek and with intermingled smile and tear and caress implore you consideration for she and you constancy : all the favor she then have to ask of you -- and this be the time be it give to man to confine himself to one object to be happier every day than another now belford be i to go no farther than i have go with my beloved miss harlowe how shall i know the difference between she and another bird to let she fly now what a pretty jest would that be -- how do i know except i try whether she may not be bring to sing I a fine song and to be as well contented as i have bring other bird to be and very shy one too but now let we reflect a little upon the confound partiality of we human creature i can give two or three familiar and if they be not familiar they would be shocking instance of the cruelty both of man and woman with respect to other creature perhaps as worthy as -lrb- at least more innocent than -rrb- themselves by my soul jack there be more of the savage on human nature than we be commonly aware of nor be it after all so much amiss that we sometimes avenge the more innocent animal upon we own species to particulars : how usual a thing be it for woman as well as man without the least remorse to ensnare to cage and torment and even with burn knitting-needle to put out the eye of the poor feather would songster -lrb- thou seest i have not yet do with bird -rrb- which however in proportion to its bulk have more life than themselves -lrb- for a bird be all soul -rrb- and of consequence have as much feeling as the human creature when at the same time if a honest fellow by the gentlest persuasion and the softest art have the good luck to prevail upon a mew would - up lady to countenance she own escape and she consent to break cage and be set a fly into the all-cheering air of liberty mercy on we what a outcry be generally raise against he just like what you and i once see raise in a paltry village near chelmsford after a poor hungry fox who watch he opportunity have seize by the neck and shoulder a sleek-feathered goose : at what time we behold the whole vicinage of boy and girl old man and old woman all the furrow and wrinkle of the latter fill up with malice for the time the old man arm with prong pitch-fork club and catstick the old woman with mop broom fire-shovel tong and poker and the younger fry with dirt stone and brickbat gather as they run like a snowball in pursuit of the wind-outstripping prowler all the mongrel cur of the circumjacency yelp yelp yelp at they heel complete the horrid chorus rememebrest thou not this scene surely thou must my imagination inflamed by a tender sympathy for the danger of the adventurous marauder represent it to my eye as if it be but yesterday and dost thou not recollect how generously glad we be as if we own case that honest reynard by the help of a lucky stile over which both old and young tumble upon one another and a wind course escape they brutal fury and fly catstick and how in fancy we follow he to he undiscovered retreat and imagine we behold the intrepid thief enjoy he dear-earned purchase with a delight proportion to he past danger i once make a charming little savage severely repent the delight she take in see she tabby favorite make cruel sport with a pretty sleek bead - eyed mouse before she devour it egad my love say i to myself as i sit meditate the scene i be determine to lie in wait for a fit opportunity to try how thou wilt like to be tost over my head and be catch again : how thou wilt like to be part from I and pull to I yet will i rather give life than take it away as this barbarous quadruped have at last do by she prey and after all be over between my girl and I i remind she of the incident to which my resolution be owe nor have i at another time any mercy upon the daughter of a old epicure who have teach the girl without the least remorse to roast lobster alive to cause a poor pig to be whipt to death to scrape carp the contrary way of the scale make they leap in the stew-pan and dress they in they own blood for sauce and this for luxury-sake and to provoke a appetite which i have without stimulation in my way and that i can tell thee a very ravenous one many more instance of the like nature could i give be i to leave nothing to thyself to shew that the best take the same liberty and perhaps worse with some sort of creature that we take with other all creature still and creature too as i have observe above replete with strong life and sensible feeling -- if therefore people pretend to mercy let mercy go through all they action i have hear somewhere that a merciful man be merciful to he beast so much at present for those part of thy letter

shall then conclude that there be not a woman in the world who can resist a bold and resolute lover a messenger be just now arrive from my uncle the mortification it seem be get to he knee and the surgeon declare that he can not live many day he therefore send for I directly with these shocking word that i will come and close he eye my servant or he must of necessity be in town every day on he

pretty much to the same effect as in mr lovelace 's letter no xiii and then proceed : -rrb- he be constantly accuse I of over-scrupulousness he say ' i be always out of humor with he : that i could not have behave more reservedly to mr solme : and that it be contrary to all he hope and notion that he should not in so long a time find himself able to inspire the person whom he hope so soon to have the honor to call he with the least distinguishing tenderness for he before-hand ' silly and partial encroacher not to know to what to attribute the reserve i be force to treat he with but he pride have eat up he prudence it be indeed a dirty low pride that have swallow up the true pride which should have set he above the vanity that have overrun he yet he pretend that he have no pride but in oblige I : and be always talk of he reverence and humility and such sort of stuff : but of this i be sure that he have as i observe the first time i see he \* too much regard to he own person greatly to value that of he wife marry he whom he will : and i must be blind if i do not see that he be exceedingly vain of he external advantage and of that address which if it have any merit in it to a outward eye be perhaps owe more to he confidence that -lrb- sic -rrb- to any thing else \* see vol i letter iii have you not behold the man when i be you happy guest as he walk to he chariot look about he as if to observe what eye he specious person and air have attract but indeed we have some homely coxcomb as proud as if they have person to be proud of at the same time that it be apparent that the pain they take about themselves but the more expose they defect the man who be fond of be think more or better than he be as i have often observe but provoke a scrutiny into he pretension and that generally produce contempt for pride as i believe i have heretofore say be a infallible sign of weakness of something wrong in the head or in both he that exalt himself insult he neighbor who be

Monday night : nor see i before I any thing that can afford I a please hope for what with a mind so unequal as he can be my best hope i think i mention to you in my former that my clothes be bring I you flutter I so that i be not sure i do but i know i design to mention that they be they be bring I on Thursday but neither my few guinea with they nor any of my book except a drexelius on eternity the good old practice of piety and a franci spira my brother 's wit i suppose he think he do well to point out death and despair to I i wish for the one and every now-and-then be on the brink of the other you will the less wonder at my be so very solemn when add to the above and to my uncertain situation i tell you that they have send I with these book a letter form my cousin morden it have set my heart against mr lovelace against myself too i send it enclose if you please my dear you may read it here : col morden to miss clarissa harlowe florence April 13 i be extremely concern to hear of a difference betwixt the rest of a family so near and dear to I and you still dearer to than any of the rest my cousin jame have acquaint I with the offer you have have and with you refusal i wonder not at either such charming promise at so early a age as when i leave england and those promise as i have often hear so greatly exceed as well in you person as mind how much must you be admire how few must there be worthy of you you parent the most indulgent in the world to a child the most deserving have give way it seem to you refusal of several gentleman they have contented themselves at last to name one with earnestness to you because of the address of another whom they can not approve they have not reason it seem from you behavior to think you greatly averse : so they proceed : perhaps too hastily for a delicacy like you 's but when all be fix on they part and most extraordinary term conclude in you favor term which abundantly show the gentleman 's just value for you you fly off with a warmth and vehemence little suit to that sweetness which give grace to all you action i know very little of either of the gentleman : but of mr lovelace i know more than of mr solme i wish i could say more to he advantage than i can as to every qualification but one you brother own there be no comparison but that one outweigh all the rest together it can not be think that miss clarissa harlowe will dispense with moral in a husband what my dearest cousin shall i plead first to you on this occasion you duty you interest you temporal and you eternal welfare do and may all depend upon this single point the morality of a husband a woman who have a wicked husband may find it difficult to be good and out of she power to do good and be therefore in a worse situation than the man can be in who have a bad wife you preserve all you religious regard i understand i wonder not that you do i should have wonder have you not but what can you promise youself as to perseverance in they with a immoral husband if you parent and you differ in sentiment on this important occasion let I ask you my dear cousin who ought to give way i own to you that i should have think there could not any where have be a more suitable match for you than mr lovelace have he be a moral man i should have very little to say against a man of whose action i be not to set up myself as a judge do he not address my cousin but on this occasion let I tell you my dear clarissa that mr lovelace can not possibly deserve you he may reform you 'll say : but he may not habit be not soon or easily shake off libertine who be libertine in defiance of talent of superior light of conviction hardly ever reform but by miracle or by incapacity well do i know mine own sex well be i able to judge of the probability of the reformation of a licentious young man who have not be fasten upon by sickness by affliction by calamity : who have a prosperous run of fortune before he : he spirit high : he will uncontroulable : the company he keep perhaps such as himself confirm he in all he course assist he in all he enterprise as to the other gentleman suppose my dear cousin you do not like he at present it be far from be unlikely that you will hereafter : perhaps the more for not like he now he can hardly sink lower in you opinion : he may rise very seldom be it that high expectation be so much as tolerably answer how indeed can they when a fine and extensive imagination carry its expectation infinitely beyond reality in the highest of we sublunary enjoyment a woman adorn with such a imagination see no defect in a favored object -lrb- the less if she be not conscious of any wilful fault in herself -rrb- till it be too late to rectify the mistake occasion by she generous credulity but suppose a person of you talent be to marry a man of inferior talent who in this case can be so happy in herself as miss clarissa harlowe what delight do you take in do good how happily do you devote the several portion of the day to you own improvement and to the advantage of all that move within you sphere -- and then such be you taste such be you acquirement in the politer study and in the politer amusement such you excellence in all the different part of economy fit for a young lady 's inspection and practice that you friend would wish you to be take off as little as possible by regard that may be call merely personal but as to what may be the consequence respect yourself respect a young lady of you talent from the preference you be suspect to give to a libertine i would have you my dear cousin consider what that may be a mind so pure to mingle with a mind impure and will not such a man as this engross all you solitude will he not perpetually fill you with anxiety for he and for yourself -- the divine and civil power defy and they sanction break through by he on every not merely accidental but meditate occasion to be agreeable to he and to hope to preserve a interest in he affection you must probably be oblige to abandon all you own laudable pursuit you must enter into he pleasure and distaste you must give up you virtuous companion for he profligate one -- perhaps be forsake by you 's because of the scandal he daily give can you hope cousin with such a man as this to be long so good as you now be if not consider which of you present laudable delight you would choose to give up which of he culpable one to follow he in how could you brook to go backward instead of forward in those duty which you now so exemplarily perform and how do you know if you once give way where you shall be suffer where you shall be able to stop you brother acknowledge that mr solme be not near so agreeable in person as mr lovelace but what be person with such a lady as i have the honor to be now write to he own likewise that he have not the address of mr lovelace : but what a mere personal advantage be a plausible address without moral a woman have better take a husband whose manners she be to fashion than to find they ready-fashioned to she hand at the price of she morality a price that be often pay for travel accomplishment o my dear cousin be you but with we here at florence or at rome or at pari -lrb- where also i reside for many month -rrb- to see the gentleman whose suppose rough english manners at set out be to be polish and what they improvement be in they return through the same place you would infinitely prefer the man in he first stage to the same man in he last you find the difference on they return -- a fondness for foreign fashion a attachment to foreign vice a supercilious contempt of he own country and countryman -lrb- himself more despicable than the most despicable of those he despise -rrb- these with a unblushing effrontery be too generally the attainment that concur to finish the travel gentleman mr lovelace i know deserve to have a exception make in he favor for he really be a man of part and learning : he be esteem so both here and at rome and a fine person and a generous turn of mind give he great advantage but you need not be tell that a libertine man of sense do infinitely more mischief than a libertine of weak part be able to do and this i will tell you further that it be mr lovelace 's own fault that he be not still more respected than he be among the literati here there be in short some liberty in which he indulge himself that endanger he person and he liberty and make the best and most worthy of those who honor he with they notice give he up and he stay both at florence and at rome shorter than he design this be all i choose to say of mr lovelace i have much rather have have reason to give he a quite contrary character but as to rake or libertine in general i who know they well must be allow because of the mischief they have always in they heart and too often in they power to do you sex to add still a few more word upon this topic a libertine my dear cousin a plot a intriguing libertine must be generally remorseless -- unjust he must always be the noble rule of do to other what he would have do to himself be the first rule he break and every day he break it the oftener the greater he triumph he have great contempt for you sex he believe no woman chaste because he be a profligate every woman who favor he confirm he in he wicked incredulity he be always plot to extend the mischief he delight in if a woman love such a man how can she bear the thought of divide she interest in he affection with half the town and that perhaps the dregs of it then so sensual -- how will a young lady of you delicacy bear with so sensual a man a man who make a jest of he vow and who perhaps will break you spirit by the most unmanly insult to be a libertine be to continue to be every thing vile and inhuman prayer tear and the most abject submission be but fuel to he pride : wagering perhaps with lewd companion and not improbably with lewder woman upon instance which he boast of to they of you patient suffering and broken spirit and bring they home to witness to both i write what i know have be i mention not fortune squander estate mortgage or sell and posterity rob -- nor yet a multitude of other evil too gross too shocking to be mention to a person of you delicacy all these my dear cousin to be shun all the evil i have name to be avoid the power of do all the good you have be accustom to preserved nay increase by the separate provision that will be make for you : you charming diversion and exemplary employment all maintain and every good habit perpetuate : and all by one sacrifice the fading pleasure of the eye who would not -lrb- since every thing be not to be meet with in one man who would not -rrb- to preserve so many essential give up to light so unpermanent a pleasure weigh all these thing which i might insist upon to more advantage do i think it needful to one of you prudence -- weigh they well my beloved cousin and if it be not the will of you parent that you should continue single resolve to oblige they and let it not be say that the power of fancy shall -lrb- as in many other of you sex -rrb- be too hard for you duty and you prudence the less agreeable the man the more oblige the compliance remember that he be a sober man -- a man who have reputation to lose and whose reputation therefore be a security for he good behavior to you you have a opportunity offer you to give the highest instance that can be give of filial duty embrace it it be worthy of you it be expect from you however for you inclination-sake we may be sorry that you be call upon to give it let it be say that you have be able to lay a obligation upon you parent -lrb- a proud word my cousin -rrb- which you could not do be it not lay against you inclination -- upon parent who have lay a thousand upon you : who be set upon this point : who will not give it up : who have give up many point to you even of this very nature : and in they turn for the sake of they own authority as well as judgment expect to be oblige i hope i shall soon in person congratulate you upon this you meritorious compliance to settle and give up my trusteeship be one of the principal motive of my leave these part i shall be glad to settle it to every one 's satisfaction to yours particularly if on my arrival i find a happy union as formerly reign in a family so dear to I it will be a unspeakable pleasure to I and i shall perhaps so dispose my affair as to be near you for ever i have write a very long letter and will add no more than that i be with the greatest respect my dearest cousin you most affectionate and faithful servant wm morden \*\*\* i will suppose my dear miss howe that you have read my cousin 's letter it be now in vain to wish it have come sooner but if it have i might perhaps have be so rash as to give mr lovelace the fatal meeting as i little thought of go away with he but i should hardly have give he the expectation of so do previous to the meeting which make he come prepared and the revocation of which he so artfully make ineffectual persecute as i be and little expect so much condescension as my aunt to my great mortification have tell I -lrb- and you confirm -rrb- i should have meet with it be however hard to say what i should or should not have do as to meet he have it come in time : but this effect i verily believe it would have have -- to have make I insist with all my might on go over out of all they way to the kind writer of the instructive letter and on make a father -lrb- a protector as well as a friend -rrb- of a kinsman who be one of my trustee this circumstanced as i be would have be a natural at least a unexceptionable protection -- but i be to be unhappy and how it cut I to the heart to think that i can already subscribe to my cousin 's character of a libertine so well draw in the letter which i suppose you now to have read that a man of a character which ever be my abhorrence should fall to my lot -- but depend on my own strength have no reason to apprehend danger from headstrong and disgraceful impulse i too little perhaps cast up my eye to the supreme director : in whom mistrust myself i ought to have place my whole confidence -- and the more when i see myself so perserveringly address by a man of this character inexperience and presumption with the help of a brother and sister who have low end to answer in my disgrace have be my ruin -- a hard word my dear but i repeat it upon deliberation : since let the best happen which now can happen my reputation be destroy a rake be my portion : and what that portion be my cousin morden 's letter have acquaint you pray keep it by you till call for i see it not myself -lrb- have not the heart to inspect my trunk -rrb- till this morning i would not for the world this man should see it because it might occasion mischief between the most violent spirit and the most settle brave one in the world as my cousin 's be say to be this letter be enclose -lrb- open -rrb- in a blank cover scorn and detest I as they will i wonder that one line be not send with it -- be it but to have more particularly point the design of it in the same generous spirit that send I the spira the seal of the cover be with black wax i hope there be no new occasion in the family to give reason for black wax but if there be it would to be sure have be mention and lay at my door -- perhaps too justly i have begin a letter to my cousin but lay it by because of the uncertainty of my situation and expect every day for several day past to be at a greater certainty you bid I write to he some time ago you know then it be i begin it : for i have great pleasure in obey you in all i may so i ought to have for you be the only friend leave I and moreover you generally honor I with you own observance of the advice i take the liberty to offer you : for i pretend to say i give better advice than i have take and so i have need for i know not how it come about but i be in my own opinion a poor lose creature : and yet can not charge myself with one criminal or faulty inclination do you know my dear how this can be yet i can tell you how i believe -- one devious step at set out -- that must be it : -- which pursue have lead I so far out of my path that i be in a wilderness of doubt and error and never never shall find my way out of it : for although but one pace awry at first it have lead I hundred and hundred of mile out of my path : and the poor estray have not one kind friend nor have meet with one direct passenger to help she to recover it but i presumptuous creature must rely so much upon my own knowledge of the right path -- little apprehend that a ignus fatuus with its false fire -lrb- and ye i have hear enough of such -rrb- would arise to mislead I and now in the midst of fen and quagmire it play around I and around I throw I back again whenever i think myself in the right track but there be one common point in which all shall meet err widely as they may in that i shall be lay quietly down at last : and then will all my calamity be at a end but how i stray again stray from my intention i would only have say that i have begin a letter to my cousin morden some time ago : but that now i can never end it you will believe i can not : for how shall i tell he that all he compliment be misbestow that all he advice be throw away all he warning vain and that even my highest expectation be to be the wife of that free-liver whom he so pathetically warn I to shun let I own however have you prayer join with my own -lrb- my fate depend as it seem upon the lip of such a man -rrb- ` that whatever shall be my destiny that dreadful part of my father 's malediction that i may be punish by the man in whom he suppose i put my confidence may not take place that this for mr lovelace 's own sake and for the sake of human nature may not be or if it be necessary in support of the parental authority that i should be punish by he that it may not be by he premeditated or wilful baseness but that i may be able to acquit he intention if not he action ' otherwise my fault will appear to be double in the eye of the event-judging world and yet methink i would be glad that the unkindness of my father and uncle whose heart have already be too much wound by my error may be justify in every article excepting in this heavy curse : and that my father will be please to withdraw that before it be generally know : at least the most dreadful part of it which regard futurity i must lay down my pen i must brood over these reflection once more before i close my cousin 's letter i will peruse it and then i shall have it by heart letter xx miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe Sunday night may 7 when you reflect upon my unhappy situation which be attend with so many indelicate and even shocking circumstance some of which my pride will not let I think of with patience all aggravate by the contents of my cousin 's affect letter you will not wonder that the vapourishness which have lay hold of my heart should rise to my pen and yet it would be more kind more friendly in I to conceal from you who take such a generous interest in my concern that worst part of my grief which communication and complaint can not relieve but to whom can i unbosom myself but to you : when the man who ought to be my protector as he have bring upon I all my distress add to my apprehension when i have not even a servant on whose fidelity i can rely or to whom i can break my grief as they arise and when he bountiful temper and gay heart attach every one to he and i be but a cipher to give he significance and myself pain -- these grief therefore do what i can will sometimes burst into tear and these mingle with my ink will blot my paper and i know you will not grudge I the temporary relief but i shall go on in the strain i leave off with in my last when i intend rather to apologize for my melancholy but let what i have above write once for all be my apology my misfortune have give you a call to discharge the noblest office of the friendship we have vow to each other in advice and consolation and it would be a injury to it and to you to suppose it need even that call -lrb- she then tell miss howe that now she clothes be come mr lovelace be continually tease she to go abroad with he in a coach attend by whom she please of she own sex either for the air or to the public diversion she give the particulars of a conversation that have pass between they on that subject and he several proposal but take notice that he say not the least word of the solemnity which he so much press for before they come to town and which as she observe be necessary to give propriety to he proposal -rrb- now my dear she say i can not bear the life i live i would be glad at my heart to be out of he reach if i be he should soon find the difference if i must be humble it have better be by those to whom i owe duty than by he my aunt write in she letter \* that she dare not propose any thing in my favor you tell I that upon inquiry you find \* that have i not be unhappily seduce away a change of measure be actually resolve upon and that my mother particularly be determine to exert herself for the restoration of the family peace and in order to succeed the better have thought of try to engage my uncle harlowe in she party \* see vol iii letter lii \*\* ibid letter viii let I build on these foundation i can but try my dear it be my duty to try all probable method to restore the poor outcast to favor and who know but that once indulgent uncle who have very great weight in the family may be induce to interpose in my behalf i will give up all right and title to my grandfather 's devise and bequest with all my heart and soul to whom they please in order to make my proposal palatable to my brother and that my surrender may be effectual i will engage never to marry what think you my dear of this expedient surely they can not resolve to renounce I for ever if they look with impartial eye upon what have happen they will have something to blame themselves for as well as I i presume that you will be of opinion that this expedient be worth try but here be my difficulty : if i should write my hard-hearted brother have so strongly confederate they all against I that my letter would be hand about from one to another till he have harden every one to refuse my request whereas could my uncle be engage to espouse my cause as from himself i should have some hope as i presume to think he would soon have my mother and my aunt of he party what therefore i be thinking of be this -- ` suppose mr hickman whose good character have gain he every body 's respect should put himself in my uncle harlowe 's way and -lrb- as if from you knowledge of the state of thing between mr lovelace and I -rrb- assure he not only of the above particulars but that i be under no obligation that shall hinder I from take he direction ' i submit the whole to you consideration whether to pursue it at all or in what manner but if it be pursue and if my uncle refuse to interest himself in my favor upon mr hickman 's application as from you -lrb- for so for obvious reason it must be put -rrb- i can then have no hope and my next step in the mind i be in shall be to throw myself into the protection of the lady of he family it be a impiety to adopt the follow line because it would be throw upon the decree of providence a fault too much my own but often do i revolve they for the sake of the general similitude which they bear to my unhappy yet undersigned error to you great god i make my last appeal : or clear my virtue or my crime reveal if wand ` ring in the maze of life i run and backward tread the step i seek to shun impute my error to you own decree : my foot be guilty : but my heart be free -lrb- the lady date again on Monday to let miss howe know that mr lovelace on observe she uneasiness have introduce to she mr mennell mr fretchville 's kinsman who manage all she affair she call he a young officer of sense and politeness who give she a account of the house and furniture to the same effect that mr lovelace have do before \* as also of the melancholy way mr fretchville be in \* see letter iv of this volume she tell miss howe how extremely urgent mr lovelace be with the gentleman to get he spouse -lrb- as he now always call she before company -rrb- a sight of the house : and that mr mennell undertake that very afternoon to show she all of it except the apartment mr fretchville should be in when she go but that she choose not to take another step till she know how she approve of she scheme to have she uncle sound and with what success if try it would be attend mr lovelace in he humourous way give he friend a account of the lady 's peevishness and dejection on receive a letter with she clothes he regret that he have lose she confidence which he attribute to he bring she into the company of he four companion yet he think he must excuse they and censure she for over-niceness for that he never see man behave better at least not they mention he introduce mr mennell to she -rrb- now jack say he be it not very kind of mr mennell -lrb- captain mennell i sometimes call he for among the military there be no such officer thou knowest as a lieutenant or a ensign -- be it not very kind in he -rrb- to come along with I so readily as he do to satisfy my beloved about the vapourish lady and the house but who be capt mennell methink thou askest : i never hear of such a man as captain mennell very likely but knowest thou not young newcomb honest doleman 's newphew o-ho be it he it be and i have change he name by virtue of my own single authority knowest thou not that i be a great name-father preferment i bestow both military and civil i give estate and take they away at my pleasure quality too i create and by a still more valuable prerogative i degrade by virtue of my own imperial will without any other act of forfeiture than my own convenience what a poor thing be a monarch to I but mennell now he have see this angel of a woman have qualm that be the devil -- i shall have enough to do to keep he right but it be the less wonder that he should stagger when a few hour ' conversation with the same lady could make four much more hardened varlet find heart -- only that i be confident that i shall at least reward she virtue if she virtue overcome I or i should find it impossible to persevere -- for at time i have confound qualm myself but say not a word of they to the confraternity : nor laugh at I for they thyself in another letter date Monday night he write as follow : this perverse lady keep I at such a distance that i be sure something be go on between she and miss howe notwithstanding the prohibition from mr howe to both : and as i have think it some degree of merit in myself to punish other for they transgression i be of opinion that both these girl be punishable for they breach of parental injunction and as to they letter-carrier i have be inquire into he way of living and find he to be a common poacher a deer-stealer and warren-robber who under pretence of haggle deal with a set of customer who constantly take all he bring whether fish fowl or venison i hold myself justified -lrb- since wilson 's conveyance must at present be sacred -rrb- to have he strip and rob and what money he have about he give to the poor since if i take not money as well as letter i shall be suspect to serve one 's self and punish a villain at the same time be serve public and private the law be not make for such a man as I and i must come at correspondence so disobediently carry on but on second thought if i could find out that the dear creature carry any of she letter in she pocket i can get she to a play or to a concert and she may have the misfortune to lose she pocket but how shall i find this out since she dorca know no more of she dress and undress than she lovelace for she be dress for the day before she appear even to she servant vilely suspicious upon my soul jack a suspicious temper be a punishable temper if a woman suspect a rogue in a honest man be it not enough to make the honest man who know it a rogue but as to she pocket i think my mind hanker after they as the less mischievous attempt but they can not hold all the letter i should wish to see and yet a woman 's pocket be half as deep as she be high tie round the sweet levity i presume as ballast-bag lest the wind as they move with full sail from whale-ribbed canvass should blow away the gypsy -lrb- he then in apprehension that something be meditate between the two lady or that something may be set on foot to get miss harlowe out of he hand relate several of he contrivance and boast of he instruction give in write to dorca and to he servant will summer and say that he have provide against every possible accident even to bring she back if she should escape or in case she should go abroad and then refuse to return and hope so to manage as that should he make a attempt whether he succeed in it or not he may have a pretence to detain she -rrb- he then proceed as follow : i have order dorca to cultivate by all mean she lady 's favor to lament she incapacity as to write and read to shew letter to she lady as from pretended country relation to beg she advice how to answer they and to get they answer and to be always aim at scrawl with a pen lest inky finger should give suspicion i have moreover give the wench a ivory-leafed pocket-book with a silver pencil that she may make memorandum on occasion and let I tell thee that the lady have already -lrb- at mr sinclair 's motion -rrb- remove she clothes out of the trunk they come in into a ample mahogany repository where they will lie at full length and which have drawer in it for linen a repository that use to hold the richest suit which some of the nymph put on when they be to be dress out to captivate or to ape quality for many a countess thou knowest have we mother equipped nay two or three duchess who live upon quality - term with they lord but this to such as will come up to she price and can make a appearance like quality themselves on the occasion : for the reputation of person of birth must not lie at the mercy of every under-degreed sinner a master-key which will open every lock in this chest be put into dorca 's hand and she be to take care when she search for papers before she remove any thing to observe how it lie that she may replace all to a hair sally and polly can occasionally help to transcribe slow and sure with such a argus-eyed charmer must be all my movement it be impossible that one so young and so inexperienced as she be can have all she caution from herself the behavior of the woman so unexceptionable no revelling no company ever admit into this inner - house all genteel quiet and easy in it the nymph well-bred and well-read she first disgust to the old one get over -- it must be miss howe therefore -lrb- who once be in danger of be take in by one of we class by honest sir george colmar as thou hast hear -rrb- that make my progress difficult thou seest belford by the above precautionary that i forget nothing as the song say it be not to be imagine on what slight string depend these thing on which man build they glory so far so good i shall never rest till i have discover in the first place where the dear creature put she letter and in the next till i have get she to a play to a concert or to take a airing with I out of town for a day or two \*\*\* i give thee just now some of my contrivance dorca who be ever attentive to all she lady 's motion have give I some instance of she mistress 's precaution she wafer she letter it seem in two place prick the wafer and then seal upon they no doubt but the same care be take with regard to those bring to she for she always examine the seal of the latter before she open they i must i must come at they this difficulty augment my curiosity strange so much as she write and at all hour that not one sleepy or forgetful moment have offer in we favor a fair contention thou seest : nor plead thou in she favor she youth she beauty she family she fortune credulity she have none and with regard to she tender year be i not a young fellow myself as to beauty pr ` ythee jack do thou to spare my modesty make a comparison between my clarissa for a woman and thy lovelace for a man for she family that be not know to its country a century ago : and i hate they all but she have i not cause -- for she fortune fortune thou knowest be ever a stimulus with I and this for reason not ignoble do not girl of fortune adorn themselves on purpose to engage we attention seek they not to draw we into they snare depend they not generally upon they fortune in the view they have upon we more than on they merit shall we deprive they of the benefit of they principal dependence -- can i in particular marry every girl who wish to obtain my notice if therefore in support of the libertine principle for which none of the sweet rogue hate we a woman of fortune be bring to yield homage to she emperor and any consequence attend the subjugation be not such a one shield by she fortune as well from insult and contempt as from indigence -- all then that admit of debate between my beloved and I be only this -- which of the two have more wit more circumspection -- and that remain to be try a sad life however this life of doubt and suspense for the poor lady to live as well as for I that be to say if she be not naturally jealous -- if she be she uneasiness be constitutional and she can not help it nor will it in that case hurt she for a suspicious temper will make occasion for doubt if none be to offer to its hand my fair one therefore if naturally suspicious be oblige to I for save she the trouble of study for these occasion -- but after all the plainest path in we journey through life be the safest and best i believe although it be not give I to choose they i be not however singular in the pursuit of the more intricate path since there be thousand and ten thousand who have rather fish in troubled water than in smooth letter xxi mr lovelace to john belford esq Tuesday may 9 i be a very unhappy man this lady be say to be one of the sweetest - temper creature in the world : and so i think she but to I she be one of the most perverse i never be suppose to be a ill-natured mortal neither how can it be i imagine for a long while that we be bear to make each other happy : but quite the contrary we really seem to be send to plague each other i will write a comedy i think : i have a title already and that be half the work the quarrelsome lover ` twill do there be something new and striking in it yet more or less all lover quarrel old terence have take notice of that and observe upon it that lover fall out occasion lover fall in and a better understanding of course ` tis natural that it should be so but with we we fall out so often without fall in once and a second quarrel so generally happen before a first be make up that it be hard to guess what event we love will be attend with but perseverance be my glory and patience my handmaid when i have in view a object worthy of my attempt what be there in a easy conquest hudibra question well ------ what mad lover ever dy would to gain a soft and easy bride or for a lady tender-hearted in purl stream or hemp depart but i will lead to the occasion of this preamble i have be out on my return meeting dorca on the stair

she have be read with a little parcel of other she be now busy with -- all pull out of she pocket as i believe : so sir you 'll know where to find they another time i be ready to leap for joy and instantly resolve to bring forward a expedient which i have hold in petto and enter the dining-room with a air of transport i boldly clasped my arm about she as she sit she huddle up she papers in she handkerchief all the time the drop paper unseen o my dearest life a lucky expedient have mr mennell and i hit upon just now in order to hasten mr fretchville to quit the house i have agree if you approve of it to entertain she cook she housemaid and two men-servant -lrb- about whom she be very solicitous -rrb- till you be provide to you mind and that no accommodation may be wanted i have

care to set my foot upon the letter and scrape it farther from she as it be behind she chair she be in a passion at the liberty i take bow low i begged she pardon and stoop still lower in the same motion take up the letter and whipt it into my bosom pox on I for a puppy a fool a blockhead a clumsy varlet a mere jack belford -- i think myself a much cleverer fellow than i be -- why could i not have be follow in by dorca who might have take it up while i address she lady for here the letter be unfold i could not put it in my bosom without alarming she ear as my sudden motion do she eye -- up she fly in a moment : traitor juda she eye flash lightning and a perturbation in she eager countenance so charming -- what have you take up -- and then what for both my ear i durst not have do to she she make no scruple to seize the steal letter though in my bosom what be to be do on so palpable a detection -- i clasped she hand which have hold of the ravish paper between mine : o my beloved creature say i can you think i have not some curiosity be it possible you can be thus for ever employ and i loving narrative letter-writing above every other species of write and admire you talent that way should not -lrb- thus upon the dawn of my happiness as i presume to hope -rrb- burn with a desire to be admit into so sweet a correspondence let go my hand -- stamp with she pretty foot how dare you sir -- at this rate i see -- too plainly i see -- and more she could not say : but gasp be ready to faint with passion and affright the devil a bit of she accustomed gentleness to be see in she charming face or to be hear in she musical voice have go thus far loth very loth be i to lose my prize -- once more i get hold of the rumpled-up letter -- impudent man be she word : stamp again for god 's sake then it be i let go my prize lest she should faint away : but have the pleasure first to find my hand within both hers she try to open my reluctant finger how near be my heart at that moment to my hand throb to my finger ' end to be thus familiarly although angrily treat by the charmer of my soul when she have get it in she possession she fly to the door i throw myself in she way shut it and in the humblest manner beseech she to forgive I and yet do you think the harlowe-hearted charmer -lrb- notwithstanding the agreeable annunciation i come in with -rrb- would forgive I -- no truly but push I rudely from the door as if i have be nothing -lrb- yet do i love to try so innocently to try she strength too -rrb- she gain that force through passion which i have lose through fear out she shoot to she own apartment -lrb- thank my star she could fly no farther -rrb- and as soon as she enter it in a passion still she double-locked and double-bolted herself in this my comfort on reflection that upon a greater offence it can not be worse i retreat to my own apartment with my heart full : and my man will not be near I give myself a plaguy knock on the forehead with my double fist and now be my charmer shut up from I : refuse to see I refuse she meal she resolve not to see I that be more : -- never again if she can help it and in the mind she be in -- i hope she have say the dear creature whenever they quarrel with they humble servant should always remember this saving clause that they may not be forswear but thinkest thou that i will not make it the subject of one of my first plot to inform myself of the reason why all this commotion be necessary on so slight a occasion as this would have be be not the letter that pass between these lady of a treasonable nature Wednesday morning no admission to breakfast any more than to supper i wish this lady be not a simpleton after all i have send up in captain mennell 's name a message from captain mennell madam it will not do she be of baby age she can not be -- a solomon i be go to say in every thing solomon jack be the wisest man but didst ever hear who be the wisest woman i want a comparison for this lady cunning woman and witch we read of without number but i fancy wisdom never enter into the character of a woman it be not a requisite of the sex woman indeed make better sovereign than man : but why be that -- because the women-sovereign be govern by man the man - sovereign by woman -- charming by my soul for hence we guess at the rudder by which both be steer but to put wisdom out of the question and to take cunning in that be to say to consider woman as a woman what shall we do if this lady have something extraordinary in she head repeat charge have she give to wilson by a particular messenger to send any letter direct for she the moment it come i must keep a good look-out she be not now afraid of she brother 's plot i sha not be at all surprised if singleton call upon miss howe as the only person who know or be likely to know where miss harlowe be pretend to have affair of importance and of particular service to she if he can but be admit to she speech -- of compromise who know from she brother then will miss howe warn she to keep close then will my protection be again necessary this will do i believe any thing from miss howe must joseph leman be a vile fellow with she and my implement joseph honest joseph as i call he may hang himself i have play he off enough and have very little further use for he no need to wear one plot to the stump when i can find new one every hour nor blame I for the use i make of my talent who that have such will let 'em be idle well then i will find a singleton that be all i have to do instantly find one -- will sir -- this moment call I hither thy cousin paul wheatly just come from sea whom thou wert recommend to my service if i be to marry and keep a pleasure-boat presto -- will 's go -- paul will be here presently presently to mr howe 's if paul be singleton 's mate come from he captain it will do as well as if it be singleton himself sally a little devil often reproach I with the slowness of my proceedings but in a play do not the principal entertainment lie in the first four act be not all in a manner over when you come to the fifth and what a vulture of a man must he be who souse upon he prey and in the same moment truss and devour but to own the truth i have overplot myself to my make my work secure as i think i have fright the dear creature with the sight of my four hottentot and i shall be a long time i doubt before i can recover my lose ground and then this curse family at harlowe-place have make she out of humor with I with herself and with all the world but miss howe who no doubt be continually add difficulty to my other difficulty i be very unwilling to have recourse to measure which these demon below be continually urge I to take because i be sure that at last i shall be bring to make she legally mine one complete trial over and i think i will do she noble justice \*\*\* well paul 's go -- go already -- have all he lesson a notable fellow -- lord w 's necessary-man be paul before he go to sea a more sensible rogue paul than joseph not such a pretender to piety neither as the other at what a price have i buy that joseph i believe i must punish the rascal at last : but must let he marry first : then -lrb- though that may be punishment enough -rrb- i shall punish two at once in the man and he wife and how richly do betty deserve punishment for she behavior to my goddess but now i hear the rusty hinge of my beloved 's door give I creak invitation my heart creak and throb with respondent trepidation : whimsical enough though for what relation have a lover 's heart to a rusty pair of hinge but they be the hinge that open and shut the door of my beloved 's bed-chamber relation enough in that i hear not the door shut again i shall receive she command i hope anon what signify she keep I thus at a distance she must be mine let I do or offer what i will courage whenever i assume all be over : for should she think of escape from hence whither can she fly to avoid I she parent will not receive she she uncle will not entertain she she beloved norton be in they direction and can not miss howe dare not she have not one friend in town but I -- be entirely a stranger to the town and what then be the matter with I that i should be thus unaccountably over-awed and tyrannize over by a dear creature who want only to know how impossible it be that she should escape I in order to be as humble to I as she be to she persecute relation should i ever make the grand attempt and fail and should she hate I for it she hatred can be but temporary she have already incur the censure of the world she must therefore choose to be mine for the sake of soldering up she reputation in the eye of that impudent world for who that know I and know that she have be in my power though but for twenty-four hour will think she spotless as to fact let she inclination be what it will and then human nature be such a well-known rogue that every man and woman judge by what each know of he or herself that inclination be no more to be trust where a opportunity be give than i be especially where a woman young and bloom love a man well enough to go off with he for such will be the world 's construction in the present case she call she maid dorca no doubt that i may hear she harmonious voice and to give I a opportunity to pour out my soul at she foot to renew all my vow and to receive she pardon for the past offence : and then with what pleasure shall i begin upon a new score and afterwards wipe out that and begin another and another till the last offence pass and there can be no other and once after that to be forgive will be to be forgive for ever \*\*\* the door be again shut dorca tell I that she lady deny to admit I to dine with she a favor i have order the wench to beseech she to grant I the next time she see she -- not uncivilly however deny -- coming-to by degree nothing but the last offence the honest wench tell I in the language of she principal below will do with she the last offence be meditate yet this vile recreant heart of mine play I booty but here i conclude though the tyranness leave I nothing to do but to read write and fret subscription be formal between we besides i be so much she be that i can not say how much i be thine or any other person 's letter xxii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe Tuesday may 9 if my dear you approve of the application to my uncle harlowe i wish it to be make as soon as possible we be quite out again i have shut myself up from he the offence indeed not so very great -- and yet it be too he have like to have get a letter one of you 's but never will i write again or re-peruse my papers in a apartment where he think himself entitle to come he do not read a line of it indeed he do not so do not be uneasy and depend upon future caution thus it be the sun be upon my closet and mr lovelace abroad -- she then give miss howe a account of he come by surprise upon she : of he flutter speech : of he bold address : of she struggle with he for the letter & c and now my dear proceed she i be more and more convinced that i be too much in he power to make it prudent to stay with he and if my friend will but give I hope i will resolve to abandon he for ever o my dear he be a fierce a foolish a insolent creature -- and in truth i hardly expect that we can accommodate how much unhappier be i already with he than my mother ever be with my father after marriage since -lrb- and that without any reason any pretence in the world for it -rrb- he be for break my spirit before i be he and while i be or ought to be -lrb- o my folly that i be not -rrb- in my own power till i can know whether my friend will give I hope or not i must do what i never study to do before in any case that be try to keep this difference open : and yet it will make I look little in my own eye because i shall mean by it more than i can own but this be one of the consequence of all engagement where the mind be unpaired -- dispaired in my case i must say let this evermore be my caution to individual of my sex -- guard you eye : ` twill ever be in a combination against you judgment if there be two part to be take it will be for ever traitor as it be take the wrong one if you ask I my dear how this caution befit I let I tell you a secret which i have but very lately find out upon self-examination although you seem to have make the discovery long ago : that have not my foolish eye be too much attach i have not take the pain to attempt so officiously as i do the prevention of mischief between he and some of my family which first induce the correspondence between we and be the occasion of bring the apprehend mischief with double weight upon himself my vanity and conceit as far as i know might have part in the inconsiderate measure : for do it not look as if i think myself more capable of obviate difficulty than anybody else of my family but you must not my dear suppose my heart to be still a confederate with my eye that deluded eye now clearly see its fault and the mislead heart despise it for it hence the application i be make to my uncle : hence it be that i can say -lrb- i think truly -rrb- that i would atone for my fault at any rate even by the sacrifice of a limb or two if that would do adieu my dearest friend -- may you heart never know the hundredth part of the pain mine at present feel pray you clarissa harlowe letter xxiii miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe Wednesday may 10 i will write no man shall write for I \* no woman shall hinder I from write surely i be of age

with one who know a vast deal of he private history the man be really a villain my dear a execrable one if all be true that i have hear and yet i be promise other particulars i do assure you my dear friend that have he a dozen live he might have forfeit they all and be dead twenty crime ago if ever you condescend to talk familiarly with he again ask he after miss betterton and what become of she and if he shuffle and prevaricate as to she question he about miss lockyer -- o my dear the man 's a villain i will have you uncle sound as you desire and that out of hand but yet i be afraid of the success and this for several reason ` tis hard to say what the sacrifice of you estate would do with some people : and yet i must not when it come to the test permit you to make it as you hannah continue ill i would advise you to try to attach dorca to you interest have you not be impoliticly shy of she i wish you could come at some of he letter surely a man of he negligent character can not be always guard if he be and if you can not engage you servant i shall suspect they both let he be call upon at a short warning when he be write or when he have papers lie about and so surprise he into negligence such inquiry i know be of the same nature with those we make at a inn in travel when we look into every corner and closet for fear of a villain yet should be fright out of we wit be we

wonder not at the melancholy reflection you so often cast upon yourself in you letter for the step you have be force upon on one hand and trick into on the other a strange fatality as if it be design to show the vanity of all human prudence i wish my dear as you hint that both you and i have not too much pride ourselves in a perhaps too conscious superiority over other but i will stop -- how apt be weak mind to look out for judgment in any extraordinary event ` tis so far right that it be better and safer and juster to arraign ourselves or we dearest friend than providence which must always have wise end to answer its dispensation but do not talk as if one of you former of be a warn only \* -- you will be as excellent a example as ever you hope to be as well as a warning : and that will make you story to all that shall come to know it of double efficacy : for be it that such a merit as yours could not ensure to herself noble and generous usage from a libertine heart who will expect any tolerable behavior from man of he character \* see vol iii letter xxviii if you think yourself inexcusable for take a step that put you into the way of delusion without any intention to go off with he what must those giddy creature think of themselves who without half you provocation and inducement and without any regard to decorum leap wall drop from window and steal away from they parent ' house to the seducer 's bed in the same day again if you be so ready to accuse yourself for dispense with the prohibition of the most unreasonable parent which yet be but half - prohibition at first what ought those to do who wilfully shut they ear to the advice of the most reasonable and that perhaps where apparent ruin or undoubted inconvenience be the consequence of the predetermined rashness and lastly to all who will know you story you will be a excellent example of watchfulness and of that caution and reserve by which a prudent person who have be suppose to be a little mislead endeavor to mend she error and never once lose sight of she duty do all in she power to recover the path she have be rather drive out of than choose to swerve from come come my dearest friend consider but these thing and steadily without despond pursue you earnest purpose to amend what you think have be amiss and it may not be a misfortune in the end that you have err especially as so little of you will be in you error and indeed i must say that i use the word mislead and error and such - like only in compliment to you own too-ready self-accusation and to the opinion of one to whom i owe duty : for i think in my conscience that every part of you conduct be defensible : and that those only be blamable who have no other way to clear themselves but by condemn you i expect however that such melancholy reflection as drop from you pen but too often will mingle with all you future pleasure be you to marry lovelace and be he to make the best of husband you be immensely happy above the

it refuse to enter into any obligation that shall be in the least a hinderance -lrb- sic -rrb- to it : that she would fain avoid give mr lovelace a right to make she family uneasy in relation to she grandfather 's estate : that all she wish for still be to be indulge in she choice of a single life and on that condition would make she father 's pleasure she 's with regard to that estate : that mr lovelace be continually press she to marry he and all he friend likewise : but that i be sure she have so little liking to the man because of he faulty moral and of the antipathy of she relation to he that if she have any hope give she of a reconciliation she would forego all thought of he and put herself into she father 's protection but that they resolution must be speedy for otherwise she would find herself oblige to give way to he press entreaty and it might then be out of she power to prevent disagreeable litigation i do assure you mr norton upon my honor that we dearest friend know nothing of this procedure of mine : and therefore it be proper to acquaint you in confidence with my grounds for it -- these be they : she have desire I to let mr hickman drop hint to the above effect to she uncle harlowe but indirectly as from himself lest if the application should not be attend with success and mr lovelace -lrb- who already take it ill that he have so little of she favor -rrb- come to know it she may be deprive of every protection and be perhaps subject to great inconveniency from so haughty a spirit have this authority from she and be very solicitous about the success of the application i think that if the weight of so good a wife mother and sister as mr harlowe be know to be be throw into the same scale with that of mr john harlowe -lrb- suppose he could be engage -rrb- it could hardly fail of make a due impression mr hickman will see mr john harlowe to-morrow : by that time you may see mr harlowe if mr hickman find the old gentleman favourable he will tell he that you will have see mr harlowe upon the same account and will advise he to join in consultation with she how best to proceed to melt the most obdurate heart in the world this be the fair state of the matter and my true motive for write to you i leave all therefore to you discretion and most heartily wish success to it be of opinion that mr lovelace can not possibly deserve we admirable friend : nor indeed know i the man who do pray acquaint I by a line of the result of you interposition if it prove not such as may be reasonably hope for we dear friend shall know nothing of this step from I and pray let she not from you for in that case it would only give deeper grief to a heart already too much afflict i be dear and worthy mr norton you true friend anna howe letter xxvi mrs norton to

may 13 i return a answer in write as i promise to you communication but take no notice either to my bellum 's betty -lrb- who i understand sometimes visit you -rrb- or to the poor wretch herself nor to any body that i do write i charge you do not my heart be full : write may give some vent to my grief and perhaps i may write what lie most upon my heart without confine myself strictly to the present subject you know how dear this ungrateful creature ever be to we all you know how sincerely we join with every one of those who ever have see she or converse with she to praise and admire she and exceed in we praise even the bound of that modesty which because she be we own should have restrain we be of opinion that to have be silent in the praise of so apparent a merit must rather have argue blindness or affectation in we than that we should incur the censure of vain partiality to we own when therefore any body congratulate we on such a daughter we receive they congratulation without any diminution if it be say you be happy in this child we own that no parent ever be happier in a child if more particularly they praise she dutiful behavior to we we say she know not how to offend if it be say miss clarissa harlowe have a wit and penetration beyond she year we instead of disallow it would add -- and a judgment no less extraordinary than she wit if she prudence be praise and a forethought which every one saw supply what only year and experience give to other -- nobody need to scruple take lesson from clarissa harlowe be we proud answer forgive I o forgive I my dear norton -- but i know you will for yours when good be this child and you glory as well as mine but have you not hear stranger as she pass to and from church stop to praise the angel of a creature as they call she when it be enough for those who know who she be to cry why it be miss clarissa harlowe -- as if every body be oblige to know or to have hear of clarissa harlowe and of she excellency while accustomed to praise it be too familiar to she to cause she to alter either she look or she pace for my own part i could not stifle a pleasure that have perhaps a faulty vanity for its foundation whenever i be speak of or address to as the mother of so sweet a child : mr harlowe and i all the time loving each other the better for the share each have in such a daughter still still indulge the fond the overflow heart of a mother i could dwell for ever upon the remembrance of what she be would but that remembrance banish from my mind what she be in she bosom young as she be could i repose all my grief -- sure of receive from she prudence and advice as well as comfort and both insinuate in so dutiful a manner that it be impossible to take those exception which the distance of year and character between a mother and a daughter would have make one apprehensive of from any other daughter she be we glory when abroad we delight when at home every body be even covetous of she company and we grudge she to we brother harlowe and to we sister and brother hervey no other contention among we then but who should be next favor by she no chide ever know she from we but the chiding of lover when she be for shut herself up too long together from we in pursuit of those charming amusement and useful employment for which however the whole family be the better we other child have reason -lrb- good child as they always be -rrb- to think themselves neglect but they likewise be so sensible of they sister 's superiority and of the honor she reflect upon the whole family that they confess themselves eclipse without envy the eclipser indeed there be not any body so equal with she in they own opinion as to envy what all aspire but to emulate the dear creature you know my norton give a eminence to we all then she acquirement she skill in music she fine needle-works she elegance in dress for which she be so much admire that the neighbouring lady use to say that they need not fetch fashion from london since whatever miss clarissa harlowe wear be the best fashion because she choice of natural beauty set those of art far behind they she genteel ease and fine turn of person she deep reading and these join to she open manners and she cheerful modesty -- o my good norton what a sweet child be once my clary harlowe this and more you know she to be : for many of she excellency be owe to yourself and with the milk you give she you give she what no other nurse in the world could give she and do you think my worthy woman do you think that the wilful lapse of such a child be to be forgive can she herself think that she deserve not the severest punishment for the abuse of such talent as be intrust to she she fault be a fault of premeditation of cunning of contrivance she have deceive every body 's expectation she whole sex as well as the family she spring from be disgrace by it would any body ever have believe that such a young creature as this who have by she advice save even she over-lively friend from marry a fop and a libertine would herself have go off with one of the vilest and most notorious of libertine a man whose character she know and know it to be worse than the character of he from whom she save she friend a man against whom she be warn : one who have she brother 's life in she hand and who constantly set we whole family at defiance think for I my good norton think what my unhappiness must be both as a wife and a mother what restless day what sleepless night yet my own rankle anguish endeavor to be smooth over to soften the anguish of fiercer spirit and to keep they from blaze out to further mischief o this naughty naughty girl who know so well what she do and who could look so far into consequence that we think she would have die rather than have do as she have do she known character for prudence leave she absolutely without excuse how then can i offer to plead for she if through motherly indulgence i would forgive she myself -- and have we not moreover suffer all the disgrace that can befall we have not she if now she have so little liking to he moral have she not reason before to have as little or have she suffer by they in she own person -- o my good woman i doubt -- i doubt -- will not the character of the man make one doubt a angel if once in he power the world will think the worst i be tell it do so likewise she father fear she brother hear and what can i do we antipathy to he she know before as well as he character these therefore can not be new motive without a new reason -- o my dear mr norton how shall i how can you support ourselves under the apprehension to which these thought lead he continually press she you say to marry he : he friend likewise she have reason no doubt she have reason for this application to we : and she crime be gloss over to bring she to we with new disgrace whither whither do one guilty step lead the misguided heart -- and now truly to save a stubborn spirit we be only to be sound that the application may be occasionally retract or deny upon the whole : be i incline to plead for she it be now the most improper of all time now that my brother harlowe have discourage -lrb- as he last night come hither on purpose to tell we -rrb- mr hickman 's insinuated application and be applaud for it now that my brother antony be intend to carry he great fortune through she fault into another family : -- she expect no doubt herself to be put into she grandfather 's estate in consequence of a reconciliation and as a reward for she fault : and insist still upon the same term which she offer before and which be reject -- not through my fault i be sure reject from all these thing you will return such a answer as the case require it might cost I the peace of my whole life at this time to move for she god forgive she if i do nobody else will and let it for you own sake as well as mine be a secret that you and i have enter upon this subject and i desire you not to touch upon it again but by particular permission : for o my dear good woman it set my heart a bleeding in as many stream as there be vein in it yet think I not impenetrable by a proper contrition and remorse -- but what a torment be it to have a will without a power adieu adieu god give we both comfort and to the once dear -- the ever - dear creature -lrb- for can a mother forget she child -rrb- repentance deep repentance and as little suffering as may befit he bless will and she grievous fault pray you real friend charlotte harlowe letter xxix miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe Sunday may 14 how it be now my dear between you and mr lovelace i can not tell but wicked as the man be i be afraid he must be you lord and master i call he by several very hard name in my last i have but just hear of some of he vileness when i sit down to write so my indignation be raise but on inquiry and recollection i find that the fact lay to he charge be all of they commit some time ago -- not since he have have strong hope of you favor this be say something for he he generous behavior to the innkeeper 's daughter be a more recent instance to he credit to say nothing of the universal good character he have as a kind landlord and then i approve much of the motion he make to put you in possession of mr fretchville 's house while he continue at the other widow 's till you agree that one house shall hold you i wish this be do be sure you embrace this offer -lrb- if you do not soon meet at the altar -rrb- and get one of he cousin with you be you once marry i should think you can not be very unhappy though you may not be so happy with he as you deserve to be the stake he have in he country and he reversion the care he take of he affair he freedom from obligation nay he pride with you merit must be a tolerable security for you i should think though particulars of he wickedness as they come to my knowledge hurt and incense I yet after all when i give myself time to reflect all that i have hear of he to he disadvantage be comprehend in the general character give of he long ago by lord m 's and he own dismiss bailiff \* and which be confirm to I by mr fortescue as i heretofore tell you \*\* and to you by mr greme \*\*\* \* see vol i letter iv \*\* ibid letter xii \*\*\* see vol iii letter vi you can have nothing therefore i think to be deeply concerned about but he future good and the bad example he may hereafter set to he own family these indeed be very just concern : but be you to leave he now either with or without he consent he fortune and alliance so considerable he person and address so engaging -lrb- every one excuse you now on those account and because of you relation ' folly -rrb- it would have a very ill appearance for you reputation i can not therefore on the most deliberate consideration advise you to think of that while you have no reason to doubt he honor may eternal vengeance pursue the villain if he give room for a apprehension of this nature yet he teasing way be intolerable he acquiescence with you slight delay and he resignedness to the distance you now keep he at -lrb- for a fault so much slighter as he must think than the punishment -rrb- be unaccountable : he doubt you love of he that be very probable but you have reason to be surprise at he want of ardor a blessing so great within he reach as i may say by the time you have read to this place you will have no doubt of what have be the issue of the conference between the two gentleman i be equally shock and enrage against they all against they all i say for i have try you good norton 's weight with you mother -lrb- though at first i do not intend to tell you so -rrb- to the same purpose as the gentleman sound you uncle never be there such determine brute in the world why should i mince the matter yet would i fain methink make a exception for you mother you uncle will have it that you be ruin ` he can believe every thing bad of a creature he say who could run away with a man with such a one especially as lovelace they expect application from you when some heavy distress have fall upon you but they be all resolve not to stir a inch in you favor no not to save you life ' my dearest soul resolve to assert you right claim you own and go and live upon it as you ought then if you marry not how will the wretch creep to you for you reversionary disposition you be accuse -lrb- as in you aunt 's letter -rrb- ` of premeditation and contrivance in you escape ' instead of pity you the mediate person be call upon ` to pity they who once you uncle say doat upon you : who take no joy but in you presence : who devour you word as you speak they : who tread over again you footstep as you walk before they ' -- and i know not what of this sort upon the whole it be now evident to I and so it must be to you when you read this letter that you must be he and the sooner you be so the better shall we suppose that marriage be not in you power -- i can not have patience to suppose that i be concerned methink to know how you will do to condescend -lrb- now you see you must be he -rrb- after you have keep he at such a distance and for the revenge he pride may put he upon take for it but let I tell you that if my go up and share fortune with you will prevent such a noble creature from stoop too low much more be it likely to prevent you ruin i would not hesitate a moment about it what be the whole world to I weigh against such a friend as you be think you that any of the enjoyment of this life could be enjoyment to I be you involve in calamity from which i could either alleviate or relieve you by give up those enjoyment and what in say this and act up to it do i offer you but the frit of a friendship you worth have create excuse my warmth of expression the warmth of my heart want none i be enraged at you relation for bad as what i have mention be i have not tell you all nor now perhaps ever will i be angry at my own mother 's narrowness of mind and at she indiscriminate adherence to old notion and i be exasperate against you foolish you low-vanity would lovelace but let we stoop to take the wretch as he be and make the best of he since you be destine to stoop to keep groveller and worldling in countenance he have not be guilty of a direct indecency to you nor dare he -- not so much of a devil as that come to neither have he such villainous intention so much in he power as you be they would have shewn themselves before now to such a penetrate and vigilant eye and to such a pure heart as yours let we save the wretch then if we can though we soil we finger in lift he up he dirt there be yet to a person of you fortune and independence a good deal to do if you enter upon those term which ought to be enter upon i do not find that he have once talk of settlement nor yet of the license a foolish wretch -- but as you evil destiny have throw you out of all other protection and mediation you must be father mother uncle to yourself and enter upon the requisite point for yourself it be hard upon you but indeed you must you situation require it what room for delicacy now -- or would you have I write to he yet that would be the same thing as if you be to write yourself yet write you should i think if you can not speak but speak be certainly best : for word leave no trace they pass as breath and mingle with air and may be explain with latitude but the pen be a witness on record i know the gentleness of you spirit i know the laudable pride of you heart and the just notion you have of the dignity of we sex in these delicate point but once more all this in nothing now : you honor be concern that the dignity i speak of should not be stand upon ` mr lovelace ' would i say yet hate the foolish fellow for he low he stupid pride in wish to triumph over the dignity of he own wife -- ' i be by you means deprive of every friend i have in the world in what light be i to look upon you i have well consider every thing you have make some people much against my liking think I a wife : other know i be not marry nor do i desire any body should believe i be : do you think you be here in the same house with I can be to my reputation you talk to I of mr fretchville 's house ' this will bring he to renew he last discourse on the subject if he do not revive it of himlsef ` if mr fretchville know not she own mind what be she house to I you talk of bring up you cousin montague to bear I company : if my brother 's scheme be you pretence for not go yourself to fetch she you can write to she i insist upon bring these two point to a issue : off or on ought to be indifferent to I if so to they ' such a declaration must bring all forward there be twenty way my dear that you would find out for another in you circumstance he will disdain from he native insolence to have it think he have any body to consult well then will he not be oblige to declare himself and if he do no delay on you side i beseech you give he the day let it be a short one it would be derogate from you own merit not to be so explicit as he ought to be to seem but to doubt he meaning and to wait for that explanation for which i should ever despise he if he make it necessary twice already have you my dear if not oftener modesty would away such opportunity as you ought not to have slip as to settlement if they come not in naturally e ` en leave they to he own justice and to the justice of he family and there be a end of the matter this be my advice : mend it as circumstance offer and follow you own but indeed my dear this or something like it would i do and let he tell I afterwards if he dare or would that he humble down to he shoe-buckle the person it would have be he glory to exalt support yourself mean time with reflection worthy of yourself though trick into this man 's power you be not meanly subjugate to it all he reverence you command or rather as i may say inspire since it be never know that he have any reverence for aught that be good till you be with he : and he profess now and then to be so awed and charm by you example as that the force of it shall reclaim he i believe you will have a difficult task to keep he to it but the more will be you honor if you effect he reformation : and it be my belief that if you can reclaim this great this specious deceiver

to they eldership to be flatter that all power be not over with they but that they may still class and prank it with they daughter -- it vex I heartily to have she tell I of this proposal with self-complaisant simpering and yet she affect to speak of it as if she have no intention to encourage it these antiquated bachelor -lrb- old before they believe themselves to be so -rrb- imagine that when they have once persuade themselves to think of the state they have nothing more to do than to make they mind know to the woman you uncle 's overgrown fortune be indeed a bait a tempting one a

forgiveness for the distance i have so perversely keep he at -- yes i warrant -- but i shall see how this behavior will sit upon I -- you have always rally I upon my meekness i think : well then i

i hate myself but i will not be insult indeed i will not for all this letter xxxi miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe Tuesday may 16 i think once more we seem to be in a kind of train but through a storm i will give you the particulars i hear he in the dining-room at five in the morning i have rest very ill and be up too but open not my door till six : when dorca bring I he request for my company he approach I and take my hand as i enter the dining-room i go not to bed madam till two say he yet sleep not a wink for god 's sake torment I not as you have do for a week past he pause i be silent at first proceed he i think you resentment of a curiosity in which i have be disappoint could not be deep and that it would go off of itself : but when i find it be to be keep up till you know the success of some new overture which you have make and which comply with might have deprive I of you for ever how madam could i support myself under the thought of have with such a union of interest make so little impression upon you mind in my favor he pause again i be still silent he go on i acknowledge that i have a proud heart madam i can not but hope for some instance of previous and preferable favor from the lady i be ambitious to call mine and that she choice of I should not appear not flagrantly appear direct by the perverseness of she selfish persecutor who be my irreconcilable enemy more to the same purpose he say you know my dear the room he have give I to recriminate upon he in twenty instance i do not spare he every one of these instance say i -lrb- after i have enumerate they -rrb- convince I of you pride indeed sir but not of you merit i confess that i have as much pride as you can have although i hope it be of another kind than that you so readily avow but if sir you have the least mixture in yours of that pride which may be expect and think laudable in a man of you birth alliance and fortune you should rather wish i will presume to say to promote what you call my pride than either to suppress it or to regret that i have it it be this my acknowledge pride proceed i that induce I to tell you sir that i think it beneath I to disown what have be my motive for decline for some day past any conversation with you or visit from mr mennell that might lead to point out of my power to determine upon until i hear from my uncle harlowe whom i confess i have cause to be sound whether i might be favor with he interest to obtain for I a reconciliation with my friend upon term which i have cause to be propose i know not say he and suppose must not presume to ask what those term be but i can but too well guess at they and that i be to have be the preliminary sacrifice but you must allow I madam to say that as much as i admire the nobleness of you sentiment in general and in particular that laudable pride which you have speak of i wish that i could compliment you with such a uniformity in it as have set you as much above all submission to mind implacable and unreasonable -lrb- i hope i may without offence say that you brother 's and sister 's be such -rrb- as it have above all favor and condescension to I duty and nature sir call upon I to make the submission you speak of : there be a father there be a mother there be uncle in the one case to justify and demand those submission what pray sir can be plead for the condescension as you call it will you say you merit either with regard to they or to myself may this madam to be say after the persecution of those relation after what you have suffer after what you have make I hope let I my dearest creature ask you -lrb- we have be talk of pride -rrb- what sort of pride must he be which can dispense with inclination and preference in the lady whom he adore -- what must that love -- love sir who talk of love -- be not merit the thing we be talk of -- have i ever profess have i ever require of you profession of a passion of that nature -- but there be no end of these debating each so faultless each so full of self -- i do not think myself faultless madam : -- but -- but what sir -- would you ever more argue with I as if you be a child -- seek palliation and make promise -- promise of what sir of be in future the man it be a shame a gentleman be not -- of be the man -- good god interrupt he with eye lift up if thou wert to be thus severe -- well well sir -lrb- impatiently -rrb- i need only to observe that all this vast difference in sentiment show how unpaired we mind be -- so let we -- let we what madam -- my soul be rise into tumult and he look so wildly that i be a good deal terrify -- let we what madam -- i be however resolve not to desert myself -- why sir let we resolve to quit every regard for each other -- nay flame not out -- i be a poor weak-minded creature in some thing : but where what i should be or not deserve to live if i be not be in the question i have a great and invincible spirit or my own conceit betray I -- let we resolve to quit every regard for each other that be more than civil this you may depend upon : i will never marry any other man i have see enough of you sex at least of you -- a single life shall ever be my choice : while i will leave you at liberty to pursue you own indifference worse than indifference say he in a passion -- interrupt he -- indifference let it be -- you have not -lrb- in my opinion at least -rrb- deserve that it should be other : if you have in you own you have cause -lrb- at least you pride have -rrb- to hate I for misjudge you dearest dearest creature snatch my hand with fierceness let I beseech you to be uniformly noble civil regard madam -- civil regard -- can you so expect to narrow and confine such a passion as mine such a passion as yours mr lovelace deserve to be narrow and confine it be either the passion you do not think it or i do not i question whether you mind be capable of be so narrow and so widen as be necessary to make it be what i wish it to be lift up you hand and you eye sir in silent wonder if you please but what do that wonder express what do it convince I of but that we be not bear for one another by my soul say he and grasp my hand with a eagerness that hurt it we be bear for one another : you must be mine -- you shall be mine -lrb- and put he other hand round I -rrb- although my damnation be to be the purchase i be still more terrify -- let I leave you mr lovelace say i or do you be go from I be the passion you boast of to be thus shockingly demonstrate you must not go madam -- you must not leave I in anger -- i will return -- i will return -- when you can be less violent -- less shocking and he let I go the man quite fright I insomuch that when i get into my chamber i find a sudden flow of tear a great relief to I in half a hour he send a little billet express he concern for the vehemence of he behavior and pray to see I i go because i could not help myself i go he be full of excuse -- o my dear what would you even you do with such a man as this and in my situation it be very possible for he now he say to account for the workings of a begin phrensy for he part he be near distraction all last week to suffer as he have suffer and now to talk of civil regard only when he have hope from the nobleness of my mind -- hope what you will interrupt i i must insist upon it that we mind be by no means suit to each other you have bring I into difficulty i be desert by every friend but miss howe my true sentiment i will not conceal -- it be against my will that i must submit to owe protection from a brother 's project which miss howe think be not give over to you who have bring I into these straight : not with my own concurrence bring I into they remember that -- i do remember that madam -- so often remind how can i forget it -- yet i will owe to you this protection if it be necessary in the earnest hope that you will shun rather than seek mischief if any further inquiry after I be make but what hinder you from leave I -- can not i send to you the widow fretchville it be plain know not she own mind : the people here be more civil to I every day than other : but i have rather have lodgings more agreeable to my circumstance i best know what will suit they and be resolve not to be oblige to any body if you leave I i will privately retire to some one of the neighbouring village and there wait my cousin morden 's arrival with patience i presume madam reply he from what you have say that you application to harlowe-place have prove unsuccessful : i therefore hope that you will now give I leave to mention the term in the nature of settlement which i have long intend to propose to you and which have till now delay to do through accident not proceed from myself i have thought of urge to you the moment you enter upon you new house and upon you finding yourself as independent in appearance as you be in fact permit I madam to propose these matter to you -- not with a expectation of you immediate answer but for you consideration be not hesitation a self-felt glow a downcast eye encouragement more than enough and yet you will observe -lrb- as i now do on recollection -rrb- that he be in no great hurry to solicit for a day since he have no thought of propose settlement till i have get into my new house and now in he great complaisance to I he desire leave to propose he term not with a expectation of my immediate answer but for my consideration only -- yet my dear you advice be too much in my head at this time i hesitate he urge on upon my silence he would call god to witness to the justice nay to the generosity of he intention to I if i would be so good as to hear what he have to propose to I as to settlement could not the man have fall into the subject without this parade many a point you know be refuse and ought to be refuse if leave be ask to introduce it and when once refuse the refusal must in honor be adhere to -- whereas have it be slide in upon one as i may say it might have merit further consideration if such a man as mr lovelace know not this who should but he seem to think it enough that he have ask my leave to propose he settlement he take no advantage of my silence as i presume man as modest as mr lovelace would have do in a like case : yet gaze in my face very confidently and seem to expect my answer i think myself oblige to give the subject a more diffuse turn in order to save myself the mortification of appear too ready in my compliance after such a distance as have be between we and yet -lrb- in pursuance of you advice -rrb- i be willing to avoid the necessity of give he such a repulse as might again throw we out of the course -- a cruel alternative to be reduce to you talk of generosity mr lovelace say i and you talk of justice perhaps without have consider the force of the word in the sense you use they on this occasion -- let I tell you what generosity be in my sense of the word -- true generosity be not confine to pecuniary instance : it be more than politeness : it be more than good faith : it be more than honor it be more than justice since all of these be but duty and what a worthy mind can not dispense with but true generosity be greatness of soul it incite we to do more by a fellow-creature than can be strictly require of we it oblige we to hasten to the relief of a object that want relief anticipate even such a one 's hope or expectation generosity sir will not surely permit a worthy mind to doubt of its honorable and beneficent intention : much less will it allow itself to shock to offend any one and least of all a person throw by adversity mishap or accident into its protection what a opportunity have he to clear he intention have he be so disposed from the latter part of this home observation -- but he run away with the first and keep to that admirably define he say -- but who at this rate madam can be say to be generous to you -- you generosity i implore while justice as it must be my sole merit shall be my aim never be there a woman of such nice and delicate sentiment it be a reflection upon yourself sir and upon the company you have keep if you think these notion either nice or delicate thousand of my sex be more nice than i for they would have avoid the devious path i have be surprise into the consequence of which surprise have lay I under the sad necessity of tell a man who have not delicacy enough to enter into those part of the female character which be its glory and distinction what true generosity be he divine monitress he call I he would endeavor to form he manners -lrb- as he have often promise -rrb- by my example but he hope i would now permit he to mention briefly the justice he propose to do I in the term of the settlement a subject so proper before now to have enter upon and which would have be enter upon long ago have not my frequent displeasure -lrb- i be ever in fault my dear -rrb- take from he the opportunity he have often wish for : but now have venture to lay hold of this nothing should divert he from improve it i have no spirit just now sir to attend such weighty point what you have a mind to propose write to I : and i shall know what answer to return only one thing let I remind you of that if you touch upon a subject in which my father have a concern i shall judge by you treatment of the father what value you have for the daughter he look as if he would choose rather to speak than write : but have he say so i have a severe return to have make upon he as possibly he might see by my look \*\*\* in this way be we now : a sort of calm as i say succeed a storm what may happen next whether a storm or a calm with such a spirit as i have to deal with who can tell but be that as it will i think my dear i be not meanly off : and that be a great point with I and which i know you will be glad to hear : if it be only that i can see this man without lose any of that dignity -lrb- what other word can i use speaking of myself that betoken decency and not arrogance -rrb- which be so necessary to enable I to look up or rather with the mind 's eye i may say to look down upon a man of this man 's cast although circumstance have so offer that i could not take you advice as to the manner of deal with he yet you give I so much courage by it as have enable I to conduct thing to this issue as well as determine I against leave he : which before i be think to do at all adventure whether when it come to the point i should have do so or not i can not say because it would have depend upon he behavior at the time but let he behavior be what it will i be afraid -lrb- with you -rrb- that should any thing offer at last to oblige I to leave he i shall not mend my situation in the world 's eye but the contrary and yet i will not be treat by he with indignity while i have any power to help myself you my dear have accuse I of have modesty would away as you phrase it several opportunity of be -- be what my dear -- why the wife of a libertine : and what a libertine and he wife be my cousin morden 's letter tell we -- let I here once for all endeavor to account for the motive of behavior to this man and for the principle i have proceed upon as they appear to I upon a close self-examination be please to allow I to think that my motive on this occasion rise not altogether from maidenly niceness nor yet from the apprehension of what my present tormenter and future husband may think of a precipitate compliance on such a disagreeable behavior as he : but they arise principally from what offer to my own heart respect as i may say its own rectitude its own judgment of the fit and the unfit as i would without study answer for myself to myself in the first place to he and to the world in the second only principle that be in my mind that i find there implant no doubt by the first gracious planter : which therefore impel I as i may say to act up to they that thereby i may to the best of my judgment be enable to comport myself worthily in both state -lrb- the single and the married -rrb- let other act as they will by I i hope my dear i do not deceive myself and instead of set about rectify what be amiss in my heart endeavor to find excuse for habit and peculiarity which i be unwilling to cast off or overcome the heart be very deceitful : do you my dear friend lay mine open -lrb- but surely it be always open before you -rrb- and spare I not if you think it culpable this observation once for all as i say i think proper to make to convince you that to the best of my judgment my error in matter as well of lesser moment as of greater shall rather be the fault of my judgment than of my will i be my dearest friend you ever oblige clarissa harlowe letter xxxii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe Tuesday night may 16 mr lovelace have send I by dorca he proposal as follow : ` to spare a delicacy so extreme and to obey you i write : and the rather that you may communicate

four hundred pound a year to be pay to you sole and separate use quarterly ` my own estate be a clear not nominnal 2000l per annum lord m propose to give I possession either of that which he have in lancashire -lrb- to which by the way i think i have a better title than he have himself -rrb- or that we call the lawn in hertfordshire upon my nuptials with a lady whom he so greatly admire and to make that i shall choose a clear 1000l per annum ` my too great contempt of censure have subject I to much slander it may not therefore be improper to assure you on the word of a gentleman that no part of my estate be ever mortgage : and that although i live very expensively abroad and make large draught yet that midsummer-day next will discharge all that i owe in the world my notion be not all bad one i have be think in pecuniary case generous it would have deserve another name have i not first be just ` if as you own estate be at present in you father 's hand you rather choose that i should make a jointure out of mine tantamount to yours be it what it will it shall be do i will engage lord m to write to you what he propose to do on the happy occasion : not as you desire or expectation but to demonstrate that no advantage be intend to be take of the situation you be in with you own family ` to shew the beloved daughter the consideration i have for she i will consent that she shall prescribe the term of agreement in relation to the large sum which must be in she father 's hand arise from she grandfather 's estate i have no doubt but he will be put upon make large demand upon you all those it shall be in you power to comply with for the sake of you own peace and the remainder shall be pay into you hand and be entirely at you disposal as a fund to support those charitable donation which i have hear you so famed for out of you family and for which you have be so greatly reflect upon in it ` as to clothes jewel and the like against the time you shall choose to make you appearance it will be my pride that you shall not be beholden for such of these as shall be answerable to the rank of both to those who have have the stupid folly to renounce a daughter they deserve not you must excuse I madam : you would mistrust my sincerity in the rest could i speak of these people without asperity though so nearly related to you ` these madam be my proposal they be such as i always design to make whenever you would permit I to enter into the delightful subject but you have be so determine to try every method for reconcile yourself to you relation even by give I absolutely up for ever that you seem to think it but justice to keep I at a distance till the event of that you predominant hope could be see it be now see -- and although i have be and perhaps still be ready to regret the want of that preference i wish for from you as miss clarissa harlowe yet i be sure as the husband of mr lovelace i shall be more ready to adore than to blame you for the pang you have give to a heart the generosity or rather the justice of which my implacable enemy have teach you to doubt : and this still the readier as i be persuade that those pang never would have be give by a mind so noble have not the doubt be entertain -lrb- perhaps with too great a appearance of reason -rrb- and as i hope i shall have it to reflect that the moment the doubt shall be overcome the indifference will cease ' i will only add that if i have omit any thing that would have give you farther satisfaction or if the above term be short of what you would wish you will be please to supply they as you think fit and when i know you pleasure i will instantly order article to be draw up comformably that nothing in my power may be want to make you happy ` you will now dearest madam judge how far all the rest depend upon yourself ' you see my dear what he offer you see it be all my fault that he have not make these offer before i be a strange creature -- to be to blame in every thing and to every body yet neither intend the ill at the time nor know it to be the ill too late or so nearly too late that i must give up all the delicacy he talk of to compound for my fault i shall now judge how far the rest depend upon myself so coldly conclude he such warm and in the main unobjectionably proposal : would you not as you read have suppose that the paper would conclude with the most earnest demand of a day -- i own i have that expectation so strong result naturally as i may say from the premise that without study for dissatisfaction i could not help be dissatisfy when i come to the conclusion but you say there be no help i must perhaps make further sacrifice all delicacy it seem be to be at a end with I -- but if so this man know not what every wise man know that prudence and virtue and delicacy of mind in a wife do the husband more real honor in the eye of the world than the same quality -lrb- be she destitute of they -rrb- in himself do he : as the want of they in she do he more dishonor : for be not the wife 's error the husband 's reproach how justly he reproach be another thing i will consider this paper and write to it if i be able : for it seem now all the rest depend upon myself letter xxxiii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe Wednesday morning may 17 mr lovelace would fain have engage I last night but as i be not prepare to enter upon the subject of he proposal -lrb- intend to consider they maturely -rrb- and be not highly please with he conclusion i desire to be excuse see he till morning and the rather as there be hardly any get from he in tolerable time overnight accordingly about seven o'clock we meet in the dining-room i find he be full of expectation that i should meet he with a very favourable who know but with a thankful aspect and i immediately find by he sullen countenance that he be under no small disappointment that i do not my dearest love be you well why look you so solemn upon I will you indifference never be over if i have propose term in any respect short of you expectation -- i tell he that he have very considerately mention my shew he proposal to miss howe and as i should have a speedy opportunity to send they to she by collin i desire to suspend any talk upon that subject till i have she opinion upon they good god -- if there be but the least loop-hole the least room for delay -- but he be write a letter to lord m to give he a account of he situation with I and could not finish it so satisfactorily either to my lord or to himself as if i would condescend to say whether the term he have propose be acceptable or not thus far i tell he i could say that my principal point be peace and reconciliation with my relation as to other matter the gentleness of he own spirit would put he upon do more for I than i should ask or expect wherefore if all he have to write about be to know what lord m would do on my account he might spare himself the trouble for that my utmost wish as to myself be much more easily gratify than he perhaps imagine he ask I then if i would so far permit he to touch upon the happy day as to request the presence of lord m on the occasion and to be my father father have a sweet and venerable sound with it i say i should be glad to have a father who would own I be not this plain speaking think you my dear yet it rather i must own appear so to I on reflection than be design freely at the time for i then with a sigh from the bottom of my heart thought of my own father bitterly regret that i be a outcast from he and from my mother mr lovelace i think seem a little affected at the manner of my speaking and perhaps at the sad reflection i be but a very young creature mr lovelace say i -lrb- and wipe my eye as i turn away my face -rrb- although you have kindly and in love to I introduce so much sorry to I already : so you must not wonder that the word father strike so sensibly upon the heart of a child ever dutiful till she know you and whose tender year still

as lord m be so subject to gout he be afraid that the compliment he have just propose to make he might if make occasion a larger suspension than he could bear to think of and if it do it would vex he to the heart that he have make it i could not say a single word to this you know my dear but you will guess at my thought of what he say -- so much passionate love lip-deep so prudent and so dutifully patient at heart to a relation he have till now so undutifully despise -- why why be i throw upon such a man think i he hesitate as if contend with himself and after take a turn or two about the room he be at a great loss what to determine upon he say because he have not the honor of know when he be to be make the happiest of man -- would to god it might that very instant be resolve upon he stop a moment or two stare in he usual confident way in my downcast face -lrb- do i not o my beloved friend think you want a father or a mother just then -rrb- but if he could not so soon as he wish procure my consent to a day in that case he think the compliment might as well be make to lord m as not -lrb- see my dear -rrb- since the settlement might be draw and engross in the intervenient time which would pacify he impatience as no time would be lose you will suppose how i be affect by this speech by repeat the substance of what he say upon it as follow but by he soul he know not so much be i upon the reserve and so much latent meaning do my eye import whether when he most hope to please I he be not farthest from do so would i vouchsafe to say whether i approve of he compliment to lord m or not to leave it to I to choose whether the speedy day he ought to have urge for with earnestness should be accelerate or suspend -- miss howe think i at that moment say i must not run away from this man to be sure mr lovelace if this matter be ever to be it must be agreeable to I to have the full approbation of one side since i can not have that of the other if this matter be ever to be good god what word be these at this time of day and full approbation of one side why that word approbation when the greatest pride of all my family be that of have the honor of so dear a creature for they relation would to heaven my dearest life add he that without compliment any body to-morrow might be the happiest day of my life -- what say you my angel with a tremble impatience that seem not affect -- what say you for to-morrow it be likely my dear i could say much to it or name another day have i be dispose to the latter with such a hint delay from he i be silent next day madam if not to-morrow -- have he give I time to answer it could not have be in the affirmative you must think -- but in the same breath he go on -- or the day after that -- and take both my hand in he he stare I into a half-confusion -- would you have have patience with he my dear no no say i as calmly as possible you can not think that i should imagine there can be reason for such a hurry it will be most agreeable to be sure for my lord to be present i be all obedience and resignation return the wretch with a self - plume air as if he have acquiesce to a proposal make by I and have compliment I with a great piece of self denial be it not plain my dear that he design to vex and tease I proud yet mean and foolish man if so -- but you say all punctilio be at a end with I why why will he take pain to make a heart wrap itself up in reserve that wish only and that for he sake as well as my own to observe due decorum modesty i think require of I that it should pass as he have put it : do it not -- i think it do would to heaven -- but what signify wish but when he would have reward himself as he have heretofore call it for this self-supposed concession with a kiss i repulse he with a just and very sincere disdain he seem both vex and surprise as one who have make the most agreeable proposal and concession and think they ungratefully return he plainly say that he think we situation would entitle he to such a innocent freedom : and he be both amaze and grieve to be thus scornfully repulse no reply could be make be I on such a subject i abruptly break from he i recollect as i pass by one of the pier - glass that i saw in it he clenched hand offer in wrath to he forehead : the word indifference by he soul next to hatred i hear he speak and something of ice he mention : i hear not what whether he intend to write to my lord or miss montague i can not tell but as all delicacy ought to be over with I now perhaps i be to blame to expect it from a man who may not know what it be if he do not and yet think himself very polite and intend not to be otherwise i be rather to be pity than he to be censure and after all since i must take he as i find he i must : that be to say as a man so vain and so accustomed to be admire that not be conscious of internal defect he have take no pain to polish more than he outside : and as he proposal be higher than my expectation and as in he own opinion he have a great deal to bear from I i will -lrb- no new offence prevent -rrb- sit down to answer they and if possible in term as unobjectionable to he as he be to I but after all see you not my dear more and more the mismatch that there be in we mind however i be willing to compound for my fault by give up -lrb- if that may be all my punishment -rrb- the expectation of what be deem happiness in this life with such a husband as i fear he will make in short i will content myself to be a suffer person through the state to the end of my life -- a long one it can not be this may qualify he -lrb- as it may prove -rrb- from sting of conscience from misbehavior to a first wife to be a more tolerable one to a second though not perhaps a better deserving one : while my story to all who shall know it will afford these instruction : that the eye be a traitor and ought ever to be mistrust : that form be deceitful : in other word that a fine person be seldom pair by a fine mind : and that sound principle and a good heart be the only basis on which the hope of a happy future either with respect to this world or the other can be build and so much at present for mr lovelace 's proposal : of which i desire you opinion \* \* we can not forbear observe in this place that the lady have be particularly censure even by some of she own sex as over-nice in she part of the above conversation : but surely this must be owe to want of attention to the circumstance she be in and to she character as well as to the character of the man she have to deal with : for although she could not be suppose to know so much of he design as the reader do by means of he letter to belford yet she be but too well convinced of he faulty moral and of the necessity there be from the whole of he behavior to she to keep such a encroacher as she frequently call he at a distance in letter xxxiii of vol iii the reader will see that upon some favourable appearance she blame herself for she readiness to suspect he but he character he principle say she be so faulty -- he be so light so vain so various -- then my dear i have no guardian to depend upon in letter ix of vol iii must i not with such a man say she be want to myself be i not jealous and vigilant by this time the reader will see that she have still greater reason for she jealousy and vigilance and lovelace will tell the sex as he do in letter xi of vol v that the woman who resent not initiatory freedom must be lose love be a encroacher say he : love never go backward nothing but the highest act of love can satisfy a indulged love but the reader perhaps be too apt to form a judgment of clarissa 's conduct in critical case by lovelace 's complaint of she coldness not consider he view upon she and that she be propose as a example and therefore in she trial and distress must not be allow to dispense with those rule which perhaps some other of the sex in she delicate situation would not have think themselves so strictly bind to observe although if she have not observe they a lovelace would have carry all he point -lrb- four letter be write by mr lovelace from the date of he last give the state of affair between he and the lady pretty much the same as in hers in the same period allow for the humor in he and for he resentment express with vehemence on she resolution to leave he if she friend could be bring to be reconcile to she -- a few extract from they will be only give -rrb- what say he might have become of I and of my project have not she father and the rest of the implacable stand my friend -lrb- after violent threatening of revenge he say -rrb- ` tis plain she would have give I up for ever : nor should i have be able to prevent she abandon of I unless i have tear up the tree by the root to come at the fruit which i hope still to bring down by a gentle shake or two if i can but have patience to stay the ripening seasoning -lrb- thus triumph in he unpolite cruelty he say -rrb- after she haughty treatment of I i be resolve she shall speak out there be a thousand beauty to be discover in the face in the accent in the bush-beating hesitation of a woman who be earnest about a subject she want to introduce yet know not how silly fellow call themselves generous one would value themselves for spare a lady 's confusion : but they be silly fellow indeed and rob themselves of prodigious pleasure by they forwardness and at the same time deprive she of display a world of charm which can only be manifest on these occasion i 'll tell thee beforehand how it will be with my charmer in this case -- she will be about it and about it several time : but i will not understand she : at least after half a dozen hem -- ing she will be oblige to speak out -- i think mr lovelace -- i think sir -- i think you be say some day ago -- still i will be all silence -- she eye fix upon my shoe-buckle as i sit over-against she -- lady when put to it thus always admire a man 's shoe-buckle or perhaps some particular beauty in the carpet i think you say that mr fretchville -- then a crystal tear trickle down each crimson cheek vex to have she virgin pride so little assisted but come my meaning dear cry i to myself remember what i have suffer for thee and what i have suffer by thee thy tearful pausing shall not be help out by I speak out love -- o the sweet confusion can i rob myself of so many conflict beauty by the precipitate charmer-pitying folly by which a politer man -lrb- thou knowest lovely that i be no polite man -rrb- betray by he own tenderness and unused to female tear would have be overcome i will feign a irresolution of mind on the occasion that she may not quite abhor I -- that she reflection on the scene in my absence may bring to she remembrance some beauty in my part of it : a irresolution that will be owe to awe to reverence to profound veneration and that will have more eloquence in it than word can have speak out then love and spare not hard-heartedness as it be call be a essential of the libertine 's character familiarize to the distress he occasion he be seldom betray by tenderness into a complaisant weakness unworthy of himself -lrb- mention the settlement he say -rrb- i be in earnest as to the term if i marry she -lrb- and i have no doubt that i shall after my pride my ambition my revenge if thou wilt be gratify -rrb- i will do she noble justice the more i do for such a prudent such a excellent economist the more shall i do for myself -- but by my soul belford she haughtiness shall be bring down to own both love and obligation to I nor will this sketch of settlement bring we forwarder than i would have it modesty of sex will stand my friend at any time at the very altar we hand join i will engage to make this proud beauty leave the parson and I and all my friend who should be present though twenty in number to look like fool upon one another while she take wing and fly out of the church door or window -lrb- if that be open and the door shut -rrb- and this only by a single word -lrb- he mention he rash expression that she should be he although he damnation be to be the purchase -rrb- at that instant say he i be upon the point of make a violent attempt but be check in the very moment and but just in time to save myself by the awe i be strike with on again cast my eye upon she terrify but lovely face and see as i think she spotless heart in every line of it o virtue virtue proceed he what be there in thee that can thus against he will affect the heart of a lovelace -- whence these involuntary tremor and fear of give mortal offence -- what art thou that act in the breast of a feeble woman which never before no not in my first attempt young as i then be and frighten at my own boldness -lrb- till i find myself forgive -rrb- have such a effect upon I -lrb- he paint in lively color that part of the scene between he and the lady where she say the word father have a sweet and venerable sound with it -rrb- i be exceedingly affect say he upon the occasion but be ashamed to be surprise into such a fit of unmanly weakness -- so ashamed that i be resolve to subdue it at the instant and to guard against the like for the future yet at that moment i more than half regret that i could not permit she to enjoy a triumph which she so well deserve to glory in -- she youth she beauty she artless innocence and she manner equally beyond comparison or description but she indifference belford -- that she could resolve to sacrifice I to the malice of my enemy and carry on the design in so clandestine a manner -- and yet love she as i do to phrensy -- revere she as i do to adoration -- these be the recollection with which i fortify my recreant heart against she -- yet after all if she persevere she must conquer -- coward as she have make I that never be a coward before -lrb- he conclude he fourth letter in a vehement rage upon she repulse he when he offer to salute she have suppose as he own that she would have be all condescension on he proposal to she -rrb- this say he i will for ever remember against she in order to steel my heart that i may cut through a rock of ice to hers and repay she for the disdain the scorn which glow in she countenance and be apparent in she air at she abrupt departure for I after such oblige behavior on my side and after i have so earnestly press she for a early

true i do not know that he have any bad design upon she but i know he temper too well not to be apprehensive upon such long delay : and the lady here have be for some time in fear for she : lady sarah in particular who -lrb- as you must know -rrb- be a wise woman say that these delay in the present case must be from he rather than from the lady he have always indeed a strong antipathy to marriage and may think of play he dog 's trick by she as he have by so many other if there be any danger of this ` tis best to prevent it in time : for when a thing be do advice come too late he have always have the folly and impertinence to make a jest of I for use proverb : but as they be the wisdom of whole nation and age collect into a small compass i be not to be shame out of sentence that often contain more wisdom in they than the tedious harangue of most of we parson and moralist let he laugh at they if he please : you and i know better thing mr belford -- though you have keep company with a wolf you have not learn to howl of he but nevertheless you must let he know that i have write to you on this subject i be ashamed to say it but he have ever treat I as if i be a man of very common

sow 's ear i be sure he have no reason however to slight I as he do he may and will be the better for I if he outlive I though he once tell I to my face that i might do as i would with my estate for that he for he part love he liberty as much as he despise money and at another time twit I with my phrase that the man be above controul who want not either to borrow or flatter he think i suppose that i could not cover he with my wing without peck at he with my bill though i never use to be peck at he without very great occasion : and god know he might have my very heart if he would but endeavor to oblige I by study he own good for that be all i desire of he indeed it be he poor mother that first spoil he and i have be but too indulgent to he since a fine grateful disposition you 'll say to return evil for good but that be always he way it be a good say and which be verify by he with a witness -- child when little make they parent fool when great mad have he parent live to see what i have see of he they would have be mad indeed this match however as the lady have such a extraordinary share of wisdom and goodness might set all to rights and if you can forward it i would enable he to make whatever settlement he could wish and should not be unwilling to put he in possession of another pretty estate besides i be no covetous man he know and indeed what be a covetous man to be liken to so fitly as to a dog in a wheel which roast meat for other and what do i live for -lrb- as i have often say -rrb- but to see he and my two niece well marry and settle may heaven settle he down to a better mind and turn he heart to more of goodness and consideration if the delay be on he side i tremble for the lady and if on hers -lrb- as he tell my niece charlotte -rrb- i could wish she be apprize that delay be dangerous excellent as she be she ought not to depend on she merit with such a changeable fellow and such a profest marriage - hater as he have be desert and reward i can assure she seldom keep company together but let he remember that vengeance though it come with leaden foot strike with iron hand if he behave ill in this case he may find it so what a pity it be that

she will that she must yield entangled as she be : and yet makest she virtue the pretence of thy solicitude for she a instrument of the vile jame harlowe dost thou call I -- o jack how could i curse thee -- i be instrument of that brother of that sister but mark the end -- and thou shalt see what will become of that brother and of that sister play not against I my own acknowledge sensibility i desire thee sensibility which at the same time that they contradict thy charge of a adamantine heart in thy friend thou hadst know nothing of have i not communicate they to thee if i ruin such a virtue sayest thou -- eternal monotonist -- again the most immaculate virtue may be ruin by man who have no regard to they honor and who make a jest of the most solemn oath & c what must be the virtue that will be ruin without oath be not the world full of these deception and be not lover ' oath a jest of hundred of year ' standing and be not caution against the perfidy of we sex a necessary part of the female education i do intend to endeavor to overcome myself but i must first try if i can not overcome this lady have i not say that the honor of she sex be concern that i should try whenever thou meetest with a woman of but half she perfection thou wilt marry -- do jack can a girl be degrade by trial who be not overcome i be glad that thou takest crime to thyself for not endeavor to convert the poor wretch whom other have ruin i will not recriminate upon thee belford as i might when thou flatterest thyself that thou never ruinedst the moral of any young creature who otherwise would not have be corrupt -- the palliating consolation of a hottentot heart determine rather to gluttonize on the garbage of other foul feeder than to reform -- but tell I jack wouldst thou have spare such a girl as my rosebud have i not by my example engage thy generosity nor be my rosebud the only girl i spare : -- when my power be acknowledge who more merciful than thy friend it be resistance that inflame desire sharpen the dart of love and blow its fire love be disarm would that meet with too much ease he languish and do not care to please the woman know this as well as the man they love to be address with spirit : and therefore ` tis they golden fruit they guard with so much care to make profession hard whence for a by-reflection the ardent the complaisant gallant be so often prefer to the cold the unadoring husband and yet the sex do not consider that variety and novelty give the ardor and the obsequiousness and that be the rake as much use to they as the husband be he would be -lrb- and be to he own wife if marry -rrb- as indifferent to they favor as they husband be and the husband in he turn would to another woman be the rake let the woman upon the whole take this lesson from a lovelace -- ` always to endeavor to make themselves as new to a husband and to appear as elegant and as oblige to he as they be desirous to appear to a lover and actually be to he as such and then the rake which all woman love will last longer in the husband than it generally do ' but to return : -- if i have not sufficiently clear my conduct to thee in the above i refer thee once more to mine of the 13th of last month \* and pr ` ythee jack lay I not under a necessity to repeat the same thing so often i hope thou readest what i write more than once \* see vol ii letter xiv i be not displeased that thou art so apprehensive of my resentment that i can not miss a day without make thee uneasy thy conscience ` tis plain tell thee that thou have deserve my displeasure : and if it have convince thee of that it will make thee afraid of repeat thy fault see that this be the consequence else now that thou hast tell I how i can punish thee it be very likely that i do punish thee by my silence although i have as much pleasure in write on this charming subject as thou canst have in read what i write when a boy if a dog run away from I through fear i generally look about for a stone or a stick and if neither offer to my hand i skinned my hat after he to make he afraid for something what signify power if we do not exert it let my lord know that thou hast scribble to I but give he not the contents of thy epistle though a parcel of crude stuff he would think there be something in it poor argument will do when bring in favor of what we like but the stupid peer little think that this lady be a rebel to love on the contrary not only he but all the world believe she to be a volunteer in he service -- so i shall incur blame and she will be pity if any thing happen amiss since my lord 's heart be set upon this match i have write already to let he know ` that my unhappy character have give my beloved a ungenerous diffidence of I that she be so mother-sick and father-fond that she have rather return to harlowe-place than marry that she be even apprehensive that the step she have take of go off with I will make the lady of a family of such rank and honor as ours think slightly of she that therefore i desire he lordship -lrb- though this hint i tell he must be very delicately touch -rrb- to write I such a letter as i can shew she -lrb- let he treat I in it ever so freely i shall not take it amiss i tell he because i know he lordship take pleasure in write to I in a corrective style -rrb- that he may make what offer he please on the marriage that i desire he presence at the ceremony that i may take from he hand the greatest blessing that mortal man can give I ' i have not absolutely tell the lady that i would write to he lordship to this effect yet have give she reason to think i will so that without the last necessity i shall not produce the answer i expect from he : for i be very loth i own to make use of any of my family 's name for the further of my design and yet i must make all secure before i pull off the mask be not this my motive for bring she hither thus thou seest that the old peer 's letter come very seasonably i thank thee for that but as to he sentence they can not possibly do I good i be early suffocate with he wisdom of nation when a boy i never ask anything of he but out fly a proverb and if the tendency of that be to deny I i never could obtain the least favor this give I so great a aversion to the very word that when a child i make it a condition with my tutor who be a honest parson that i would not read my bible at all if he would not excuse I one of the wisest book in it : to which however i have no other objection than that it be call the proverb and as for solomon he be then a hate character with I not because of he polygamy but because i have conceive he to be such another musty old fellow as my uncle well but let we leave old saw to old I what signify thy tedious whining over thy depart relation be it not generally agree that he can not recover will it not be kind in thee to put he out of he misery i hear that he be pester still with visit from doctor and apothecary and surgeon that they can not cut so deep as the mortification have go and that in every visit in every scarification inevitable death be pronounced upon he why then do they keep torment he be it not to take away more of he live fleece than of he dead flesh -- when a man be give over the fee should surely be refuse be they not now rob he heir -- what have thou to do if the will be as thou ` dst have it -- he send for thee -lrb- do he not -rrb- to close he eye he be but a uncle be he let I see if i mistake not it be in the bible or some other good book : can it be in herodotus -- o i believe it be in josephus a half - sacred and half-profane author he tell we of a king of syrium put out of he pain by he prime minister or one who deserve to be so for he contrivance the story say if i be right that he spread a wet cloth over he face which kill he he reign in he place a notable fellow perhaps this wet cloth in the original be what we now call laudanum a potion that overspread the faculty as the wet cloth do the face of the royal patient and the translator know not how to render it but how like forlorn varlet thou subscribest ` thy melancholy friend j belford ' melancholy for what to stand by and see fair play between a old man and death i think thou hadst be more of a man that thou art not afraid of a acute death a sword 's point to be so plaugily hip would at the consequence of a chronical one -- what though the scarificator work upon he day by day it be only upon a caput mortuum : and pr ` ythee go to to use the stylum veterum and learn of the royal butcher who for sport -lrb- a hundred time worse man than thy lovelace -rrb- widow ten thousand at a brush and make twice as many fatherless -- learn of they i say how to support a single death but art thou sure jack it be a mortification -- my uncle once give promise of such a root-and-branch distemper : but alas it turn to a smart gout-fit and i have the mortification instead of he -- i have hear that bark in proper dose will arrest a mortification in its progress and at last cure it let thy uncle 's surgeon know that it be worth more than he ear if he prescribe one grain of the bark i wish my uncle have give I the opportunity of set thee a better example : thou shouldst have see what a brave fellow i have be and have i have occasion to write my conclusion would have be this : ' i hope the old trojan 's happy in that hope i be so and ` thy rejoice friend ' r lovelace ' dwell not always jack upon one subject let I have poor belton 's story the sooner the better if i can be of service to he tell he he may command I either in purse or person yet the former with a freer will than the latter for how can i leave my goddess but i 'll issue my command to my other vassal to attend thy summons if ye want head let I know if not my quota on this occasion be money letter xxxviii mr belford to robert lovelace esq Saturday may 20 not one word will i reply to such a abandon wretch as thou hast shewn thyself to be in thine of last night i will leave the lady to the protection of that power who only can work miracle and to she own merit still i have hope that these will save she i will proceed as thou desirest to poor belton 's case and the rather as it have throw I into such a train of think upon we past live we present course and we future view as may be of service to we both if i can give due weight to the reflection that arise from it the poor man make I a visit on Thursday in this my melancholy attendance he begin with complaint of he ill health and spirit he hectic cough and he increase malady of spit blood and then lead to he story a confound one it be and which highly aggravate he other malady : for it have come out that he thomasine -lrb- who truly would be new christen you know that she name might be nearer in sound to the christian name of the man whom she pretend to doat upon -rrb- have for many year carry on a intrigue with a fellow who have be hostler to she father -lrb- a innkeeper at darking -rrb- of whom at the expense of poor belton she have make a gentleman and manage it so that have the art to make herself he cashier she have be unable to account for large sum which he think forthcoming at demand and have trust to she custody in order to pay off a mortgage upon he parental estate in kent which he heart have run upon leave clear but which now can not be do and will soon be foreclose and yet she have so long pass for he wife that he know not what to resolve upon about she nor about the two boy he be so fond of suppose they to be he whereas now he begin to doubt he share in they so keep do not do lovelace ` tis not the eligible wife ' a man must keep a woman say the poor fellow to I but not he estate -- two interest -- then my totter fabric ' point to he emaciated carcass we do well to value ourselves upon we liberty or to speak more properly upon the liberty we take we have need to run down matrimony as we do and to make that state the subject of we frothy jest when we frequently render ourselves -lrb- for this of tom 's be not a singular case -rrb- the dupe and tool of woman who generally govern we -lrb- by art we wise head penetrate not -rrb- more absolutely than a wife would attempt to do let we consider this point a little and that upon we own principle as libertine set aside what be exact from we by the law of we country and its custom which nevertheless we can not get over till we have get over almost all moral obligation as member of society in the first place let we consider -lrb- we who be in possession of estate by legal descent -rrb- how we should have like to have be such naked destitute varlet as we must have be have we father be as wise as ourselves and despise matrimony as we do -- and then let we ask ourselves if we ought not to have the same regard for we posterity as we be glad we father have for theirs but this perhaps be too moral a consideration -- to proceed therefore to those consideration which will be more striking to we : how can we reasonably expect economy or frugality -lrb- or anything indeed but riot and waste -rrb- from creature who have a interest and must therefore have view different from we own they know the uncertain tenure -lrb- we fickle humor -rrb- by which they hold : and be it to be wonder at suppose they to be provident harlot that they should endeavor if they have the power to lay up against a rainy day or if they have not the power that they should squander all they can come at when they be sure of nothing but the present hour and when the life they live and the sacrifice they have make put conscience and honor out of the question whereas a wife have the same family-interest with she husband lie not under either the same apprehension or temptation and have not break through -lrb- of necessity at least have not -rrb- those restraint which education have fasten upon she : and if she make a private purse which we be tell by anti-matrimonialist all wife love to do and have child it go all into the same family at the long-run then as to the great article of fidelity to you bed -- be not woman of family who be well-educated under greater restraint than creature who if they ever have reputation sacrifice it to sordid interest or to more sordid appetite the moment they give it up to you do not the example you furnish of have succeed with she give encouragement for other to attempt she likewise for with all she blandishments can any man be so credulous or so vain as to believe that the woman he could persuade another may not prevail upon adultery be so capital a guilt that even rake and libertine if not wholly abandon and as i may say invite by a woman 's levity disavow and condemn it : but here in a state of keep a woman be in no danger of incur -lrb- legally at least -rrb- that guilt and you yourself have break through and overthrow in she all the fence and boundary of moral honesty and the modesty and reserve of she sex : and what tie shall hold she against inclination or interest and what shall deter a attempter while a husband have this security from legal sanction that if he wife be detect in a criminal conversation with a man of fortune -lrb- the most likely by bribe to seduce she -rrb- he may recover very great damages and procure a divorce besides : which to say nothing of the ignominy be a consideration that must have some force upon both party and a wife must be vicious indeed and a reflection upon a man 's own choice who for the sake of change and where there be no quality to seduce nor affluence to corrupt will run so many hazard to injure she husband in the tenderest of all point but there be difficulty in procure a divorce -- -lrb- and so there ought -rrb- -- and none say the rake in parting with a mistress whenever you suspect she or whenever you be weary of she and have a mind to change she for another but must not the man be a brute indeed who can cast off a woman whom he have seduce -lrb- if he take she from the town that be another thing -rrb- without some flagrant reason something that will better justify he to himself as well as to she and to the world than mere power and novelty but i do not see if we judge by fact and by the practice of all we have be acquaint with of the keeping-class that we know how to part with they when we have they that we know we can if we will be all we have for it : and this lead we to bear many thing from a mistress which we would not from a wife but if we be good-natured and humane : if the woman have art : -lrb- and what woman want it who have fall by art and to whose precarious situation art be so necessary -rrb- if you have give she the credit of be call by you name : if you have a settle place of abode and have receive and pay visit in she company as you wife : if she have bring you child -- you will allow that these be strong obligation upon you in the world 's eye as well as to you own heart against tear yourself from such close connection she will stick to you as you skin : and it will be next to flay yourself to cast she off even if there be cause for it by infidelity she will have manage ill if she have not she defender nor do i ever know a cause or a person so bad as to want advocate either from ill-will to the one or pity to the other : and you will then be think a hard-hearted miscreant : and even be she to go off without credit to herself she will leave you as little especially with all those whose good opinion a man would wish to cultivate well then shall this poor privilege that we may part with a woman if we will be deem a balance for the other inconveniency shall it be think by we who be man of family and fortune a equivalent for give up equality of degree and take for the partner of we bed and very probably more than the partner in we estate -lrb- to the breach of all family-rule and order -rrb- a low-born a low-educated creature who have not bring any thing into the common stock and can possibly make no return for the solid benefit she receive but those libidinous one which a man can not boast of but to he disgrace nor think of but to the shame of both moreover as the man advance in year the fury of he libertinism will go off he will have different aim and pursuit which will diminish he appetite to range and make such a regular life as the matrimonial and family life palatable to he and every day more palatable if he have child and have reason to think they he and if he lewd course have leave he any estate he will have cause to regret the restraint he boast liberty have lay he under and the valuable privilege it have deprive he of when he find that it must descend to some relation for whom whether near or distant he care not one farthing and who perhaps -lrb- if a man of virtue -rrb- have hold he in the utmost contempt for he dissolute life and be we to suppose he estate in he power to bequeath as he please why should a man resolve for the gratifying of he foolish humor only to bastardize he race why should he wish to expose he child to the scorn and insult of the rest of the world why should he whether they be son or daughter lay they under the necessity of comply with proposal of marriage either inferior as to fortune or unequal as to age why should he deprive the child he love who themselves may be guilty of no fault of the respect they would wish to have and to deserve and of the opportunity of associate themselves with proper that be to say with reputable company and why should he make they think themselves under obligation to every person of character who will vouchsafe to visit they what little reason in a word would such child have to bless they father 's obstinate defiance of the law and custom of he country and for give they a mother of whom they could not think with honor to whose crime it be that they owe they very being and whose example it be they duty to shun if the education and moral of these child be leave to chance as too generally they be -lrb- for the man who have humanity and a feeling heart and who be capable of fondness for he offspring i take it for grant will marry -rrb- the case be still worse he crime be perpetuate as i may say by he child : and the sea the army perhaps the highway for the boy the common for the girl too often point out the way to a worse catastrophe what therefore upon the whole do we get by tread in these crooked path but danger disgrace and a too-late repentance and after all do we not frequently become the cully of we own libertinism slide into the very state with those half-worn-out doxy which perhaps we might have enter into with they lady at least with they superior both in degree and fortune and all the time live handsomely like ourselves not sneak into hole and corner and when we creep abroad with we woman look about we and at ever one that pass we as if we be confessedly accountable to the censure of all honest people my cousin tony jenyn thou knewest he have not the actively mischievous spirit that thou belton mowbray tourville and myself have : but he imbibe the same notion we do and carry they into practice how do he prate against wedlock how do he strut about as a wit and a smart and what a wit and a smart do all the boy and girl of we family -lrb- myself among the rest then a urchin -rrb- think he for the air he give himself -- marry no not for the world what man of sense would bear the insolence the petulance the expensiveness of a wife he could not for the heart of he think it tolerable that a woman of equal rank and fortune and as it might happen superior talent to he own should look upon herself to have a right to share the benefit of that fortune which she bring he so after he have flutter about the town for two or three year in all which time he have a better opinion of himself than any body else have what do he do but enter upon a affair with he fencing-master 's daughter he succeed take private lodgings for she at hackney visit she by stealth both of they tender of reputation that be extremely tender but which neither have quite give up for rake of either sex be always the last to condemn or cry down themselves : visit by nobody nor visit : the life of a thief or of a man best by creditor afraid to look out of he own house or to be see abroad with she and thus go on for twelve year and though he have a good estate hardly make both end meet for though no glare there be no economy and beside he have ever year a child and very fond of he child be he but none of they live above three year and be now on the death of the dozenth grow as dully sober as if he have be a real husband he good mr thoma -lrb- for he have not permit she to take he own name -rrb- prevail upon he to think the loss of they child a judgment upon the parent for they wicked way of life -lrb- a time will come lovelace if we live to advanced year in which reflection will take hold of the enfeebled mind -rrb- and then it be not difficult for he woman to induce he by way of compound with heaven to marry she when this be do he have leisure to sit down and contemplate a to recollect the many offer of person of family and fortune to which he have decline in the prime of life : he expense equal at least : he reputation not only less but lose : he enjoyment steal : he partnership unequal and such as he have always be ashamed of but the woman say that after twelve or thirteen year ' cohabitation tony do a honest thing by she and that be all my poor cousin get by make he old mistress he new wife -- not a drum not a trumpet not a fife not a tabret nor the expectation of a new joy to animate he on what belton will do with he thomasine i know not nor care i to advise he : for i see the poor fellow do not like that any body should curse she but himself this he do very heartily and so low be he reduce that he blubber over the reflection upon he past fondness for she cub and upon he present doubt of they be he : ` what a damn would thing be it belford if tom and hal should be the hostler dog 's puppy and not mine ' very true and i think the strong health of the chubby-faced muscular whelp confirm the too great probability but i say not so to he you he say be such a gay lively mortal that this sad tale would make no impression upon you : especially now that you whole heart be engage as it be mowbray would be too violent upon it : he have not he say a feeling heart tourville have no discretion : and a pretty jest although he and he thomasine live without reputation in the world -lrb- people guess that they be not marry notwithstanding she go by he name -rrb- yet ` he would not too much discredit the cursed ingrate neither ' could a man act a weaker part have he be really marry and be he sure he be go to separate from the mother of he own child i leave this as a lesson upon thy heart without make any application : only with this remark ` that after we libertine have indulge we licentious appetite reflect -lrb- in the conceit of we vain heart -rrb- both with we lip and by we life upon we ancestor and the good old way we find out when we come to year of discretion if we live till then -lrb- what all who know we find out before that be to say we find out -rrb- we own despicable folly that those good old way would have be best for we as well as for the rest of the world and that in every step we have deviate from they we have only expose we vanity and we ignorance at the same time ' j belford letter xxxix mr lovelace to john belford esq Saturday may 20 i be please with the sober reflection with which thou concludest thy last and i thank thee for it poor belton -- i do not think he thomasine would have prove so very a devil but this must everlastingly be the risk of a keeper who take up with a low-bred girl this i never do nor have i occasion to do it such a one as i jack need only till now to shake the stateliest tree and the mellow fruit dropt into my mouth : -- always of montaigne 's taste thou knowest : -- think it a glory to subdue a girl of family -- more truly delightful to I the seduction - progress than the crown act : for that be a vapor a bubble and most cordially do i thank thee for thy indirect hint that i be right in my pursuit from such a woman as miss harlowe a man be secure from all the inconveniency thou expatiatest upon once more therefore do i thank thee belford for thy approbation -- a man need not as thou sayest sneak into hole and corner and shun the day in the company of such a woman as this how friendly in thee thus to abet the favorite purpose of my heart -- nor can it be a disgrace to I to permit such a lady to be call by my name -- nor shall i be at all concerned about the world 's censure if i live to the year of discretion which thou mentionest should i be take in and prevail upon to tread with she the good old path of my ancestor a blessing on thy heart thou honest fellow i think thou wert in jest and but acquit thyself of a engagement to lord m when thou wert plead for matrimony in behalf of this lady -- it could not be principle i know in thee : it could not be compassion -- a little envy indeed i suspect -- but now i see thee once more thyself : and once more say i a blessing on thy heart thou true friend and very honest fellow now will i proceed with courage in all my scheme and oblige thee with the continue

afternoon which have set she heart at ease with respect to several doubtful point such as particularly ` mrs fretchville 's unhappy state of mind -- most humanely pity by miss martin who know she very well -- the husband she have lose and herself -lrb- as sally say -rrb- lover from they cradle pity from one beget pity from another be the occasion for it either strong or weak and so many

hindrance from visit my spouse lady betty and miss montague soon expect in town ` my earnest desire signify to have my spouse receive those lady in she own house if mr fretchville would but know she

this to see if i be to be deny every favor -- yet for my own part i love not tragedy though she do for the sake of the instruction the warning and the example generally give in they ' i have too much feeling i say there be enough in the world to make we heart sad without carry grief in we diversion and make the distress of other we own ' true enough belford and i believe generally speak that all the man of we cast be of my mind -- they love not any tragedy but those in which they themselves act the part of tyrant and executioner and afraid to trust themselves with serious and solemn reflection run to comedy in order to laugh away compunction on the distress they have occasion and to find example of man as immoral as themselves for very few of we comic performance as thou knowest give we good one -- i answer however for myself -- yet thou i think on recollection lovest to deal in the lamentable sally answer for polly who be absent mr sinclair for herself and for all she acquaintance even for miss partington in prefer the comic to the tragic scene -- and i believe they be right for the devil 's in it if a confided-in rake do not give a girl enough of tragedy in he

hand near as long as himself and proportionately thick ` no question ask by this fellow must be answer they should call I to he but not let my beloved know a tittle of this so long as it could be help and i add that if she brother or singleton come and if they behave civilly i would for she sake be civil to they : and in this case she have nothing to do but to own she marriage and there could be no pretence for violence on either side but most fervently i swear that if she be convey away either by persuasion or force i would directly on miss she but one day go to demand she at harlowe-place

should thus delight in tease a woman i so dearly love i must i doubt have something in my temper like miss howe who love to plague the man who put himself in she power -- but i could not do thus by

music and perhaps a collation afterwards co-operating indeed i have no hope of such a effect here but i have more than one end to answer by get she to a play to name but one -- dorca have a master-key as i have tell thee -- but it be worth while to carry she to the play of venice preserve be it but to show she that there have be and may be much deeper distress than she can possibly know thus exceedingly happy be we at present i hope we shall not find any of nat lee 's left-handed god at work to dash we bowl of joy with wormwood r lovelace letter xli miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe Friday may 19 i would not if i could help it be so continually brood over the dark and gloomy face of my condition -lrb- all nature you know my dear and every thing in it have a bright and a gloomy side -rrb- as to be think unable to enjoy a more hopeful prospect and this not only for my own sake but for yours who take such generous concern in all that befall I let I tell you then my dear that i have know four-and-twenty hour together not unhappy one my situation consider -lrb- she then give the particulars of the conversation which she have overhear between mr lovelace mr sinclair and miss martin but account more minutely than he have do for the opportunity she have of overhear it unknown to they she give the reason she have to be please with what she hear from each : but be shock at the measure he be resolve to take if he miss she but for one day yet be pleased that he propose to avoid aggressive violence if she brother and he meet in town -rrb- even dorca say she appear less exceptionable to I than before and i can not but pity she for she neglect education as it be matter of so much regret to herself : else there would not be much in it as the low and illiterate be the most useful people in the common-wealth -lrb- since such constitute the labor part of the public -rrb- and as a lettered education but too generally set people above those servile office by which the business of the world be carry on nor have i any doubt but there be take the world through twenty happy people among the unlettered to one among those who have have a school-education this however conclude not against learn or letter since one would wish to lift to some little distinction and more genteel usefulness those who have capacity and whose parentage one respect or whose service one would wish to reward be my mind quite at ease i could enlarge perhaps not unusefully upon this subject for i have consider it with as much attention as my year and little experience and observation will permit but the extreme illiterateness and indocility of this maid be surprising consider that she want not inquisitiveness appear willing to learn and in other respects have quick part this confirm to I what i have hear remark that there be a docible season a learning-time as i may say for every person in which the mind may be lead step by step from the lower to the higher -lrb- year by year -rrb- to improvement how industriously ought these season as they offer to be take hold of by tutor parent and other friend to whom the cultivation of the genius of child and youth be commit since once elapse and no foundation lay they hardly ever return -- and yet it must be confess that there be some genius which like some fruit ripen not till late and industry and perseverance will do prodigious thing -- but for a learner to have those first rudiment to master at twenty year of age suppose which other be teach and they themselves might have attain at ten what a uphill labor these kind of observation you have always wish I to intersperse as they arise to my thought but it be a sign that my prospects be a little mended or i should not among so many more interesting one that my mind have be of late fill with have have heart 's ease enough to make they let I give you my reflection on my more hopeful prospects i be now in the first place better able to account for the delay about the house than i be before -- poor mr fretchville -- though i know she not i pity she -- next it look well that he have apprize the woman -lrb- before this conversation with they of he intention to stay in this house after i be remove to the other by the tone of he voice he seem concern for the appearance of this new delay would have with I so handsomely do miss martin express herself of I that i be sorry methink that i judge so hardly of she when i first come hither -- free people may go a great way but not all the way : and as such be generally unguarded precipitate and thoughtless the same quickness changeableness and suddenness of spirit as i may call it may intervene -lrb- if the heart be not corrupt -rrb- to recover they to think and duty he reason for decline to go in person to bring up the lady of he family while my brother and singleton continue they machination carry no bad face with it and one may the rather allow for they expectation that so proud a spirit as he should attend they for this purpose as he speak of they sometimes as person of punctilio other reason i will mention for my be easier in my mind than i be before i overheard this conversation such as the advice he have receive in relation to singleton 's mate which agree but too well with what you my dear write to I in you 's of may the 10th \* \* see letter xxiii of this volume he not intend to acquaint I with it he caution to the servant about the sailor if he should come and make inquiry about we he resolution to avoid violence be he to fall in either with my brother or this singleton and the easy method he have chalk out in this case to prevent mischief since i need only not to deny my be he but yet i should be drive into such a tacit acknowledgement to any new person till i be so although i have be lead -lrb- so much against my liking -rrb- to give countenance to the belief of the person below that we be married i think myself oblige from what pass between mr lovelace and I on Wednesday and from what i overhear he say to consent to go with he to the play and the rather as he have the discretion to propose one of the niece to accompany I i can not but acknowledge that i be pleased to find that he have actually write to lord m i have promise to give mr lovelace a answer to he proposal as soon as i have hear from you my dear on the subject i hope that in my next letter i shall have reason to confirm these favourable appearance favourable i must think they in the wreck i have suffer i hope that in the trial which you hint may happen between I and myself -lrb- as you \* express it -rrb- if he should so behave as to oblige I to leave he i shall be able to act in such a manner as to bring no discredit upon myself in you eye and that be all now that i have to wish for but if i value he so much as you be pleased to suppose i do the trial which you imagine will be so difficult to I will not i conceive be upon get from he when the means to affect my escape be lend I but how i shall behave when get from he and if like the israelite of old i shall be so weak as to wish to return to my egyptian bondage \* see letter xxxiv of this volume i think it will not be amiss notwithstanding the present favourable appearance that you should perfect the scheme -lrb- whatever it be -rrb- which you tell I \* you have think of in order to procure for I a asylum in case of necessity mr lovelace be certainly a deep and dangerous man and it be therefore but prudence to be watchful and to be provide against the worst lord bless I my dear how i be reduce -- could i ever have think to be in such a situation as to be oblige to stay with a man of whose honor by I i could have but the shadow of a doubt -- but i will look forward and hope the best \* ibid i be certain that you letter be safe be perfectly easy therefore on that head mr lovelace will never be out of my company by he good will otherwise i have no doubt that i be mistress of my goings-out and comings-in and do i think it needful and be i not afraid of my brother and captain singleton i would oftener put it to trial letter xlii miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe Saturday may 20 i do not know my dear that you defer give a answer to mr lovelace 's proposal till you have my opinion of they a particular hand occasionally go to town will leave this at wilson 's that no delay may be make

answer for she have condescend to answer he -- with a denial however but such a denial as no one but a old bachelor would take from a widow any body except myself who could have be acquaint with such a fal-lal courtship as this must have be have it proceed would have be glad it have go on : and i dare say but for the saucy daughter it have my good mamma in that case would have be ten year the younger for it perhaps : and could i but have approve of it i should have be consider by she as if ten year older than i be : since very likely it would have be : ` we widow my dear know not how to keep man at a distance -- so as to give they pain in order to try they love -- you must advise I child : you must teach I to be cruel -- yet not too cruel neither -- so as to make a man heartless who have no time god wot to throw away ' -- then would my behavior to mr hickman have be better like and my mother would have bridle like she daughter o my dear how might we have be divert by the practising for the recovery of the long forgotten could i have be sure that it would have be in my power to have put they asunder in the irish style before they have come together but there be no trust to the widow whose goods and chattel be in she own hand address by a old bachelor who have fine thing and offer to leave she ten thousand pound better than he find she and sole mistress besides of all she notable for these as you will see by-and-by be he proposal the old triton 's address carry the writer 's mark upon the very subscription -- to the equally amiable and worthy admire -lrb- there be for you -rrb- mr anabellum howe widow the last word add i suppose as esquire to a man as a word of honor or for fear the bellum to anna should not enough distinguish the person mean from the spinster : -lrb- vain hussy you 'll call I i know : -rrb- and then follow -- these humbly present -- put down as a memorandum i presume to make a leg and behave handsomely at present it he intend very probably to deliver it himself and now stand by -- to see enter old neptune he head adorn with sea-weed and a crown of cockle-shell as we see he deck out in mr robinson 's grotto Monday may 15 madam i do make a sort of resolution ten year ago never to marry i saw in other family where they live best you will be please to mark that queerness i could not away with then like well enough to live single for the sake of my brother 's family and for one child in it more than the rest but that girl have turn we all off the hinge : and why should i deny myself any comfort for they as will not thank I for so do i do not know so much for my motive as from self and family : but the dear mr howe make I go farther i have a very great fortune i bless god for it all of my own get or most of it you will be please to mark that for i be the youngest brother of three you have also god be thank a great estate which you have improve by you own frugality and wise management frugality let I stop to say be one of the greatest virtue in this mortal life because it enable we to do justice to all and put it in we power to benefit some by it as we see they deserve you have but one child and i be a bachelor and have never a one -- all bachelor can not say so : wherefore you daughter may be the better for I if she will keep up with my humor which be never think bad : especially to my equal servant indeed i do not matter be angry with when i please they be pay for bear it and too-too often deserve it as we have frequently take notice of to one another and moreover if we keep not servant at distance they will be familiar i always make it a rule to find fault whether reasonable or not that so i might have no reason to find fault young woman and servant in general -lrb- as worthy mr solme observe -rrb- be better govern by fear than love but this my humor as to servant will not effect either you or miss you know i will make very advantageous settlement such as any common friend shall judge to be so but must have all in my own power while i live : because you know madam it be as creditable to the wife as to the husband that it should be so i be not at fine word we be not child though it be hope we may have some for i be a very healthy sound man i bless god for it : and never bring home from my voyage and travel a worser constitution than i take out with I i be none of those i will assure you but this i will undertake that if you be the survivor you shall be at the least ten thousand pound the better for I what in the contrary case i shall be the better for you i leave to you as you shall think my kindness to you shall deserve but one thing madam i shall be glad of that miss howe might not live with we then -- -lrb- she need not know i write thus -rrb- -- but go home to mr hickman as she be upon the point of marriage i hear : and if she behave dutifully as she should do to we both she shall be the better for i say so before you shall manage all thing both mine and you own for i know but little of land-matter all my opposition to you shall be out of love when i think you take too much upon you for you health it will be very pretty for you i should think to have a man of experience in a long winter 's evening to sit down by you and tell you story of foreign part and the custom of the nation he have consort with and i have fine curiosity of the indian growth such as lady love and some that even my niece clary when she be good never see these one by one as you be kind to I -lrb- which i make no question of because i shall be kind to you -rrb- shall be all yours prettier entertainment by much than sit with a too smartish daughter sometimes out of humor and thwart and vex as daughter will -lrb- when women-grown especially as i have hear you often observe -rrb- and think they parent old without pay they the reverence due to year when as in you case i make no sort of doubt they be young enough to wipe they nose you understand I madam as for I myself it will be very happy and i be delighted with the thinking of it to have after a pleasant ride or so a lady of like experience with myself to come home to and but one interest betwixt we : to reckon up we comings-in together and what this day and this week have produce -- o how this will increase love -- most mightily will it increase it -- and i believe i shall never love you enough or be able to show you all my love i hope madam there need not be such maiden nicety and hangings-off as i may call they between we -lrb- for hanging-off sake -rrb- as that you will deny I a line or two to this proposal write down although you would not answer I so readily when i speak to you you daughter be i suppose hard by for you look round you as if not willing to be overhear so i resolve to write : that my writing may stand as upon record for my upright meaning be none of you lovelace you will mark that madam but a downright true honest faithful englishman so hope you will not disdain to write a line or two to this my proposal : and i shall look upon it as a great honor i will assure you and be proud thereof what can i say more -- for you be you own mistress as i be my own master : and you shall always be you own mistress be please to mark that for so a lady of you prudence and experience ought to be this be a long letter but the subject require it because i would not write twice where once would do so would explain my sense and meaning at one time i have have write in my head two whole month very near but hardly know how -lrb- be unpracticed in these matter -rrb- to begin to write and now good lady be favourable to you most humble lover and obedient servant ant harlowe \*\*\* here be a letter of courtship my dear -- and let I subjoin to it that if now or hereafter i should treat this hideous lover who be so free with I to my mother with asperity and you should be disgust at it i shall think you do not give I that preference in you love which you have in mine and now which shall i first give you the answer of my good mamma or the dialogue that pass between the widow mother and the pert daughter upon she let the latter know that she have a love-letter i think you shall have the dialogue but let I promise one thing that if you think I too free you must not let it run in you head that i be write of you uncle or of my mother but of a couple of old lover no matter whom

harlowe -- but pray excuse I m you have put I quite out with you forward temper -lrb- angrily sit down again -rrb- d i will be all patience and attention may i be allow to read he letter m i want to advise with you upon it -- but you be such a strange creature -- you be always for answer one before one speak d you 'll be so good as to forgive I madam -- but i think every body -lrb- he among the rest -rrb- know that you have always declare against a second marriage m and so i have but then it be in the mind i be in thing may offer -- i stare m nay do not be surprise -- i do not intend -- i do not intend -- d not perhaps in the mind you be in madam m pert creature -lrb- rise again -rrb- -- we shall quarrel i see -- there be no -- d once more dear madam i beg you excuse i will attend in

bad against you intimation on the contrary that you shall be the better for he if you oblige he not a living soul but the harlowe i say think I ill-tempered : and i be contented that they should who could do as they have do by the most universally acknowledge sweetness in the world here we break out a little but at last she read I some of the passage in the letter but not the most mightily ridiculous : yet i could hardly keep my countenance neither especially when she come to that passage which mention he sound health and at which she stop she best know why -- but soon resume : m well now nancy tell I what you think of it d nay pray madam tell I what you think of it m i expect to be answer by a answer not by a question you do not use to be so shy to speak you mind d not when my mamma command I to do so m then speak it now d without hear the whole of the letter m speak to what you have hear d why then madam -- you will not be my mamma howe if you give way to it m i be

either write too much nonsense or too little but do you call this odd soul 's letter -lrb- no more will i call he old soul if i can help it -rrb- a love-letter m well well i see you be averse to this matter i be not to be you mother you will live single if i marry i have a mind to see if generosity govern you in you view i shall pursue my own inclination and if they should happen to be suitable to yours pray let I for the future be better reward by you than hitherto i have be and away she fling without stay for a reply -- vex i dare say that i do not better approve of the proposal -- be it only that the merit of deny might have be all she own and to lay the stronger obligation upon she saucy daughter she write such a widow-like refusal when she go from I as might not exclude hope in any other wooer whatever it may do in mr tony harlowe it will be my part to take care to beat she off the visit she half - promise to make he -lrb- as you will see in she answer -rrb- upon condition that he will withdraw he suit for who know what effect the old bachelor 's exotic -lrb- far-fetched and dear-bought you know be a proverb -rrb- might otherwise have upon a woman 's mind want nothing but unnecessary gewgaw and finery and offer such as be not easily to be meet with or purchase well but now i give you leave to read here in this place the copy of my mother 's answer to you uncle 's letter not one comment will i make upon it i know my duty better and here therefore take the liberty to hope that i may in you present less disagreeable though not wholly agreeable situation provoke a smile from you i conclude myself you ever affectionate and faithful anna howe mr annabella howe to antony harly esq mr antony harlowe Friday may 19 sir it be not usual i believe for we sex to answer by pen and ink the first letter on these occasion the first letter how odd be that as if i expect another which i do not but then i think as i do not judge proper to encourage you proposal there be no reason why i should not answer in civility where so great a civility be intend indeed i be always of opinion that a person be entitle to that and not to ill usage because he have a respect for I and so i have often and often tell my daughter a woman i think make but a poor figure in a man 's eye afterwards and do no reputation to she sex neither when she behave like a tyrant to he beforehand to be sure sir if i be to change my condition i know not a gentleman whose proposal could be more agreeable you nephew and you niece have enough without you : my daughter have a fine fortune without I and i should take care to double it live or die be i to do such a thing : so nobody need to be the worse for it but nancy would not think so all the comfort i know of in child be that when young they do with we what they will and all be pretty in they to they very fault and when they be grow up they think they parent must live for they only and deny themselves every thing for they sake i know nancy could not bear a father-in-law she would fly at the very think of my be in earnest to give she one not that i stand in fear of my daughter neither it be not fit i should but she have she poor papa 's spirit a very violent one that be and one would not choose you know sir to enter into any affair that one know one must renounce a daughter for or she a mother -- except indeed one 's heart be much in it which i bless god mine be not i have now be a widow these ten year nobody to controul I : and i be say not to bear controul : so sir you and i be best as we be i believe : nay i be sure of it : for we want not what either have have both more than we know what to do with and i know i could not be in the least accountable for any of my way my daughter indeed though she be a fine girl as girl go -lrb- she have too much sense indeed for one of she sex and know she have it -rrb- be more a check to I than one would wish a daughter to be : for who would choose to be always snap at each other but she will soon be marry and then not live together we shall only come together when we be pleased and stay away when we be not and so like other lover never see any thing but the best side of each other i own for all this that i love she dearly and she I i dare say : so would not wish to provoke she to do otherwise besides the girl be so much regard every where that have live so much of my prime a widow i would not lay myself open to she censure or even to she indifference you know you generous proposal require all this explicitness i thank you for you good opinion of I when i know you acquiesce with this my civil refusal -lrb- and indeed sir i be as much in earnest in it as if i have speak broader -rrb- i do not know but nancy and i may with you permission come to see you fine thing for i be a great admirer of rarity that come from abroad so sir let we only converse occasionally as we meet as we use to do without any other view to each other than good wish : which i hope may not be lessen for this decline and then i shall always think myself you obliged servant annabellum howe p i send word by mr lorimer that i would write a answer : but would take time for consideration so hope sir you will not think it a slight i do not write sooner letter xliv mr lovelace to john belford esq Sunday may 21 i be too much disturb in my mind to think of any thing but

redness remain upon it still do you not think my dear that i have reason to be incense at he my situation consider be i not under a necessity as it be of quarrel with he at least every other time i see he no prudery no coquetry no tyranny in my heart or in my behavior to he that i know of no affected procrastination aim at nothing but decorum he as much concerned and so he ought to think as i to have that observe too much in he power : cast upon he by the cruelty of my relation no other protection to fly to but he one plain path before we yet such embarrass such difficulty such subject for doubt for cavil for uneasiness as fast as one be obviate another to be introduce and not by myself -- know not how introduce -- what pleasure can i propose to myself in meet such a wretch perfect for I my dearest miss howe perfect for I i beseech you you kind scheme with mr townsend and i will then leave this man my temper i believe be change no wonder if it be i question whether ever it will be what it be but i can not make he half so uneasy by the change as i be myself see you not how from step to step he grow upon I -- i tremble to look back upon he encroachment and now to give I cause to apprehend more evil from he than indignation will permit I to express -- o my dear perfect you scheme and let I fly from so strange a wretch yet to be first a eloper from my friend to he as the world suppose and now to be so from he -lrb- to whom i know not -rrb- how hard to one who ever endeavor to shun intricate path but he must certainly have view in quarrel with I thus which he dare not own -- yet what can they be -- i be terrify but to think of what they may be let I but get from he -- as to my reputation if i leave he -- that be already too much wound for I now to be careful about any thing but how to act so as that my own heart shall not reproach I as to the world 's censure i must be content to suffer that -- a unhappy composition however -- what a wreck have my fortune suffer to be oblige to throw overboard so many valuable to preserve indeed the only valuable -- a composition that once it would have half broken my heart to think there would have be the least danger that i should be oblige to submit to you my dear could not be a stranger to my most secret failing although you would not tell I of they what a pride do i take in the applause of every one -- what a pride even in suppose i have not that pride -- which conceal itself from my unexamining heart under the specious veil of humility double the merit to myself by the suppose and indeed imputed gracefulness in the manner of confer benefit when i have not a single merit in what i do vastly overpay by the pleasure of do some little good and impel as i may say by talent give I -- for what -- not to be proud of so desirous in short to be consider as a example a vanity which my partial admirer put into my head -- and so secure in my own virtue i be punish enough enough mortify for this my vanity -- i hope enough if it so please the all-gracious inflictor : since now i verily think i more despise myself for my presumptuous self-security as well as vanity than ever i secretly vaunted myself on my good inclination : secretly i say however for indeed i have not give myself leisure to reflect till i be thus mortified how very imperfect i be nor how much truth there be in what divine tell we that we sin in we best performance but i be very young -- but here let I watch over myself again : for in those four word i be very young be there not a palliation couch that be enough to take all efficacy from the discovery and confession what strange imperfect being -- but self here which be at the bottom of all we do and of all we wish be the grand misleader i will not apologize to you my dear for these grave reflection be it not enough to make the unhappy creature look into herself and endeavor to detect herself who from such a high reputation leave to proud and presumptuous self should by one thoughtless step be bring to the dreadful situation i be in let I however look forward : to despond would be to add sin to sin and whom have i to raise I up whom to comfort I if i desert myself -- thou o father who i hope hast not yet desert hast not yet curse I -- for i be thine -- it be fit that mediation should supply the rest -- \*\*\* i be so disgusted with he as well as fright by he that on my return to my chamber in a fit of passionate despair i tear almost in two the answer i have write to he proposal i will see he in the morning because i promise i would but i will go out and that without he or any attendant if he account not tolerably for he sudden change of behavior and a proper opportunity offer of a private lodging in some creditable house i will not any more return to this : -- at present i think so -- and there will i either attend the perfecting of you scheme or by you epistolary mediation make my own term with the wretch since it be you opinion that i must be he and can not help myself : or perhaps take a resolution to throw myself at once into lady betty 's protection and this will hinder he from make he insolently-threatened visit to harlowe-place -lrb- the

about he but when it come to phoebus 's turn he so play upon the traveller with he beam that he make he first unbutton and then throw it quite off : -- nor leave he till he oblige he to take to the friendly shade of a spreading beech where prostrate himself on the thrown-off cloak he take a comfortable nap the victor-god then laugh outright both at borea and the traveller and pursue he radiant course shine upon and warming and cherish a thousand new object as he dance along : and at night when he put up he fiery courser he divert he theti with the relation of he prank in the pass day i in like manner will discard all my boisterous invention : and if i can oblige my sweet traveller to throw aside but for one moment the cloak of she rigid virtue i shall have nothing to do but like the

delay on she account she now wish with all she heart that she have know she own mind and go into the country at first when i treat about the house this evil then have not happen a cursed cross accident for we too -- heigh-ho nothing else i think in this mortal life people need not study to bring cross upon themselves by they petulancy so this affair of the house will be over at least for

my father 's temper mr lovelace : but the worst that he ever show after marriage be not in the least to be compare to what you have show twenty time beforehand -- and what be my prospects with you at

how to wish you mine -- give I hope dearest creature give I but hope that i be you preferable choice -- give I but hope that you hate I not : that you do not despise I o mr lovelace we have be long enough together to be tire of each other 's humor and way way and humor so different that perhaps you ought to dislike I as much as i do you -- i think i think that i can not make a answerable return to the value you profess for I my temper be utterly ruin you have give I a ill opinion of all mankind of yourself in particular : and withal so bad a one of myself that i shall never be able to look up have utterly and for ever lose all that self-complacency and conscious pride which be so necessary to carry a woman through this life with tolerable satisfaction to herself she pause i be silent by my soul think i this sweet creature will at last undo I she proceed : what now remain but that you pronounce I free of all obligation to you and that you hinder I not from pursue the destiny that shall be allot I again she pause i be still silent meditate whether to renounce all further design upon she whether i have not receive sufficient evidence of a virtue and of a greatness of soul that could not be question or impeach she go on : propitious to I be you silence mr lovelace -- tell I that i be free of all obligation to you you know i never make you promise you know that you be not

actually in treaty for equipage equipage sir -- trappings tinsel -- what be equipage what be life what be any thing to a creature sink so low as i be in my own opinion -- labor under a father 's curse -- unable to look backward without self - reproach or forward without terror -- these reflection strengthen by every cross accident -- and what but cross accident befall I -- all my darling scheme dash in piece all my hope at a end deny I not the liberty to refuge myself in some obscure corner where neither the enemy you have make I nor the few friend you have leave I may ever hear of the suppose rash-one till those happy moment be at hand which shall expiate for all i have not a word to say for myself such a war in my mind have i never know gratitude and admiration of the excellent creature before I combate with villanous habit with resolution so premeditatedly make and with view so much glory in -- a hundred new contrivance in my head and in my heart that to be honest as it be call must all be give up by a heart delighting in intrigue and difficulty -- miss howe 's virulence endeavor to be recollect -- yet recollection refuse to bring they forward with the requisite efficacy -- i have certainly be a lose man have not dorca come seasonably in with a letter -- on the superscription write -- be pleased sir to open it now i retire to the window -- open it -- it be from dorca herself -- these the contents -- ` be please to detain my lady : a paper of importance to transcribe i will cough when i have do ' i put the paper in my pocket and turn to my charmer less disconcerted as she by that time have also a little recovered herself -- one favor dearest creature -- let I but know whether miss howe approve or disapprove of my proposal i know she to be my enemy i be intend to account to you for the change of behavior you accuse I of at the beginning of the conversation but be divert from it by you vehemence indeed my beloved creature you be very vehement do you think it must not be matter of high regret to I to find my wish so often delay and postpone in favor of you predominant view to a reconciliation with relation who will not be reconcile to you -- to this be owe you decline to celebrate we nuptials before we come to town though you be so atrociously treat by you sister and you whole family and though so ardently press to celebrate by I -- to this be owe the ready offence you take at my four friend and at the unavailing attempt i make to see a dropt letter little imagine from what two such lady could write to each other that there could be room for mortal displeasure -- to this be owe the week 's distance you hold I at till you know the issue of another application -- but when they have reject that when you have send my cold-received proposal to miss howe for she approbation or advice as indeed i advise and have honor I with you company at the play on Saturday night -lrb- my whole behavior unobjectionable to the last hour -rrb- must not madam the sudden change in you conduct the very next morning astonish and distress I -- and this persist in with still stronger declaration after you have receive the impatiently-expected letter from miss howe must i not conclude that all be owe to she influence and that some other application or project be meditate that make it necessary to keep I again at a distance till the result be know and which be to deprive I of you for ever for be not that you constantly-proposed preliminary -- well madam might i be work up to a half-phrensy by this apprehension and well might i charge you with hate I -- and now dearest creature let I know i once more ask you what be miss howe 's opinion of my proposal be i dispose to debate with you mr lovelace i could very easily answer you fine harangue but at present i shall only say that you way have be very unaccountable you seem to I if you meaning be always just to have take great pain to embarrass they whether owe in you to the want of a clear head or a sound heart i can not determine but it be to the want of one of they i verily think that i be to ascribe the greatest part of you strange conduct curse upon the heart of the little devil say i who instigate you to think so hardly of the faithfullest heart in the world how dare you sir and there she stopt have almost overshot herself as i design she should how dare i what madam and i look with mean how dare i what vile man -- and do you -- and there again she stopt do i what madam -- and why vile man how dare you curse any body in my presence o the sweet receder but that be not to go off so with a lovelace why then dearest creature be there any body that instigate you -- if there be again i curse they be they whom they will she be in a charming pretty passion and this be the first time that i have the odds in my favor well madam it be just as i think and now i know how to account for a temper that i hope be not natural to you artful wretch and be it thus you would entrap I but know sir that i receive letter from nobody but miss howe miss howe like some of you way as little as i do for i have set every thing before she yet she be thus far you enemy as she be mine she think i could not refuse you offer but endeavor to make the best of my lot and now you have the truth would to heaven you be capable of deal with equal sincerity i be madam and here on my knee i renew my vow and my supplication that you will make I you 's you 's for ever and let I have cause to bless you and miss howe in the same breath to say the truth belford i have before begin to think that the vixen of a girl who certainly like not hickman be in love with I rise sir from you too-ready knee and mock I not too-ready knee think i though this humble posture so little affect this proud beauty she know not how much i have obtain of other of she sex nor how often i have be forgive for the last attempt by kneel mock you madam and i arise and re-urge she for the day i blame myself at the same time for the invitation i have give to lord m as it might subject I to delay from he infirmity : but tell she that i would write to he to excuse I if she have no objection or to give he the day she would give I and not wait for he if he could not come in time my day sir say she be never be not surprise a person of politeness judge between we would not be surprise that i say so but indeed mr lovelace -lrb- and weep through impatience -rrb- you either know not how to treat with a mind of the least degree of delicacy notwithstanding you birth and education or you be a ungrateful man and -lrb- after a pause -rrb- a worse than ungrateful one but i will retire i will see you again to-morrow i can not before i think i hate you and if upon a re-examination of my own heart i find i do i would not for the world that matter should go on farther between we but i see i see she do not hate I how it would mortify my vanity if i think there be a woman in the world much more this that could hate I ` tis evident villain as she think I that i should not be a odious villain if i could but at last in one instance cease to be a villain she could not hold it determine as she have think herself i saw by she eye the moment i endeavor to dissipate she apprehension on my too-ready knee as she call they the moment the rough cover my teasing behavior have throw over she affection be quite remove i doubt not to find all silk and silver at the bottom all soft bright and charming i be however too much vexed disconcerted mortified to hinder she from retire and yet she have not go if dorca have not cough the wench come in as soon as she lady have retire and give I the copy she have take and what should it be but of the answer the truly admirable creature have intend to give to my write proposal in relation to settlement i have but just dipt my pen into this affect paper be i to read it attentively not a wink should i sleep this night to-morrow it shall obtain my serious consideration letter xlviii mr lovelace to john belford esq Tuesday morning may 23 the dear creature desire to be excuse see I till evening she be not very well as dorca tell I read here if thou wilt the paper transcribe by dorca it be impossible that i should proceed with my project against this admirable woman be it not that i be resolve after a few trial more if as nobly sustain as those she have pass through to make she -lrb- if she really hate I not -rrb- legally mine to mr lovelace ` when a woman be marry that supreme earthly obligation require that in all instance where she husband 's real honor be concerned she should yield she own will to he but beforehand i could be glad conformably to what i have always signify to have the most explicit assurance that every possible way should be try to avoid litigation with my father time and patience will subdue all thing my prospects of happiness be extremely contract a husband 's right will be always the same in my lifetime i could wish nothing to be do of this sort you circumstance sir will not oblige you to extort violently from he what be in he hand all that depend upon I either with regard to my person to my diversion or to the economy that no married woman of whatever rank or quality should be above inspect shall be do to prevent a necessity for such measure be take and if there will be no necessity for they it be to be hope that motive less excusable will not have force -- motive which must be found in a littleness of mind which a woman who have not that littleness of mind will be under such temptation as she duty will hardly be able at all time to check to despise she husband for have especially in case where she own family so much a part of herself and which will have obligation upon she -lrb- though then but secondary one -rrb- from which she can never be free be intimately concerned ` this article then i urge to you most serious consideration as what lie next my heart i enter not here minutely into the fatal misunderstanding between they and you : the fault may be in both but sir you 's be the foundation-fault : at least you give a too-plausible pretence for my brother 's antipathy to work upon condescension be no part of you study you choose to bear the imputation lay to you charge rather than to make it you endeavor to obviate they ` but this may lead into hateful recrimination -- let it be remember i will only say in this place that in they eye you have rob they of a daughter they doat upon and that they resentment on this occasion rise but in proportion to they love and they disappointment if they be faulty in some of the measure they take while they themselves do not think so who shall judge for they you sir who will judge every body as you please and will let nobody judge you in you own particular must not be they judge -- it may therefore be expect that they will stand out ` as for myself sir i must leave it -lrb- so seem it to be destine -rrb- to you justice to treat I as you shall think i deserve : but if you future behavior to they be not govern by that harsh-sounding implacableness which you charge upon some of they temper the splendor of you family and the excellent character of some of they -lrb- of all indeed unless you own conscience furnish you with one only exception -rrb- will on better consideration do every thing with they : for they may be overcome perhaps however with the more difficulty as the greatly prosperous less bear controul and disappointment than other : for i will own to you that i have often in secret lament that they great acquirement have be a snare to they perhaps as great a snare as some other accidental have be to you which be less immediately you own gift you have still less reason than they to value yourself upon they ` let I only on this subject further observe that condescension be not meanness there be a glory in yield that hardly any violent spirit can judge of my brother perhaps be no more sensible of this than you but as you have talent which he have not -lrb- who however have as i hope that regard for moral the want of which make one of he objection to you -rrb- i could wish it may not be owe to you that you mutual dislike to each other do not subside for it be my earnest hope that in time you may see each other without exciting the fear of a wife and a sister for the consequence not that i should wish you to yield in point that truly concern you honor : no sir i would be as delicate in such as you yourself : more delicate i will venture to say because more uniformly so how vain how contemptible be that pride which show itself in stand upon diminutive observance and give up and make a jest of the most important duty ` this article be consider as i wish all the rest will be easy be i to accept of the handsome separate provision you seem to intend I add to the considerate sum arise from my grandfather 's estate since he death -lrb- more considerable than perhaps you may suppose from you offer -rrb- i should think it my duty to lay up for the family good and for unforseen event out of it : for as to my donation i would generally confine myself in they to the tenth of my income be it what it would i aim at no glare in what i do of that sort all i wish for be the power of relieve the lame the blind the sick and the industrious poor and those whom accident have make so or sudden distress reduce the common or breed beggar i leave to other and to the public provision they can not be lower : perhaps they wish not to be higher : and not able to do for every one i aim not at work of supererogation two hundred pound a year would do all i wish to do of the separate sort : for all above i would content myself to ask you except mistrust you own economy you would give up to my management and keep in order to provide for future contingency a larger portion for which as you steward i would regularly account ` as to clothes i have particularly two suit which have be only in a manner try on would answer for any present occasion jewel i have of my grandmother 's which want only new-setting : another set i have which on particular day i use to wear although these be not send I i have no doubt be merely personal but they will when i should send for they in another name : till when i should not choose to wear any ` as to you complaint of my diffidence and the like i appeal to you own heart if it be possible for you to make my case you own for one moment and to retrospect some part of you behavior word and action whether i be not rather to be justified than censure : and whether of all the man in the world avow what you avow you ought not to think so if you do not let I admonish you sir from the very great mismatch that then must appear to be in we mind never to seek nor so much as to wish to bring about the most intimate union of interest between yourself and clarissa harlowe may 20 ' \*\*\* the original of this charming paper as dorca tell I be tear almost in two in one of she pet i suppose what business have the sex whose principal glory be meekness and patience and resignation to be in a passion i trow -- will not she who allow herself such liberty as a maiden take greater when marry and a wife to be in a passion -- let I tell the lady it be a impudent thing beg they pardon and as imprudent as impudent for a wife to be in a passion if she mean not eternal separation or wicked defiance by it : for be it not reject at once all that expostulatory meekness and gentle reasoning mingle with sigh as gentle and grace with bent knee supplicate hand and eye lift up to you imperial countenance just run over that you should make a reconciliation speedy and as lasting as speedy even suppose the husband be in the wrong will not this be so give the greater force to she expostulation now i think of it a man should be in the wrong now-and-then to make he wife shine miss howe tell my charmer that adversity be she shine - time ` tis a generous thing in a man to make he wife shine at he own expense : to give she leave to triumph over he by patient reasoning : for be he to be too imperial to acknowledge he fault on the spot she will find the benefit of she duty and submission in future and in the high opinion he will conceive of she prudence and obligingness -- and so by degree she will become she master 's master but for a wife to come up with kemboed arm the other hand throw out perhaps with a point finger -- look ye here sir -- take notice -- if you be wrong i 'll be wrong -- if you be in a passion i 'll be in a passion -- rebuff for rebuff sir -- if you fly i 'll tear -- if you swear i 'll curse -- and the same room and the same bed shall not hold we sir - for remember i be marry sir -- i be a wife sir -- you can not help yourself sir -- you honor as well as you peace be in my keep and if you like not this treatment you may have worse sir ah jack jack what man who have observe these thing either imply or express in other family would wish to be a husband dorca find this paper in one of the drawer of she lady 's dress - table she be reperus it as she suppose when the honest wench carry my message to desire she to favor I at the tea-table for she see she pop a paper into the drawer as she come in and there on she mistress 's go to meet I in the dining-room she find it and to be this but i have better not to have have a copy of it as far as i know : for determine as i be before upon my operation it instantly turn all my resolution in she favor yet i would give something to be convince that she do not pop it into she drawer before the wench in order for I to see it and perhaps -lrb- if i be to take notice of it -rrb- to discover whether dorca accord to miss howe 's advice be most my friend or she be the very suspicion of this will do she no good : for i can not bear to be artfully deal with people love to enjoy they own peculiar talent in monopoly as argument against I in she behalf but i know every tittle thou canst say upon it spare therefore thy wambling nonsense i desire thee and leave this sweet excellence and I to we fate : that will determine for we as it shall please itself : for as cowley say a unseen hand make all we move : and some be great and some be small some climb to good some from great fortune fall : some wise man and some fool we call : figure alas of speech -- for destiny play we all but after all i be sorry almost sorry -lrb- for how shall i do to be quite sorry when it be not give to I to be so -rrb- that i can not until i have make further trial resolve upon wedlock i have just read over again this intended answer to my proposal : and how i adore she for it but yet another yet -- she have not give it or send it to I -- it be not therefore she answer it be not write for I though to I nay she have not intend to send it to I : she have even tear it perhaps with indignation as think it too good for I by this action she absolutely retract it why then do my foolish fondness seek to establish for she the same merit in my heart as if she avow it pr ` ythee dear belford once more leave we to we fate and do not thou interpose with thy nonsense to weaken a spirit already too squeamish and strengthen a conscience that have declare itself of she party then again remember thy recent discovery lovelace remember she indifference attend with all the appearance of contempt and hatred view she even now wrapt up in reserve and mystery meditate plot as far as thou knowest against the sovereignty thou hast by right of conquest obtain over she remember in short all thou hast threaten to remember against this insolent beauty who be a rebel to the power she have list under but yet how dost thou propose to subdue thy sweet enemy -- abhor be force be the necessity of force if that can be avoid there be no triumph in force -- no conquest over the will -- no prevail by gentle degree over the gentle passion -- force be the devil my cursed character as i have often say be against I at set out -- yet be she not a woman can not i find one yield or but half - yield moment if she do not absolutely hate I but with what can i tempt she -- riches she be bear to and despise know what they be jewel and ornament to a mind so much a jewel and so richly set she worthy consciousness will not let she value love -- if she be susceptible of love it seem to be so much under the direction of prudence that one unguarded moment i fear can not be reasonably hope for : and so much vigilance so much apprehensiveness that she fear be ever aforehand with she danger then she love or virtue seem to be principle native principle or if not native so deeply root that its fiber have strike into she heart and as she grow up so blended and twisted themselves with the string of life that i doubt there be no separate of the one without cut the other asunder what then can be do to make such a matchless creature get over the first test in order to put she to the grand proof whether once overcome she will not be always overcome we mother and she nymph say i be a perfect craven and no lovelace : and so i think but this be no simpering smile charmer as i have find other to be when i have touch upon affect subject at a distance as once or twice i have try to she the mother introduce they -lrb- to make sex palliate the freedom to sex -rrb- when only we three together she be above the affectation of not seem to understand you she show by she displeasure and a fierceness not natural to she eye that she judge of a impure heart by a impure mouth and dart dead at once even the embryo hope of a encroach lover however distantly insinuate before the meaning hint can dawn into double entendre by my faith jack as i sit gaze upon she my whole soul in my eye contemplate she perfection and think when i have see she easy and serene what would be she thought do she know my heart as well as i know it when i behold she disturbed and jealous and think of the justness of she apprehension and that she can not fear so much as there be room for she to fear my heart often misgive I and must think i o creature so divinely excellent and so beloved of my soul those arm those encircle arm that would make a monarch happy be use to repel brutal force all they strength unavailingly perhaps exert to repel it and to defend a person so delicately frame can violence enter into the heart of a wretch who might entitle himself to all she willing yet virtuous love and make the blessing he aspireth after she duty to confer -- begone villain-purpose sink ye all to the hell that could only inspire ye and i be then ready to throw myself at she foot to confess my villainous design to avow my repentance and put it out of my power to act unworthily by such a excellence how then come it that all these compassionate and as some would call they honest sensibility go off -- why miss howe will tell thee : she say i be the devil -- by my conscience i think he have at present a great share in I there be ingenuousness -- how i lay myself open to thee -- but seest thou not that the more i say against myself the less room there be for thee to take I to task -- o belford belford i can not can not -lrb- at least at present -rrb- i can not marry then she family my bitter enemy -- to supple to they or if i do not to make she as unhappy as she can be from my attempt -- then do she not love they too much I too little she now seem to despise I : miss howe declare that she really do despise I to be despise by a wife -- what a thought be that -- to be excel by a wife too in every part of praise-worthy knowledge -- to take lesson to take instruction from a wife -- more than despise I she herself have take time to consider whether she do not hate I : -- i hate you lovelace with my whole heart say she to I but yesterday my soul be above thee man -- urge I not to tell thee how sincerely i think my soul above thee -- how poor indeed be i then even in my own heart -- so visible a superiority to so proud a spirit as mine -- and here from below from below indeed from these woman i be so goad on -- yet ` tis poor too to think myself a machine in the hand of such wretch -- i be no machine -- lovelace thou art base to thyself but to suppose thyself a machine but have go thus far i should be unhappy if after marriage in the petulance of ill humor i have it to reproach myself that i do not try she to the utmost and yet i do not know how it be but this lady the moment i come into she presence half-assimilate I to she own virtue -- once or twice -lrb- to say nothing of she triumph over I on Sunday night -rrb- i be prevail upon to fluster myself with a intention to make some advance which if oblige to recede i might lay upon raise spirit : but the instant i beheld she i be soberize into awe and reverence : and the majesty of she even visible purity first damp and then extinguish my double flame what a surprisingly powerful effect so much and so long in my power she so instigate by some of she own sex and so stimulate by passion i -- how can this be account for in a lovelace but what a heap of stuff have i write -- how have i be run away with -- by what -- canst thou say by what -- o thou lurk varletess conscience -- be it thou that hast thus make I of party against myself -- how camest thou in -- in what disguise thou egregious haunter of my more agreeable hour -- stand thou with fate but neuter in this controversy and if i can not do credit to human nature and to the female sex by bring down such a angel as this to class with and adorn it -lrb- for adorn it she do in she very foible -rrb- then i be all you 's and never will resist you more here i arise i shake myself the window be open always the troublesome bosom-visiter the intruder be fly -- i see it yet -- and now it lessen to my ache eye -- and now the cleft air be close after it and it be out of sight -- and once more i be robert lovelace letter xlix mr lovelace to john belford esq Tuesday may 23 well do i and but just in time to conclude to have do with mr fretchville and the house : for here mennell have declare that he can not in conscience and honor go any farther -- he would not for the world be accessory to the deceive of such a lady -- i be a fool to let either you or he see she for ever since ye have both have scruple which neither would have have be a woman to have be in the question well i can not help it mennell have however though with some reluctance consent to write I a letter provide i will allow it to be the last step he shall take in this affair i presume i tell he that if i could cause mrs fretchville 's woman to supply he place he would have no objection to that none he say -- but be it not pity -- a pitiful fellow such a ridiculous kind of pity he as those silly soul have who would not kill a innocent chicken for the world but when kill to they hand be always the most greedy devourer of it now this letter give the servant the small-pox : and she have give it to she unhappy vapourish lady vapourish people be perpetual subject for disease to work upon name but the malady and it be theirs in a moment ever fit for inoculation -- the physical tribe 's milch-cow -- a vapourish or splenetic patient be a fiddle for the doctor and they be eternally play upon it sweet music do it make they all they difficulty except a case extraordinary happen -lrb- as poor mr fretchville 's who have realize she apprehension -rrb- be but to hold they countenance while they patient be draw up a bill of indictment against himself -- and when they have hear it proceed to punish -- the right word for prescribe why should they not when the criminal have confess he guilt -- and punish they generally do with a vengeance yet silly toad too now i think of it for why when they know they can not do good may they not as well endeavor to gratify as to nauseate the patient 's palate be i a physician i would get all the trade to myself : for malmsey and cyprus and the generous product of the cape a little disguised should be my principal dose : as these would create new spirit how would the revive patient covet the physic and adore the doctor give all the parader of the faculty whom thou knowest this hint -- there could but one inconvenience arise from it the apothecary would find they medicine cost they something : but the demand for quantity would answer that : since the honest nurse would be the patient 's taster perpetually require repetition of the last cordial julap well but to the letter -- yet what need of further explanation after the hint in my former the widow can not be remove and that be enough : and mennell 's work be over and he conscience leave to plague he for he own sin and not another man 's : and very possibly plague enough will give he for those this letter be direct to robert lovelace esq or in he absence to he lady she have refuse dine with I or see I : and i be out when it come she open it : so be my lady by she own consent proud and saucy as she be i be glad at my heart that it come before we entirely make up she would else perhaps have conclude it to be contrived for a delay : and now moreover we can accommodate we old and new quarrel together and that be contrivance you know but how be she dear haughty heart humble to what it be when i know she first that she can apprehend any delay from I and have nothing to do but to vex at they i come in to dinner she send I down the letter desire my excuse for open it -- do it before she be aware lady-pride belford recollection then retrogradation i request to see she upon it that moment -- but she desire to suspend we interview till morning i will bring she to own before i have do with she that she can not see I too often my impatience be so great on a occasion so unexpected that i could not help write to tell she ` how much vexed i be at the accident : but that it need not delay my happy day as that do not depend upon the house -lrb- she know that before she 'll think and so do i -rrb- and as mr fretchville by mr mennell so handsomely express she concern upon it and she wish that it could suit we to bear with the unavoidable delay i hope that go down to the lawn for two or three of the summer - month when i be make the happiest of man would be favourable to all round ' the dear creature take this incident to heart i believe : she have send word to my repeat request to see she notwithstanding she denial that she can not till the morning : it shall be then at six o'clock if i please to be sure i do please can see she but once a day now jack do i tell thee that i write a letter to my cousin montague wonder that i hear not from lord m as the subject be so very interesting in it i acquaint she with the

she usual dignity but when she come to mention mr mennell 's letter she re-urge miss howe to perfect she scheme for she deliverance be resolve to leave he but date again on he send up to she miss montague 's letter she alter she mind and desire she to suspend for the present she application to mr townsend -rrb- i have begin say she to suspect all he have say of mr fretchville and she house and even mr mennell himself though so well-appearing a man but now that i find mr lovelace have apprize he relation of he intent to take it and have engage some of the lady to visit I there i could hardly forbear blame myself for censure he as capable of so vile a imposture but may he not thank himself for act so very unaccountably and take such needlessly-awry step as he have do embarrassing as i tell he he own meaning if they be good letter l mr lovelace to john belford esq Wednesday may 24 -lrb- he give he friend a account of they interview that morning and of the happy effect of he cousin montague 's letter in he favor she reserve however he tell he be not absolutely banish but this he impute to form -rrb- it be not in the power of woman say he to be altogether sincere on these occasion but why -- do they think it so great a disgrace to be find out to be really what they be i regret the illness of mr fretchville as the intention i have to fix she dear self in the house before the happy knot be tie would have set she in that independence in appearance as well as fact which be necessary to show to all the world that she choice be free and as the lady of my family would have be proud to make they court to she there while the settlement and we equipage be prepare but on any other account there be no great matter in it since when my happy day be over we could with so much convenience go down to the lawn to my lord m 's and to lady sarah 's or lady betty 's in turn which would give full time to provide ourselves with servant and other accommodation how sweetly the charmer listen i ask she if she have have the small-pox ten thousand pound the worse in my estimation think i if she have not for no one of she charming grace can i dispense with 'twa always a doubtful point with she mother and mr norton she own but although she be not afraid of it she choose not unnecessarily to rush into place where it be right thought i -- else i say it would not have be amiss for she to see the house before she go into the country for if she like it not i be not oblige to have it she ask if she might take a copy of miss montague 's letter i say she might keep the letter itself and send it to miss howe if she please for that i suppose be she intention she bow she head to I there jack i shall have she courtesy to I by-and-by i question not what a-devil have i to do to terrify the sweet creature by my termagant project -- yet it be not amiss i believe to make she afraid of I she say i be a unpolite man and every polite instance from such a one be deem a favor talking of the settlement i tell she i have rather that pritchard -lrb- mention by my cousin charlotte -rrb- have not be consult on this occasion pritchard indeed be a very honest man and have be for a generation in the family and know of the estate and the condition of they better than either my lord or myself : but pritchard like other old man be diffident and slow and value himself upon he skill as a draughts-man and for the sake of the paltry reputation must have all he form preserve be a imperial crown to depend upon he dispatch i kiss she unrepulsing hand no less than five time during this conversation lord jack how my generous heart run over -- she be quite oblige at parting -- she in a manner ask I leave to retire to reperuse charlotte 's letter -- i think she bent she knee to I but i will not be sure -- how happy might we both have be long ago have the dear creature be always as complaisant to I for i do love respect and whether i deserve it or not always have it till i know this proud beauty and now belford be we in a train or the deuce be in it every fortified town have its strong and its weak place i have carry on my attack against the impregnable part i have not doubt but i shall either shine or smuggle she out of she cloke since she and miss howe have intend to employ a smuggler against I -- all we wait for now be my lord 's letter but i have like to have forget to tell thee that we have be not a little alarmed by some inquiry that have be make after I and my beloved by a man of good appearance who yesterday procure a tradesman in the neighborhood to send for dorca : of whom he ask several question relate to we particularly -lrb- as we board and lodge in one house -rrb- whether we be marry this have give my beloved great uneasiness and i could not help observe upon it to she how right a thing it be that we have give out below that we be marry the inquiry most probably i say be from she brother 's quarter and now perhaps that we marriage be own we should hear no more of he machination the person it seem be curious to know the day that the ceremony be perform but dorca refuse to give he any other particulars than that we be marry and she be the more reserve as he decline to tell she the motive of he inquiry letter li mr lovelace to john belford esq may 24 the devil take this uncle of mine he have at last send I a letter which i can not show without expose the head of we family for a fool a confound parcel of pop-gun have he let off upon I i be in hope he have exhaust he whole stock of this sort in he letter to you -- to keep it back to delay send it till he have recollect all this farrago of nonsense -- confound he wisdom of nation if so much of it be to be scrape together in disgrace of itself to make one egregious simpleton -- but i be glad i be fortify with this piece of flagrant folly however since in all human affair the convenient be so mingled that there be no have the one without the other i have already offer the bill enclose in it to my beloved and read to she part of the letter but she refuse the bill : and as i be in cash myself i shall return it she seem very desirous to peruse the whole letter and when i tell she that be it not for expose the writer i would oblige she she say it would not be expose he lordship to show it to she and that she always prefer the heart to the head i know she meaning but do not thank she for it all that make for I in it i will transcribe for she -- yet hang it she shall have the letter and my soul with it for one consent kiss \*\*\* she have get the letter from I without the reward deuce take I if i have the courage to propose the condition a new character this of bashfulness in thy friend i see that a truly modest woman may make even a confident man keep he distance by my soul belford i believe that nine woman in ten who fall fall either from they own vanity or levity or for want of circumspection and proper reserve \*\*\* i do intend to take my reward on she return a letter so favourable to we both but she send it to I seal up by dorca i might have think that there be two or three hint in it that she would be too nice immediately to appear to i send it to thee and here will stop to give thee time to read it return it as soon as thou hast peruse it letter lii lord m to robert lovelace esq Tuesday may 23 it be a long lane that have no turning -- do not despise I for my proverb -- you know i be always fond of they and if you have be so too it would have be the better for you let I tell you i dare swear the fine lady you be so likely to be soon happy with will be far from despise they for i be tell that she write well and that all she letter be full of sentence god convert you for nobody but he and this lady can i have no manner of doubt but that you will marry as you father and all you ancestor do before you : else you would have have no title to be my heir nor can you descendant have any title to be you 's unless they be legitimate that be worth you remembrance sir -- no man be always a fool every man be sometimes -- but you folly i hope be now at a end i know you have vow revenge against this fine lady 's family : but no more of that now you must look upon they all as you relation and forgive and forget and when they see you make a good husband and a good father -lrb- which god send for all we sake -rrb- they will wonder at they nonsensical antipathy and beg you pardon : but while they think you a vile fellow and a rake how can they either love you or excuse they daughter and methink i could wish to give a word of comfort to the lady who doubtless must be under great fear how she shall be able to hold in such a wild creature as you have hitherto be i would hint to she that by strong argument and gentle word she may do any thing with you for though you be apt to be hot gentle word will cool you and bring you into the temper that be necessary for you cure would to god my poor lady you aunt who be dead and go have be a proper patient for the same remedy god rest she soul no reflection upon she memory worth be best know by want i know she 's now and if i have go first she would by this time have know mine there be great wisdom in that say god send I a friend that may tell I of my fault : if not a enemy and he will not that i be you enemy and that you well know the more noble any one be the more humble so bear with I if you would be think noble -- be i not you uncle and do i not design to be better to you than you father could be nay i will be you father too when the happy day come since you desire it : and pray make my compliment to my dear niece and tell she i wonder much that she have so long defer you happiness pray let she know as that i will present she -lrb- not you -rrb- either my lancashire seat or the lawn in hertfordshire and settle upon she a thousand pound a year penny-rent to show she that we be not a family to take base advantage : and you may have writings draw and settle as you will -- honest pritchard have the rent-roll of both these estate and as he have be a good old servant i recommend he to you lady 's favor i have already consult he : he will tell you what be best for you and most please to I i be still very bad with my gout but will come in a litter as soon as the day be fix it would be the joy of my heart to join you hand and let I tell you if you do not make the best of husband to so good a young lady and one who have have so much courage for you sake i will renounce you and settle all i can upon she and she be by you and leave you out of the question if any thing be want for you further security i be ready to give it though you know that my word have always be look upon as my bond and when the harlowe know all this let we see whether they be able to blush and take shame to themselves lady sarah and lady betty want only to know the day to make all the country round they blaze and all they tenant mad and if any one of mine be sober upon the occasion pritchard shall eject he and on the birth of the first child if a son i will do something more for you and repeat all we rejoicing i ought indeed to have write sooner but i know that if you think I long and be in haste as to you nuptials you would write and tell I so but my gout be very troublesome : and i be but a slow writer you know at best : for composing be a thing that though formerly i be very ready at it -lrb- as my lord lexington use to say -rrb- yet have leave it off a great while i be not so now and i choose on this occasion to write all out of my own hand and memory and to give you my best advice for i may never have such a opportunity again you have have -lrb- god mend you -rrb- a strange way of turn you back upon all i have say : this once i hope you will be more attentive to the advice i give you for you own good i have still another end nay two other end the one be that now you be upon the border of wedlock as i may say and all you wild oats will be sow i would give you some instruction as to you public as well as private behavior in life which intend you so much good as i do you ought to hear and perhaps would never have listen to on any less extraordinary occasion the second be that you dear lady-elect -lrb- who be it seem herself so fine and so sententious a writer -rrb- will see by this that it be not we fault nor for want of the best advice that you be not a better man than you have hitherto be and now in a few word for the conduct i would wish you to follow in public as well as in private if you would think I worthy of advise -- it shall be short so be not uneasy as to the private life : love you lady as she deserve let you action praise you be a good husband and so give the lie to all you enemy and make they ashamed of they scandal and let we have pride in say that miss harlowe have not do either herself or family any discredit by come among we do this and i and lady sarah and lady betty will love you for ever as to you public conduct : this as follow be what i could wish : but i reckon you lady 's wisdom will put we both right -- no disparagement sir since with all you wit you have not hitherto show much wisdom you know get into parliament as soon as you can : for you have talon to make a great figure there who so proper to assist in make new hold law as those whom no law in be could hold then for so long as you will give attendance in st stephen 's chapel -- its be call a chapel i hope will not disgust you : i be sure i have know many a riot there -- a speaker have a hard time of it but we peer have more decorum -- but what be i go to say -- i must go back for so long as you will give you attendance in parliament for so long will you be out of mischief out of private mischief at least : and may st stephen 's fate be you 's if you wilfully do public mischief when a new election come you will have two or three borough you know to choose out of : -- but if you stay till then i have rather you be for the shire you will have interest enough i be sure and be so handsome a man the woman will make they husband vote for you i shall long to read you speech i expect you will speak if occasion offer the very first day you want no courage and think highly enough of yourself and lowly enough of every body else to speak on all occasion as to the method of the house you have spirit enough i fear to be too much above they : take care of that -- i do not so much fear you want of good-manners to man you want no decency if they do not provoke you : as to that i wish you would only learn to be as patient of contradiction from other as you would have other people be to you although i would not have you to be a courtier neither would i have you to be a malcontent i remember -lrb- for i have it down -rrb- what my old friend archibald hutcheson say and it be a very good say -- -lrb- to mr secretary cragg i think it be -rrb- -- ' i look upon a administration as entitle to every vote i can with good conscience give it for a house of common should not needlessly put drag upon the wheel of government : and when i have not give it my vote it be with regret : and for my country 's sake i wish with all my heart the measure have be such as i could have approve ' and another say he have which be this : ` neither can a opposition neither can a ministry be always wrong to be a plumb man therefore with either be a infallible mark that that man must mean more and worse than he will own he do mean ' be these saying bad sir be they to be despise -- well then why should i be despise for remember they and quote they as i love to do let I tell you if you love my company more than you do you would not be the worse for it i may say so without any vanity since it be other man 's wisdom and not my own that i be so fond of but to add a word or two more on this occasion and i may never have such another for you must read this through -- love honest man and herd with they in the house and out of the house by whatever name they be dignified or distinguish : keep good man company and you shall be out of they number but do i or do i not write this before -- write at so many different time and such a quantity one may forget you may come in for the title when i be dead and go -- god help I -- so i would have you keep a equilibrium if once you get the name of be a fine speaker you may have any thing : and to be sure you have naturally a great deal of elocution a tongue that would delude a angel as the woman say -- to they sorrow some of they poor creature -- a lead man in the house of common be a very important character because that house have the give of money : and money make the mare to go ay and queen and king too sometimes to go in a manner very different from what they might otherwise choose to go let I tell you however methink i would not have you take a place neither -- it will double you value and you interest if it be believe that you will not : for as you will then stand in no man 's way you will have no envy but pure sterling respect and both side will court you for you part you will not want a place as some other do to piece up they broken fortune if you can now live reputably upon two thousand pound a year it will be hard if you can not hereafter live upon seven or eight -- less you will not have if you oblige I as now by marry so fine a lady very much you will -- and all this and above lady betty 's and lady sarah 's favor what in the name of wonder could possibly possess the proud harlowe -- that son that son of theirs -- but for he dear sister 's sake i will say no more of he i never be offer a place myself : and the only one i would have take have i be offer it be master of the buckhound for i love hunting when i be young and it carry a good sound with it for we who live in the country often have i thought of that excellent old adage he that eat the king 's goose shall be choke with he feather i wish to the lord this be thoroughly consider by place-hunter it would be better for they and for they poor family i could say a great deal more and all equally to the purpose but really i be tired and so i doubt be you and besides i would reserve something for conversation my niece montague and lady sarah and lady betty join in compliment to my niece that be to be if she would choose to have the knot tie among we pray tell she that we shall all see it securely do : and we will make all the country ring and blaze for a week together but so i believe i say before if any thing further may be needful toward promote you reciprocal felicity let I know it and how you order about the day and all that the enclosed bill be very much at you service ` tis payable at sight as whatever else you may have occasion for shall be so god bless you both and make thing as convenient to my gout as you can though be it whenever it will i will hobble to you for i long to see you and still more to see my niece and be -lrb- in expectation of that happy opportunity -rrb- you most affectionate uncle m letter liii mr lovelace to john belford esq Thursday may 25 thou seest belford how we now drive before the wind -- the dear creature now come almost at the first word whenever i desire the honor of she company i tell she last night that apprehend delay from pritchard 's slowness i be determine to leave it to my lord to make he compliment in he own way and have actually that afternoon put my writings into the hand of a very eminent lawyer counsellor willian with direction for he to draw up settlement from my own estate and conformably to those of my mother which i put into he hand at the same time it have be i assure she no small part of my concern that she frequent displeasure and we mutual misapprehension have hinder I from advise with she before on this subject indeed indeed my dearest life say i you have hitherto afford I but a very thorny courtship she be silent kindly silent for well know i that she could have recriminate upon I with a vengeance but i be willing to see if she be not loth to disoblige I now i comfort myself i say with the hope that all my difficulty be now over and that every past disobligation would be bury in oblivion now belford i have actually deposit these writings with counsellor william and i expect the draught in a week at farthest so shall be doubly arm for if i attempt and fail these shall be ready to throw in to make she have patience with I till i can try again i have more contrivance still in embryo i could tell thee of a hundred and yet hold another hundred in petto to pop in as i go along to excite thy surprize and to keep up thy attention nor rave thou at I but if thou art my friend think of miss howe 's letter and of she smuggling scheme all owe to my fair captive 's information incitement be i not a villain a fool a beelzebub with they already -- yet no harm do by I nor so much as attempt every thing of this nature the dear creature answer -lrb- with a downcast eye and a blush cheek -rrb- she leave to I i propose my lord 's chapel for the celebration where we might have the presence of lady betty lady sarah and my two cousin montague she seem not to favor a public celebration and wave this subject for the present i doubt not but she would be as willing as i to decline a public wedding so i press not this matter farther just then but pattern i actually produce and a jeweller be to bring as this day several set of jewel for she choice but the pattern she would not open she sigh at the mention of they : the second pattern she say that have be offer to she : \* and very peremptorily forbid the jeweller 's come as well as decline my offer of cause my mother 's to be new-set at least for the present \* see vol i letter xli i do assure thee belford i be in earnest in all this my whole estate be nothing to I put in competition with she hoped-for favor she then tell I that she have put into write she opinion of my general proposal and there have express she mind as to clothes and jewel : but on my strange behavior to she -lrb- for no cause that she know of -rrb- on Sunday night she have tear the paper in two i earnestly press she to let I be favor with a sight of this paper tear as it be and after some hesitation she withdraw and send it to I by dorca i peruse it again it be in a manner new to I though i have read it so lately : and by my soul i could hardly stand it a hundred admirable creature i call she to myself but i charge thee write not a word to I in she favor if thou meanest she well for if i spare she it must be all ex mero motu you may easily suppose when i be re-admitted to she presence that i run over in she praise and in vow of gratitude and everlasting love but here be the devil she still receive all i say with reserve or if it be not with reserve she receive it so much as she due that she be not at all raise by it some woman be undo by praise by flattery i myself a man be proud of praise perhaps thou wilt say that those be most proud of it who least deserve it as those be of riches and grandeur who be not bear to either i own that to be superior to these foible it require a soul have i not then a soul -- surely i have -- let I then be consider as a exception to the rule now have i foundation to go upon in my term my lord in the exuberance of he generosity mention a thousand pound a year penny-rent this i know that be i to marry this lady he would rather settle upon she all he have a mind to settle than upon I he have even threaten that if i prove not a good husband to she he will leave all he can at he death from I to she yet consider not that a woman so perfect can never be displeased with she husband but to he disgrace : for who will blame she -- another reason why a lovelace should not wish to marry a clarissa but what a pretty fellow of a uncle be this foolish peer to think of make a wife independent of she emperor and a rebel of course yet smart himself for a error of this kind my beloved in she torn paper mention but two hundred pound a year for she separate use i insist upon she name a larger sum she say it might be three and i for fear she should suspect very large offer name only five but add the entire disposal of all arrears in she father 's hand for the benefit of mr norton or whom she please she say that the good woman would be uneasy if any thing more than a competency be do for she she be more for suit all she disposition of this kind she say to the usual way of life of the person to go beyond it be but to put the benefit upon project or to make they awkward in a new state when they might shine in that to which they be accustom and to put it into so good a mother 's power to give she son a beginning in he business at a proper time yet to leave she something for herself to set she above want or above the necessity of take back from she child what she have be enable to bestow upon he would be the height of such a worthy parent 's ambition here 's prudence here 's judgment in so young a creature how do i hate the harlowe for produce such a angel -- o why why do she refuse my sincere address to tie the knot before we come to this house but yet what mortify my pride be that this exalted creature if i be to marry she would not be govern in she behavior to I by love but by generosity merely or by blind duty and have rather live single than be mine i can not bear this i would have the woman whom i honor with my name if ever i confer this honor upon any forego even she superior duty for I i would have she look after I when i go out as far as she can see I as my rosebud after she johnny and meet I at my return with rapture i would be the subject of she dream as well as of she waking thought i would have she think every moment lose that be not pass with I : sing to I read to I play to I when i pleased : no joy so great as in obey I when i should be incline to love overwhelm I with it when to be serious or solitary if apprehensive of intrusion retire at a nod approach I only if i smile encouragement : steal into my presence with silence out of it if not notice on tiptoe be a lady easy to all my pleasure and value those most who most contribute to they only sigh in private that it be not herself at the time thus of old do the contend wife of the honest patriarch each recommend she handmaid to she lord as she think it would oblige he and look upon the genial product as she own the gentle waller say woman be bear to be controul gentle as he be he know that a tyrant husband make a dutiful wife and why do the sex love rake but because they know how to direct they uncertain will and manage they \*\*\* another agreeable conversation the day of day the subject as to fix a particular one that need not be do my charmer say till the settlement be complete as to marry at my lord 's chapel the lady of my family present that would be make a public affair of it and the dear creature observe with regret that it seem to be my lord 's intention to make it so it could not be imagine i say but that he lordship 's set out in a litter and come to town as well as he taste for glare and the joy he would take to see I marry at last and to she dear self would give it as much the air of a public marriage as if the ceremony be perform at he own chapel all the lady present i can not say she endure the thought of a public day it will carry with it a air of insult upon my whole family and for my part if my lord will not take it amiss -lrb- and perhaps he will not as the motion come not from himself but from you mr lovelace -rrb- i will very willingly dispense with he lordship 's presence the rather as dress and appearance will then be unnecessary for i can not bear to think of deck my person while my parent be in tear how excellent this yet do not she parent richly deserve to be in tear see belford with so charming a niceness we might have be a long time ago upon the verge of the state and yet find a great deal to do before we enter into it all obedience all resignation -- no will but she 's i withdraw and write directly to my lord and she not disapprove of it i send it away the purport as follow for i take no copy ` that i be much oblige to he lordship for he intended goodness to I on a occasion the most solemn of my life that the admirable lady whom he so justly praise think he lordship 's proposal in she favor too high that she choose not to make a public appearance if without disoblige my friend she could avoid it till a reconciliation with she own could be effect that although she express a grateful sense of he lordship 's consent to give she to I with he own hand yet presume that the motive to this kind intention be rather to do she honor than it otherwise would have be he own choice -lrb- especially as travel would be at this time so inconvenient to he -rrb- she think it advisable to save he lordship trouble on this occasion and hope he would take as mean she decline the favor ` that the lawn will be most acceptable to we both to retire to and the rather as it be so to he lordship ` but if he please the jointure may be make from my own estate leave to he lordship 's goodness the alternative ' i conclude with tell he ` that i have offer to present the lady he lordship 's bill but on she decline to accept of it -lrb- have myself no present occasion for it -rrb- i return it enclose with my thanks & c ' and be not this go a plaguy length what a figure should i make in rakish annals if at last i should be catch in my own gin the sex may say what they will but a poor innocent fellow have need to take great care of himself when he dance upon the edge of the matrimonial precipice many a faint-hearted man when he begin to jest or only design to ape gallantry have be force into earnest by be over-prompt and take at he word not know how to own that he mean less than the lady suppose he mean i be the better enable to judge that this must have be the case of many a sneak varlet because i who know the female world as well as any man in it of my standing be so frequently in doubt of myself and know not what to make of the matter then these little sly rogue how they lie couchant ready to spring upon we harmless fellow the moment we be in they reach -- when the ice be once break for they how swiftly can they make to port -- mean time the subject they can least speak to they most think of nor can you talk of the ceremony before they have lay out in they mind how it be all to be little saucy-faced designer how first they draw themselves in then we but be all these thing as they will lord m never in he life receive so handsome a letter as this from he nephew lovelace \*\*\* -lrb- the lady after have give to miss howe on the particulars contain in mr lovelace 's last letter thus express herself : -rrb- a principal consolation arise from these favourable appearance be that i who have now but one only friend shall most probably and if it be not my own fault have as many new one as there be person in mr lovelace 's family and this whether mr lovelace treat I kindly or not and who know but that by degree those new friend by they rank and merit may have weight enough to get I restore to the favor of my relation till which can be effect i shall not be tolerably easy happy i never expect to be mr lovelace 's mind and mine be vastly different different in essential but as matter be at present circumstanced i pray you my dear friend to keep to yourself every thing that might bring discredit to he if reveal -- better any body expose a man than a wife if i be to be he and what be say by you will be think to come from I it shall be my constant prayer that all the felicity which this world can afford may be you 's : and that the almighty will never suffer you nor you 's to the remotest posterity to want such a friend as my anna howe have be to she clarissa harlowe letter liv mr lovelace to john belford esq and now that my beloved seem secure in my net for my project upon the vixen miss howe and upon she mother : in which the officious prancer hickman be to come in for a dash but why upon she mother methink thou askest who unknown to herself have only act by the impulse through thy agent joseph leman upon the folly of old tony the uncle no matter for that : she believe she act upon she own judgment : and deserve to be punish for pretend to judgment when she have none -- every living soul but myself i can tell thee shall be punish that treat either cruelly or disrespectfully so adore a lady -- what a plague be it not enough that she be tease and torment in person by I i have already break the matter to we three confederate as a suppose not a resolved-on case indeed and yet they know that with I in a piece of mischief execution with its swiftest feel be seldom three pace behind projection which hardly ever limp neither mowbray be not against it it be a scheme he say worthy of we : and we have not do any thing for a good while that have make a noise belton indeed hesitate a little because matter go wrong between he and he thomasine and the poor fellow have not the courage to have he sore place probe to the bottom tourville have start a fresh game and shrug he shoulder and should not choose to go abroad at present if i please for i apprehend that -lrb- from the nature of the project -rrb- there will be a kind of necessity to travel till all be blow over to I one country be as good as another and i shall soon i suppose choose to quit this paltry island except the mistress of my fate will consent to cohabit at home and so lay I under no necessity of surprising she into foreign part travel thou knowest give the sex charming opportunity of be familiar with one another a very few day and night must now decide all matter betwixt I and my fair inimitable doleman who can act in these cause only as chamber-counsel will inform we by pen and ink -lrb- he right hand and right side have not yet be strike and the other side begin to be sensible -rrb- of all that shall occur in we absence as for thee we have rather have thy company than not for although thou art a wretched fellow at contrivance yet art thou intrepid at execution but as thy present engagement make thy attendance uncertain i be not for make thy part necessary to we scheme but for leave thee to come after we when abroad i know thou canst not long live without we the project in short be this : -- mr howe have a elder sister in the isle of wight who be lately a widow and i be well inform that the mother and daughter have engage before the latter be marry to pay a visit to this lady who be rich and intend miss for she heiress and in the interim will make she some valuable present on she approach nuptials which as mr howe who love money more than any thing but herself tell one of my acquaintance would be worth fetch now jack nothing more need be do than to hire a little trim vessel which shall sail a pleasure backward and forward to portsmouth spithead and the isle of wight for a week or fortnight before we enter upon we part of the plot and as mr howe will be for make the best bargain she can for she passage the master of the vessel may have order -lrb- as a perquisite allow he by he owner -rrb- to take what she will give : and the master 's name be it what it will shall be ganmore on the occasion for i know a rogue of that name who be not oblige to be of any country any more than we well then we will imagine they on board i will be there in disguise they know not any of ye four -- suppose -lrb- the scheme so invite -rrb- that thou canst be one ` tis plaguy hard if we can not find or make a storm perhaps they will be sea-sick : but whether they be or not no doubt they will keep they cabin here will be mr howe miss howe mr hickman a maid and a footman i suppose : and thus we will order it i know it will be hard weather : i know it will : and before there can be the least suspicion of the matter we shall be in sight of guernsey jersey dieppe cherbourg or any where on the french coast that it shall please we to agree with the wind to blow we : and then secure the footman and the woman be separate one of we accord to lot that may be cast shall overcome either by persuasion or force the maid servant : that will be no hard task and she be a likely wench -lrb- i have see she often : -rrb- one mr howe nor can there be much difficulty there for she be full of health and life and have be long a widow : another -lrb- that say the princely lion must be i -rrb- the saucy daughter who will be much too frightened to make great resistance -lrb- violent spirit in that sex be seldom true spirit -- ` tis but where they can : -rrb- and after beat about the coast for three or four day for recreation 's sake and to make sure work till we see we sullen bird begin to eat and sip we will set they all ashore where it will be most convenient sell the vessel -lrb- to mr townsend 's agent with all my heart or to some other smuggler -rrb- or give it to ganmore and pursue we travels and tarry abroad till all be hush up now i know thou wilt make difficulty as it be thy way while it be mine to conquer they my other vassal make theirs and i condescend to obviate they : as thus i will thine first state they for thee accord to what i know of thy phlegm what in the first place wilt thou ask shall be do with hickman who will be in full parade of dress and primness in order to show the old aunt what a devilish clever fellow of a nephew she be to have what -- i 'll tell thee -- hickman in good manners will leave the woman in they cabin -- and to show he courage with he breed be upon deck -- well and suppose he be -- why then i hope it be easy for ganmore or any body else myself suppose in my pea-jacket and great watch coat -lrb- if any other make scruple to do it -rrb- while he stand in the way gaping and stare like a novice to stumble against he and push he overboard -- a rich thought -- be it not belford -- he be certainly plaguy officious in the lady ' correspondence and i be inform play double between mother and daughter in fear of both -- dost not see he jack -- i do -- pop up and down he wig and hat float by he and paddle paw and dash like a frighted mongrel -- i be afraid he never venture to learn to swim but thou wilt not drown the poor fellow wilt thou no no -- that be not necessary to the project -- i hate to do mischief supererogatory the skiff shall be ready to save he while the vessel keep its course : he shall be set on shore with the loss of wig and hat only and of half he little wit at the place where he embark or any where else well but shall we not be in danger of be hang for three such enormous rape although hickman should escape with only a bellyful of sea-water yes to be sure when catch -- but be there any likelihood of that -- besides have we not be in danger before now for worse fact and what be there in be only in danger -- if we actually be to appear in open day in england before matter be make up there will be greater likelihood that these woman will not prosecute that they will -- for my own part i should wish they may would not a brave fellow choose to appear in court to such a arraignment confront woman who would do credit to he attempt the country be more merciful in these case than in any other : i should therefore like to put myself upon my country let I indulge in a few reflection upon what thou mayest think the worst that can happen i will suppose that thou art one of we and that all five be actually bring to trial on this occasion : how bravely shall we enter a court i at the head of you dress out each man as if to he wedding appearance -- you be sure of all the woman old and young of you side -- what brave fellow -- what fine gentleman -- there go a charming handsome man -- mean I to be sure -- who could find in they heart to hang such a gentleman as that whisper one lady sit perhaps on the right hand of the recorder : -lrb- i suppose the scene to be in london : -rrb- while another disbelieve that any woman could fairly swear against I all will crowd after I : it will be each man 's happiness -lrb- if ye shall chance to be bashful -rrb- to be neglect : i shall be find to be the greatest criminal and my safety for which the general voice will be engage will be yours but then come the triumph of triumph that will make the accuse look up while the accuser be cover with confusion make room there -- stand by -- give back -- one receive a rap another a elbow half a score a push a piece -- enter the slow-moving hooded-faced down-looking plaintiff -- and first the widow with a sorrowful countenance though half-veiled pity she daughter more than herself the people the woman especially who on this occasion will be five-sixth of the spectator reproach she -- you would have the conscience would you to have five such brave gentleman as these hang for you know not what next come the poor maid -- who perhaps have be ravish twenty time before and have not appear now but for company-sake mincing simpering weep by turn not know whether she should be sorry or glad but every eye dwell upon miss -- see see the handsome gentleman bow to she to the very ground to be sure i shall bow and kiss my hand see she confusion see she turn from he -- ay that be because it be in open court cry a arch one -- while other admire she -- ay that be a girl worth venture one 's neck for then we shall be praise -- even the judge and the whole crowded bench will acquit we in they heart and every single man wish he have be I -- the woman all the time disclaim prosecution be the case to be they own to be sure belford the sufferer can not put half so good a face upon the matter as we then what a noise will this matter make -- be it not enough suppose we move from the prison to the sessions-house \* to make a noble heart thump it away most gloriously when such a one find himself attend to he trial by a parade of guard and officer of mien and aspect warlike and unwarlike himself of they whole care and they business weapon in they hand some bright some rusty equally venerable for they antiquity and inoffensiveness other of more authoritative demeanor strut before with fine paint stave shoal of people follow with a which be he whom the young lady appear against -- then let we look down look up look round which way we will we shall see all the door the shop the window the sign-iron and balcony -lrb- garret gutter and chimney-top include -rrb- all white-capt black - hooded and periwigg would or crop-ear would up by the immobile vulgus : while the float street-swarmer who have see we pass by at one place run with stretched-out neck and strained eye-ball a roundabout way and elbow and shoulder themselves into place by which we have not pass in order to obtain another sight of we every street continue to pour out its swarm of late-comer to add to the gathering snowball who be content to take description of we person behavior and countenance from those who have the good fortune to have be in time to see we \* within these few year past a passage have be make from the prison to the sessions-house whereby malefactor be carry into court without go through the street lovelace 's triumph on they suppose march show the wisdom of this alteration let I tell thee jack i see not why -lrb- to judge accord to we principle and practice -rrb- we should not be as much elate in we march be this to happen to we as other may be upon any other the most mob - attract occasion -- suppose a lord-mayor on he gawdy -- suppose a victorious general or ambassador on he public entry -- suppose -lrb- as i begin with the lowest -rrb- the grandest parade that can be suppose a coronation -- for in all these do not the royal guard the heroic trained-band the pendent clinging throng of spectator with they wave head roll to-and-fro from house-top to house-bottom and street-way as i have above describe make the principal part of the raree-show and let I ask thee if thou dost not think that either the mayor the ambassador or the general would not make very pitiful figure on they gala do not the trumpet and tabret call together the canaille to gaze at they -- nor perhaps should we be the most guilty hero neither : for who know how the magistrate may have obtain he gold chain while the general probably return from cut of throat and from murder sanctify by custom only -- caesar we be tell \* have win at the age of fifty-six when he be assassinate fifty pitched battle have take by assault above a thousand town and slay near 1200000 man i suppose exclusive of those who fall on he own side in slaying they be not you and i jack innocent man and babe in swaddling-clothes compare to caesar and to he predecessor in heroism alexander dub for murder and depredation magnus \* pliny give this account put the number of man slay at 1100092 see also lipsius de constandia the principal difference that strike I in the comparison between we and the mayor the ambassador the general on they gawdy be that the mob make a greater noise a louder huzzaing in the one case than the other which be call acclamation and end frequently in higher taste by throw dead animal at one another before they disperse in which they have as much joy as in the former part of the triumph : while they will attend we with all the mark of a awful or silent -lrb- at most only a whispering -rrb- respect they mouth distend as if set open with gag and they voice generally lose in goggle-ey would admiration well but suppose after all we be convict what have we to do but in time make over we estate that the sheriff may not revel in we spoil -- there be no fear of be hang for such a crime as this while we have money or friend -- and suppose even the worst that two or three be to die have we not a chance each man of we to escape the devil 's in they if they 'll hang five for ravishing three i know i shall get off for one -- be it but for family sake : and be a handsome fellow i shall have a dozen or two young maiden all dress in white go to court to beg my life -- and what a pretty show they will make with they white hood white gown white petticoat white scarf white glove kneel for I with they white handkerchief at they eye in two pretty row as he majesty walk through they and nod my pardon for they sake -- and if once pardon all be over : for jack in a crime of this nature there lie no appeal as in a murder so thou seest the worst that can happen should we not make the grand tour upon this occasion but stay and take we trial but it be most likely that they will not prosecute at all if not no risque on we side will be run only take we pleasure abroad at the worst leave friend tire of we in order after a time to return to the same friend endear to we as we to they by absence this jack be my scheme at the first run i know it be capable of improvement -- for example : i can land these lady in france whip over before they can get a passage back or before hickman can have recover he fright and so find means to entrap my beloved on board -- and then all will be right and i need not care if i be never to return to england memorandum to be consider of -- whether in order to complete my vengeance i can not contrive to kidnap away either jame harlowe or solme or both a man jack would not go into exile for nothing letter lv mr lovelace to john belford esq if belford thou likest not my plot upon miss howe i have three or four more as good in my own opinion better perhaps they will be in thine : and so ` tis but get loose from thy present engagement and thou shalt pick and choose but as for thy three brethren they must do as i would have they : and so indeed must thou -- else why be i you general but i will refer this subject to its proper season thou knowest that i never absolutely conclude upon a project till ` tis time for execution and then lightning strike not quicker than i and now to the subject next my heart wilt thou believe I when i tell thee that i have so many contrivance rise up and crowd upon I for preference with regard to my gloriana that i hardly know which to choose -- i could tell thee of no less than six princely one any of which must do but as the dear creature have not grudge give I trouble i think i ought not in gratitude to spare combustible for she but on the contrary to make she stare and stand aghast by spring three or four mine at once thou remembrest what shakespeare in he troilus and cressida make hector who however be not use to boast say to achille in a interview between they and which apply to this watchful lady and to the vexation she have give I and to the certainty i now think i have of subdue she will run thus : suppose the charmer before I and i meditate she sweet person from head to foot : henceforth o watchful fair-one guard thee well : for i 'll not kill thee there nor there nor there but by the zone that circle venus ' waist i 'll kill thee ev'ry where yea o'er and o'er -- thou wisest belford pardon I this brag : she watchfulness draw folly from my lip but i 'll endeavor deed to match the word or i may never -- then i imagine thee interpose to qualify my impatience as ajax do to achille : -- do not chafe thee cousin : -- and let these threat alone till accident or purpose bring thee to it all that vex I in the midst of my gloried-in device be that there be a sorry fellow in the world who have presume to question whether the prize when obtain be worthy of the pain it cost I : yet know with what patience and trouble a bird-man will spread a acre of ground with gin and snare set up he stalk horse he glass plant he decoy - bird and invite the feathered throng by he whistle and all he prize at last -lrb- the reward of early hour and of a whole morning 's pain -rrb- only a simple linnet to be serious belford i must acknowledge that all we pursuit from childhood to manhood be only trifle of different sort and size proportion to we year and view : but then be not a fine woman the noblest trifle that ever be or could be obtain by man -- and to what purpose do we say obtain if it be not in the way we wish for -- if a man be rather to be she prize than she he \*\*\* and now belford what dost think that thou art a cursed fellow if -- if -- no if 's -- but i shall be very sick to-morrow i shall ` faith sick -- why sick what a-devil shouldst thou be sick for for more good reason than one jack i should be glad to hear but one -- sick quotha of all thy roguish invention i should not have think of this perhaps thou thinkest my view to be to draw the lady to my bedside that be a trick of three or four thousand year old and i should find it much more to my purpose if i could get to she 's however i 'll condescend to make thee as wise as myself i be excessively disturb about this smuggling scheme of miss howe i have no doubt that my fair-one be i to make a attempt and miscarry will fly from I if she can i once believe she love I : but now i doubt whether she do or not : at least that it be with such a ardor as miss howe call it as will make she overlook a premeditated fault should i be guilty of one and what will be sick do for thee have patience i do not intend to be so very bad as dorca shall represent I to be but yet i know i shall reach confoundedly and bring up some clot blood to be sure i shall break a vessel : there be no doubt of that : and a bottle of eaton 's styptic shall be send for but no doctor if she have humanity she will be concerned but if she have love let it have be push ever so far back it will on this occasion come forward and show itself not only in she eye but in every line of she sweet face i will be very intrepid i will not fear death or any thing else i will be sure of be well in a hour or two have formerly find great benefit by this astringent medicine on occasion of a inward bruise by a fall from my horse in hunting of which perhaps this malady may be the remains and this will show she that though those about I may make the most of it i do not and so can have no design in it well methink thou sayest i begin to think tolerably of this device i know thou wouldst when i explain myself another time prepare to wonder and banish doubt now belford i shall expect that she will show some concern at the broken vessel as it may be attend with fatal effect especially to one so fiery in he temper as i have the reputation to be think to be : and the rather as i shall calmly attribute the accident to the harass and doubt under which i have labor for some time past and this will be a further proof of my love and will demand a grateful return -- and what then thou egregious contriver why then i shall have the less remorse if i be to use a little violence : for can she deserve compassion who show none and what if she show a great deal of concern then shall i be in hope of building on a good foundation love hide a multitude of fault and diminish those it can not hide love when acknowledge authorize freedom and freedom beget freedom and i shall then see how far i can go well but lovelace how the deuce wilt thou with that full health and vigor of constitution and with that bloom in thy face make any body believe thou art sick how -- why take a few grain of ipecacuanha enough to make I reach like a fury good -- but how wilt thou manage to bring up blood and not hurt thyself foolish fellow be there no pigeon and chicken in every poulterer 's shop cry thy mercy but then i will be persuade by mr sinclair that i have of late confine myself too much and so will have a chair call and be carry to the park where i will try to walk half the length of the mall or so and in my return amuse myself at white 's or the cocoa and what will this do question again -- i be afraid thou ` rt a infidel belford -- why then shall i not know if my beloved offer to go out in my absence -- and shall i not see whether she receive I with tenderness at my return but this be not all : i have a foreboding that something affect will happen while i be out but of this more in its place and now belford wilt thou or wilt thou not allow that it be a right thing to be sick -- lord jack so much delight do i take in my contrivance that i shall be half sorry when the occasion for they be over for never never shall i again have such charming exercise for my invention mean time these plaguy woman be so impertinent so full of reproach that i know not how to do any thing but curse they and then truly they be for help I out with some of they trite and vulgar artifice sally particularly who pretend to be a mighty contriver have just now in a insolent manner tell I on my reject she proffer aid that i have no mind to conquer and that i be so wicked as to intend to marry though i would not own it to she because this little devil make she first sacrifice at my altar she think she may take any liberty with I : and what make she outrageous at time be that i have for a long time studiously as she say slight she too-readily-offered favor : but be it not very impudent in she to think that i will be any man 's successor it be not come to that neither this thou knowest be always my rule -- once any other man 's and i know it and never more mine it be for such as thou and thy brethren to take up with harlot i have be always aim at the merit of a first discoverer the more devil i perhaps thou wilt say to endeavor to corrupt the uncorrupted but i say not since hence i have but very few adultery to answer for one affair indeed at pari with a married lady -lrb- i believe i never tell thee of it -rrb- touch my conscience a little : yet bring on by the spirit of intrigue more than by sheer wickedness i 'll give it thee in brief : ' a french marquis somewhat in year employ by he court in a public function at that of madrid have put he charming young new-married wife under the controul and wardship as i may say of he insolent sister a old prude ' i see the lady at the opera i like she at first sight and better at second when i know the situation she be in so pretend to make my address to the prude get admittance to both ` the first thing i have to do be to compliment the prude into shyness by complaint of shyness : next to take advantage of the marquise 's situation between she husband 's jealousy and he sister 's arrogance and to inspire she with resentment and as i hope with a regard to my person the french lady have no dislike to intrigue ` the sister begin to suspect I : the lady have no mind to part with the company of the only man who have be permit to visit she and tell I of she sister 's suspicion i put she upon conceal the prude as if unknown to I in a closet in one of she own apartment lock she in and put the key in she own pocket : and she be to question I on the sincerity of my profession to she sister in she sister 's hearing ` she comply my mistress be lock up the lady and i take we seat i own fervent love and make high profession : for the marquise put it home to I the prude be delighted with what she hear ` and how dost thou think it end -- i take my advantage of the lady herself who dare not for she life cry out and draw she after I to the next apartment on pretence of go to seek she sister who all the time be lock up in the closet ' no woman ever give I a private meeting for nothing my dearest miss harlowe except ` my ingenuity obtain my pardon : the lady be unable to forbear laughing throughout the whole affair to find both so uncommonly trick she gaoleress she prisoner safe lock up and as much pleased as either of we ' the english jack do not often out-wit the french ` we have contrivance afterwards equally ingenious in which the lady the ice once broken -lrb- once subdue always subdue -rrb- co-operate but a more tender tell-tale reveal the secret -- reveal it before the marquise could cover the disgrace the sister be inveterate the husband irreconcilable in every respect unfit for a husband even for a french one -- make perhaps more delicate to these particulars by the custom of a people among whom he be then resident so contrary to those of he own countryman she be oblige to throw herself into my protection -- nor think herself unhappy in it till childbed pang seize she : then penitence and death overtake she the same hour ' excuse a tear belford -- she deserve a better fate what have such a vile inexorable husband to answer for -- the sister be punish effectually -- that please I on reflection -- the sister effectually punish -- but perhaps i have tell thee this story before end of vol4 end of project gutenberg 's clarissa volume 4 -lrb- of 9 -rrb-
