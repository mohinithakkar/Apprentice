1895 to my dear mother contents the race of orven the stone of the edmundsbury monk the ss the race of orven never without grief and pain could i remember the fate of prince zaleskus -- victim of a too importunate too unfortunate love which the fulgor of the throne itself could not abash exile perforce from he native land and voluntary exile from the rest of man have renounce the world over which lurid and inscrutable as a fall star he have pass the world quickly cease to wonder at he and even i to whom more than to another the workings of that just and passionate mind have be reveal half forget he in the rush of thing but during the time that what be call the ` pharanx labyrinth ' be exercise many of the heaviest brain in the land my thought turn repeatedly to he and even when the affair have pass from the general attention a bright day in spring combined perhaps with a latent mistrust of the _ dénoûment _ of that dark plot draw I to he place of hermitage i reach the gloomy abode of my friend as the sun set it be a vast palace of the older world stand lonely in the midst of woodland and approach by a sombre avenue of poplar and cypress through which the sunlight hardly pierce up this i pass and seek out the desert stable -lrb- which i find all too dilapidated to afford shelter -rrb- finally put up my _ calèche _ in the ruin sacristy of a old dominican chapel and turn my mare loose to browse for the night on a paddock behind the domain as i push back the open front door and enter the mansion i could not but wonder at the saturnine fancy that have lead this wayward man to select a brooding-place so desolate for the passage of he day i regard it as a vast tomb of mausolus in which lay deep sepulchred how much genius culture brilliancy power the hall be construct in the manner of a roman _ atrium _ and from the oblong pool of turgid water in the center a troop of fat and otiose rat flee weakly squeal at my approach i mount by broken marble step to the corridor run round the open space and thence pursue my way through a mazeland of apartment -- suite upon suite -- along many a length of passage up and down many stair dust-cloud rise from the uncarpeted floor and choke I incontinent echo cough answer _ ricochet _ to my footstep in the gathering darkness and add emphasis to the funereal gloom of the dwelling nowhere be there a vestige of furniture -- nowhere a trace of human life after a long interval i come in a remote tower of the building and near its utmost summit to a richly-carpeted passage from the ceiling of which three mosaic lamp shed dim violet scarlet and pale-rose light around at the end i perceive two figure stand as if in silent guard on each side of a door tapestry with the python 's skin one be a post-replica in parian marble of the nude aphrodite of cnidus in the other i recognize the gigantic form of the negro ham the prince 's only attendant whose fierce and glistening and ebon visage broaden into a grin of intelligence as i come nearer nod to he i push without ceremony into zaleskus 's apartment the room be not a large one but lofty even in the semi-darkness of the very faint greenish lustre radiate from a open censerlike _ lampa _ of fret gold in the center of the domed encausted roof a certain incongruity of barbaric gorgeousness in the furnish fill I with amazement the air be heavy with the scented odour of this light and the fume of the narcotic _ cannabis sativa _ -- the base of the _ bhang _ of the mohammedan -- in which i know it to be the habit of my friend to assuage himself the hanging be of wine-coloured velvet heavy gold-fringed and embroidered at nurshedabad all the world know prince zaleskus to be a consummate _ cognoscente _ -- a profound amateur -- as well as a savant and a thinker but i be nevertheless astounded at the mere multitudinousness of the curio he have contrived to crowd into the space around he side by side rest a palaeolithic implement a chinese ` wise man ' a gnostic gem a amphora of graeco-etruscan work the general effect be a _ bizarrerie _ of half-weird sheen and gloom flemish sepulchral brass company strangely with runic tablet miniature painting a winged bull tamil scripture on lacquered leaf of the talipot mediaeval reliquary richly gemmed brahmin god one whole side of the room be occupy by a organ whose thunder in that circumscribe place must have set all these relic of dead epoch clash and jingle in fantastic dance as i enter the vaporous atmosphere be palpitate to the low liquid tinkling of a invisible musical box the prince recline on a couch from which a draping of cloth-of-silver roll torrent over the floor beside he stretch in its open sarcophagus which rest on three brazen trestle lay the mummy of a ancient memphian from the upper part of which the brown cerement have rot or be rent leave the hideousness of the naked grin countenance expose to view discard he gemmed chibouque and a old vellum reprint of anacreon zaleskus rise hastily and greet I with warmth mutter at the same time some commonplace about he ` pleasure ' and the ` unexpectedness ' of my visit he then give order to ham to prepare I a bed in one of the adjoining chamber we pass the greater part of the night in a delightful stream of that somnolent and half-mystic talk which prince zaleskus alone could initiate and sustain during which he repeatedly press on I a concoction of indian hemp resemble _ hashish _ prepare by he own hand and quite innocuous it be after a simple breakfast the next morning that i enter on the subject which be partly the occasion of my visit he lay back on he couch volume in a turkish _ beneesh _ and listen to I a little wearily perhaps at first with weave finger and the pale inverted eye of old anchorite and astrologer the moony greenish light fall on he always wan feature ` you know lord pharanx ' i ask ' i have meet he in the world he son lord randolph too i see once at court at peterhof and once again at the winter palace of the tsar i notice in they great stature shaggy head of hair ear of a very peculiar conformation and a certain aggressiveness of demeanor -- a strong likeness between father and son ' i have bring with I a bundle of old newspaper and compare these as i go on i proceed to lay the incident before he ` the father ' i say ` hold as you know high office in a late administration and be one of we big luminary in politics he have also be president of the council of several learn society and author of a book on modern ethic he son be rapidly rise to eminence in the _ corps diplomatique _ and lately -lrb- though strictly speak _ unebenbürtig _ -rrb- contract a affiance with the prinzessin charlotte mariana natalium of morgen-üppigen a lady with a strain of indubitable hohenzollern blood in she royal vein the orven family be a very old and distinguished one though -- especially in modern day -- far from wealthy however some little time after randolph have become engage to this royal lady the father insure he life for immense sum in various office both in england and america and the reproach of poverty be now sweep from the race six month ago almost simultaneously both father and son resign they various position _ en bloc _ but all this of course i be tell you on the assumption that you have not already read it in the papers ' ' a modern newspaper ' he say ` be what it mostly be be the one thing insupportable to I at present believe I i never see one ' ` well then lord pharanx as i say throw up he post in the fulness of he vigor and retire to one of he country seat a good many year ago he and randolph have a terrible row over some trifle and with the implacability that distinguish they race have not since exchange a word but some little time after the retirement of the father a message be despatch by he to the son who be then in indium consider as the first step in the _ rapprochement _ of this proud and selfish pair of being it be a altogether remarkable message and be subsequently depose to in evidence by a telegraph official it run : ' _ return the beginning of the end be come _ whereupon randolph do return and in three month from the date of he landing in england lord pharanx be dead ' ' _ murder _ ' a certain something in the tone in which this word be utter by zaleskus puzzle I it leave I uncertain whether he have address to I a exclamation of conviction or a simple question i must have look this feeling for he say at once : ' i could easily from you manner surmise as much you know perhaps i might even have foretell it year ago ' ` foretell -- what not the murder of lord pharanx ' ` something of that kind ' he answer with a smile ` but proceed -- tell I all the fact you know ' word-mystery of this sort fall frequent from the lip of the prince i continue the narrative ` the two then meet and be reconcile but it be a reconciliation without cordiality without affection -- a shake of hand across a barrier of brass and even this hand-shaking be a strictly metaphorical one for they do not seem ever to have get beyond the interchange of a frigid bow the opportunity however for observation be few soon after randolph 's arrival at orven hall he father enter on a life of the most absolute seclusion the mansion be a old three-storied one the top floor consist for the most part of sleeping-room the first of a library drawing-room and so on and the ground-floor in addition to the dining and other ordinary room of another small library look out -lrb- at the side of the house -rrb- on a low balcony which in turn look on a lawn dot with flower-bed it be this smaller library on the ground-floor that be now divest of its book and convert into a bedroom for the earl hither he migrate and here he live scarcely ever leave it randolph on he part move to a room on the first floor immediately above this some of the retainer of the family be dismiss and on the remain few fall a hush of expectancy a sense of wonder as to what these thing bode a great enforced quiet pervade the build the least undue noise in any part be sure to be follow by the angry voice of the master demand the cause once as the servant be sup in the kitchen on the side of the house most remote from that which he occupy lord pharanx slipper and in dressing-gown appear at the doorway purple with rage threaten to pack the whole company of they out of door if they do not moderate the clatter of they knife and fork he have always be regard with fear in he own household and the very sound of he voice now become a terror he food be take to he in the room he have make he habitation and it be remark that though simple before in he gustatory taste he now -- possibly owe to the sedentary life he lead -- become fastidious insist on _ recherché _ bit i mention all these detail to you -- as i shall mention other -- not because they have the least connection with the tragedy as it subsequently occur but merely because i know they and you have request I to state all i know ' ` yes ' he answer with a suspicion of _ ennui _ ` you be right i may as well hear the whole -- if i must hear a part ' ` meanwhile randolph appear to have visit the earl at least once a day in such retirement do he too live that many of he friend still suppose he to be in indium there be only one respect in which he break through this privacy you know of course that the orven be and i believe always have be note as the most obstinate the most crabbed of conservative in politics even among the past-enamoured family of england they stand out conspicuously in this respect be it credible to you then that randolph should offer himself to the radical association of the borough of orven as a candidate for the next election in opposition to the sit member it be on record too that he speak at three public meeting -- report in local papers -- at which he avow he political conversion afterwards lay the foundation-stone of a new baptist chapel preside at a methodist tea-meeting and take a abnormal interest in the debased condition of the labourer in the village round fit up as a class-room a apartment on the top floor at orven hall and gather round he on two evening in every week a class of yokel whom he proceed to cram with demonstration in elementary mechanic ' ` mechanic ' cry zaleskus start upright for a moment ` mechanic to agricultural labourer why not elementary chemistry why not elementary botany _ why _ mechanic ' this be the first evidence of interest he have show in the story i be pleased but answer : ` the point be unimportant and there really be no accounting for the vagary of such a man he wish i imagine to give some idea to the young illiterate of the simple law of motion and force but now i come to a new character in the drama -- the chief character of all one day a woman present herself at orven hall and demand to see its owner she speak english with a strong french accent though approach middle life she be still beautiful have wild black eye and creamy pale face she dress be tawdry cheap and loud showing sign of wear she hair be unkempt she manners be not the manners of a lady a certain vehemence exasperation unrepose distinguish all she say and do the footman refuse she admission lord pharanx he say be invisible she persist violently push past he and have to be forcibly eject during all which the voice of the master be hear roar from the passage red-eyed remonstrance at the unusual noise she go away gesticulate wildly and vow vengeance on lord pharanx and all the world it be afterwards find that she have take up she abode in one of the neighbouring hamlet call lee ` this person who give the name of maude cibra subsequently call at the hall three time in succession and be each time refuse admittance it be now however think advisable to inform randolph of she visit he say she might be permit to see he if she return this she do on the next day and have a long interview in private with he she voice be hear raise as if in angry protest by one hester dyett a servant of the house while randolph in low tone seem to try to soothe she the conversation be in french and no word could be make out she pass out at length toss she head jauntily and smile a vulgar triumph at the footman who have before oppose she ingress she be never know to seek admission to the house again ` but she connection with its inmate do not cease the same hester assert that one night come home late through the park she see two person converse on a bench beneath the tree creep behind some bush and discover that they be the strange woman and randolph the same servant bear evidence to track they to other meeting-place and to find in the letter-bag letter address to maude cibra in randolph 's hand-writing one of these be actually unearth later on indeed so engrossing do the intercourse become that it seem even to have interfere with the outburst of radical zeal in the new political convert the _ rendezvous _ -- always hold under cover of darkness but naked and open to the eye of the watchful hester -- sometimes clash with the science lecture when these latter would be put off so that they become gradually fewer and then almost cease ' ` you narrative become unexpectedly interesting ' say zaleski ` but this unearth letter of randolph 's -- what be in it ' i read as follow : ` dear mdlle cibra -- i be exert my utmost influence for you with my father but he show no sign of come round as yet if i could only induce he to see you but he be as you know a person of unrelent will and meanwhile you must confide in my loyal effort on you behalf at the same time i admit that the situation be a precarious one : you be i be sure well provide for in the present will of lord pharanx but he be on the point -- within say three or four day -- of make another and exasperate as he be at you appearance in england i know there be no chance of you receive a _ centime _ under the new will before then however we must hope that something favourable to you may happen and in the meantime let I implore you not to let you only too just resentment pass beyond the bound of reason sincerely yours randolph ' ' i like the letter ' cry zaleski ` you notice the tone of manly candor but the _ fact _ -- be they true _ do _ the earl make a new will in the time specify ' ` no -- but that may have be because he death intervene ' ` and in the old will _ be _ mdlle cibra provide for ' ` yes -- that at least be correct ' a shadow of pain pass over he face ` and now ' i go on ' i come to the closing scene in which one of england 's foremost man perish by the act of a obscure assassin the letter i have read be write to maude cibra on the 5th of January the next thing that happen be on the 6th when lord pharanx leave he room for another during the whole day and a skilled mechanic be introduce into it for the purpose of effect some alteration ask by hester dyett as he be leave the house what be the nature of he operation the man reply that he have be apply a patent arrangement to the window look out on the balcony for the better protection of the room against burglar several robbery have recently be commit in the neighborhood the sudden death of this man however before the occurrence of the tragedy prevent he evidence be hear on the next day -- the 7th -- hester enter the room with lord pharanx 's dinner fancy though she can not tell why -lrb- inasmuch as he back be towards she he sit in a arm-chair by the fire -rrb- that lord pharanx have be drink heavily ` on the 8th a singular thing befall the earl be at last induce to see maude cibra and during the morning of that day with he own hand write a note inform she of he decision randolph hand the note to a messenger that note also have be make public it read as follow : ` maude cibras -- you may come here to-night after dark walk to the south side of the house come up the step to the balcony and pass in through the open window to my room remember however that you have nothing to expect from I and that from to-night i blot you eternally from my mind : but i will hear you story which i know beforehand to be false destroy this note pharanx ' as i progress with my tale i come to notice that over the countenance of prince zaleskus there grow little by little a singular fixed aspect he small keen feature distort themselves into a expression of what i can only describe as a abnormal _ inquisitiveness _ -- a inquisitiveness most impatient arrogant in its intensity he pupil contract each to a dot become the central _ puncta _ of two ring of fiery light he little sharp tooth seem to gnash once before i have see he look thus greedily when grasp a troglodyte tablet cover with half-effaced hieroglyphic -- he finger livid with the fixity of he grip -- he bent on it that strenuous inquisition that ardent question gaze till by a species of mesmeric dominancy he seem to wrench from it the arcanum it hide from other eye then he lay back pale and faint from the too arduous victory when i have read lord pharanx 's letter he take the paper eagerly from my hand and run he eye over the passage ` tell I -- the end ' he say ` maude cibras ' i go on ` thus invite to a meeting with the earl fail to make she appearance at the appoint time it happen that she have leave she lodgings in the village early that very morning and for some purpose or other have travel to the town of bath randolph too go away the same day in the opposite direction to plymouth he return on the follow morning the 9th soon after walk over to lee and enter into conversation with the keeper of the inn where cibra lodge ask if she be at home and on be tell that she have go away ask further if she have take she luggage with she be inform that she have and have also announce she intention of at once leave england he then walk away in the direction of the hall on this day hester dyett notice that there be many article of value scatter about the earl 's room notably a tiara of old brazilian brilliant sometimes worn by the late lady pharanx randolph -- who be present at the time -- further draw she attention to these by tell she that lord pharanx have choose to bring together in he apartment many of the family jewel and she be instruct to tell the other servant of this fact in case they should notice any suspicious-looking loafer about the estate ` on the 10th both father and son remain in they room all day except when the latter come down to meal at which time he would lock he door behind he and with he own hand take in the earl 's food give as he reason that he father be write a very important document and do not wish to be disturb by the presence of a servant during the forenoon hester dyett hearing loud noise in randolph 's room as if furniture be be remove from place to place find some pretext for knock at he door when he order she on no account to interrupt he again as he be busy pack he clothes in view of a journey to london on the next day the subsequent conduct of the woman show that she curiosity must have be excite to the utmost by the undoubtedly strange spectacle of randolph pack he own clothes during the afternoon a lad from the village be instruct to collect he companion for a science lecture the same evening at eight o'clock and so the eventful day wear on ` we arrive now at this hour of eight pm on this 10th day of January the night be dark and windy some snow have be fall but have now cease in a upper room be randolph engage in expound the element of dynamics in the room under that be hester dyett -- for hester have somehow obtain a key that open the door of randolph 's room and take advantage of he absence upstairs to explore it under she be lord pharanx certainly in bed probably asleep hester tremble all over in a fever of fear and excitement hold a light taper in one hand which she religiously shade with the other for the storm be gusty and the gust tear through the crevice of the rattle old casement toss great flickering shadow on the hanging which frighten she to death she have just time to see that the whole room be in the wildest confusion when suddenly a rougher puff blow out the flame and she be leave in what to she standing as she be on that forbid ground must have be a horror of darkness at the same moment clear and sharp from right beneath she a pistol-shot ring out on she ear for a instant she stand in stone incapable of motion then on she dazed sens there supervene -- so she swear -- the consciousness that some object be move in the room -- move apparently of its own accord -- move in direct opposition to all the law of nature as she know they she imagine that she perceive a phantasm -- a strange something -- globular-white -- look as she say like a good-sized ball of cotton -- rise directly from the floor before she ascend slowly upward as if drive aloft by some invisible force a sharp shock of the sense of the supernatural deprive she of order reason throw forward she arm and utter a shrill scream she rush towards the door but she never reach it : midway she fall prostrate over some object and know no more and when a hour later she be bear out of the room in the arm of randolph himself the blood be drip from a fracture of she right tibia ` meantime in the upper chamber the pistol-shot and the scream of the woman have be hear all eye turn to randolph he stand in the shadow of the mechanical contrivance on which he have be illustrate he point lean for support on it he essay to speak the muscle of he face work but no sound come only after a time be he able to gasp : do you hear something -- from below they answer yes in chorus then one of the lad take a light candle and together they troop out randolph behind they a terrify servant rush up with the news that something dreadful have happen in the house they proceed for some distance but there be a open window on the stair and the light be blow out they have to wait some minute till another be obtain and then the procession move forward once more arrive at lord pharanx 's door and find it lock a lantern be procure and randolph lead they through the house and out on the lawn but have nearly reach the balcony a lad observe a track of small woman 's - foot in the snow a halt be call and then randolph point out another track of foot half obliterate by the snow extend from a coppice close by up to the balcony and form a angle with the first track these latter be great big foot make by ponderous labourer ' boot he hold the lantern over the flower-bed and show how they have be trample down some one find a common scarf such as workman wear and a ring and a locket drop by the burglar in they flight be also find by randolph half bury in the snow and now the foremost reach the window randolph from behind call to they to enter they cry back that they can not the window be close at this reply he seem to be overcome by surprise by terror some one hear he murmur the word my god what can have happen now he horror be increase when one of the lad bear to he a revolting trophy which have be find just outside the window it be the front phalanx of three finger of a human hand again he utter the agonised moan my god and then master he agitation make for the window he find that the catch of the sash have be roughly wrench off and that the sash can be open by merely push it up : do so and enter the room be in darkness : on the floor under the window be find the insensible body of the woman cibras she be alive but have faint she right finger be close round the handle of a large bowie-knife which be cover with blood part of the left be miss all the jewelry have be steal from the room lord pharanx lie on the bed stab through the bedclothes to the heart later on a bullet be also find imbed in he brain i should explain that a trenchant edge run along the bottom of the sash be the obvious means by which the finger of cibra have be cut off this have be place there a few day before by the workman i speak of several secret spring have be place on the inner side of the lower horizontal piece of the window-frame by press any one of which the sash be lower so that no one ignorant of the secret could pass out from within without rest the hand on one of these spring and so bring down the armed sash suddenly on the underlie hand ` there be of course a trial the poor culprit in mortal terror of death shriek out a confession of the murder just as the jury have return from they brief consultation and before they have time to pronounce they verdict of guilty but she deny shooting lord pharanx and she deny steal the jewel and indeed no pistol and no jewel be find on she or anywhere in the room so that many point remain mysterious what part do the burglar play in the tragedy be they in collusion with cibra have the strange behavior of at least one of the inmate of orven hall no hidden significance the wildest guess be make throughout the country theory propound but no theory explain _ all _ the point the ferment however have now subside to-morrow morning maude cibra end she life on the gallows ' thus i end my narrative without a word zaleskus rise from the couch and walk to the organ assist from behind by ham who foreknow he master 's every whim he proceed to render with infinite feel a air from the _ lakmé _ of delibe long he sit dreamily utter the melody he head sunken on he breast when at last he rise he great expanse of brow be clear and a smile all but solemn in its serenity be on he lip he walk up to a ivory _ escritoire _ scribble a few word on a sheet of paper and hand it to the negro with the order to take my trap and drive with the message in all haste to the nearest telegraph office ` that message ' he say resume he place on the couch ` be a last word on the tragedy and will no doubt produce some modification in the final stage of its history and now shiel let we sit together and confer on this matter from the manner in which you have express yourself it be evident that there be point which puzzle you -- you do not get a clean _ coup d'oeil _ of the whole regiment of fact and they cause and they consequence as they occur let we see if out of that confusion we can not produce a coherence a symmetry a great wrong be do and on the society in which it be do be impose the task of make it translucent of see it in all its relation and of punish it but what happen the society fail to rise to the occasion on the whole it contrive to make the opacity more opaque do not see the crime in any human sense be unable to punish it now this you will admit whenever it occur be a woful failure : woful i mean not very in itself but very in its significance : and there must be a precise cause for it that cause be the lack of something not merely or specially in the investigator of the wrong but in the world at large -- shall we not boldly call it the lack of culture do not however misunderstand I : by the term i mean not so much attainment in general as _ mood _ in particular whether or when such mood may become universal may be to you a matter of doubt as for I i often think that when the era of civilisation begin -- as assuredly it shall some day begin -- when the race of the world cease to be credulous ovine mob and become critical human nation then will be the usher in of the ten thousand year of a _ clairvoyant _ culture but nowhere and at no time during the very few hundred of year that man have occupy the earth have there be one single sign of its presence in individual yes -- in the greek plato and i think in you english milton and bishop berkeley -- but in humanity never and hardly in any individual outside those two nation the reason i fancy be not so much that man be a hopeless fool as that time so far as he be concern have as we know only just begin : it be of course conceivable that the creation of a perfect society of man as the first requisite to a _ régime _ of culture must nick to itself a longer loop of time than the making of say a stratum of coal a loquacious person -- he be one of you cherish novel-writer by the way if that be indeed a novel in which there be nowhere any pretence at novelty -- once assure I that he could never reflect without swell on the greatness of the age in which he live a age the mighty civilisation of which he liken to the augustan and periclean a certain stony gaze of anthropological interest with which i regard he frontal bone seem to strike the poor man dumb and he take a hurry departure could he have be ignorant that ours be in general greater than the periclean for the very reason that the divinity be neither the devil nor a bungler that three thousand year of human consciousness be not nothing that a whole be greater than its part and a butterfly than a chrysali but it be the assumption that it be therefore in any way great in the abstract that occasion my profound astonishment and indeed contempt civilisation if it mean anything can only mean the art by which man live musically together -- to the luting as it be of panpipe or say perhaps to triumphant organ-burst of martial march dithyramb any formulum define it as the art of lie back and get elaborately tickled should surely at this hour be _ too _ primitive -- _ too _ opic -- to bring anything but a smile to the lip of grown white-skinned man and the very fact that such a definition can still find undoubting acceptance in all quarter may be a indication that the true -lrb- greek : _ idéa _ -rrb- which this condition of be must finally assume be far indeed -- far perhaps by age and aeon -- from become part of the general conception nowhere since the beginning have the gross problem of live ever so much as approach solution much less the delicate and intricate one of live _ together : à propo _ of which you body corporate not only still produce criminal -lrb- as the body-natural flea -rrb- but its very elementary organism can not so much as catch a really athletic one as yet meanwhile _ you _ and _ i _ be handicap the individual travaileth in pain in the struggle for quality power air he spend he strength and yet hardly escape asphyxiation he can no more wriggle himself free of the psychic gravitation that invest he than the earth can shake herself loose of the sun or he of the omnipotence that rivet he to the universe if by chance one shoot a downy hint of wing a instant feeling of contrast puff he with self-consciousness : a tragedy at once : the unconscious be the alone complete to attain to anything he must need screw the head up into the atmosphere of the future while foot and hand drip dark ichor of despair from the crucify cross of the crude present -- _ a horrid strain _ far up a nightly instigation of star he see : but he may not strike they with the head if earth be a boat and mine i know well toward what wild azimuth i would compel she helm : but gravity gravity -- chiefest curse of eden 's sin -- be hostile when indeed -lrb- as be ordain -rrb- the old mother swing herself into a sublimer orbit we on she back will follow : till then we make to ourselves icarian organa in vain i mean to say that it be the plane of station which be at fault : move that upward you move all but meantime be it not goethe who assure we that further reacheth no man make he what stretch he will for man you perceive be not many but one it be absurd to suppose that england can be free while poland be enslave pari be _ far _ from the beginning of civilisation whilst toobooloo and chicago be barbaric probably no ill-fated microcephalous son of adam ever tumble into a mistake quite so huge so infantile as do dive if he imagine himself rich while lazarus sit pauper at the gate not many i say but one even ham and i here in we retreat be not alone we be embarrass by the uninvited spirit of the present the adamant root of the mountain on whose summit we stand be base ineradicably in the low world yet thank heaven goethe be not _ quite _ right -- as indeed he prove in he proper person i tell you shiel i _ know _ whether mary do or do not murder darnley i know -- as clearly as precisely as a man can know -- that beatrice cencus be not guilty as certain recently-discovered document prove she but that the shelley version of the affair though a guess be the correct one it _ be _ possible by take think to add one cubit -- or say a hand or a dactyl -- to you stature you may develop power slightly -- very slightly but distinctly both in kind and degree -- in advance of those of the mass who live in or about the same cycle of time in which you live but it be only when the power to which i refer be share by the mass -- when what for want of another term i call the age of the culture mood have at length arrive -- that they exercise will become easy and familiar to the individual and who shall say what prescience prism _ séances _ what introspective craft genie apocalypse shall not _ then _ become possible to the few who stand spiritually in the van of man ` all this you will understand i say as some sort of excuse for myself and for you for any hesitation we may have show in loosen the very little puzzle you have place before I -- one which we certainly must not regard as difficult of solution of course look at all the fact the first consideration that must inevitably rivet the attention be that arise from the circumstance that viscount randolph have strong reason to wish he father dead they be avowed enemy he be the _ fiancé _ of a princess whose husband he be probably too poor to become though he will very likely be rich enough when he father die and so on all that appear on the surface on the other hand we -- you and i -- know the man : he be a person of gentle blood as moral we suppose as ordinary people occupy a high station in the world it be impossible to imagine that such a person would commit a assassination or even countenance one for any or all of the reason that present themselves in we heart with or without clear proof we could hardly believe it of he earl ' son do not in fact go about murder people unless then we can so reason as to discover other motive -- strong adequate irresistible -- and by irresistible i mean a motive which must be _ far _ stronger than even the love of life itself -- we should i think in fairness dismiss he from we mind ` and yet it must be admit that he conduct be not free of blame he contract a sudden intimacy with the acknowledged culprit whom he do not seem to have know before he meet she by night correspond with she who and what be this woman i think we could not be far wrong in guess some very old flame of lord pharanx 's of _ théâtre des variétés _ type whom he have support for year and from whom hear some story to she discredit he threaten to withdraw he supplies however that be randolph write to cibra -- a violent woman a woman of lawless passion -- assure she that in four or five day she will be exclude from the will of he father and in four or five day cibras plunge a knife into he father 's bosom it be a perfectly natural sequence -- though of course the _ intention _ to produce by he word the actual effect produce might have be absent indeed the letter of lord pharanx himself have it be receive would have tend to produce that very effect for it not only give a excellent opportunity for convert into action those evil thought which randolph -lrb- thoughtlessly or guiltily -rrb- have instil but it further tend to rouse she passion by cut off from she all hope of favor if we presume then as be only natural that there be no such intention on the part of the earl we _ may _ make the same presumption in the case of the son cibra however never receive the earl 's letter : on the morning of the same day she go away to bath with the double object i suppose of purchase a weapon and create a impression that she have leave the country how then do she know the exact _ locale _ of lord pharanx 's room it be in a unusual part of the mansion she be unacquainted with any of the servant a stranger to the district can it be possible that randolph _ have tell she _ and here again even in that case you must bear in mind that lord pharanx also tell she in he note and you must recognize the possibility of the absence of evil intention on the part of the son indeed i may go further and show you that in all but every instance in which he action be in themselves _ outré _ suspicious they be render not less _ outré _ but less suspicious by the fact that lord pharanx himself know of they share in they there be the cruel barbing of that balcony window about it the crudest thinker would argue thus to himself : randolph practically incite maude cibra to murder he father on the 5th and on the 6th he have that window so altered in order that should she act on he suggestion she will be catch on attempt to leave the room while he himself the actual culprit be discover _ en flagrant délit _ will escape every shadow of suspicion but on the other hand we know that the alteration be make with lord pharanx 's consent most likely on he initiative -- for he leave he favored room during a whole day for that very purpose so with the letter to cibras on the 8th -- randolph despatch it but the earl write it so with the disposal of the jewel in the apartment on the 9th there have be some burglary in the neighborhood and the suspicion at once arise in the mind of the crude reasoner : could randolph -- find now that cibra have leave the country that in fact the tool he have expect to serve he end have fail he -- could he have thus bring those jewel there and thus warn the servant of they presence in the hope that the intelligence might so get abroad and lead to a burglary in the course of which he father might lose he life there be evidence you know tend to show that the burglary do actually at last take place and the suspicion be in view of that by no means unreasonable and yet militate against it be we knowledge that it be lord pharanx who _ choose _ to gather the jewel round he that it be in he presence that randolph draw the attention of the servant to they in the matter at least of the little political comedy the son seem to have act alone but you surely can not rid yourself of the impression that the radical speech the candidature and the rest of it form all of they only a very elaborate and withal clumsy set of preliminary to the _ class _ anything to make the perspective the sequence of _ that _ seem natural but in the class at any rate we have the tacit acquiescence or even the cooperation of lord pharanx you have describe the conspiracy of quiet which for some reason or other be impose on the household in that reign of silence the bang of a door the fall of a plate become a domestic tornado but have you ever hear a agricultural labourer in clog or heavy boot ascend a stair the noise be terrible the tramp of a army of they through the house and overhead probably jabber uncouthly together would be insufferable yet lord pharanx seem to have make no objection the novel institution be set up in he own mansion in a unusual part of it probably against he own principle but we hear of no murmur from he on the fatal day too the calm of the house be rudely break by a considerable commotion in randolph 's room just overhead cause by he preparation for a journey to london but the usual angry remonstrance be not forthcoming from the master and do you not see how all this more than acquiescence of lord pharanx in the conduct of he son deprive that conduct of half its significance its intrinsic suspiciousness ' a hasty reasoner then would inevitably jump to the conclusion that randolph be guilty of something -- some evil intention -- though of precisely what he would remain in doubt but a more careful reasoner would pause : he would reflect that _ as _ the father be implicate in those act and _ as _ he be innocent of any such intention so might possibly even probably be the son this i take it have be the view of the official whose logic be probably far in advance of they imagination but suppose we can adduce one act undoubtedly actuate by evil intention on the part of randolph -- one act in which he father certainly do _ not _ participate -- what follow next why that we revert at once to the view of the hasty reasoner and conclude that _ all _ the other act in the same relation be actuate by the same evil motive and have reach that point we shall be unable longer to resist the conclusion that those of they in which he father have a share _ might _ have spring from a like motive in _ he _ mind also nor should the mere obvious impossibility of such a condition of thing have even the very least influence on we as thinker in cause we to close we mind against its logical possibility i therefore make the inference and pass on ` let we then see if we can by search find out any absolutely certain deviation from right on the part of randolph in which we may be quite sure that he father be not a abettor at eight on the night of the murder it be dark there have be some snow but the fall have cease -- how long before i know not but so long that the interval become sufficiently appreciable to cause remark now the party go round the house come on two track of foot meet at a angle of one track we be merely tell that it be make by the small foot of a woman and of it we know no more of the other we learn that the foot be big and the boot clumsy and it be add the mark be _ half obliterate by the snow _ two thing then be clear : that the person who make they come from different direction and probably make they at different time that alone by the way may be a sufficient answer to you question as to whether cibra be in collusion with the burglar but how do randolph behave with reference to these track though he carry the lantern he fail to perceive the first -- the woman 's -- the discovery of which be make by a lad but the second half hide in the snow he notice readily enough and at once point it out he explain that burglar have be on the war-path but examine he horror of surprise when he hear that the window be close when he see the woman 's bleeding finger he can not help exclaim my god what have happen _ now _ but why now the word can not refer to he father 's death for that he know or guess beforehand have hear the shot be it not rather the exclamation of a man whose scheme destiny have complicate besides he should have _ expect _ to find the window close : no one except himself lord pharanx and the workman who be now dead know the secret of its construction the burglar therefore have enter and rob the room one of they intend to go out would press on the ledge and the sash would fall on he hand with what result we know the other would then either break the glass and so escape or pass through the house or remain prisoner that immoderate surprise be therefore absurdly illogical after see the burglar-track in the snow but how above all do you account for lord pharanx 's silence during and after the burglar ' visit -- if there be a visit he be you must remember alive all that time _ they _ do not kill he certainly they do not shoot he for the shot be hear after the snow have cease to fall -- that be after long after they have leave since it be the fall snow that have half obliterate they track nor do they stab he for to this cibras confess why then be alive and not gag do he give no token of the presence of he visitor there be in fact no burglar at orven hall that night ' ` but the track ' i cry ` the jewel find in the snow -- the neckerchief ' zaleskus smile ` burglar ' he say ` be plain honest folk who have a just notion of the value of jewelry when they see it they very properly regard it as mere foolish waste to drop precious stone about in the snow and would refuse to company with a man weak enough to let fall he neckerchief on a cold night the whole business of the burglar be a particularly inartistic trick unworthy of its author the mere facility with which randolph discover the bury jewel by the aid of a dim lantern should have serve as a hint to a educate police not afraid of face the improbable the jewel have be _ put _ there with the object of throw suspicion on the imaginary burglar with the same design the catch of the window have be wrench off the sash purposely leave open the track make the valuable take from lord pharanx 's room all this be deliberately do by some one -- would it be rash to say at once by whom ` we suspicion have now lose they whole character of vagueness and begin to lead we in a perfectly definite direction let we examine the statement of hester dyett now it be immediately comprehensible to I that the evidence of this woman at the public examination be look at askance there can be no doubt that she be a poor specimen of humanity a undesirable servant a peer hysterical caricature of a woman she statement if formally record be not believe or if believe be believe with only half the mind no attempt be make to deduce anything from they but for my part if i want specially reliable evidence as to any matter of fact it be precisely from such a be that i would seek it let I draw you a picture of that class of intellect they have a greed for information but the information to satisfy they must relate to actuality they have no sympathy with fiction it be from they impatience of what seem to be that spring they curiosity of what _ be _ clio be they muse and she alone they whole lust be to gather knowledge through a hole they whole faculty be to _ peep _ but they be destitute of imagination and do not lie in they passion for reality they would esteem it a sacrilege to distort history they make straight for the substantial the indubitable for this reason the peniculus and ergasilus of plautus seem to I far more true to nature than the character of paul pry in jerrold 's comedy in one instance indeed the evidence of hester dyett appear on the surface of it to be quite false she declare that she see a round white object move upward in the room but the night be gloomy she taper have go out she must have be stand in a dense darkness how then could she see this object she evidence it be argue must be designedly false or else -lrb- as she be in a ecstatic condition -rrb- the result of a excited fancy but i have state that such person nervous neurotic even as they may be be not fanciful i therefore accept she evidence as true and now mark the consequence of that acceptance i be drive to admit that there must from some source have be light in the room -- a light faint enough and diffused enough to escape the notice of hester herself this be so it must have proceed from around from below or from above there be no other alternative around these be nothing but the darkness of the night the room beneath we know be also in darkness the light then come from the room above -- from the mechanic class-room but there be only one possible means by which the light from a upper can diffuse a lower room it _ must _ be by a hole in the intermediate board we be thus drive to the discovery of a aperture of some sort in the flooring of that upper chamber give this the mystery of the round white object drive upward disappear we at once ask why not _ draw _ upward through the newly-discovered aperture by a string too small to be visible in the gloom assuredly it be draw upward and now have establish a hole in the ceiling of the room in which hester stand be it unreasonable -- even without further evidence -- to suspect another in the flooring but we actually have this further evidence as she rush to the door she fall faint and fracture the lower part of she leg have she fall _ over _ some object as you suppose the result might have be a fracture also but in a different part of the body be where it be it could only have be cause by place the foot inadvertently in a hole while the rest of the body be in rapid motion but this give we a approximate idea of the _ size _ of the lower hole it be at least big enough to admit the foot and lower leg big enough therefore to admit that good-sized ball of cotton of which the woman speak : and from the lower we be able to conjecture the size of the upper but how come it that these hole be nowhere mention in the evidence it can only be because no one ever see they yet the room must have be examine by the police who if they exist must have see they they therefore do not exist : that be to say the piece which have be remove from the flooring have by that time be neatly replace and in the case of the lower one cover by the carpet the removal of which have cause so much commotion in randolph 's room on the fatal day hester dyett would have be able to notice and bring at least one of the aperture forward in evidence but she faint before she have time to find out the cause of she fall and a hour later it be you remember randolph himself who bear she from the room but should not the aperture in the top floor have be observe by the class undoubtedly if its position be in the open space in the middle of the room but it be not observe and therefore its position be not there but in the only other place leave -- behind the apparatus use in demonstration that then be _ one _ useful object which the apparatus -- and with it the elaborate hypocrisy of class and speech and candidature -- serve : it be make to act as a curtain a screen but have it no other purpose that question we may answer when we know its name and its nature and it be not beyond we power to conjecture this with something like certainty for the only machine possible to use in illustration of simple mechanic be the screw the wedge the scale the lever the wheel-and-axle and atwood 's machine the mathematical principle which any of these exemplify would of course be incomprehensible to such a class but the first five most of all and as there would naturally be some slight pretence of try to make the learner understand i therefore select the last and this selection be justified when we remember that on the shot be hear randolph lean for support on the machine and stand in its shadow but any of the other would be too small to throw any appreciable shadow except one -- the wheel and-axle -- and that one would hardly afford support to a tall man in the erect position the atwood 's machine be therefore force on we as to its construction it be as you be aware compose of two upright post with a cross-bar fit with pulley and string and be intend to show the motion of body act under a constant force -- the force of gravity to wit but now consider all the really glorious use to which those same pulley may be turn in lower and lift unobserved that ball of cotton through the two aperture while the other string with the weight attach be dangle before the dull eye of the peasant i need only point out that when the whole company troop out of the room randolph be the last to leave it and it be not now difficult to conjecture why ` of what then have we convict randolph for one thing we have show that by mark of foot in the snow preparation be make beforehand for obscure the cause of the earl 's death that death must therefore have be at least expect foreknown thus we convict he of expect it and then by a independent line of deduction we can also discover the _ mean _ by which he expect it to occur it be clear that he do not expect it to occur when it do by the hand of maude cibra -- for this be prove by he knowledge that she have leave the neighborhood by he evidently genuine astonishment at the sight of the close window and above all by he truly morbid desire to establish a substantial a irrefutable _ alibi _ for himself by go to plymouth on the day when there be every reason to suppose she would do the deed -- that be on the 8th the day of the earl 's invitation on the fatal night indeed the same morbid eagerness to build up a clear _ alibi _ be observable for he surround himself with a cloud of witness in the upper chamber but that you will admit be not nearly so perfect a one as a journey say to plymouth would have be why then expect the death do he not take some such journey obviously because on _ this _ occasion he personal presence be necessary when _ in conjunction _ with this we recall the fact that during the intrigue with cibra the lecture be discontinue and again resume immediately on she unlooked-for departure we arrive at the conclusion that the means by which lord pharanx 's death be expect to occur be the personal presence of randolph _ in conjunction _ with the political speech the candidature the class the apparatus ` but though he stand condemn of foreknowing and be in some sort connect with he father 's death i can nowhere find any indication of he have personally accomplish it or even of he ever have have any such intention the evidence be evidence of complicity -- and nothing more and yet -- and yet -- even of _ this _ we begin by acquit he unless we could discover as i say some strong adequate altogether irresistible motive for such complicity fail this we ought to admit that at some point we argument have play we false and lead we into conclusion wholly at variance with we certain knowledge of the principle underlie human conduct in general let we therefore seek for such a motive -- something deeper than personal enmity stronger than personal ambition _ than the love of life itself _ and now tell I at the time of the occurrence of this mystery be the whole past history of the house of orven fully investigate ' ` not to my knowledge ' i answer ` in the papers there be of course sketch of the earl 's career but that i think be all ' ` yet it can not be that they past be unknown but only that it be ignore long i tell you long and often have i pondered on that history and seek to trace with what ghastly secret have be pregnant the destiny gloomful as erebus and the murk of black-peplosed nux which for century have hang its pall over the man of this ill-fated house now at last i know dark dark and red with gore and horror be that history down the silent corridor of the age have these blood-soaked son of atreus flee shriek before the pursue talon of the dread eumenide the first earl receive he patent in 1535 from the eighth henry two year later though note as a rabid king 's man he join the pilgrimage of grace against he master and be soon after execute with darcy and some other lord he age be then fifty he son meantime have serve in the king 's army under norfolk it be remarkable by the way that female have all along be rare in the family and that in no instance have there be more than one son the second earl under the sixth edward suddenly throw up a civil post hasten to the army and fall at the age of forty at the battle of pinkie in 1547 he be accompany by he son the third in 1557 under mary renounce the catholic faith to which both before and since the family have passionately clung and suffer -lrb- at the age of forty -rrb- the last penalty the fourth earl die naturally but suddenly in he bed at the age of fifty during the winter of 1566 at midnight _ of the same day _ he be lay in the grave by he son this son be later on in 1591 see by _ he _ son to fall from a lofty balcony at orven hall while walk in he sleep at high noonday then for some time nothing happen but the eighth earl die mysteriously in 1651 at the age of forty-five a fire occur in he room he leap from a window to escape the flame some of he limb be thereby fracture but he be in a fair way to recovery when there be a sudden relapse soon end in death he be find to have be poison by _ radix aconitus indica _ a rare arabian poison not know in europe at that time except to _ savant _ and first mention by acosta some month before a attendant be accuse and try but acquit the then son of the house be a fellow of the newly-founded royal society and author of a now-forgotten work on toxicology which however i have read no suspicion of course fall on _ he _ ' as zaleskus proceed with this retrospect i could not but ask myself with stirring of the most genuine wonder whether he could possess this intimate knowledge of _ all _ the great family of europe it be as if he have spend a part of he life in make special study of the history of the orven ` in the same manner ' he go on ' i could detail the annals of the family from that time to the present but all through they have be mark by the same latent tragic element and i have say enough to show you that in each of the tragedy there be invariably something large leering something of which the mind demand explanation but seek in vain to find it now we need no longer seek destiny do not design that the last lord of orven should any more hide from the world the guilty secret of he race it be the will of the god -- and he betray himself return he write the beginning of the end be come what end _ the _ end -- perfectly well know to randolph need no explanation for _ he _ the old old end which in the ancient dim time lead the first lord loyal still at heart to forsake he king and another still devout to renounce he cherish faith and yet another to set fire to the home of he ancestor you have call the two last scion of the family a proud and selfish pair of being proud they be and selfish too but you be in error if you think they selfishness a personal one : on the contrary they be singularly oblivious of self in the ordinary sense of the word theirs be the pride and the selfishness of _ race _ what consideration think you other than the weal of he house could induce lord randolph to take on himself the shame -- for as such he certainly regard it -- of a conversion to radicalism he would i be convince have _ die _ rather than make this pretence for merely personal end but he do it -- and the reason it be because he have receive that awful summons from home because the end be daily come nearer and it must not find he unprepared to meet it it be because lord pharanx 's sens be become _ too _ acute because the clatter of the servant ' knife at the other end of the house inflame he to madness because he excited palate can no longer endure any food but the subtlest delicacy because hester dyett be able from the posture in which he sit to conjecture that he be intoxicate because in fact he be on the brink of the dreadful malady which physician call _ general paralysis of the insane _ you remember i take from you hand the newspaper contain the earl 's letter to cibras in order to read it with my own eye i have my reason and i be justified that letter contain three mistake in spelling : here be print hear pass appear as pa and room as rume printer ' error you say but not so -- one might be two in that short paragraph could hardly be three would be impossible search the whole paper through and i think you will not find another let we reverence the theory of probability : the error be the writer 's not the printer 's general paralysis of the insane be know to have this effect on the write it attack its victim about the period of middle age -- the age at which the death of all the orven who die mysteriously occur finding then that the dire heritage of he race -- the heritage of madness -- be fall or fall on he he summons he son from indium on himself he pass sentence of death : it be the tradition of the family the secret vow of self-destruction hand down through age from father to son but he must have aid : in these day it be difficult for a man to commit the suicidal act without detection -- and if madness be a disgrace to the race equally so be suicide besides the family be to be enrich by the insurance on he life and be thereby to be ally with royal blood but the money will be lose if the suicide be detect randolph therefore return and blossom into a popular candidate ` for a time he be lead to abandon he original plan by the appearance of maude cibra he hope that _ she _ may be make to destroy the earl but when she fail he he recur to it -- recur to it all suddenly for lord pharanx 's condition be rapidly become critical patent to all eye could any eye see he -- so much so that on the last day none of the servant be allow to enter he room we must therefore regard cibra as a mere addendum to a extraneous element in the tragedy not as a integral part of it she do not shoot the noble lord for she have no pistol nor do randolph for he be at a distance from the bed of death surround by witness nor do the imaginary burglar the earl therefore shoot himself and it be the small globular silver pistol such as this ' -- here zaleskus draw a little embossed venetian weapon from a drawer near he -- ` that appear in the gloom to the excited hester as a ball of cotton while it be be draw upward by the atwood 's machine but if the earl shoot himself he could not have do so after be stab to the heart maude cibra therefore stab a dead man she would of course have ample time for steal into the room and do so after the shot be fire and before the party reach the balcony window on account of the delay on the stair in procure a second light in go to the earl 's door in examine the track and so on but have stab a dead man she be not guilty of murder the message i just now send by ham be one address to the home secretary tell he on no account to let cibra die to-morrow he well know my name and will hardly be silly enough to suppose I capable of use word without mean it will be perfectly easy to prove my conclusion for the piece remove from and replace in the flooring can still be detect if look for the pistol be still no doubt in randolph 's room and its bear can be compare with the bullet find in lord pharanx 's brain above all the jewel steal by the burglar be still safe in some cabinet of the new earl and may readily be discover i therefore expect that the dénoûment will now take a somewhat different turn ' that the dénoûment do take a different turn and pretty strictly in accordance with zaleskus 's forecast be now matter of history and the incident therefore need no further comment from I in this place the stone of the edmundsbury monk ` russium ' say prince zaleskus to I one day when i happen to be on a visit to he in he darksome sanctuary -- ` russium may be regard as land surround by ocean that be to say she be a island in the same way it be sheer gross irrelevancy to speak of _ britain _ as a island unless indeed the word be understand as a mere _ modus loquendus _ arise out of a rather poor geographical pleasantry britain in reality be a small continent near she -- a little to the south-east -- be situate the large island of europe thus the enlighten french traveller pass to these shore should commune within himself : i now cross to the mainland and retrace he step : i now return to the fragment rent by wrack and earthshock from the mother-country and this i say not in the way of paradox but as the expression of a sober truth i have in my mind merely the relative depth and extent -- the _ non-insularity _ in fact -- of the impression make by the several nation on the world but this island of europe have herself a island of she own : the name of it russium she of all land be the _ terra incognita _ the unknown land till quite lately she be more -- she be the undiscovered the unsuspected land she _ have _ a literature you know and a history and a language and a purpose -- but of all this the world have hardly so much as hear indeed she and not any antarctic sea whatever be the real ultima thule of modern time the true island of mystery ' i reproduce these remark of zaleskus here not so much on account of the splendid tribute to my country contain in they as because it ever seem to I -- and especially in connection with the incident i be about to recall -- that in this respect at least he be a genuine son of russium if she be the land so truly be he the man of mystery i who know he best alone know that it be impossible to know he he be a be little of the present : with one arm he embrace the whole past the finger of the other heave on the vibrant pulse of the future he seem to I -- i say it deliberately and with forethought -- to possess the unparalleled power not merely of disentangle in retrospect but of unravel in prospect and i have know he to relate _ come _ event with unimaginable minuteness of precision he be nothing if not superlative : he diatribe now culminate in a very _ extravaganza _ of hyperbole -- now sail with loose wing through the downy witched dutch cloud-heap of some quaintest tramontane nephelococcugium of thought -- now lay down law of the mede for the actual world of to-day -- have oft-time the strange effect of bring back to my mind the very singular old-epic epithet -lrb- greek : aenemoen -rrb- -- _ airy _ -- as apply to human think the mere grip of he memory be not simply extraordinary it have in it a token a hint of the strange the pythic -- nay the sibylline and as he reflect intellect moreover have all the lightness of foot of a chamoix kid unless you could contrive to follow each dazzlingly swift successive step by the sum of which he attain he alp-height he inevitably leave on you the astounding the confounding impression of mental omnipresence i have bring with I a certain document a massive book bind in iron and leather the diary of one sir jocelin saul this i have abstract from a gentleman of my acquaintance the head of a firm of inquiry agent in london into whose hand only the day before it have come a distant neighbor of sir jocelin hearing by chance of he extremity have invoke the assistance of this firm but the aged baronet be in a state of the utmost feebleness terror and indeed hysterical incoherence have be able to utter no word in explanation of he condition or wish and in silent abandonment have merely hand the book to the agent a day or two after i have reach the desolate old mansion which the prince occupy know that he might sometimes be induce to take a absorb interest in question that have prove themselves too profound or too intricate for ordinary solution i ask he if he be willing to hear the detail read out from the diary and on he assent i proceed to do so the brief narrative have reference to a very large and very valuable oval gem enclose in the substance of a golden chalice which chalice in the monastery of st edmundsbury have once lain century long within the loculus or inmost coffin wherein repose the body of st edmund by press a hidden pivot the cup -lrb- which be compose of two equal part connect by minute hinge -rrb- spring open and in a hollow space at the bottom be disclose the gem sir jocelin saul i may say be lineally connect with -- though of course not descendant from -- that same jocelin of brakelonda a brother of the edmundsbury convent who write the now so celebrated _ jocelinus chronica _ : and the chalice have fall into the possession of the family seemingly at some time prior to the suppression of the monastery about 1537 on it be inscribe in old english character of unknown date the word : ` shulde this ston stalen bee or shuld it chaunge dre the houss of sawl and hy hed anoon shal de ' the stone itself be a intaglio and have engrave on its surface the figure of a mythological animal together with some nearly obliterate letter of which the only one remain legible be those form the word ` have ' as a sure precaution against the loss of the gem another cup have be make and engrave in a exactly similar manner inside of which to complete the delusion another stone of the same size and cut but of comparatively valueless material have be place sir jocelin saul a man of intense nervosity live he life alone in a remote old manor-house in suffolk he only companion be a person of eastern origin name ul-jabal the baronet have consume he vitality in the life-long attempt to sound the too fervid maelstrom of oriental research and he mind have perhaps catch from he study a tinge of they morbidness they esotericism they insanity he have for some year past be engage in the task of write a stupendous work on pre-zoroastrian theogony in which it be to be suppose ul-jabal act somewhat in the capacity of secretary but i will give _ verbatim _ the extract from he diary : ' _ June 11 _ -- this be my birthday seventy year ago exactly i slide from the belly of the great dark into this light and life my god my god it be briefer than the rage of a hour fleeter than a mid-day trance ul-jabal greet I warmly -- seem to have be look forward to it -- and point out that seventy be of the fateful number its only factor be seven five and two : the last denote the duality of birth and death five isolation seven infinity i inform he that this be also my father 's birthday and _ he _ father 's and repeat the oft-told tale of how the latter just seventy year ago to-day walking at twilight by the churchyard-wall see the figure of _ himself _ sit on a grave-stone and die five week later rive with the pang of hell whereat the sceptic show he two huge row of tooth ` what be he peculiar interest in the edmundsbury chalice on each successive birthday when the cup have be produce he have ask I to show he the stone without any well-defined reason i have always decline but to-day i yield he gaze long into its sky-blue depth and then ask if i have no idea what the inscription have mean i inform he that it be one of the lose secret of the world ' _ June l5 _ -- some new element have enter into we existence here something threaten I i hear the echo of a menace against my sanity and my life it be as if the garment

gem a weakness overtake I and i lay for many dreamless hour naked on the marble floor ` do the fool think to hide ought from my eye can he imagine that i shall not recover my precious gem my stone of saul ' _ June 20 _ -- ah ul-jabal -- my brave my noble son of the prophet of god he have replace the stone he would not slay a aged man the yellow ray of he eye it be but the gleam of the great thinker not -- not -- the gleam of the assassin again as i lay in semi-somnolence i see he enter my room this time more distinctly he go up to the cabinet shake the chalice in the dawn some hour after he have leave i hear with delight the rattle of the stone i might have know he would replace it i should not have doubt he clemency to a poor man like I but the strange being -- he have take the _ other _ stone from the _ other _ cup -- a thing of little value to any man be ul-jabal mad or i ' _ June 21 _ -- merciful lord in heaven he have _ not _ replace it -- not _ it _ -- but another instead of it to-day i actually open the chalice and see he have put a stone there the same in size in cut in engrave but different in color in quality in value -- a stone i have never see before how have he obtain it -- whence i must brace myself to probe to watch i must turn myself into a eye to search this devil 's - bosom my life this subtle cunning reason of mine hang in the balance ' _ June 22 _ -- just now he offer I a cup of wine i almost dash it to the ground before he but he look steadfastly into my eye i flinch : and drink -- drink ` year ago when as i remember we be at balbec i see he one day make a almost tasteless preparation out of pure black nicotine which in mere wanton lust he afterwards give to some of the dweller by the caspian to drink but the fiend would surely never dream of give to I that browse of hell -- to I a aged man and a thinker a seer ' _ June 23 _ -- the mysterious the unfathomable ul-jabal once again as i lay in heavy trance at midnight have he invade calm and noiseless as a spirit the sanctity of my chamber serene on the sway air which radiant with soft beam of vermil and violet light rock I into variant vision of heaven i recline and regard he unmoved the man have replace the valueless stone in the modern-made chalice and have now steal the false stone from the other which _ he himself _ put there in patience will i possess this my soul and watch what shall betide my eye shall know no slumber ' _ June 24 _ -- no more -- no more shall i drink wine from the hand of ul-jabal my knee totter beneath the weight of my lean body dagger of lambent fever race through my brain incessant some fibrillary twitching at the right angle of the mouth have also arrest my attention ' _ June 25 _ -- he have dare at open mid-day to enter my room i watch he from a angle of the stair pass along the corridor and open my door but for the terrifying death-boding thump thump of my heart i should have face the traitor then and tell he that i know all he treachery do i say that i have strange fibrillary twitching at the right angle of my mouth and a brain on fire i have cease to write my book -- the more the pity for the world not for I ' _ June 26 _ -- marvellous to tell the traitor ul-jabal have now place _ another _ stone in the edmundsbury chalice -- also identical in nearly every respect with the original gem this then be the object of he entry into my room yesterday so that he have first steal the real stone and replace it by another then he have steal this other and replace it by yet another he have beside steal the valueless stone from the modern chalice and then replace it surely a man go rabid a man go dancing foam rave mad ' _ June 28 _ -- i have now set myself to the task of recover my jewel it be here and i shall find it life against life -- and which be the best life mine or this accursed ishmaelite 's if need be i will do murder -- i with this withered hand -- so that i get back the heritage which be mine ` to-day when i think he be wander in the park i steal into he room lock the door on the inside i tremble exceedingly know that he eye be in every place i ransack the chamber dive among he clothes but find no stone one singular thing in a drawer i saw : a long white beard and a wig of long and snow-white hair as i pass out of the chamber lo he stand face to face with I at the door in the passage my heart give one bind and then seem wholly to cease its travail oh i must be sick unto death weaker than a bruised reed when i wake from my swoon he be support I in he arm now he say grin down at I now you have at last deliver all into my hand he leave I and i see he go into he room and lock the door upon himself what be it i have deliver into the madman 's hand ' _ July 1 _ -- life against life -- and he the young the stalwart rather than mine the moulder the sere i love life not _ yet _ be i ready to weigh anchor and reeve halliard and turn my prow over the watery path of the wine-brown deep oh no not yet let _ he _ die many and many be the day in which i shall yet see the light walk think i be averse to end the number of my year : there be even a feeling in I at time that this worn body shall never never taste of death the chalice predict indeed that i and my house shall end when the stone be lose -- a mere fiction _ at first _ a idler 's dream _ then _ but now -- now -- that the prophecy have stand so long a part of the reality of thing and a fact among fact -- no longer fiction but adamant stern as the very word of god do i not feel hourly since it have go how the surge of life ebb ebb ever lower in my heart nay nay but there be hope i have here beside I a arab blade of subtle damascene steel insinuous to pierce and to hew with which in a street of bethlehem i see a syrian 's head cleft open -- a gallant stroke the edge of this i have make bright and white for a nuptial of blood ' _ July 2 _ -- i spend the whole of the last night in search every nook and crack of the house use a powerful magnify lens at time i think ul-jabal be watch I and would pounce out and murder I convulsive tremor shake my frame like earthquake ah I i fear i be all too frail for this work yet dear be the love of life ' _ July 7 _ -- the last day i have pass in carefully search the grounds with the lens as before ul-jabal constantly find pretext for follow I and i be confident that every step i take be know to he no sign anywhere of the grass have be disturb yet my land be wide and i can not be sure the burden of this mighty task be greater than i can bear i be weaker than a bruised reed shall i not slay my enemy and make a end ' _ July _ 8 -- ul-jabal have be in my chamber again i watch he through a crack in the panel he form be hide by the bed but i could see he hand reflect in the great mirror opposite the door first i can not guess why he move to a point in front of the mirror the chair in which i sometimes sit he then go to the box in which lie my few garment -- and open it ah i have the stone -- safe -- safe he fear my cunning ancient eye and have hide it in the one place where i would be least likely to seek it -- _ in my own trunk _ and yet i dread most intensely i dread to look ' _ July _ 9 -- the stone alas be not there at the last moment he must have change he purpose could he wondrous sensitiveness of intuition have make he feel that my eye be look in on he ' _ July 10 _ -- in the dead of night i know that a stealthy foot have go past my door i rise and throw a mantle round I i put on my head my cap of fur i take the temper blade in my hand then creep out into the dark and follow ul-jabal carry a small lantern which reveal he to I my foot be bare but he wear felted slipper which to my unfailing ear be not utterly noiseless he descend the stair to the bottom of the house while i crouch behind he in the deepest gloom of the corner and wall at the bottom he walk into the pantry : there stop and turn the lantern full in the direction of the spot where i stand but so agilely do i slide behind a pillar that he could not have see I in the pantry he lift the trap-door and descend still further into the vault beneath the house ah the vault -- the long the tortuous the darksome vault -- how have i forget they still i follow rent by seismic shock of terror i have not forget the weapon : could i creep near enough i feel that i might plunge it into the marrow of he back he open the iron door of the first vault and pass in if i could lock he in -- but he hold the key on and on he wind he way hold the lantern near the ground he head bent down the thought come to I _ then _ that have i but the courage one swift sweep and all be over i creep closer closer suddenly he turn round and make a quick step in my direction i see he eye the murderous grin of he jaw i know not if he see I -- think forsake I the weapon fall with clatter and clangor from my grasp and in panic fright i flee with extended arm and the headlong swiftness of a striple through the black labyrinth of the cavern through the vacant corridor of the house till i reach my chamber the door of which i have time to fasten on myself before i drop gasp panting for very life on the floor ' _ July 11 _ -- i have not the courage to see ul-jabal to-day i have remain lock in my chamber all the time without food or water my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth ' _ July 12 _ -- i take heart and creep downstairs i meet he in the study he smile on I and i on he as if nothing have happen between we oh we old friendship how it have turn into bitterest hate i have take the false stone from the edmundsbury chalice and put it in the pocket of my brown gown with the bold intention of show it to he and ask he if he know aught of it but when i face he my courage fail again we drink together and eat together as in the old day of love ` July l3 -- i can not think that i have not again imbibe some soporiferous drug a great heaviness of sleep weigh on my brain till late in the day when i wake my thought be in wild distraction and a most peculiar condition of my skin hold I fix before the mirror it be dry as parchment and brown as the leaf of autumn ` July l4 -- ul-jabal be go and i be leave a lonely a desolate old man he say though i swear it be false that i have grow to mistrust he that i be hide something from he that he could live with I no more no more he say should i see he face the debt i owe he he would forgive he have take one small parcel with he -- and be go ` July l5 -- go go in mazeful dream i wander with uncovered head far and wide over my domain seek i know not what the stone he have with he -- the precious stone of saul i feel the life-surge ebb ebb in my heart ' here the manuscript abruptly end prince zaleskus have listen as i read aloud lie back on he moorish couch and breathing slowly from he lip a heavy reddish vapor which he imbibe from a very small carve bismuth pipette he face as far as i could see in the green-grey crepuscular atmosphere of the apartment be expressionless but when i have finish he turn fully round on I and say : ` you perceive i hope the sinister meaning of all this ' ' _ have _ it a meaning ' zaleskus smile ` can you doubt it in the shape of a cloud the pitch of a thrush 's note the _ nuance _ of a sea-shell you would find have you only insight _ enough _ inductive and deductive cunning _ enough _ not only a meaning but i be convince a quite endless significance undoubtedly in a human document of this kind there be a meaning and i may say at once that this meaning be entirely transparent to I pity only that you do not read the diary to I before ' ` why ' ` because we might between we have prevent a crime and save a life the last entry in the diary be make on the 15th of July what day be this ' ` this be the 20th ' ` then i would wager a thousand to one that we be too late there be still however the one chance leave the time be now seven o'clock : seven of the evening i think not of the morning the house of business in london be therefore close but why not send my man ham with a letter by train to the private address of the person from whom you obtain the diary tell he to hasten immediately to sir jocelin saul and on no consideration to leave he side for a moment ham would reach this person before midnight and understanding that the matter be one of life and death he would assuredly do you bidding ' as i be write the note suggest by zaleskus i turn and ask he : ` from whom shall i say that the danger be to be expect -- from the indian ' ` from ul-jabal yes but by no means indian -- persian ' profoundly impress by this knowledge of detail derive from source which have bring I no intelligence i hand the note to the negro tell he how to proceed and instruct he before start from the station to search all the procurable papers of the last few day and to return in case he find in any of they a notice of the death of sir jocelin saul then i resume my seat by the side of zaleskus ` as i have tell you ' he say ' i be fully convince that we messenger have go on a bootless errand i believe you will find that what have really occur be this : either yesterday or the day before sir jocelin be find by he servant -- i imagine he have a servant though no mention be make of any -- lie on the marble floor of he chamber dead near he probably by he side will be find a gem -- a oval stone white in color -- the same in fact which ul-jabal last place in the edmundsbury chalice there will be no mark of violence -- no trace of poison -- the death will be find to be a perfectly natural one yet in this case a particularly wicked murder have be commit there be i assure you to my positive knowledge forty-three -- and in one island in the south sea forty-four -- different method of do murder any one of which would be entirely beyond the scope of the introspective agency at the ordinary disposal of society ` but let we bend we mind to the detail of this matter let we ask first _ who _ be this ul-jabal i have say that he be a persian and of this there be abundant evidence in the narrative other than he mere name fragmentary as the document be and not intend by the writer to afford the information there be yet evidence of the religion of this man of the particular sect of that religion to which he belong of he peculiar shade of color of the object of he stay at the manor-house of saul of the special tribe amongst whom he formerly live what he ask when he greedy eye first light on the long-desired gem what be the meaning of the inscription ` have ' -- the meaning which _ he _ so well know one of the lose secret of the world reply the baronet but i can hardly understand a learn orientalist speaking in that way about what appear to I a very patent circumstance : it be clear that he never earnestly apply himself to the solution of the riddle or else -- what be more likely in spite of he rather high-flown estimate of he own reason -- that he mind and the mind of he ancestor never be able to go farther back in time than the edmundsbury monk but _ they _ do not make the stone nor do they dig it from the depths of the earth in suffolk -- they get it from some one and it be not difficult to say with certainty from whom the stone then might have be engrave by that someone or by the someone from whom _ he _ receive it and so on back into the dimness of time and consider the character of the engraving -- it consist of _ a mythological animal _ and some word of which the letter have only be distinguishable but the animal at least be pure persian the persian you know be not only quite worthy competitor with the hebrew the egyptian and later on the greek for excellence in the glyptic art but this fact be remarkable that in much the same way that the figure of the _ scarabaeus _ on a intaglio or cameo be a pretty infallible indication of a egyptian hand so be that of a priest or a grotesque animal a sure indication of a persian we may say then from that evidence alone -- though there be more -- that this gem be certainly persian and have reach that point the mystery of have vanish : for we at once jump at the conclusion that that too be persian but persian you say write in english character yes and it be precisely this fact that make its meaning one of what the baronet childishly call the lose secret of the world : for every successive inquirer believe it part of a english phrase be thus hopelessly lead astray in he investigation have be in fact part of the word hasn-us-sabah and the mere circumstance that some of it have be obliterate while the figure of the mystic animal remain intact show that it be execute by one of a nation less skilled in the art of grave in precious stone than the persian -- by a rude mediaeval englishman in short -- the modern revival of the art owe its origin of course to the medicus of a later age and of this englishman -- who either grave the stone himself or get some one else to do it for he -- do we know nothing we know at least that he be certainly a fighter probably a norman baron that on he arm he bear the cross of red that he tread the sacred soil of palestine perhaps to prove this i need hardly remind you who hasn-us-sabah be it be enough if i say that he be greatly mix up in the affair of the crusader lend he irresistible arm now to this side now to that he be the chief of the heterodox mohammedan sect of the assassin -lrb- this word i believe be actually derive from he name -rrb- imagine himself to be a incarnation of the deity and from he inaccessible rock-fortress of alamut in the elburz exercise a sinister influence on the intricate politics of the day the red cross knight call he shaikh-ul-jabal -- the old man of the mountain that very nickname connect he infallibly with the ul-jabal of we own time now three well-known fact occur to I in connection with this stone of the house of saul : the first that saladin meet in battle and defeat _ and plunder _ in a certain place on a certain day this hasn-us-sabah or one of he successor bear the same name the second that about this time there be a cordial _ rapprochement _ between saladin and richard the lion and between the infidel and the christian generally during which a free interchange of gem then regard as of deep mystic importance take place -- remember the talisman and the lee penny the third that soon after the fighter of richard and then himself return to england the loculus or coffin of st edmund -lrb- as we be inform by the _ jocelinus chronica _ -rrb- be _ open by the abbot _ at midnight and the body of the martyr expose on such occasion it be customary to place gem and relic in the coffin when it be again close up now the chalice with the stone be take from this loculus and be it possible not to believe that some knight to whom it have be present by one of saladin 's man have in turn present it to the monastery first scratch uncouthly on its surface the name of hasn to mark its semi-sacred origin or perhaps bid the monk to do so but the assassin now call i think al hasani or ismailus -- that accursed _ ishmaelite _ the baronet exclaim in one place -- still live be still a flourish sect impel by fervid religious fanaticism and where think you be they chief place of settlement where but on the height of that same lebanon on which sir jocelin pick up he too doubtful scribe and literary helper ` it now become evident that ul-jabal be one of the sect of the assassin and that the object of he sojourn at the manor-house of he financial help to the baronet of he whole journey perhaps to england be the recovery of the sacred gem which once glitter on the breast of the founder of he sect in dread of spoil all by over-rashness he wait perhaps for year till he make sure that the stone be the right one by see it with he own eye and learn the secret of the spring by which the chalice be open he then proceed to steal it so far all be clear enough now this too be conceivable that intend to commit the theft he have beforehand provide himself with another stone similar in size and shape -- these be well know to he -- to the other in order to substitute it for the real stone and so for a time at least escape detection it be presumable that the chalice be not often _ open _ by the baronet and this would therefore have be a perfectly rational device on the part of ul-jabal but assume this to be he mode of think how ludicrously absurd appear all the trouble he take to _ engrave _ the false stone in a exactly similar manner to the other _ that _ could not help he in produce the deception for that he do not contemplate the stone be _ see _ but only _ hear _ in the cup be prove by the fact that he select a stone of a different _ color _ this color as i shall afterwards show you be that of a pale brown-spotted stone but we be meet with something more extraordinary still when we come to the last stone the white one -- i shall prove that it be white -- which ul-jabal place in the cup be it possible that he have provide _ two _ substitute and that he have engrave these _ two _ without object in the same minutely careful manner you mind refuse to conceive it and _ have _ do this decline in addition to believe that he have prepare even one substitute and i be fully in accord with you in this conclusion ` we may say then that ul-jabal have not _ prepared _ any substitute and it may be add that it be a thing altogether beyond the limit of the probable that he could _ by chance _ have possess two old gem exactly similar in every detail down to the very half-obliterated letter of the word hasn-us-sabah i have now show you perceive that he do not make they purposely and that he do not possess they accidentally nor be they the baronet 's for we have he declaration that he have never see they before whence then do the persian obtain they that point will immediately emerge into clearness when we have sound he motive for replace the one false stone by the other and above all for take away the valueless stone and then replace it and in order to lead you up to the comprehension of this motive i begin by make the bold assertion that ul-jabal have not in he possession the real st edmundsbury stone at all ` you be surprise for you argue that if we be to take the baronet 's evidence at all we must take it in this particular also and he positively assert that he see the persian take the stone it be true that there be indubitable sign of insanity in the document but it be the insanity of a diseased mind manifest itself by fantastic exaggeration of sentiment rather than of a mind confide to itself its own delusion as to matter of fact there be therefore nothing so certain as that ul-jabal do steal the gem but these two thing be equally evident : that by some means or other it very soon pass out of he possession and that when it have so pass he for he part believe it to be in the possession of the baronet now he cry in triumph one day as he catch sir jocelin in he room -- _ now _ you have deliver all into my hand all what sir jocelin wonder all of course mean the stone he believe that the baronet have do precisely what the baronet afterwards believe that _ he _ have do -- hidden away the stone in the most secret of all place in he own apartment to wit the persian sure now at last of victory accordingly hasten into he chamber and lock the door in order by a easy search to secure he prize when moreover the baronet be examine the house at night with he lens he believe that ul-jabal be spy he movement when he extend he operation to the park the other find pretext to be near he ul-jabal dog he footstep like a shadow but suppose he have really have the jewel and have deposit it in a place of perfect safety -- such as with or without lens the extensive grounds of the manor-house would certainly have afford -- he more reasonable _ rôle _ would have be that of unconscious _ nonchalance _ rather than of agonised interest but in fact he suppose the owner of the stone to be himself seek a secure hiding-place for it and be resolve at all cost on know the secret and again in the vault beneath the house sir jocelin report that ul-jabal hold the lantern near the ground with he head bent down : can anything be better descriptive of the attitude of _ search _ yet each be so sure that the other possess the gem that neither be able to suspect that both be seeker ` but after all there be far better evidence of the non-possession of the stone by the persian than all this -- and that be the murder of the baronet for i can almost promise you that we messenger will return in a few minute now it seem to I that ul-jabal be not really murderous averse rather to murder thus the baronet be often in he power swoon in he arm lie under the influence of narcotic in semi-sleep while the persian be in he room and yet no injury be do he still when the clear necessity to murder -- the clear means of gain the stone -- present itself to ul-jabal he do not hesitate a moment -- indeed he have already make elaborate preparation for that very necessity and when be it that this necessity present itself it be when the baronet put the false stone in the pocket of a loose gown for the purpose of confront the persian with it but what kind of pocket i think you will agree with I that male garment admit of the designation gown have usually only outer pocket -- large square pocket simply sew on to the outside of the robe but a stone of that size _ must _ have make such a pocket bulge outwards ul-jabal must have notice it never before have he be perfectly sure that the baronet carry the long-desired gem about on he body but now at last he know beyond all doubt to obtain it there be several course open to he : he may rush there and then on the weak old man and tear the stone from he he may ply he with narcotic and extract it from the pocket during sleep but in these there be a small chance of failure there be a certainty of near or ultimate detection pursuit -- and this be a land of law swift and fairly sure no the old man must die : only thus -- thus surely and thus secretly -- can the outraged dignity of hasn-us-sabah be appease on the very next day he leave the house -- no more shall the mistrustful baronet who be hide something from he see he face he carry with he a small parcel let I tell you what be in that parcel : it contain the baronet 's fur cap one of he brown gown and a snow-white beard and wig of the cap we can be sure for from the fact that on leave he room at midnight to follow the persian through the _ house _ he put it on he head i gather that he wear it habitually during all he waking hour yet after ul-jabal have leave he he wander _ far and wide _ with uncovered head can you not picture the distract old man seek ever and anon with absent mind for he long-accustomed head-gear and seek in vain of the gown too we may be equally certain : for it be the procuring of this that lead ul-jabal to the baronet 's trunk we now know that he do not go there to _ hide _ the stone for he have it not to hide nor to _ seek _ it for he would be unable to believe the baronet childish enough to deposit it in so obvious a place as for the wig and beard they have be previously see in he room but before he leave the house ul-jabal have one more work to do : once more the two eat and drink together as in the old day of love once more the baronet be drunken with a deep sleep and when he wake he skin be brown as the leaf of autumn that be the evidence of which i spake in the beginning as give we a hint of the exact shade of the oriental 's color -- it be the yellowish-brown of a sered leaf and now that the face of the baronet have be smear with this indelible pigment all be ready for the tragedy and ul-jabal depart he will return but not immediately for he will at least give the eye of he victim time to grow accustomed to the change of color in he face nor will he tarry long for there be no tell whether or whither the stone may not disappear from that outer pocket i therefore surmise that the tragedy take place a day or two ago i remember the feebleness of the old man he highly neurotic condition i thought of those fibrillary twitching indicate the onset of a well-known nervous disorder sure to end in sudden death i recall he belief that on account of the loss of the stone in which he feel he life bind up the chariot of death be urgent on he footstep i bear in mind he memory of he grandfather die in agony just seventy year ago after see he own wraith by the churchyard-wall i know that such a man could not be strike by the sudden the terrific shock of see _ himself _ sit in the chair before the mirror -lrb- the chair you remember have be _ place _ there by ul-jabal -rrb- without drop down stone dead on the spot i be thus able to predict the manner and place of the baronet 's death -- if he _ be _ dead beside he i say would probably be find a white stone for ul-jabal he ghastly impersonation end would hurry to the pocket snatch out the stone and find it not the stone he seek would in all likelihood dash it down fly away from the corpse as if from plague and i hope straightway go and -- hang himself ' it be at this point that the black mask of ham frame itself between the python-skin tapestry of the doorway i tear from he the paper now two day old which he hold in he hand and under the head ` sudden death of a baronet ' read a nearly exact account of the fact which zaleski have be detail to I ' i can see by you face that i be not altogether at fault ' he say with one of he musical laugh ` but there still remain for we to discover whence ul-jabal obtain he two substitute he motive for exchange one for the other and for steal the valueless gem but above all we must find where the real stone be all the time that these two man so sedulously seek it and where it now be now let we turn we attention to this stone and ask first what light do the inscription on the cup throw on its nature the inscription assure we that if this stone be steal or if it chaunge dre the house of saul and its head anoon -lrb- ie anon at once -rrb- shall die dre i may remind you be a old english word use i think by burn identical with the saxon _ dreogan _ mean to suffer so that the writer at least contemplate that the stone might suffer change but what kind of change -- external or internal external change -- change of environment -- be already provide for when he say shulde this ston stalen bee chaunge therefore in _ he _ mind mean internal change but be such a thing possible for any precious stone and for this one in particular as to that we might answer when we know the name of this one it nowhere appear in the manuscript and yet it be immediately discoverable for it be a sky-blue stone a sky-blue sacred stone a sky-blue sacred persian stone that at once give we its name -- it be a _ turquoise _ but can the turquoise to the certain knowledge of a mediaeval writer chaunge dre let we turn for light to old anselm de boot : that be he in pig-skin on the shelf behind the bronze hera ' i hand the volume to zaleski he point to a passage which read as follow : ` assuredly the turquoise doth possess a soul more intelligent than that of man but we can not be wholly sure of the presence of angel in precious stone i do rather opine that the evil spirit doth take up he abode therein transform himself into a angel of light to the end that we put we trust not in god but in the precious stone and thus perhaps doth he deceive we spirit by the turquoise : for the turquoise be of two sort : those which keep they color and those which lose it ' -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : ` assurément la turquoise a une âme plus intelligente que l'âme de l'homme mais nous ne pouvons rien establir de certain touchant la presence des anges dans les pierres precieuses mon jugement seroit plustot que le mauvais esprit qui se transforme en ange de lumiere se loge dans les pierres precieuses à fin que l'on ne recoure pas à dieu mais que l'on repose sa creance dans la pierre precieuse ainsi peut-être il deçoit no esprits par la turquoise : car la turquoise est de deux sortes les unes qui conservent leur couleur et les autres qui la perdent ' _ anselm de boot _ book ii -rrb- ` you thus see ' resume zaleski ` that the turquoise be believe to have the property of change its color -- a change which be universally suppose to indicate the fading away and death of its owner the good de boot alas believe this to be a property of too many other stone beside like the hebrew in respect of they urim and thummim but in the case of the turquoise at least it be a well-authenticated natural phenomenon and i have myself see such a specimen in some case the change be a gradual process in other it may occur suddenly within a hour especially when the gem long keep in the dark be expose to brilliant sunshine i should say however that in this metamorphosis there be always a intermediate stage : the stone first change from blue to a pale color spot with brown and lastly to a pure white thus ul-jabal have steal the stone find that it be of the wrong color and soon after replace it he suppose that in the darkness he have select the wrong chalice and so take the valueless stone from the other this too he replace and infinitely puzzle make yet another hopeless trial of the edmundsbury chalice and again baffle again replace it conclude now that the baronet have suspect he design and substitute a false stone for the real one but after this last replacement the stone assume its final hue of white and thus the baronet be lead to think that two stone have be substitute by ul-jabal for he own invaluable gem all this while the gem be lie serenely in its place in the chalice and thus it come to pass that in the manor-house of saul there arise a somewhat considerable ado about nothing ' for a moment zaleskus pause then turn round and lay he hand on the brown forehead of the mummy by he side he say : ` my friend here could tell you and he would a fine tale of the immensely important part which jewel in all age have play in human history human religion institution idea he flourish some five century before the messiah be a memphian priest of amsu and as the hieroglyphic on he coffin assure I a prime favorite with one queen amynta beneath these moulder swaddling of the grave a great ruby still cherish its blood-guilty secret on the forefinger of he right hand most curious be it to reflect how in _ all _

yet as explicable as the contagion of cholera mind be at least as sensitive to the touch of mind as body to that of body it be during the ever-memorable outbreak of this obscure malady in the year 1875 that i venture to break in on the calm of that deep silence in which as in a mantle my friend prince zaleskus have wrap himself i write in fact to ask he what he think of the epidemic he answer be in the laconic word address to the master in the house of woe at bethany : ` come and see ' to this however he add in postscript : ` but what epidemic ' i have momentarily lose sight of the fact that zaleskus have so absolutely cut himself off from the world that he be not in the least likely to know anything even of the appalling series of event to which i have refer and yet it be no exaggeration to say that those event have throw the greater part of europe into a state of consternation and even confusion in london manchester pari and berlin especially the excitement be intense on the Sunday precede the writing of my note to zaleskus i be present at a monster demonstration hold in hyde park in which the government be hold up on all hand to the popular derision and censure -- for it will be remember that to many mind the mysterious accompaniment of some of the death daily occur convey a still darker significance than that imply in mere self-destruction and seem to point to a succession of purposeless and hideous murder the demagogue i must say speak with some wildness and incoherence many lay the blame at the door of the police and urge that thing would be different be they but place under municipal instead of under imperial control a thousand panacea be invent a thousand aimless censure pass but the people listen with vacant ear never have i see the populace so agitate and yet so subdue as with the sense of some impending doom the glittering eye betray the excitement the pallor of the cheek the doubt the haunt _ fear _ none feel himself quite safe man recognize shudder the grin of death in the air to tingle with affright and to know not why -- that be the transcendentalism of terror the threat of the cannon 's mouth be trivial in its effect on the mind in comparison with the menace of a shadow it be the pestilence that walketh _ by night _ that be intolerable as for myself i confess to be pervade with a nameless and numbing awe during all those week and this feeling appear to be general in the land the journal have but one topic the party organ throw politics to the wind i hear that on the stock exchange as in the paris _ bourse _ business decrease to a minimum in parliament the work of law-threshing practically cease and the time of minister be nightly spend in answer volume of angry ` question ' and in face motion after motion for the ` adjournment ' of the house it be in the midst of all this commotion that i receive prince zaleskus 's brief ` come and see ' i be flatter and please : flatter because i suspect that to I alone of all man would such a invitation come from he be address and pleased because many a time in the midst of the noisy city street and the garish dusty world have the thought of that vast mansion that dim and silent chamber flood my mind with a drowsy sense of the romantic till from very excess of melancholy sweetness in the picture i be fain to close my eye i avow that that lonesome room -- gloomy in its lunar bath of soft perfumed light -- shroud in the sullen voluptuousness of plushy narcotic-breathing drapery -- pervade by the mysterious spirit of its brooding occupant -- grow more and more on my fantasy till the remembrance have for I all the cool refreshment shed by a midsummer-night 's dream in the dewy deep of some perrhoebian grove of cornel and loto and ruby star of the asphodel it be therefore in all haste that i set out to share for a time in the solitude of my friend zaleskus 's reception of I be most cordial immediately on my entrance into he sanctum he break into a perfect torrent of wild enthusiastic word tell I with a kind of rapture that he be just then laboriously engage in co-ordinate to one of the calculi certain new property he have discover in the parabola add with infinite gusto he ` firm ' belief that the ancient assyrian be acquaint with all we modern notion respect the parabola itself the projection of body in general and of the heavenly body in particular and must moreover from certain inference of he own in connection with the winged circle have be conversant with the fact that light be not a ether but only the vibration of a ether he then gallop on to suggest that i should at once take part with he in he investigation and comment on the timeliness of my visit i on my part be anxious for he opinion on other and far weightier matter than the concern of the assyrian and intimate as much to he but for two day he be firm in he tacit refusal to listen to my story and conclude that he be disincline to undergo the agony of unrest with which he be always torment by any mystery which momentarily baffle he i be of course force to hold my peace on the third day however of he own accord he ask I to what epidemic i have refer i then detail to he some of the strange event which be agitate the mind of the outside world from the very first he be interested : later on that interest grow into a passion a greedy soul-consuming quest after the truth the intensity of which be such at last as to move I even to pity i may as well here restate the fact as i communicate they to zaleski the concatenation of incident it will be remembered start with the extraordinary death of that eminent man of science professor schleschinger consult laryngologist to the charité hospital in berlin the professor a man of great age be on the point of contract he third marriage with the beautiful and accomplished daughter of the herr geheimrath otto von friedrich the contemplated union which be entirely one of those _ mariage de convenance _ so common in good society spring out of the professor 's ardent desire to leave behind he a direct heir to he very considerable wealth by he first two marriage indeed he have have large family and be at this very time surround by quite a army of little grandchild from whom -lrb- all he direct descendant be dead -rrb- he might have be content to select he heir but the old german prejudice in these matter be strong and he still hope to be represent on he decease by a son of he own to this whim the charming ottilie be mark by she parent as the victim the wedding however have be postpone owe to a slight illness of the veteran scientist and just as he be on the point of final recovery from it death intervene to prevent altogether the execution of he design never do death of man create a profounder sensation _ never be death of man follow by consequence more terrible _ the _ residenz _ of the scientist be a stately mansion near the university in the _ unter den linden _ boulevard that be to say in the most fashionable _ quartier _ of berlin he bedroom from a considerable height look out on a small back garden and in this room he have be engage in conversation with he colleague and medical attendant dr johann hofmeier to a late hour of the night during all this time he seem cheerful and speak quite lucidly on various topic in particular he exhibit to he colleague a curious strip of what look like ancient papyrus on which be trace certain grotesque and apparently meaningless figure this he say he have find some day before on the bed of a poor woman in one of the horribly low quarter that surround berlin on whom he have have occasion to make a _ post-mortem _ examination the woman have suffer from partial paralysis she have a small young family none of whom however could give any account of the slip except one little girl who declare that she have take it ` from she mother 's mouth ' after death the slip be soil and have a fragrant smell as though it have be smear with honey the professor add that all through he illness he have be employ himself by examine these figure he be convince he say that they contain some archaeological significance but in any case he cease not to ask himself how come a slip of papyrus to be find in such a situation -- on the bed of a dead berlinerin of the poorest class the story of its be take from the _ mouth _ of the woman be of course unbelievable the whole incident seem to puzzle while it amuse he seem to appeal to the instinct -- so strong in he -- to investigate to probe for day he declare he have be endeavor in vain to make anything of the figure dr hofmeier too examine the slip but inclined to believe that the figure -- rude and uncouth as they be -- be only such as might be draw by any school-boy in a idle moment they consist merely of a man and a woman seat on a bench with what look like a ornamental border run round they after a pleasant evening 's scientific gossip dr hofmeier a little after midnight take he departure from the bed-side a hour later the servant be rouse from sleep by one deep raucous cry proceeding from the professor 's room they hasten to he door it be lock on the inside all be still within no answer come to they call the door be break in they find they master lie calm and dead on he bed a window of the room be open but there be nothing to show that any one have enter it dr hofmeier be send for and be soon on the scene after examine the body he fail to find anything to account for the sudden demise of he old friend and chief one observation however have the effect of cause he to tingle with horror on he entrance he have notice lie on the side of the bed the piece of papyrus with which the professor have be toy in the earlier part of the day and have remove it but as he be on the point of leave the room he happen to approach the corpse once more and bend over it notice that the lip and tooth be slightly part draw open the now stiffen jaw he find -- to he amazement to he stupefaction -- that neatly fold beneath the dead tongue lay just such another piece of papyrus as that which he have remove from the bed he draw it out -- it be clammy he put it to he nose -- it exhale the fragrance of honey he open it -- it be cover by figure he compare they with the figure on the other slip -- they be just so similar as two draughtsman hastily copy from a common model would make they the doctor be unnerved : he hurry homeward and immediately submit the honey on the papyrus to a rigorous chemical analysis : he suspect poison -- a subtle poison -- as the means of a suicide grotesquely insanely accomplish he find the fluid to be perfectly innocuous -- pure honey and nothing more the next day germany thrill with the news that professor schleschinger have destroy himself for suicide however some of the papers substitute murder though of neither be there a atom of actual proof on the day follow three person die by they own hand in berlin of whom two be young member of the medical profession on the day follow that the number rise to nineteen hamburg dresden and aachen join in the frenzied death-dance within three week from the night on which professor schleschinger meet he unaccountable end eight thousand person in germany france and great britain die in that startlingly sudden and secret manner which we call ` tragic ' many of they obviously by they own hand many in what seem the servility of a fatal imitativeness with figure honey-smeared slip of papyrus beneath they tongue even now -- now after year -- i thrill intensely to recall the dread remembrance but to live through it to breathe daily the mawkish miasmatic atmosphere all vapid with the suffocating death -- ah it be terror too deep nausea too foul for mortal bearing novali have somewhere hint at the possibility -lrb- or the desirability -rrb- of a simultaneous suicide and voluntary return by the whole human family into the sweet bosom of we ancient father -- i half expect it be come have come _ then _ it be as if the old good-easy meek-eyed man of science die have leave he effectual curse on all the world and have thereby convert civilisation into one omnivorous grave one universal charnel-house i spend several day in read out to zaleski account of particular death as they have occur he seem never to tire of listen lie back for the most part on the silver-cushioned couch and wear a inscrutable mask sometimes he rise and pace the carpet with noiseless foot-fall he step increase to the sway uneven velocity of a animal in confinement as a passage here or there attract he and then subside into they slow regularity again at any interruption in the reading he would instantly turn to I with a certain impatience and implore I to proceed and when we stock of matter fail he break out into actual anger that i have not bring more with I henceforth the negro ham use my trap daily take a double journey -- one before sunrise and one at dusk -- to the nearest townlet from which he would return load with newspaper with unimaginable eagerness do both zaleskus and i seize morning after morning and evening after evening on these budget to gloat for long hour over the ever-lengthening tale of death as for he sleep forsake he he be a man of small reasonableness scorn the limitation of human capacity he palate brook no meat when he brain be headlong in the chase even the mild narcotic which be now he food and drink seem to lose something of they power to mollify to curb he often rise from slumber in what i take to be the dead of night -- though of day or night there could be small certainty in that dim dwelling -- i would peep into the domed chamber and see he there under the livid-green light of the censer the leaden smoke issue from he lip he eye fix unweariedly on a square piece of ebony which rest on the coffin of the mummy near he on this ebony he have paste side by side several woodcut -- snip from the newspaper -- of the figure trace on the piece of papyrus find in the mouth of the dead i could see as time pass that he be concentrate all he power on these figure for the detail of the death themselves be all of a dreary sameness offering few salient point for investigation in those case where the suicide have leave behind he clear evidence of the means by which he have commit the act there be nothing to investigate the other -- rich and poor alike peer and peasant -- troop out by thousand on the far journey without leave the faintest footprint to mark the road by which they have go this be perhaps the reason that after a time zaleskus discard the newspaper leave they perusal to I and turn he attention exclusively to the ebon tablet know as i full well do the daring and success of he past spiritual adventure -- the subtlety the imagination the imperial grip of he intellect -- i do not at all doubt that he choice be wise and would in the end be justified these woodcut -- now so notorious -- be all exactly similar in design though minutely differ here and there in draw the follow be a facsimile of one of they take by I at random : -lrb- illustration -rrb- the time pass it now begin to be a grief to I to see the turgid pallor that gradually overspread the always ashen countenance of zaleskus i grow to consider the ravage life that glare and blaze in he sunken eye as too volcanic demonic to be canny : the mystery i decide at last -- if mystery there be -- be too deep too dark for he hence perhaps it be that i now absented myself more and more from he in the adjoining room in which i sleep there one day i sit reading over the latest list of horror when i hear a loud cry from the vaulted chamber i rush to the door and behold he stand gaze with wild eye at the ebon tablet hold straight out in front of he ` by heaven ' he cry stamp savagely with he foot ` by heaven then i certainly _ be _ a fool _ it be the staff of phaebus in the hand of herme ' _ i hasten to he ` tell I ' i say ` have you discover anything ' ` it be possible ' ` and have there really be foul play -- murder -- in any of these death ' ` of that at least i be certain from the first ' ` great god ' i exclaimed ` could any son of man so convert himself into a fiend a beast of the wilderness ' ` you judge precisely in the manner of the multitude ' he answer somewhat petulantly ` illegal murder be always a mistake but not necessarily a crime remember corday but in case where the murder of one be really fiendish why be it qualitatively less fiendish than the murder of many on the other hand have brutus slay a thousand caesar -- each act involve a additional exhibition of the sublimest self-suppression -- he might well have take rank as a saint in heaven ' fail for the moment to see the drift or the connection of the argument i contented myself with wait event for the rest of that day and the next zaleskus seem to have dismiss the matter of the tragedy from he mind and enter calmly on he former study he no longer consult the news or examine the figure on the tablet the papers however still arrive daily and of these he soon afterwards lay several before I point with a curious smile to a small paragraph in each these all appear in the advertisement column be word alike and read as follow : ' a true son of lycurgus _ have news _ desire to know the _ time _ and _ place _ of the next meeting of he phyle address zaleskus at r -- abbey in the county of m -- ' i gaze in mute alternation at the advertisement and at he i may here stop to make mention of a very remarkable sensation which my association with he occasionally produce in I i feel it with intense with unpleasant with irritating keenness at this moment it be the sensation of be bear aloft -- aloft -- by a force external to myself -- such a sensation as might possibly tingle through a earthworm when lift into illimitable airy height by the strongly-daring pinion of a eagle it be the feeling of be hurry out beyond one 's depth -- catch and whiff away by the all-compelling sweep of some rabid vigor into a new foreign element something akin i have experience in a ` express ' as it rage with I -- winged rock ecstatic shrilling a dragon aha -- round a too narrow curve it be a sensation very far from agreeable ` to that ' he say point to the paragraph ` we may i think shortly expect a answer let we only hope that when it come it may be immediately intelligible ' we wait throughout the whole of that day and night hide we eagerness under the pretence of absorption in we book if by chance i fall into a uneasy doze i find he on wake ever watchful and pore over the great tome before he about the time however when could we have see it the first gray of dawn must have be peep over the land he impatience again become painful to witness he rise and pace the room mutter occasionally to himself this only cease when hour later ham enter the room with a envelope in he hand zaleskus seize it -- tear it open -- run he eye over the contents -- and dash it to the ground with a oath ` curse it ' he groan ` ah curse it unintelligible -- every syllable of it ' i pick up the missive and examine it it be a slip of papyrus cover with the design now so hideously familiar except only that the two central figure be want at the bottom be write the date of the 15th of November -- it be then the morning of the 12th -- and the name ` morris ' the whole therefore present the follow appearance : -lrb- illustration -rrb- my eye be now heavy with sleep every sense half-drunken with the vapourlike atmosphere of the room so that have abandon something of hope i totter willingly to my bed and fall into a profound slumber which last till what must have be the time of the gathering in of the shades of night i then rise miss zaleskus i seek through all the chamber for he he be nowhere to be see the negro inform I with a affectionate and anxious tremor in the voice that he master have leave the room some hour before but have say nothing to he i order the man to descend and look into the sacristy of the small chapel wherein i have deposit my _ calèche _ and in the field behind where my horse should be he return with the news that both have disappear zaleskus i then conclude have undoubtedly depart on a journey i be deeply touch by the demeanor of ham as the hour go by he wander stealthily about the room like a lose be it be like matter sigh after weep over spirit prince zaleskus have never before withdraw himself from the _ surveillance _ of this sturdy watchman and he disappearance now be like a convulsion in they little cosmos ham implore I repeatedly if i could to throw some light on the meaning of this catastrophe but i too be in the dark the titanic frame of the ethiopian tremble with emotion as in broken childish word he tell I that he feel instinctively the approach of some great danger to the person of he master so a day pass away and then another on the next he rouse I from sleep to hand I a letter which on opening i find to be from zaleskus it be hastily scribble in pencil date ` london nov 14th ' and run thus : ` for my body -- should i not return by Friday night -- you will no doubt be good enough to make search _ descend _ the river keep constantly to the left consult the papyrus and stop at the _ descensus aesopus _ seek diligently and you will find for the rest you know my fancy for cremation : take I if you will to the crematorium of _ père-lachaise _ my whole fortune i decree to ham the lybian ' ham be all for know the contents of this letter but i refuse to communicate a word of it i be daze i be more than ever perplexed i be appal by the frenzy of zaleskus Friday night it be then Thursday morning and i be expect to wait through the dreary interval uncertain agonised inactive i be offend with my friend he conduct bear the interpretation of mental distraction the leaden hour pass all oppressively while i seek to appease the keenness of my unrest with the anodyne of drugged sleep on the next morning however another letter -- a rather massive one -- reach I the cover be direct in the writing of zaleskus but on it he have scribble the word : ` this need not be open unless i fail to reappear before Saturday ' i therefore lay the packet aside unread i wait all through Friday resolve that at six o'clock if nothing happen i should make some sort of effort but from six i remain with eye strain towards the doorway until ten i be so utterly at a loss my ingenuity be so entirely baffle by the situation that i could devise no course of action which do not immediately appear absurd but at midnight i spring up -- no longer would i endure the carking suspense i seize a taper and pass through the door-way i have not proceed far however when my light be extinguish then i remember with a shudder that i should have to pass through the whole vast length of the building in order to gain a exit it be a all but hopeless task in the profound darkness to thread my way through the labyrinth of hall and corridor of tumble-down stair of bat-haunted vault of purposeless angle and involution but i proceed with something of a blind obstinacy grope my way with arm hold out before I in this manner i have wander on for perhaps a quarter of a hour when my finger come into distinct momentary contact with what feel like cold and humid human flesh i shrink back unnerved as i already be with a murmur of affright ` zaleskus ' i whisper with bated breath intently as i strain my ear i could detect no reply the hair of my head catch terror from my fancy erect themselves again i advanced and again i become aware of the sensation of contact with a quick movement i pass my hand upward and downward it be indeed he he be half-reclining half-standing against a wall of the chamber : that he be not dead i at once know by he uneasy breathing indeed when have chafe he hand for some time i try to rouse he he quickly recover himself and mutter : ' i faint i want sleep -- only sleep ' i bear he back to the light room assist by ham in the latter part of the journey ham 's ecstasy be infinite he have hardly hope to see he master 's face again he garment be wet and soil the negro divest he of they and dress he in a tightly-fitting scarlet robe of babylonish pattern reach to the foot but leave the lower neck and forearm bare and girt round the stomach by a broad gold-orphreyed _ ceinture _ with all the tenderness of a woman the man stretch he master thus array on the couch here he keep a argus guard while zaleskus in one deep unbroken slumber of a night and a day repose before he when at last the sleeper wake in he eye -- full of divine instinct -- flit the wonted falchion-flash of the whet two-edged intellect the secret austere self-conscious smile of triumph curve he lip not a trace of pain or fatigue remain after a substantial meal on nut autumn fruit and wine of samo he resume he place on the couch and i sit by he side to hear the story of he wander he say : ` we have shiel have before we a very remarkable series of murder and a very remarkable series of suicide be they in any way connect to this extent i think -- that the mysterious the unparalleled nature of the murder give rise to a morbid condition in the public mind which in turn result in the epidemic of suicide but though such a epidemic have its origin in the instinct of imitation so common in man you must not suppose that the mental process be a _ conscious _ one a person feel a impulse to go and do and be not aware that at bottom it be only a impulse to go and do _ likewise _ he would indeed repudiate such a assumption thus one man destroy himself and another imitate he -- but whereas the former use a pistol the latter use a rope it be rather absurd therefore to imagine that in any of those case in which the slip of papyrus have be find in the mouth after death the cause of death have be the slavish imitativeness of the suicidal mania -- for this as i say be never _ slavish _ the papyrus then -- quite apart from the unmistakable evidence of suicide invariably leave by each self-destroyer -- afford we definite and certain means by which we can distinguish the two class of death and we be thus able to divide the total number into two nearly equal half ` but you start -- you be trouble -- you never hear or read of murder such as this the simultaneous murder of thousand over wide area of the face of the globe here you feel be something outside you experience deeper than you profoundest imagining to the question by whom commit and with what motive you mind can conceive no possible answer and yet the answer must be by man and for human motive -- for the angel of death with flash eye and flame sword be himself long dead and again we can say at once by no _ one _ man but by many a cohort a army of man and again by no _ common _ man but by man hellish -lrb- or heavenly -rrb- in cunning in resource in strength and unity of purpose man laugh to scorn the flimsy prophylactic of society separate by a infinity of self-confidence and spiritual integrity from the ordinary easily-crushed criminal of we day ` this much at least i be able to discover from the first and immediately i set myself to the detection of motive by a careful study of each case this too in due time become clear to I -- but to motive it may perhaps be more convenient to refer later on what next engage my attention be the figure on the papyrus and devoutly do i hope that by they solution i might be able to arrive at some more exact knowledge of the mystery ` the figure round the border first attract I and the mere _ reading _ of they give I very little trouble but i be convince that behind they meaning thus read lay some deep esoteric significance and this almost to the last i be utterly unable to fathom you perceive that these border figure consist of wave line of two different length drawing of snake triangle look like the greek delta and a heart-shaped object with a dot follow it these succeed one another in a certain definite order on all the slip what i ask myself be these drawing mean to represent -- letter number thing or abstraction this i be the more readily able to determine because i have often in think over the shape of the roman letter s wonder whether it do not owe its convolute form to a attempt on the part of its inventor to make a picture of the _ serpent _ s be the sibilant or hissing letter and the serpent the hiss animal this view i fancy -lrb- though i be not sure -rrb- have escape the philologist but of course you know that all letter be originally _ picture of thing _ and of what be s a picture if not of the serpent i therefore assume by way of trial that the snake in the diagram stand for a sibilant letter that be either c or s and thence supposing this to be the case i deduce : firstly that all the other figure stand for letter and secondly that they all appear in the form of picture of the thing of which those letter be originally mean to be picture thus the letter m one of the four _ liquid _ consonant be as we now write it only a shorten form of a wave line and as a wave line it be originally write and be the character by which _ a stream of run water _ be represent in write indeed it only owe its name to the fact that when the lip be press together and m utter by a continuous effort a certain resemblance to the murmur of run water be produce the longer wave line in the diagram i therefore take to represent m and it at once follow that the shorter mean n for no two letter of the commoner european alphabet differ only in length -lrb- as distinct from shape -rrb- except m and n and w and v indeed just as the french call w double-ve so very properly might m be call double-en but in this case the longer not be w the shorter could not be v : it be therefore n and now there only remain the heart and the triangle i be unable to think of any letter that could ever have be intend for the picture of a heart but the triangle i know to be the letter #a # this be originally write without the cross-bar from prop to prop and the two foot at the bottom of the prop be not separate as now but join so that the letter form a true triangle it be mean by the primitive man to be a picture of he primitive house this house being of course hut-shaped and consist of a conical roof without wall i have thus with the exception of the heart disentangle the whole which then -lrb- leave a space for the heart -rrb- read as follow : -lcb- ss ` mn -lcb- anan san ' -lcb- cc but ` c ' before ` a ' be never a sibilant -lrb- except in some few so-called ` romance ' language -rrb- but a guttural it be for the moment discard also as no word begin with the letter ` mn ' -- except ` mnemonic ' and its fellow -- i conclude that a vowel must be omit between these letter and thence that all vowel -lrb- except ` a ' -rrb- be omit again as the double 's ' can never come after 'n' i see that either a vowel be omit between the two 's 's ' or that the first word end after the first 's ' thus i get be n sanan san ' or supply the now quite obvious vowel ` men sana in sano ' the heart i now know represent the word ` corpore ' the latin word for ` heart ' be ` cor ' and the dot -- show that the word as it stand be a abbreviation -- conclusively prove every one of my deduction ` so far all have go flowingly it be only when i come to consider the central figure that for many day i spend my strength in vain you hear my exclamation of delight and astonishment when at last a ray of light pierce the gloom at no time indeed be i wholly in the dark as to the _ general _ significance of these figure for i see at once they resemblance to the sepulchral relief of classical time in case you be not minutely acquaint with the _ technique _ of these stone i may as well show you one which i myself remove from a old grave in tarentum ' he take from a niche a small piece of close-grained marble about a foot square and lay it before I on one side it be exquisitely sculpture in relief ` this ' he continue ` be a typical example of the greek grave-stone and have see one specimen you may be say to have see almost all for there be surprisingly little variety in the class you will observe that the scene represent a man recline on a couch in he hand he hold a _ patera _ or dish fill with grape and pomegranate and beside he be a tripod bear the viand from which he be banquet at he foot sit a woman -- for the greek lady never recline at table in addition to these two figure a horse 's head a dog or a serpent may sometimes be see and these form comprise the almost invariable pattern of all grave relief now that this be the real model from which the figure on the papyrus be take i could not doubt when i consider the seemingly absurd fidelity with which in each murder the papyrus smear with honey be place under the tongue of the victim i say to myself : it can only be that the assassin have bind themselves to the observance of a strict and narrow ritual from which no departure be under any circumstance permit -- perhaps for the sake of signalling the course of event to other at a distance but what ritual that question i be able to answer when i know the answer to these other -- why _ under the tongue _ and why _ smear with honey _ for no reason except that the greek -lrb- not the roman till very late in they history -rrb- always place a _ obolo _ or penny beneath the tongue of the dead to pay he passage across the stygian river of ghost for no reason except that to these same greek honey be a sacred fluid intimately associate in they mind with the mournful subject of death a fluid with which the body of the decease be anoint and sometimes -- especially in sparta and the pelasgic south -- embalm with which libation be pour to herme psuchopompo conductor of the dead to the region of shade with which offering be make to all the chthonic deity and the soul of the depart in general you remember for instance the melancholy word of helen address to hermione in _ oreste : _ -lrb- greek : _ kai labe choas tasd ` en cheroin koma t 'em as elthousa d'amphus ton klutaimnaestras taphon melikrat ` aphe galakto oinopon t ` achnaen _ -rrb- and so everywhere the ritual then of the murderer be a _ greek _ ritual they cult a greek cult -- preferably perhaps a south greek one a spartan one for it be here that the highly conservative people of that region cling longest and fondliest to this semi-barbarous worship this then be so i be make all the more certain of my conjecture that the central figure on the papyrus be draw from a greek model ` here however i come to a standstill i be infinitely puzzle by the rod in the man 's hand in none of the greek grave-relief do any such thing as a rod make a appearance except in one well-known example where the god herme -- generally represent as carry the _ caduceus _ or staff give he by phoebus -- appear lead a dead maiden to the land of night but in every other example of which i be aware the sculpture represent a man _ live _ not dead banqueting _ on earth _ not in hade by the side of he live companion what then could be the significance of the staff in the hand of this living man it be only after day of the hardest struggle the cruellest suspense that the thought flash on I that the idea of herme lead away the dead female might in this case have be carry one step farther that the male figure might be no living man no man at all but _ herme himself _ actually banquet in hade with the soul of he disembodied _ protégée _ the thought fill I with a rapture i can not describe and you witness my excitement but at all event i see that this be a truly tremendous departure from greek art and think to which in general the copyist seem to cling so religiously there must therefore be a reason a strong reason for vandalism such as this and that at any rate it be no longer difficult to discover for now i know that the male figure be no mortal but a god a spirit a daemon -lrb- in the greek sense of the word -rrb- and the female figure i saw by the marked shortness of she drapery to be no athenian but a spartan no matron either but a maiden a lass a lassie and now i have force on I lassie daemon _ lacedaemon _ ` this then be the badge the so carefully-buried badge of this society of man the only thing which still puzzle and confound I at this stage be the startling circumstance that a _ greek _ society should make use of a _ latin _ motto it be clear that either all my conclusion be totally wrong or else the motto _ men sana in corpore sano _ contain wrap up in itself some acroamatic meaning which i find myself unable to penetrate and which the author have find no greek motto capable of convey but at any rate have find this much my knowledge lead I of itself one step further for i perceive that widely extend as be they operation the society be necessarily in the main a _ english _ or at least a english-speaking one -- for of this the word lassie be plainly indicative : it be easy now to conjecture london the monster-city in which all thing lose themselves as they head-quarter and at this point in my investigation i despatch to the papers the advertisement you have see ' ` but ' i exclaimed ` even now i utterly fail to see by what mysterious process of thought you arrive at the wording of the advertisement even now it convey no meaning to my mind ' ` that ' he reply ' will grow clear when we come to a right understanding of the baleful _ motive _ which inspire these man i have already say that i be not long in discover it there be only one possible method of do so -- and that be by all means by any means to find out some condition or other common to every one of the victim before death it be true that i be unable to do this in some few case but where i fail i be convince that my failure be due to the insufficiency of the evidence at my disposal rather than to the actual absence of the condition now let we take almost any two case you will and seek for this common condition : let we take for example the first two that attract the attention of the world -- the poor woman of the slum of berlin and the celebrated man of science separate by as wide a interval as they be we shall yet find if we look closely in each case the same pathetic token of the still uneliminated _ stria _ of we poor humanity the woman be not a old woman for she have a small young family which have she live might have be increase : notwithstanding which she have suffer from hemiplegium partial paralysis the professor too have have not one but two large family and a army of grand-child : but note well the startling the hideous fact that _ every one of he child be dead _ the crude grave have gape before the cock to suck in _ every one _ of those shrink form so indigent of vital impulse so pauper of civism lust so draughty so vague so lean -- but not before they have have time to dower with the ah and will of they infirmity a whole wretched army of grand-child and yet this man of wisdom be on the point in he old age of marry once again of produce for the good of he race still more of this poor human stuff you see the lurid significance the point of resemblance -- you see it and o heaven be it not too sad for I i tell you the whole business have a tragic pitifulness too deep for word but this bring I to the discussion of a large matter it would for instance be interesting to I to hear what you a modern european saturated with all the notion of you little day what _ you _ consider the supreme the all-important question for the nation of europe at this moment be i far wrong in assume that you would rattle off half a dozen of the moot point agitate rival faction in you own land select one of they and call that the question of the hour i wish i could see as you see i wish to god i do not see deeper in order to lead you to my point what let I ask you what _ precisely _ be it that ruin the old nation -- that bring say rome to she knee at last centralisation you say top-heavy imperialism dilettante pessimism the love of luxury at bottom believe I it be not one of these high-sounding thing -- it be simply war the sum total of the battle of century but let I explain myself : this be a novel view to you and you be perhaps unable to conceive how or why war be so fatal to the old world because you see how little harmful it be to the new if you collect in a promiscuous way a few million of modern englishman and slew they all simultaneously what think you would be the effect from the point of view of the state the effect i conceive would be indefinitely small wonderfully transitory there would of course be a momentary lacuna in the boiling surge : yet the womb of humanity be full of sap and uberant ocean-tide woo of that ilithyium whose breast be many would flow on and the void would soon be fill but the effect would only be thus insignificant if as i say you million be take promiscuously -lrb- as in the modern army -rrb- not if they be _ pick _ man -- in _ that _ case the loss -lrb- or gain -rrb- would be excessive and permanent for all time now the war-host of the ancient commonwealth -- not dependent on the mechanical contrivance of the modern army -- be necessarily compose of the very best man : the strong-boned the heart-stout the sound in wind and limb under these condition the state shudder through all she frame thrill adown every filament at the death of a single one of she son in the field as only the feeble the aged bide at home they number after each battle become larger _ in proportion to the whole _ than before thus the nation more and more with ever-increasing rapidity decline in bodily and of course spiritual quality until the _ end _ be reach and nature swallow up the weakling whole and thus war which to the modern state be at worst the blockhead and indecent _ affaire d'honneur _ of person in office -- and which surely before you and i die will cease altogether -- be to the ancient a genuine and remorselessly fatal scourge ` and now let I apply these fact to the europe of we own time we no longer have world-serious war -- but in its place we have a scourge the effect of which on the modern state be _ precisely the same _ as the effect of war on the ancient only -- in the end -- far more destructive far more subtle sure horrible disgust the name of this pestilence be medical science yes it be most true shudder -- shudder -- as you will man 's best friend turn to a asp in he bosom to sting he to the basest of death the devastating growth of medical and especially surgical science -- that if you like for we all be the question of the hour and what a question of what surpass importance in the presence of which all other question whatever dwindle into mere academic triviality for just as the ancient state be wound to the heart through the death of she healthy son in the field just so slowly just so silently be the modern receive deadly hurt by the botching and tinkering of she unhealthy child the net result be in each case the same -- the altered ratio of the total amount of reproductive health to the total amount of reproductive disease they recklessly spend they best we sedulously conserve we worst and as they pine and die of anemia so we unless we repent must perish in a paroxysm of black-blood apoplexy and this prospect become more certain when you reflect that the physician as we know he be not like other man and thing a being of gradual growth of slow evolution : from adam to the middle of the last century the world see nothing even in the least resemble he no son of paian _ he _ but a fatherless full-grown birth from the incessant matrix of modern time so motherly of monstrous litter of gorgon and hydra and chimaeras dire you will understand what i mean when you consider the quite recent date of say the introduction of anaesthetic or antiseptic the discovery of the knee-jerk bacteriology or even of such a doctrine as the circulation of the blood we be at this very time if i mistake not on the verge of new insight which will enable man to laugh at disease -- laugh at it in the sense of over-rule its natural tendency to produce death not by any means in the sense of destroy its ever-expanding _ existence _ do you know that at this moment you hospital be cram with being in human likeness suffering from a thousand obscure and subtly-ineradicable ill all of whom if leave alone would die almost at once but ninety in the hundred of whom will as it be be send forth cure like missionary of hell and the horrent shape of night and acheron to mingle in the pure river of humanity the poison-taint of they protean vileness do you know that in you school one-quarter of the child be already purblind have you gauge the importance of you tremendous consumption of quack catholicon of the fortune derive from they sale of the spread of modern nervous disorder of toothless youth and thrice loathsome age among the helot-class do you know that in the course of my late journey to london i walk from piccadilly circus to hyde park corner during which time i observe some five hundred people of whom twenty-seven only be perfectly healthy well-formed man and eighteen healthy beautiful woman on every hand -- with a thrill of intensest joy i say it -- be to be see if not yet commence civilisation then progress progress -- wide as the world -- toward it : only here -- at the heart -- be there decadence fatty degeneration brain-evolution -- and favor air -- and the ripening time -- and the silent will of god of god -- all these in conspiracy seem to be behind urge the whole ship 's company of we to some undreamable luxury of glory -- when lo this check artificial evitable less death more disease -- that be the sad the unnatural record child especially -- so sensitive to the physician 's art -- live on by hundred of thousand bear within they the germ of wide-spreading sorrow who in former time would have die and if you consider that the proper function of the doctor be the strictly limited one of cure the curable rather than of self-gloriously perpetuate the incurable you may find it difficult to give a quite rational answer to this simple question : _ why _ nothing be so sure as that to the unit it be a cruelty nothing so certain as that to humanity it be a wrong to say that such and such a one be send by the all wise and must _ therefore _ be not merely permit but elaborately coax and force to live be to utter a blasphemy against man at which even the ribald tongue of a priest might falter and as a matter of fact society in just contempt for this species of argument never hesitate to hang for its own imagine good its heaven-sent catholic protestant sheep sheep-stealers etc what then you ask would i do with these unholy one to save the state would i pierce they with a sword or leave they to the slow throe of they agony ah do not expect I to answer that question -- i do not know what to answer the whole spirit of the present be one of a broad and beautiful if quite thoughtless humanism and i a child of the present can not but be bear along by it coerce into sympathy with it beautiful i say : for if anywhere in the world you have see a sight more beautiful than a group of hospital _ savant _ bend with endless scrupulousness over a little pauper child concenter upon its frailty the whole human skill and wisdom of age so have not i here have you the full realisation of a parable diviner than that of the man who go down from jerusalem to jericho beautiful then with at least surface beauty like the serpent _ lachesis mutus _ but like many beautiful thing deadly too _ in_human and on the whole a answer will have to be find as for I it be a doubt which have often agitate I whether the central dogma of judaism and christianity alike can after all be really one of the inner verity of this we earthly being -- the dogma that by the shed of the innocent blood and by that alone shall the race of man find cleanse and salvation will no agony of reluctance overcome the necessity that one man die so that the whole people perish not can it be true that by nothing less than the three day of pestilence shall the land be purge of its stain and be this old divine alternative about to confront we in new modern form do the inscrutable artemi indeed demand offering of human blood to suage she anger most sad that man should ever need should ever have need to foul he hand in the -lrb- greek : musaron aima -rrb- of he own vein but what be be and can it be fate that the most advanced civilisation of the future shall need have in it as the first and chief element of its glory the most barbarous of all the ritual of barbarism -- the immolation of hecatomb which wail a muling human wail be it indeed part of man 's strange destiny through the deep of time that he one day bow he back to the duty of pruning himself as a garden so that he run not to a waste wilderness shall the physician the _ accoucheur _ of the time to come be expect and command to do on the ephod and breast-plate anoint he head with the oil of gladness and add to the function of healer the function of sacrificial priest these you say be wild dark question wild enough dark enough we know how sparta -- the man-taming sparta simonide call she -- answer they here be the complete subordination of all unit-life to the well-being of the whole the child immediately on he entry into the world fall under the control of the state : it be not leave to the judgment of he parent as elsewhere whether he should be bring up or not but a commission of the phyle in which he be bear decide the question if he be weakly if he have any bodily unsightliness he be expose on a place call taygetus and so perish it be a consequence of this that never do the sun in he course light on man half so godly stalwart on woman half so houri-lovely as in stern and stout old sparta death like all mortal they must bear disease once and for all they be resolve to have do with the word which they use to express the idea ugly mean also hateful vile disgraceful -- and i need hardly point out to you the significance of that fact alone for they consider -- and rightly -- that there be no sort of natural reason why every denizen of earth should not be perfectly hale integral sane beautiful -- if only very moderate pain be take to procure this divine result one fellow indeed call nancleida grow a little too fat to please the sensitive eye of the spartan : i believe he be periodically whip under a system so very barbarous the super-sweet egoistic voice of the club-footed poet byron would of course never have be hear : one brief egoistic lament on taygetus and so a end it be not however certain that the world could not have manage very well without lord byron the one thing that admit of no contradiction be that it can not manage without the holy citizen and that disease to man and to nation can have but one mean annihilation near or ultimate at any rate from these remark you will now very likely be able to arrive at some understanding of the wording of the advertisement which i send to the papers ' zaleskus have deliver himself of this singular _ tirade _ pause : replace the sepulchral relief in its niche : draw a drapery of silver cloth over he bare foot and the hem of he antique garment of babylon : and then continue : ` after some time the answer to the advertisement at length arrive but what be my disgust to find that it be perfectly unintelligible to I i have ask for a date and a address : the reply come give a date and a address too -- but a address wrap up in cypher which of course i as a suppose member of the society be expect to be able to read at any rate i now know the significance of the incongruous circumstance that the latin proverb _ men sana etc _ should be adopt as the motto of a greek society the significance lay in this that the motto _ contain a address _ -- the address of they meeting-place or at least of they chief meeting-place i be now confront with the task of solve -- and of solve quickly without the loss of a hour -- this enigma and i confess that it be only by the most violent and extraordinary concentration of what i may call the dissect faculty that i be able to do so in good time and yet there be no special difficulty in the matter for look at the motto as it stand in cypher the first thing i perceive be that in order to read the secret the heart-shaped figure must be leave out of consideration if there be any _ consistency _ in the system of cypher at all for it belong to a class of symbol quite distinct from that of all the other not be like they a picture-letter omit this therefore and take all the other vowel and consonant whether actually represent in the device or not i now get the proverb in the form _ men sana in pore sano _ i write this down and what instantly strike I be the immense the altogether unusual number of _ liquid _ in the motto -- six in all amount to no less than one-third of the total number of letter put these all together you get _ mnnnnr _ and you can see that the very appearance of the m 's and n 's -lrb- especially when _ write _ -rrb- run into one another of itself suggest a stream of water have previously arrive at the conclusion of london as the meeting-place i could not now fail to go on to the inference of _ the thame _ there or near there would i find those whom i seek the letter mnnnnr then mean the thame : what do the still remain letter mean i now take these remain letter place they side by side : i get aaa sss ee oo p and i juxtapose these nearly in the order indicate by the frequency of they occurrence and they place in the roman alphabet you at once and inevitably get the word _ aesopus _ and now i be fairly startle by this symmetrical proof of the exactness of my own deduction in other respects but above all far above all by the occurrence of that word _ aesopus _ for who be aesopus he be a slave who be free for he wise and witful sally : he be therefore typical of the liberty of the wise -- they moral manumission from temporary and narrow law he be also a close friend of croesus : he be typical then of the union of wisdom with wealth -- true wisdom with real wealth lastly and above all he be throw by the delphian from a rock on account of he wit : he be typical therefore of death -- the shed of blood -- as a result of wisdom this thought be a elaboration of solomon 's great maxim in much wisdom be much sorrow but how accurately all this fit in with what would naturally be the doctrine of the man on whose track i be i could no longer doubt the justness of my reasoning and immediately while you sleep i set off for london ` of my hap in london i need not give you a very particular account the meeting be to be hold on the 15th and by the morning of the 13th i have reach a place call wargrave on the thame there i hire a light canoe and thence proceed down the river in a somewhat zig-zag manner narrowly examine the bank on either side and keep a sharp out-look for some board or sign or house that would seem to betoken any sort of connection with the word aesopus in this way i pass a fruitless day and have reach the shipping region make fast my craft and in a spirit of _ diablerie _ spend the night in a common lodging-house in the company of the most remarkable human being characterise by a odour of alcohol and a certain obtrusive _ bonne camaraderie _ which the prevail fear of death could not altogether repress by dawn of the 14th i be on my journey again -- on and ever on eagerly i long for a sight of the word i seek : but i have misjudge the man against whose cunning i have measure my own i should have remember more consistently that they be no ordinary man as i be destine to find there lay a deeper more cabalistic meaning in the motto than any i have be able to dream of i have proceed on my pilgrimage down the river a long way past greenwich and have now reach a desolate and level reach of land stretch away on either hand paddling my boat from the right to the left bank i come to a spot where a little arm of the river run up some few yard into the land the place wear a specially dreary and desert aspect : the land be flat and cover with low shrub i row into this arm of shallow water and rest on my oar wearily bethink myself what be next to be do look round however i see to my surprise that at the end of this arm there be a short narrow pathway -- a wind road -- lead from the river-bank i stand up in the boat and follow its course with my eye it be meet by another road also wind among the bush but in a slightly different direction at the end of this be a little low high-roofed round house without door or window and then -- and then -- tingle now with a thousand rapture -- i beheld a pool of water near this structure and then another low house a counterpart of the first -- and then still lead on in the same direction another pool -- and then a great rock heart-shaped -- and then another wind road -- and then another pool of water all be a model -- _ exact to the minutest particular _ -- of the device on the papyrus the first long-waved line be the river itself the three short-waved line be the arm of the river and the two pool the three snake be the three wind road the two triangle represent the letter #a # be the two high-roofed round house the heart be the rock i spring now thoroughly excite from the boat and run in headlong haste to the end of the last lake here there be a rather thick and high growth of bush but peer among they my eye at once catch a white oblong board support on a stake : on this in black letter be mark the word descensus aesopi it be necessary therefore to go _ down _ : the meeting-place be subterranean it be without difficulty that i discover a small opening in the ground half hide by the underwood from the orifice i find that a series of wooden step lead directly downward and i at once boldly descend no sooner however have i touch the bottom than i be confront by a ancient man in hellenic apparel arm with the greek _ zipho _ and _ peltè _ he eye accustom to the gloom pierce I long with a earnest scrutiny ` you be a spartan he ask at length ` yes i answer promptly ` then how be it you do not know that i be stone deaf ' i shrug indicate that for the moment i have forget the fact ` you _ be _ a spartan he repeat ' i nod with emphasis ` then how be it you omit to make the sign ` now you must not suppose that at this point i be nonplussed for in that case you would not give due weight to the strange inherent power of the mind to rise to the occasion of a sudden emergency -- to stretch itself long to the length of a event i do not hesitate to say that _ no _ combination of circumstance can defeat a vigorous brain fully alert and in possession of itself with a quickness to which the lightning-flash be tardy i remember that this be a spot indicate by the symbol on the papyrus : i remember that this same papyrus be always place under the _ tongue _ of the dead i remember too that among that very nation whose language have afford the motto to turn up the _ thumb _ -lrb- _ pollicem vertere _ -rrb- be a symbol significant of death i touch the under surface of my tongue with the tip of my thumb the aged man be appease i pass on and examine the place ` it be simply a vast circular hall the arched roof of which be support on colonnade of what i take to be pillar of porphyry down the middle and round the side run table of the same material the wall be clothe in hanging of sable velvet on which in infinite reproduction be embroider in cypher the motto of the society the chair be cushion in the same stuff near the center of the circle stand a huge statue of what really seem to I to be pure beaten gold on the great ebon base be inscribe the word -lrb- greek : lukurgo -rrb- from the roof swing by brazen chain a single misty lamp ` have see this much i reascended to the land of light and be fully resolve on attend the meeting on the next day or night and not know what my fate might then be i write to inform you of the means by which my body might be trace ` but on the next day a new thought occur to I : i reason thus : these man be not common assassin they wage a too rash warfare against diseased life but not against life in general in all probability they have a quite immoderate quite morbid reverence for the sanctity of healthy life they will not therefore take mine _ unless _ they suppose I to be the only living outsider who have a knowledge of they secret and therefore think it absolutely necessary for the carry out of they beneficent design that my life should be sacrifice i will therefore prevent such a motive from occur to they by communicate to another they whole secret and -- if the necessity should arise -- _ let they know _ that i have do so without tell they who that other be thus my life will be assure i therefore write to you on that day a full account of all i have discover give you to understand however on the envelope that you need not examine the contents for some little time ' i wait in the subterranean vault during the greater part of the next day but not till midnight do the confederate gather what happen at that meeting i shall not disclose even to you all be sacred -- solemn -- full of awe of the choral hymn there sing the hierophantic ritual liturgy paean the gorgeous symbolism -- of the wealth there represent the culture art self-sacrifice -- of the mingling of all the tongue of europe -- i shall not speak nor shall i repeat name which you would at once recognize as familiar to you -- though i may perhaps mention that the morri whose name appear on the papyrus send to I be a well-known _ littérateur _ of that name but this in confidence for some year at least ` let I however hurry to a conclusion my turn come to speak i rise undaunted and calmly disclose myself during the moment of hush of wide-eyed paralysis that ensue i declare that fully as i coincide with they view in general i find myself unable to regard they method with approval -- these i could not but consider too rash too harsh too premature my voice be suddenly drown by one universal earth-shaking roar of rage and contempt during which i be surround
