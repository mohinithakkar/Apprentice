the plough for the first time that morn no soldier gay feel at he side the throb of the gold hilt -lrb- know the blue blade hide within its sheath as lightning in the cloud -rrb- with more delight when first he belt it on than he that day hear still the clank of the plough-chain against the horse ' harnessed side as to the field they go to make it fruitful o'er the hill the sun look down baptize he for toil a farmer 's son he be and grandson too yea he great-grandsire have possess these field tradition say they have be till by man who bear the name long century ago and marry wife and rear a stalwart race and die and go where all have follow they save one old man he daughter and the youth who plough in pride nor ever doubt he toil and death be far from he this sunny morn why should we think of death when life be high the earth laugh all the day and sleep all night earth give we food and after that a grave for both be good each better in its time the youth know little but he read old tale of scotland 's warrior till he blood run swift as charge knight upon they death career and then he chant old tune till the blood be charm back into its fountain-well and tear arise instead and robert 's song which ever flow in noise like he name rise from he in the field beside the kine and meet the sky-lark 's rain from out the cloud as yet he sing only as sing the bird from gladness simply or he know not why the earth be fair -- he know not it be fair and he so glad -- he know not he be glad : he walk as in a twilight of the sense which this one day shall turn to tender light for ere the sun have clear the feathery top of the fir-thicket on the eastward hill he horse lean and labor he great hand hold both the rein and plough-stilt : he be proud proud with a ploughman 's pride nobler may be than statesman 's ay or poet 's pride sometimes for little praise would come that he plough well and yet he do it well proud of he work and not of what would follow with sure eye he see the horse keep the arrow-track he see the swift share cut the measure sod he see the furrow folding to the right ready with nimble foot to aid at need and there the slay sod lay patient for grain turn its secret upward to the sun and hiding in a grave green sun-born grass and daisy clip in carmine : all must die that other live and they arise again then when the sun have clomb to he decline and seem to rest before he slow descent upon the keystone of he airy bridge they rest likewise half-tired man and horse and homeward go for food and courage new whereby refresh they turn again to toil and live in labor all the afternoon till in the gloaming once again the plough lay like a stranded bark upon the lea and home with hang neck the horse go walk beside they master force by will then through the deepen shades a vision come it be a lady mount on a horse a slender girl upon a mighty steed that bear she with the pride horse must feel when they submit to woman home she go alone or else the groom lag far behind but as she pass some faithless belt give way the saddle slip the horse stop and the girl stand on she foot still hold fast the rein three pace bear he bound to she side she radiant beauty almost fix he there but with main force as one that gripe with fear he throw the fascination off and see the work before he soon he hand and knife replace the saddle firmer than before upon the gentle horse and then he turn to mount the maiden but bewilderment a moment last for he know not how with stirrup-hand and steady arm to throne elastic on she steed the ascend maid : a moment only for while yet she thank nor yet have time to teach she further will around she waist he put he brawny hand that almost zone she round and like a child lift she high he set she on the horse whence like a rise moon she smile on he nor turn away although a radiant blush shone in she cheek and shadow in she eye but he be never sure if from she heart or from the rosy sunset come the flush again she thank he while again he stand bewilder in she beauty not a word answer she word that flow fold in tone round which dissolve lambent music play like drop water in a silver cup till round the shoulder of the neighbouring hill sudden she disappear and he awake and call himself hard name and turn and go after he horse bend too he head ah god when beauty pass by the door although she ne'er come in the house grow bare shut shut the door there be nothing in the house why seem it always that it should be ours a secret lie behind which thou dost know and i can partly guess but think not then the holder of the plough have many sigh upon he bed that night or other dream than pleasant rise upon he view in sleep within the magic crystal of the soul nor that the airy castle of he brain have less foundation than the air admit but read my simple tale scarce worth the name and answer if he gain not from the fair beauty 's best gift and prove she not in sooth a angel vision from a higher world not much of she i tell she changeful life where part the water on the mountain ridge flow down the other side apart from he she tale have wile deep sigh on summer eve where in the ancient mystery of wood walketh a man who worship womanhood soon be she orphan of such parent-haunt surround with dead glitter not the shine of leaf in wind and sunlight while the youth breathe on as if a constant breaking dawn send forth the new-born wind upon he brow and know the morning light be climb up the further hill-side -- morning light which most they say reveal the inner hue of earth now she be such as god have make she ere the world have try to spoil she tried i say and half-succeeded fail utterly fair be she frank and innocent as a child that stare you in the eye fearless of ill because she know it not and brave withal because she drink the draught that maketh strong the charmed country air she father 's house -- a scottish laird be he of ancient name -- stand only two mile off amid the hill but though she often pass alone as now the youth have never see she face before and might not twice yet be not once enough it leave he not she as the harvest moon that goeth on she way and knoweth not the field of grain whose ripening ear she fill with wealth of life and human joyfulness go on and know not of the influence she leave behind yea never think of he save at those time when all at once old scene return uncalled with wonder that they come amidst far other thought and other care sink again into they ancient grave till some far-whispered necromantic spell loose they once more to wander for a space again i say no fond romance of love no argument of possibility if he be some one and she claim he aid turn he clear brain into a nest of dream as soon he have sit down and twisted cord to snare and carry home for daylight use some woman-angel wander half-seen on moonlight wing o'er withered autumn field but when he rise next morn and go abroad -lrb- the exultation of he new-found rank already settle into dignity -rrb- he find the earth be beautiful the sky which shine with expectation of the sun somehow he know not how be like she face he grieve almost to plough the daisy down something they share in common with that smile wherewith she crown he manhood and they fall bent in the furrow sometimes with they head just out imploringly a hedgehog run with tangled mesh of bristle spike and face helplessly innocent across the field : he let it run and bless it as it run at noon return something draw he foot into the barn enter he gaze and stand through the rent roof alight one sunbeam blaze upon the straw one golden spot dull all the yellow heap and sink far down like flame invert through the loose-piled mound cross the splendor with the shadow-straw in line innumerable 'twa so bright the eye be cheat with a spectral smoke that rise as from a fire he never know before how beautiful the sunlight be though he have see it in the grassy field and on the river and the ripening corn a thousand time he throw he on the heap and gaze down into the glory-gulf dream as a boy half-sleeping by the fire and dream rise and get he horse out god and not woman be the heart of all but she as priestess of the visible earth hold the key herself most beautiful have come to he and fling the portal wide he enter in : each beauty be a glass that gleam the woman back upon he view already in these hour he grow soul put forth the white tip of a floral bud ere long to be a crown-like shadowy flower for by he song and joy in ancient tale he show the seed lay hide in he heart a safe sure treasure hide even from he and notwithstanding mellow all he spring until like sunshine with its genial power come the fair maiden 's face : the seed awake i need not follow he through many day nor tell the joy that rise around he path minister pleasure for he labor 's meed nor how each morning be a boon to he nor how the wind with nature 's kiss fraught flow inward to he soul nor how the flower assert each a individual life a separate be for and in he thought nor how the stormy day that intervene call forth he strength and song that quell they force nor how in winter-time when thick the snow arm the sad field from gnawing of the frost and the low sun but skirt he far realm and sink in early night he take he place beside the fire and by the feeble lamp head book on book and live in other life and other need and other clime than he and add other being thus to he but i must tell that love of knowledge grow within he to a passion and a power till through the night -lrb- all dark except the moon shine frosty o'er the lea or the white snow give back all mote of light that else have sink into the thirsty earth -rrb- he bent he way over the moor to where the little town lay gather in the hollow there the man who teach the child all the shorten day teach other scholar in the long fore-night and youth who in the shop or in the barn or at the loom have do they needful work come to he schoolroom in the murky night and find the fire aglow the candle light and the good master wait for he man here mathematics wile he to they height and strange consent of line to form and law make euclid like a great romance of truth the master see with wonder how the youth all eagerly devour the offer food and straightway long to lead he with that hope of sympathy which urge he that know to multiply great knowledge by its gift that so two soul ere long may see one truth and turn see each other ' face shine so he propose the classic and the youth catch at the offer and for many a night when other lay and lose themselves in sleep he grope he way with lexicon and rule through ancient deed embalm in latin old or poet-woods alive with gracious form wherein he knowledge of the english tongue -lrb- through read many book -rrb- much aid he -- for the soul 's language be the same in all at length he progress through the master 's word proud of he pupil reach the father 's ear great joy arise within he and he vow if care spare would accomplish it he should to college and should have he fill of that same learning so to school he go instead of to the plough and ere a year he wear the scarlet gown with the close sleeve awkward at first but with a dignity that soon find fit embodiment in speech and gesture and address he make he way not seek it to the respect of youth in whom respect be of the rarer gift likewise by the consent of accident more than he worth society so call in that great northern city to its room invite he he enter dazzle first not only by the brilliance of the show in light and mirror gem and crowd eye but by the surface light of many mind cut like rose-diamond into many plane which catch up the wander ray of fact reflect color toss they here and there in varied brilliance as if quite new-born from out the center not from off the face -- dazzle at first i say he soon begin to see how little thought could sparkle well and turn he even in the midst of talk back to the silence of he homely toil around he still and ever hang a air bear of the field and plough and cart and scythe a kind of clumsy grace in which gay girl see but the clumsiness while those with light instead of glitter in they quiet eye see the grace too yea sometimes when he talk see the grace only and begin at last as he seek none to seek he in the crowd -lrb- after a maiden fashion -rrb- that they might hear he dress thought not pay poor compliment yet seldom thus be he seduce from toil or if one eve he window show no light the next they faintly gleam in candle-shine till far into the morning and he win honor among the first each session 's close and if increase familiarity with open form of ill not to be shun where youth of all kind meet endanger there a mind more willing to be pure than most -- oft when the broad rich humor of a jest do with its breezy force make radiant way for pestilential vapor follow -- arise within he sudden silent mind the maiden face that smile and blush on he that lady face inspher beyond he earth yet visible to he as any star that shine unwavering i can not tell in word the tenderness that glow across he bosom -- burn it clean in will and think shall that sweet face be blow by laughter rude out of the soul where it have deign to come but will not stay what maiden may not hear he almost weep for shame that those two thought should ever look each other in the face meeting in _ he _ house thus he make to she for love a offering of purity and if the homage that he sometimes find new to the country lad convey in smile assent and silent listening when he speak threaten yet more he life 's simplicity a antidote of nature ever come even nature 's self for in the summer month he former haunt and boyhood 's circumstance receive he back within old influence and he too noble to despise the past too proud to be ashamed of manhood 's toil too wise to fancy that a gulf lay wide betwixt the labor hand and think brain or that a workman be no gentleman because a workman clothe himself again in he old garment take the hoe or spade or sowing sheet or cover in the grain smooth with harrow what the plough have ridge with ever fresher joy he hail the field return still with larger power of sight : each time he know they better than before and yet they sweetest aspect be the old he labor keep he true to life and fact casting out worldly judgment false desire and vain distinction ever at he toil new thought arise which when still night awake he ever seek like star with instrument by science or by wise philosophy bridge the gulf between they and the known and thus prepare for the coming month when in the time of snow old scotland 's son reap wisdom in the silence of the year he sire be proud of he and most of all because he learning do not make he proud a wise man build not much upon he lore the neighbor ask what he would make he son i 'll make a man of he the old man say and for the rest just what he like himself but as he be my only son i think he 'll keep the old farm join to the old name and i shall go to the churchyard content leave my name amongst my fellow man as safe thank god as if i bear it still but son be older than they sire full oft in the new world that cometh after this so four year long he life go to and fro betwixt the scarlet gown and rough blue coat the garret study and the wide-floored barn the wintry city and the sunny field in each he quiet mind be well content because he be himself where'er he be not in one channel flow he seek thought to no profession do he ardent turn : he know he father 's wish -- it be he own why should a man he say when knowledge grow leave therefore the old patriarchal life and seek distinction in the noise of man and yet he turn he face on every side go with the doctor to the lecture-room and see the inner form of man lay bare go with the chymist where the skilful hand revere law higher than nature 's self make nature do again before we eye and in a moment what in many year and in the veil of vastness and lone deep she laboureth at alway then best content when man inquire into she secret way yea turn he ask eye on every source whence knowledge floweth for the heart of man kneel at some and drinking freely there and at the end when he have gain the right to sit with covered head before the rank of black-gowned senator and all these man be ready at a word to speed he on proud of they pupil towards any goal where he might fix he eye he take he book what little of he gown and cap remain and leave with a sigh the ancient wall with the old stony crown unchanging gray amidst the blandishments of airy spring he seek for life the lone ancestral farm with simple gladness meet he on the road he grey-haired father elder brother now few word be speak little welcome say but much be understand on either side if with a less delight he bring he home than he that meet the prodigal return yet with more confidence more certain joy and with the lean pride that old man feel in young strong arm that draw they might from they he lead he to the house he sister there whose kiss be not many but whose eye be full of watchfulness and hover love set he beside the fire in the old place and heap the table with best country fare and when the night grow deep the father rise and lead he son -lrb- who wonder why they go and in the darkness make a tortuous path through the corn-rick -rrb- to a old loft above the stable where he horse rest still enter he see some plan-pursuing hand have be at work the father lead on across the floor heap up with wait grain open a door a unexpected light flash on they from a cheerful lamp and fire that burn alone as in a fairy tale and lo a little room white-curtained bed a old arm-chair bookshelf and write desk and some old print of deep virgilian wood and one a country churchyard on the wall the young man stand and speak not the old love seek and find incarnation new draw from he heart as from the earth the sun warm tear the good the fatherly old man honor in he son the simple need which he own bounty have beget in he thus give he loneliness for silent think a simple refuge he could call he own he grasp he hand and shake it say good night and leave he glad with love faintly beneath the horse stamp and draw the lengthen chain three slide year with gently blend change go round ` mid work of hand and brain and heart he labor as before though when he would with privilege he take from hour of toil when nothing press and read within he room or wander through the moorland to the hill there stand upon the apex of the world with a great altar-stone of rock beneath and look into the wide abyss of blue that roof he round and then with steady foot descend to the world and worthy care and on the Sunday father daughter son walk to the country church across the field it be a little church and plain almost to ugliness yet lack not a charm to he who sit there when a little boy and the low mound with long grass wave on be quite as solemn as great marble tomb and on the sunny afternoon across this well-sown field of death when forth they come with the last psalm still linger in they heart he look and wonder where the heap would rise that rest on the arch of he dead breast but in the gloom and rain he turn aside and let the drop soak through the sink clay -- what matter it to he and as they walk together home the father love to hear the new stream pour from he son 's clear well the old man cling not only to the old nor bow the young man only to the new yet as they walk full often he would say he like not much what he have hear that morn he say these man believe the past alone honor those jewish time as they be jew and have no ear for this poor needy hour that up and down the century doth go like beggar boy that wander through the street with hand hold out to any passer by and yet god make it and its many cry he use to say : i take the work that come all ready to my hand the lever set i grasp and heave withal or rather i love where i live and yield I to the will that make the need about I it may be i find they nearer to my need of work than any other choice i would not choose to lack a relish for the thing that god think worth among my own i will be good a helper to all those that look to I this farm be god 's as much as yonder town these man and maiden kine and horse he and need he law of truth make rule of fact or else the earth be not redeem from ill he speak not often but he rule and do no ill be suffer there by man or beast that he could help no creature flee from he and when he slew 'twa with a sudden death like god 's benignant lightning for he know that god doth make the beast and love they well and they be sacred spring from god as we they be we brethren in a lower kind and in they face he see the human look they say : man look like different animal but he : the animal be like to man some one and some another cruelty he say would need no other fiery hell than that the ghost of the sad beast should come and crowd silent all they head one way stare the ill man to madness by degree they know not how man trust in he when he speak he word have all the force of deed that lay unsaid within he to be good be more than holy word or definite act embody itself unconsciously in simple form of human helpfulness and understanding of the need that pray and when he read the weary tale of crime and wretchedness and white-faced child sad with hunger and neglect and cruel word he would walk sadly for a afternoon with head down-bent and ponder footstep slow and to himself conclude : the best i can for the great world be just the best i can for this my world the influence will go in widen circle to the darksome lane in london 's self when a philanthropist say pompously : with you great gift you ought to work for the great world not spend yourself on common labor like a common man he answer he : the world be in god 's hand this part he give to I for which my past build up on love inherit have make I fittest neither will he let I think primeval godlike work too low to need for its perfection manhood 's noblest power and deepest knowledge far beyond my gift and for the crowd of man in whom a soul cry through the window of they hollow eye for bare humanity and leave to grow -- would i could help they but all crowd be make of individual and they grief and pain and thirst and hunger all be of the one not of the many and the power that help enter the individual and extend thence in a thousand gentle influence to other heart it be not make one 's own by lay hold of a allotted share of general good divide faithfully now here i labor whole upon the place where they have know I from my childhood up i know the individual man and he know I if there be power in I to help it goeth forth beyond the present will clothing itself in very common deed of any humble day 's necessity : -- i would not always consciously do good not always feel a helper of the man who make I full return for my poor deed -lrb- which i _ must _ do for my own highest sake if i forget my brethren for themselves -rrb- by human trust and confidence of eye that look I in the face and hand that do my work at will -- ` tis more than i deserve but in the city with a few lame word and a few scanty handful of weak coin misunderstand or at the best unknown i should toil on and seldom reach the mail and if i leave the thing that lieth next to go and do the thing that be afar i take the very strength out of my deed seek the needy not for pure need 's sake thus he the world-wise schemer for the good hold he poor peace and leave he to he way what of the vision now the vision fair send forth to meet he when at eve he go home from he first day 's plough oft she pass slowly on horseback in all kind of dream for much he dream and love he dream well nor wake he from such dream with vain regret but say i have see that face once more he smile with he eye and rise to work nor do he turn aside from other maid but love the woman-face and dear eye and sometimes think one day i wed a maid and make she mine but never come the maid or never come the hour that he might say i wed this maid and ever when he read a tale of lofty aim or when the page of history speak of woman very fair or wondrous good she face arise and stay the face for ever of that storied page meantime how fare the lady she have wed one of those common man who serve as ore for the gold grain to lie in virgin gold lay hide there -- no richer be the dross she go to gay assembly not content for she have find no heart that strike with hers sound one chord she go and dance or sit and listlessly converse or if at home read the new novel wish all the time for something better though she know not what or how to search for it what have she feel if through the rhythmic motion of light form a vision have arise as when of old the minstrel 's art lay bare the seer 's eye and show he plenteous water in the waste if she have see she ploughman-lover go with he great stride across some lonely field beneath the dark blue vault ablaze with star and lift he full eye to earth 's radiant roof in gladness that the roof be yet a floor for other foot to tread for he one day or the emerge vision might reveal he in he room with space-compelling mind pursue upon he slate some planet 's course or read and justify the poet 's wrath or wise man 's slow conclusion or in dream all gently bless she with a tremble voice for that old smile that wither nevermore that wake he smile he into what he be or kneel cry to god for better still would those dark eye have beam with darker light would that fair soul all tired of emptiness have rise from the couch of its unrest and look to heaven again again believe in god 's reality of life and fact would not she soul have sing unto itself in secret joy too good for that vain throng : i have a friend a ploughman who be wise and knoweth god and goodness and fair faith who needeth not the outward show of thing but worship the unconquerable truth : and this man loveth I i will be proud and humble -- would he love I if he know in the third year a heavy harvest fall full fill beneath the reaping-hook and scythe the man and maiden in the scorching heat hold on they toil lighten by song and jest rest at mid-day and from brim bowl drinking brown ale and white abundant milk until the last ear fall and stubble stand where wave the forest of the murmur corn and o'er the land rise pile the tent-like shock as of a army rest in array of tent by tent rank follow on rank wait until the moon should have she will of ripen on the ear and all go well the grain be fully ripe the harvest cart go forth broad-platformed for the towering load with frequent passage ` twixt homeyard and field and half the oats already hide they top of countless spray-hung grain -- they top by wind sway oft and ring rustling contact sweet make heavy oft by slow-combining dew or beat earthward by the pelting rain rise again in breeze to the sun and bear all thing till the perfect time -- have hide i say this growth of sun and air within the darkness of the towering stack when in the north low billowy cloud appear blue-based white-topped at close of afternoon and in the west dark mass plash with blue with outline vague of misty steep and dell clomb o'er the hill-top there be thunder there the air be sultry but the upper sky be clear and radiant downward go the sun down low behind the low and sullen cloud that wall the west and down below the hill that lay beneath they hide uprose the moon and look for silence in she moony field but there she find it not the staggering cart like a o'erladen beast crawl homeward still return light and low the laugh break yet that lightning of the soul from cloudless sky though not so frequent now that labor pass its natural hour yet on the labor go strain to beat the welkin-climbing toil of the huge rain-cloud heavy with they flood sleep like enchantress old soon side with the crawl cloud and flung benumbing spell on man and horse the youth that guide home the ponderous load of sheaf higher than wont daring the slumberous lightning with a start awake by fall full against the wheel that circle slow after the sleepy horse yet none would yield to soft-suggesting sleep or leave the last few shock for the wild rain would catch thereby the skirt of harvest-home and hold she linger half-way in the storm the scholar labor with he man all night not that he favor quite this headlong race with nature he would rather say : the night be send for sleep we ought to sleep in it and leave the cloud to god not every storm that climbeth heavenward overwhelm the earth and if god will ` tis better as he will what he take from we never can be lose but the old farmer order and the son go manful to the work and hold he peace the last cart homeward go oppress with sheaf just as a moist dawn blot pale the east and the first drop fall overf with mist o'ergrown and helpless darker grow the morn upstrain rack of cloud tumultuous bear upon the turmoil of oppose wind meet in the zenith and the silence cease : the lightning brake and flood all the earth and its great roar of billow follow it the deeper darkness drink the light again and lay unslaked but ere the darkness come in the full revelation of the flash he see along the road bear on a horse powerful and gentle the sweet lady go whom year agone he see for evermore ah I he say my dream be come for I now they shall have they time and home he go and sleep and moan and wake and rave and weep through all the net-drawn labyrinth of he brain the fever rage like pent internal fire he father soon be by he and the hand of he one sister soothe he day go by as in a summer evening after rain he wake to sweet quiescent consciousness enfeebled much but with a new-born life as slow the week pass he recover strength and ere the winter come seem strong once more but the brown hue of health have not return on he thin face although a keener fire burn in he larger eye and in he cheek the mount blood glow radiant -lrb- summon force sometimes unbidden -rrb- with a sunset red before its time a bite frost set in and gnaw with fang of cold he shrink life and the disease so common to the north be bear of outer cold and inner heat one morn he sister enter saw he sleep but in he hand he hold a handkerchief spot with crimson white with terror she stand motionless and stare startled next by she own pallor when she raise she eye see in the glass she move at last he wake and see she dismay say with a smile blood-red be evermore my favorite hue and see i have it in I that be all she shudder and he try to jest no more and from that hour look death full in the face when first he see the red blood outward leap as if it seek again the fountain heart whence it have flow to fill the golden bowl no terror but a wild excitement seize he spirit now the pondered mystery of the unseen would fling its portal wide and he would enter one of the awful dead whom man conceive as ghost that fleet and pine bereft of weight and half they value life -- but who he know must live intenser life have through matter all illume with sense flame like horeb 's bush with present soul and by the contact with a thousand soul each in the present glory of a shape suck so much honey from the flower o ' the world and keep the gain and cast the means aside and now all eye all ear all sense perhaps transform transfigured yet the same life-power that mould first the visible to its use so like a child he be that wait the show while yet the panting light restrain burn at half height and the theater be full but as the day go on they bring sad hour when he would sit he hand upon he knee droop and longing for the wine of life ah now he learn what new necessity come when the outer sphere of life be riven and cast distorted shadow on the soul while the poor soul not yet complete in god can not with inward light burn up the shades and laugh at seem that be not the fact for god who speak to man on every side send he voice from the outer world glorious in star and wind and flower and wave and from the inner world of thing unseen in hope and thought and deep assurance not seldom cease outward speech awhile that the inner isle in calm may clearer sound or call through dull storm proclaim a rest one center fix amid conflict sphere and thus the soul calm in itself become able to meet and cope with outward thing which else would overwhelm it utterly and that the soul say _ i will the light _ may in its absence yet grow light itself and man 's will glow the present will of god self-known and yet divine ah gracious god do with we what thou wilt thou glorious heart thou art the god of they that grow no less than they that be and so we trust in thee for what we shall be and in what we be yet in the frequent pause of the light when fall the drizzle thaw or flaky snow or when the heaped-up ocean of still foam repose upon the tranced earth breathing low he soul be like a frozen lake beneath the clear blue heaven reflect it so dim that he could scarce believe there be a heaven and fear that beauty might be but a toy invent by himself in happier mood for say he if my mind can dim the fair why should it not enhance the fairness too but then the poor mind lay itself all dim and ruffle with the outer restlessness of strive death and life and a tired man may drop he eyelid on the visible world to whom no dream when fancy flieth free will bring the sunny excellence of day nor will he utmost force increase he sight ` tis easy to destroy not so to make no keen invention lay the stratum deep of ancient history or sweep the sea with purple shadow and blue breeze ' track or rosy memory of the down-gone sun and if god mean no beauty in these show but drop they helpless shadow from he sun ah I my heart thou needst another god oh lack and doubt and fear can only come because of plenty confidence and love : without the mountain there be no abyss we spirit inward cast upon themselves because the delicate ether which doth make the mediator with the outer world be trouble and confuse with stormy pain not glad because confine to shutter room which let the sound of slanting rain be hear but show no sparkling sunlight on the drop or ancient rainbow dawn in the west -- cast on themselves i say nor find there the thing they need because god have not come and claim all they human he divine reveal himself in all they inward part go wander up and down a dreary house thus reason he yet up and down the house he wander moan till he soul and frame in painful rest compel full oft lay still and suffer only then all suddenly a light would break from forth a inward well -- god shone within he and the sun arise and to its window go the soul and look : -- lo o'er the bosom of the outspread earth flow the first wave of sunrise ripple on much gather he of patient faith from off these gloomy heath this land of mountain dark by moonlight only like the sorcerer 's weed as testify these write line of he find on he table when he empty chair stand by the wall with yet a history cling around it for the old man 's eye i be weary and something lonely and can only think think if there be some water only that a spirit might drink drink and rise with light in the eye and a crown of hope on the brow and walk in outgoing gladness -- not sit in a inward sadness -- as now but lord thy child will be sad as sad as it pleaseth thee will sit not need to be glad till thou bid sadness flee and draw near with a simple cheer speak one true word to I another song in a low minor key from awful holy calm as this from grief i weave a silken flower into my web that go straight on with simply cross line float few color upward to the sight ah holy midnight of the soul when star alone be high when wind be dead or at they goal and sea-wave only sigh ambition faint from out the will asleep sad longing lie all hope of good all fear of ill all need of action die because god be and claim the life he kindle in thy brain and thou in he rapt far from strife diest and liv ` st again it be a change and wintry time to he but visit by April air and scent that come with sudden presence unforetold as brush from off the outer sphere of spring in the new singing world by wind of sigh that wander sweep across the glad _ to be _ strange longing that he never know till now a sense of want yea of a infinite need cry out within he -- rather moan than cry and he would sit a silent hour and gaze upon the distant hill with dazzling snow upon they peak and thence adown they side streak vaporous or star in solid blue and then a shadowy sense arise in he as if behind those world-inclosing hill there sit a mighty woman with a face as calm as life when its intensity push it nigh to death wait for he to make he grand for ever with a kiss and send he silent through the tone world the father see he wane the proud sire behold he pride go droop in the cold down down to the warm earth and give god thanks that he be old but evermore the son look up and smile as he have hear strange news across the waste of primrose-bud and flower then again to he father he would come seek for comfort as a troubled child and with the same child 's hope of comfort there sure there be one great father in the heaven since every word of good from father ' lip falleth with such authority although they be but man as we : god speak in they so this poor son who near the unknown death take comfort in he father 's tenderness and make he strong to die one day he come and say : what think you father be it hard this die well my boy he say we 'll try and make it easy with the present god but as i judge though more by hope than sight it seemeth harder to the looker on than he that dieth it may be each breath that they would call a gasp seem unto he a sigh of pleasure or at most the sob wherewith the unclothed spirit step by step wade forth into the cool eternal sea i think my boy death have two side to it one sunny and one dark as this round earth be every day half sunny and half dark we on the dark side call the mystery _ death _ they on the other look down in light wait the glad birth with other tear than ours be near I father when i die he say i will my boy until a better sire take you hand out of mine and i shall say : i give he back to thee oh love he god for he need more than i can ever be and then my son mind and be near in turn when my time come you in the light beyond and know all about it i all dark and so the day go on until the green shone through the snow in patch very green : for though the snow be white yet the green shone and hope of life awake within he heart for the spring draw he warm soft bud spring with promise the father better know god give we heaven remember we poor heart we never grasp the zenith of the time we find no spring except in winter prayer now he who stride a king across he field creep slowly through the breathing of the spring and sometimes weep in secret that the earth which dwell so near he heart with all its sun and moon and maiden soon would lie afar across some unknown sure-dividing waste yet think not though i fall upon the sad and linger listen to the faint tone before i strike new chord that seize the old and waft they essence up the music-stair -- think not that he be always sad nor dare to look the blank unknown full in the void : for he have hope in god the growth of year pondering and aspiration from a child and prayer and reading and repentance something within he ever seek to come at peace with something deeper in he still some sound sigh ever for a harmony with other deeper fainter tone that still draw nearer from the unknown depths wherein the individual goeth out in god and smooth the discord ever as they grow now he go back the way the music come hope some nearer sign of god at hand and most of all to see the very face that in judea once at supper time arise a heaven of tenderness above the face of john who lean upon the breast soon to lie down in its last weariness and as the spring go on he bud life swell up and bud towards the invisible burst the earthy mould wherein it lay he never think of churchyard as before when he be strong but ever look above away from the green earth to the blue sky and thank god that he die not in the cold for say he i would rather go abroad when the sun shine and bird be happy here for though it may be we shall know no place but only mighty realm of make thought -lrb- not live in creation any more but evermore create we own world -rrb- yet still it seem as if i have to go into the sea of air that float and heave and swing its massy wave around we earth and may feel wet to the unclothed soul and i would rather go when it be full of light and blueness than when gray and fog thicken it with the steam of the old earth now in the first of summer i shall die lie mayhap at sunset sinking asleep and go with the light and from the dark and when the earth be dark they 'll say : ` he be dead ' but i shall say : ` ah god i live and love the earth be fair but this be fairer still my dear one they be very dear but now the past be past for they be dearer still ' so i shall go in starlight it may be or lapt in moonlight ecstasy to seek the heart of all the man of all my friend whom i shall know my own beyond all love because he make all loving true and deep and i live on he in he he in I the weary day and night have teach he much have send he as a sick child creep along until he hide he in he mother 's breast seek for god for all he know before seem as he know it not he need now to feel god 's arm around he hold he close close to he heart ere he could rest a hour and god be very good to he he say ah god we need the winter as the spring and thy poor child know thy great heart and that thou bearest thy large share of grief because thou lovest goodness more than joy in they thou lovest -- so dost let they grieve will cease to vex thee with they peevish cry will look and smile though they be sorrowful and not the less pray for thy help when pain be overstrong come to thee for rest one day we praise thee for without the pain one night as oft he lay and could not sleep he soul be like a empty darkened room through which strange picture pass from the outer world while regnant will lay passive and look on but the eye-tube through which the shadow come be turn towards the past one after one arise old scene old sorrow old delight ah god how sad be all thing that grow old even the rose-leaf have a mournful scent and old brown letter be more sad than grave old kiss lie about the fount of tear like autumn leave around the winter well and yet they can not die a smile once smile be to eternity a smile -- no less and that which smile and kiss liveth still and thou canst do great wonder wonderful at length as ever in such vision-hour come the bright maiden ride the great horse and then at once the will spring up awake and like a necromantic sage forbid what come unbidden to depart at will so on that form he rest he sad thought till he begin to wonder what she lot how she have fare in spin history into a psyche-cradle where to die and then emerge -- what butterfly pure white with silver dust of feather on its wing or that dull red sear with its ebon spot and then he think : i know some woman fail and cease to be so very beautiful and i have hear man rave of certain eye in which i could not rest a moment 's space straightway the fount of possibility begin to gurgle under in he soul anon the lava-stream burst forth amain and glow and scorch and blast as it flow for purest soul sometimes have direst fear in ghost-hour when the shadow of the earth be cast on half she child from the sun who be afar and busy with the rest if my high lady be but only such as some man say of woman -- very pure when dress in white and shine in man 's eye and with the waving of great unborn wing around they in the aether of the soul feel at the root where sens meet in one like dim-remembered air and rhyme and hue but when alone at best a common thing with earthward thought and foot that be of earth ah no -- it can not be she be of god but then fair thing may perish higher life give deeper death fair gift make fouler fault : woman themselves -- i dare not think the rest and then they say that in she london world they have other law and judgment than in ours and so the thought walk up and down he soul and find at last a spot wherein to rest build a resolution for the day but next day and the next he be too worn with the unrest of this chaotic night -- as if a man have spring to life before the spirit of god move on the water ' face and make he dwelling ready who in pain himself untuned groan for a harmony for order and for law around he life -- too tired he be to do as he have plan but on the next a genial south-born wind wave the blue air beneath the golden sun bring glad news of summer from the south into he little room the bright ray shine and dart through the busy blaze fire turn it ghostly pale slew it almost as the great sunshine of the further life quench the glow of this and giveth death he have lie gaze at the wondrous strife and strange commingling of the sun and fire like spiritual and vital energy whereof the one doth bear the other first and then destroy it for a better birth and now he rise to help the fail fire because the sunshine come not near enough to do for both and then he clothe himself and sit he down betwixt the sun and fire and get he ink and paper and begin and write with earnest die heart as thus lady i owe thee much nay do not look to find my name for though i write it here i date as from the churchyard where i lie whilst thou art reading and thou know ` st I not i dare to write because i be crown by death thy equal if my boldness should offend i pure in my intent hide with the ghost where thou wilt never meet I until thou knowest that death like god doth make of one but pardon lady ere i have begin my thought move towards thee with a gentle flow that bear a depth of water when i take my pen to write they rush into a gulf precipitate and foamy can it be that death who humble all have make I proud lady thy loveliness have walk my brain as if i be thy heritage in sooth bequeath from sire beyond all story 's reach for i have love thee from afar and long joyous in have see what lift I by very power to see above myself thy beauty have make beautiful my life thy virtue make mine strong to be itself thy form have put on every change dress of name and circumstance and history that so the life dumb in the wondrous page recording woman 's glory might come forth and be the living fact to longing eye -- thou thou essential womanhood to I afar as angel or the sainted dead yet near as loveliness can haunt a man and take any shape for every need year many year have pass since the first time which be the last i see thee what have they make or unmade in thee i ask myself o lovely in my memory art thou as lovely in thyself thy feature then say what god make thee art thou such indeed forgive my boldness lady i be dead and dead man may cry loud they make no noise i have a prayer to make thee -- hear the dead lady for god 's sake be as beautiful as that white form that dwelleth in my heart yea better still as that ideal pure that waketh in thee when thou prayest god or helpest thy poor neighbor for myself i pray for if i die and find that she my woman-glory life in common air be not so very radiant after all my sad face will afflict the calm-eyed ghost not use to see such rooted sadness there at least in field where i may hope to walk and find good company upon my knee i could implore thee -- justify my faith in womanhood 's white-handed nobleness and thee its revelation unto I but i bethink I lady if thou turn thy thought upon thyself for the great sake of purity and conscious whiteness ' self thou wilt but half succeed the other half be to forget the first and all thyself quench thy moonlight in the blaze of day turn thy be full unto thy god where shouldst thou quite forget the name of truth yet thou wouldst be a pure twice holy child -lrb- twice bear of god once of thy own pure will arise at the call father 's voice -rrb- do the right with sweet unconsciousness have god in thee a completer soul be sure than thou alone thou not the less complete in choice and individual life since that which sayeth _ i _ doth call he _ sire _ lady i die -- the father hold I up it be not much to thee that i should die -lrb- how should it be for thou hast never look deep in my eye as i once look in thine -rrb- but it be much that he doth hold I up i thank thee lady for a gentle look thou lettest fall upon I long ago the same sweet look be possible to thee for evermore -- i bless thee with thine own and say farewell and go into my grave -- nay nay into the blue heaven of my hope then come he name in full and then the name of the green churchyard where he hope to lie and then he lay he back weary and say : o god i be only a attempt at life sleep fall again ere i be full awake life goeth from I in the morning hour i have see nothing clearly feel no thrill of pure emotion save in dream wild dream and sometimes when i look right up to thee i have be proud of knowledge when the flame of truth high truth but flicker in my soul only at time in lonely midnight hour when in my soul the star come forth and bring new height of silence quell all my sea have i beheld clear truth apart from form and known myself a living lonely thought isle in the hyaline of truth alway i have not reap earth 's harvest o my god have gather but a few poor wayside flower harebell red poppy close pimpernel -- all which thou hast invent beautiful god to gather by the way for comforting have i aim proudly therefore aim too low strive for something visible in my thought and not the unseen thing hide far in thine make I content to be a primrose-flower among thy nation that the fair truth hide in the sweet primrose enter into I and i rejoice a individual soul reflect thee as truly then divine as if i tower the angel of the sun all in the night the glowing worm have give I keener joy than a whole heaven of star : thou camest in the worm more near I then nor do i think be i that green delight i would change to be the shadowy evening star ah make I father anything thou wilt so be thou will it i be safe with thee i laugh exult make I something god clear sunny veritable purity of high existence in itself content and in the thing that be besides itself and seek for no measure i have find the good of earth if i have find this death now i be ready take I when thou wilt he lay the letter in he desk with seal and superscription when he sister come he say you 'll find a note there -- afterwards -- take it yourself to the town and let it go but do not see the name my sister true -- i 'll tell you all about it when you come and as the eve through paler darker shades insensibly decline and be no more the lordly day once more a memory so die he in the hush of noon he die through the low valley-fog he brake and climb the sun shone on -- why should he not shine on the summer noise rise o'er all the land the love of god lay warm on hill and plain ` tis well to die in summer when the breath after a long still pause return no more the old man sink upon he knee and say : father i thank thee it be over now and thou hast help he well through this sore time so one by one we all come back to thee all son and brother thank thee who do put of thy fatherhood in we poor heart that have child we might guess thy love and at the last find all love one in thee and then he rise and comfort the maid who in she brother lose the pride of life weep as all she heaven be full of rain when that which be so like he -- so unlike -- lay in the churchyard and the green turf soon would grow together heal up the wound of the old earth who take she share again the sister go to do he last request then find she with he other papers this -- a farewell song in lowland scottish tongue : -- greetna father that i be gaein ' for fu ' weel ye ken the gaet i ' the winter corn ye be sawin ' -- i ' the hairst again ye ha ' t i be gaein ' hame to see my mither -- she 'll be

of the lady little more i know not even if when she have read the line she rise in haste and to she chamber go and shut the door nor if when she come forth a dawn of holier purpose shine across the sadness of she brow unto herself convict though the great world know all might call she pure as day -- yea truth itself of these thing i know nothing -- only know that on a warm autumnal afternoon when half-length shadow fall from mossy stone darken the green upon the grassy grave while the still church like a say prayer arise white in the sunshine silent as the grave empty of soul as be the tomb itself a little boy who watch a cow near by gather she milk from alms of clover field fling over earthen dyke or stray out beneath the gate upon the path behold all suddenly -- he know not how she come -- a lady closely veil alone and still seat upon a grave long time she sit and move not greetin ' sair the boy do say just like my mither whan my father deed a ' syne she rase a ' pu would at something sma ' a glintin ' gowan or maybe a blade o ' the dead grass and glide silent forth over the low stone wall by two old step and round the corner and be see no more the clang of hoof and sound of carriage wheel arise and die upon the listener 's ear the homeless ghost still flow the music flow the wine the youth in silence go through naked street in cold moonshine he homeward way he bent where on the city 's seaward line he lattice seaward lean he know not why he leave the throng but that he could not rest that something pained he in the song and mock he in the jest and a cold moon-glitter lay along one lovely lady 's breast he sit he down with solemn book he sadness to beguile a skull from off its bracket-nook throw he a lipless smile but its awful laughter-mocking look be a pass moonbeam 's wile a hour he sit and read in vain nought but mirror be he eye for to and fro through he helpless brain go the dance 's mystery till a gust of wind against the pane mix with a sea-bird 's cry and the sudden spatter of drift rain bid he mark the altered sky the moon be go intombed in cloud the wind begin to rave the ocean heave within its shroud for the dark have build its grave but like ghost brake forth and cry aloud the white crest of the wave big rain the wind howl out aware of the tread of the watery west the window shiver back wave he hair the fireside seem the best but lo a lady sit in he chair with the moonlight across she breast the moonbeam pass the lady sit on she beauty be sad and white all but she hair with whiteness shone and she hair be black as night and she eye where darkness be never go although they be full of light but she hair be wet and weep like weed on she pearly shoulder bare and the clear pale drop run down like bead down she arm to she finger fair and she limb shine through like thin-filmed seed she dank white robe 's despair she move not but look in he wonder face till he blush begin to rise but she gaze like one on the veil lace to something within he eye a gaze that have not to do with place but think and spirit try then the voice come forth all sweet and clear though jar by inward pain she speak like one that speak in fear of the judgment she will gain when the soul be full as a mountain-mere and the speech but a flow vein thine eye be like mine and thou art bold nay heap not the die fire it warm not I i be too cold cold as the churchyard spire if thou cover I up with fold on fold thou kill ` st not the coldness dire she voice and she beauty like molten gold thrill through he in burn rain he be on fire and she be cold cold as the waveless main but he heart-well fill with woe till it roll a torrent that calm he again save I oh save I she cry and fling she splendor before he foot -- i be weary of wander storm among and i hate the mouldy sheet i can dare the dark wind-vexed and wring not the dark where the dead thing meet ah though a ghost i be a lady still -- the youth recoil aghast with a passion of sorrow she great eye fill not a word she white lip pass he catch she hand 'twa a cold to kill but he hold it warm and fast what can i do to save thee dear at the word she spring upright to she ice-lip she draw he burning ear and whisper -- he shiver -- she whisper light she withdraw she gaze with a ask fear he stand with a face ghost-white i wait -- ah would i might wait she say but the moon sink in the tide thou seest it not i see it fade like one that may not bide alas i go out in the moonless shade ah kind let I stay and hide he shiver he shake he feel like clay and the fear go through he blood he face be a awful ashy gray and he vein be channel of mud the lady stand in a white dismay like a half-blown frozen bud ah speak be i so frightful then i live though they call it death i be only cold -- say _ dear _ again -- but scarce could he heave a breath the air feel dank like a frozen fen and he a half-conscious wraith ah save I once more with a hopeless cry that enter he heart and lay but sunshine and warmth and rosiness vie with coldness and moonlight and gray he speak not she move not yet to he eye she stand three pace away she speak no more grief on she face beauty have almost slay with a feverous vision 's unseen pace she have flit away again and stand with a last dumb prayer for grace by the window that clang with rain he stand he stare she have vanish quite the loud wind sink to a sigh gray face without pale the face of night as they sweep the window by and each as it pass press a cheek of fright to the glass with a stare eye and over afar from over the deep come a long and cadenced wail it rise and it sink and it rise on the steep of the billow that build the gale it cease but on in he bosom creep low echo that tell the tale he open he lattice and see afar over the western sea across the spear of a sparkling star a moony vapor flee and he think with a pang that he could not bar the lady it might be he turn and look into the room and lo it be cheerless and bare empty and drear as a hopeless tomb -- and the lady be not there yet the fire and the lamp drive out the gloom as he have drive the fair and up in the manhood of he breast spring a storm of passion and shame it tear the pride of he fancied best in a thousand shred of blame it throw to the ground he ancient crest and puff at he ancient name he have turn a lady and lightly clothe out in the stormy cold be she a ghost -- divinely sad be the guest of hade old a wander ghost oh terror bad that refuse a earthly fold and sorrow for she he shame 's regret into humility weep he kneel and he kiss the footprint wet and the track by she thin robe sweep he sit in she chair all ice-cold yet and moan until he sleep he wake at dawn the flaming sun laugh at the bye-gone dark i be glad he say that the night be do and the dream slay by the lark and the eye be all until the gun that boom at the sun-set -- hark and then with a sudden invade blast he know that it be no dream and all the night belief hold fast till thin by the morning beam thus radiant morning and pale night pass on the backward-flowing stream he love a lady with heave breath red lip and a smile alway and she sigh a odour inhabiteth all of the rose-hued may but the warm bright lady be false as death and the ghost be true as day and the spirit-face with its woe divine come back in the hour of sigh as to man who have lose they aim and pine old face of childhood rise : he weep for she plead voice and the shine of she solitary eye and now he believe in the ghost all night and believe in the day as well and he vow with a sorrowing tearful might all she ask whate'er befel if she come to he room in she garment white once more at the midnight knell she come not he seek she in churchyard old that lay along the sea and in many a church when the midnight toll and the moon shine wondrously and down to the crypt he creep grow bold but he wait in vain : ah I and he pine and sigh for love so sore that he look as he be lose and he pray she pardon more and more as one who have sin the most till fading at length away he wear and he be himself a ghost but if he find the lady then the lady sadly lose or she have find ` mongst live man a love that be a host i know not till i drop my pen and be myself a ghost abu midjan it be only just to laud good wine : if i sit in the dust so sit the vine abu midjan sing as he sit in chain for the blood of the grape be the juice of he vein the prophet have say o faithful drink not -- abu midjan drink till he heart be hot yea he sing a song in praise of wine and call it good name a joy divine and saad assail he with word of blame and leave he in iron a fettered flame but he sing of the wine as he sit in chain for the blood of the grape run fast in he vein i will not think that the prophet say _ ye shall not drink of the flow red _ but some weakling head in its after pain moaning say _ drink not again _ but i will dare with a goodly drought to drink and not spare till my thirst be out for as i quaff the liquor cool i do not laugh like a christian fool but my bosom fill and my faith be high through the emerald hill go my lightning eye i see _ they _ hearken i see they wait they light eye darken the diamond gate i hear the float of they chant divine each heavenly note mingle with mine can a evil thing make beauty more or a sinner bring to the heavenly door ` tis the sun-rays fine that sink in the earth and be drunk by the vine for its daughter ' birth and the liquid light i drink again and it flow in might through the shine brain make it know the thing that be in the earth below or the farthest star i will not think that the prophet say _ ye shall not drink of the flow red _ for he promise lo show more divine when the channel o'erflow with the singing wine but if he do ` tis a small annoy to sit in chain for a heavenly joy away go the song on the light wind bear he head sink down and a ripple of scorn at the iron that fetter he brown limb ' strength wave on he lip the dark hair 's length but sudden he lift he head to the north -- like a mountain-beacon he eye blaze forth : 'twa a cloud in the distance that catch he eye whence a faint clang shot on the light breeze by a noise and a smoke on the plain afar -- ` tis the cloud and the clang of the moslem war and the light that flash from he black eye lo be a light that pale the red wine 's glow and he shake he fetter in bootless ire and call on the prophet and name he sire but the lady of saad hear the clang and she know the far sabre he fetter ring oh she have the heart where a man might rest for she know the tempest in he breast she rise ere she reach he he call she name but he call not twice ere the lady come and he spring to he foot and the iron curse and wild from he lip the tecbir burst : let I go he say and by allah 's fear at sundown i sit in my fetter here or lie ` neath a heaven of starry eye kiss by moon-maiden of paradise the lady unlock he fetter stout bring she husband 's horse and he armor out clothe the warrior and bid he go a angel of vengeance upon the foe then turn she in and from the roof behold the battle far aloof straight as a arrow she see he go abu midjan the singer upon the foe like home-sped lightning he pierce the cloud and the thunder of battle burst more loud and like lightning along a thunderous steep she see the sickle-shaped sabre sweep keen as the sunlight they dash away when it break against they in flash spray till the battle ebb o'er the plain afar bear on the flow of the holy war as sink from the edge the sun 's last flame back to he bond abu midjan come o lady he say ` tis a mighty horse the prophet himself might have ride a worse i feel beneath I he muscle ' play as he tear to the battle like fiend away i forget he and sweep at the traitor weed and they fall before I like broken reed dropt they head as a boy doth mow the poppy ' head with he unstrung bow they flee the faithful follow at will i turn and lo he be under I still give he water lady and barley to eat then come and help I to fetter my foot he go to the terrace she go to the stall and tend the horse like a guest in the hall then to the singer in haste return the fire of the fight in he eye yet burn but he say no more as if in shame of the word that have burst from he lip in flame she leave he there as at first she find seat in fetter upon the ground but the seal fountain in pulse strong o'erflow he silence and burst in song oh the wine of the vine be a feeble thing in the rattle of battle the true grape spring when on force of the horse the arm fling abroad be sweeping and reap the harvest of god when the fear of the spear make way for its blow and the faithless lie breathless the horse-hoof below the wave-crest round the breast toss sabre all red but under its thunder be dumb to the dead they drop from the top to the sear heap below and deeper down steeper the infidel go but bright be the light on the true-hearted breaking rapturous face bent for embrace wait on he waking and he hear in he ear the voice of the river like a maiden love-laden go wander ever oh the wine of the vine may lead to the gate but the rattle of battle wake the angel who wait to the lord of the sword open it must the drinker the thinker sit in the dust he dream of the gleam of they garment of white : he miss they kiss the maiden of light they long for the strong who have burst through alarm up by the labor of stirrup and sabre up to they arm oh the wine of the grape be a feeble ghost but the wine of the fight be the joy of a host when saad come home from the far pursuit he sit he down and a hour be mute but at length he say : ah wife the fight have be lose full sure but a arm of might sudden rise up on the crest of the war with its sabre that circle in rainbow afar take up the battle and drive it on -- enoch sure or the good st john wherever he leap like a lion he the fight be thickest or soon to be wherever he spring with he lion cry the thick of the battle soon go by with a headlong fear the sinner flee we follow -- and pass they -- for they be dead but he who have save we we see no more he have go as he come by a secret door and strange to tell in he holy force he wear my armor he ride my horse the lady arise with she noble pride and she walk with saad side by side as she lead he a moon that would not wane where

of dream part i 1 i lay and dream the master come in he old weave dress i stand in joy and yet in shame oppress with earthliness he stretch he arm and gently seek to clasp I to he soul i shrink away because i think he do not know the whole i do not love he as i would embrace be not meet i sink before he where he stand and hold and kiss he foot ten year have pass away since then oft hast thou come to I the question scarce will rise again whether i care for thee to every doubt in thee my heart a answer hope to find in every gladness lord thou art the deeper joy behind and yet in other realm of life unknown temptation rise unknown perplexity and strife new question and reply and every lesson learn anew the vain assurance lend that now i know and now can do and now should see thy end so i forget i be a child and act as if a man who through the dark and tempest wild will go because he can and so o lord not yet i dare to clasp thee to my breast though well i know that only there be hide the secret rest and yet i shrink not as at first : be thou the judge of guilt thou knowest all my best and worst do with I as thou wilt spread thou once more thine arm abroad lay bare thy bosom 's beat thou shalt embrace I o my god and i will kiss thy foot 2 i stand before my childhood 's home outside the belt of tree all round my dream glance roam on well-known hill and lea when sudden from the westward rush a wide array of wave over the subject field they gush from far-off unknown cave and up the hill they clomb and come on flow like a sea : i saw and watch they like a game no terror wake in I for just the belt tree within i see my father wait and should the wave the summit win i would go through the gate for by he side all doubt be dumb and terror cease to foam no great sea-billows dare to come and tread the holy home two day pass by with restless toss the red flood brake its door prostrate i lay and look across to the eternal shore the world be fair and hope be nigh some man and woman true and i be strong and death and i would have a hard ado and so i shrink but sweet and good the dream come to my aid within the tree my father stand i must not be dismayed my grief be he not mine alone the wave that burst in fear he hear not only with he own but hear they with my ear my life and death belong to thee for i be thine o god thy hand have make and fashion I ` tis thine to bear the load and thou shalt bear it i will try to be a peaceful child whom in thy arm right tenderly thou carriest through the wild 3 the rich man mourn he little loss and knit the brow of care the poor man try to bear the cross and seek relief in prayer some gold have vanish from my purse which i have watch but ill i fear a lack but fear yet worse regret return still and so i knelt and pray my prayer to he who maketh strong that no return thought of care should do my spirit wrong i rise in peace in comfort go and lay I down to rest but straight my soul grow confident with gladness of the blest for ere the sleep that care redeem my soul such vision have that never child in childhood 's dream be more exulting glad no white-robed angel float by on slow repose wing i only see with inward eye some very common thing first rise the scarlet pimpernel with burn purple heart i see it and i know right well the lesson of its art then come the primrose childlike flower it look I in the face it bear a message full of power and confidence and grace and wind arise on upland wild and bath I like a stream and sheep-bell babble round the child who love they in a dream henceforth my mind be never cross by thought of vanish gold but with it come the guardian host of flower both meek and bold the loss be riches while i live a joy i would not lose : choose ever god what thou wilt give not leave I to choose _ what say the flower in whisper low to soothe I into rest _ i scarce have word -- they seem to grow right out of god 's own breast they say god mean the flower he make as child see the same they say the word the lily say when jesus look at they and if you want to hear the flower speak ancient word all new they may if you in darksome hour ask god to comfort you 4 we soul in daylight hour awake with vision sometimes teem which to the slumbering brain would take the form of wondrous dream thus once i see a level space with circle mountain nigh and round it group all form of grace a goodly company and at one end with gentle rise stand something like a throne and thither all the radiant eye as to a center shone and on the seat the noblest form of glory dim-descry he glance would quell all passion-storm all doubt and fear and pride but lo he eye far-fixed burn adown the widen vale the look of all obedient turn and soon those look be pale for through the shine multitude with feeble step and slow a weary man in garment rude all falteringly do go he face be white and still-composed like one that have be dead the eye from eyelid half unclose a faint wan splendor shed and to he brow a strange wreath clung and drop of crimson hue and he rough hand oh sadly wring be pierce through and through and not a look he turn aside he eye be forward bent and slow the eyelid open wide as towards the throne he go at length he reach the mighty throne and sink upon he knee and clasp he hand with stifle groan and spake in word like these : -- father i be come back -- thy will be sometimes hard to do from all the multitude so still a sound of weep grow and mournful-glad come down the one and kneel and clasp he child sink on he breast the outworn man and weep until he smile and when they tear have still they sigh and joy they tear have dry the people see with lift eye they seat side by side 5 i lay and dream three cross stand amid the gloomy air two bear two man -- one be the good the third rise wait bare a roman soldier come by mistook I for the third i lift up my ask eye for jesus ' sign or word i think he sign that i should yield and give the error way i hold my peace no word reveal no gesture utter _ nay _ against the cross a scaffold stand whence easy hand could nail the doom upon that altar-wood whose fire burn slow and pale upon this ledge he lift I i stand all thoughtful there wait until the deadly tree my form for fruit should bear rise up the wave of fear and doubt rise up from heart to brain they shut the world of vision out and thus they cry amain : ah I my hand -- the hammer 's knock -- the nail -- the tear strength my soul reply : ` tis but a shock that grow to pain at length ah I the awful fight with death the hour to hang and die the thirsting gasp for common breath that pass heedless by my soul reply : a faintness soon will shroud thee in its fold the hour will go -- the fearful noon rise pass -- and thou art cold and for thy suffer what to thee be that or care of thine thou live branch upon the tree whose root be the divine ` tis he to care that thou endure that pain shall grow or fade with bleeding hand hang on thy cure he know what he have make and still for all the inward wail my foot be firmly press for still the fear lest i should fail be stronger than the rest and thus i stand until the strife the bond of slumber brake i feel as i have ruin life have flee and come awake yet i be glad my heart confess the trial go not on glad likewise i have stand the test as far as it have go and yet i fear some recreant thought which now i all forget that painful feeling in I work of failure linger yet and if the dream have have its scope i might have flee the field but yet i thank thee for the hope and think i dare not yield 6 methink i hear as i lie slowly die indulgent friend say weep _ he be good _ i fail to speak a faint denial try -- they answer _ he humility withstand _ i know better part with love unspoken and find the unknown world not all unknown the bond that hold I from my center broken i seek my home the savior 's homely throne how he will greet I i walk on and wonder and think i know what i will say to he i fear no sapphire floor of cloudy thunder i fear no pass vision great and dim but he know all my unknown weary story : how will he judge I pure and good and fair i come to he in all he conquered glory win from such life as i go dream there i come i fall before he faintly say : ah lord shall i thy loving favor win earth 's beauty tempt I my walk be stray -- i have no honor -- but may i come in i know thee well strong prayer do keep I stable to I the earth be very lovely too thou shouldst have come to I to make thee able to love it greatly -- but thou hast get through a book of dream part ii 1 _ lord of the world 's undying youth what joy be in thy might what beauty of the inner truth and of the outer sight and when the heart be dim and sad too weak for wisdom 's beam thou sometimes makest it right glad with but a childish dream _ \* \* \* \* \* lo i will dream this windy day no sunny spot be bare dull vapor in uncomely play be welter through the air if i throw wide my windowed breast to all the blast that blow my soul will rival in unrest those tree-top -- how they go but i will dream like any child for lo a mighty swan with radiant plumage undented and fold airy van with serpent neck all proudly bent and stroke of swarthy oar dream on to I by sea-maid send over the billow hoar for in a wave-worn rock i lie outside the water foam and echo of old storm go by within my sea-built dome the water half the gloomy way beneath its arch come throb to unseen billow ' play the green gulf waver dumb a dawn twilight through the cave in moony gleam doth go half from the swan above the wave half from the swan below close to my foot she gently drift among the glisten thing she stoop she crowny head and lift white shoulder of she wing oh earth be rich with many a nest deep soft and ever new pure delicate and full of rest but dearest there be two i would not tell they but to mind that be as white as they if other hear of other kind i wish they far away upon the neck between the wing of a white sailing swan a flaky bed of sheltering -- there you will find the one the other -- well it will not out nor need i tell it you i have tell you one and need you doubt when there be only two fulfil old dream o splendid bird I o'er the water bear sure never ocean 's face be stir by any ship so fair sure never whiteness find a dress upon the earth to go so true profound and rich unless it be the fall snow with quick short flutter of each wing half-spread and stoop crown she call I and with one glad spring i nestle in the down plunge the bark then bound aloft with lessen dip and rise round curve she neck with motion soft -- sure those be woman 's eye one stroke unseen with oary foot one stroke -- away she sweep over the water pale we fleet suspend in the deep and round the shelter rock and lo the tumble weltering sea on to the west away we go over the water free she motion mould to the wave she billowy neck throw back with slow strong pulse stately and grave she cleave a ripple track and up the mount wave we glide with climb sweeping blow and down the steep far-sloping side to flow vale below i hear the murmur of the deep in countless ripple pass like talk child in they sleep like wind in reedy grass and through some ruffle feather i the glassy rolling mark with which the wave eternally roll on from dawn to dark the night be blue the star aglow in solemn peace o'erhead the archless depth of heaven below the murmur heaving bed a thickened night it heaveth on a fall earthly sky the shadow of its star alone be leave to know it by what faint across the lift loop of cloud-veil upward cast with sea-veiled limb a sleeping group of nereid dream past swim on my boat who know but i ere night sink to she grave may see in splendor pale float by the venus of the wave 2 in the night round a lady dream -- a queen among the dream -- come the silent sunset streaming mix with the voice of stream a silver fountain spring blossom in molten gold and the air of the bird float ring through harmony manifold she lie in a water valley she garden melt away through foot-path and curve alley into the wild wood gray and the green of the vale go creep to the foot of the rugged hill where the moveless rock be keep the home of the wander rill and the hue of the flower grow deeper till they dye she very brain and they scent like the soul of a sleeper wander and waver and rain for dream have a wealth of glory that daylight can not give : ah god make the hope a story -- bid the dream arise and live she lay and gaze at the flower till she soul 's own garden smile with blossom-o'ershaded bower great color and splendor wild and she heart fill up with gladness till it could only ache and it turn aside to sadness as if for pity 's sake and a fog come o'er the meadow and the rich hue faint lay come from the wood the shadow come from the rock the gray and the sunset thither have vanish where the sunset always go and the sound of the stream be banish as if slay by frost and snow and the flower pale fast and faster and they crumble fold on fold till they look like the stain plaster of a cornice in ruin old and they blacken and shrink together as if scorch by the breath of flame with a sad perplexity whether they be or be not the same and she see herself still lie and smile on the while and the smile instead of die be fix in a idiot smile and the lady arise in sorrow out of she sleep 's dark stream but she dream make dark the morrow and she tell I the haunt dream alas dear lady i know it the dream that all be a dream the joy with the doubt below it that the bright thing only seem one moment of sad commotion and one of doubt 's withering rule -- and the great wave-pulsing ocean be only a gather pool and the flower be spot of painting of lifeless stare hue though you heart be sick to faint they say not a word to you and the bird know nought of gladness they be only song-machines and a man be a skilful madness and the woman picture queen and fiercely we dig the fountain to know the water true and we climb the crest of the mountain to part it from the blue but we look too far before we for that which be more than nigh though the sky be lofty o'er we we be always in the sky and the fog o'er the rose that creepeth steam from the unknown sea in the dark of the soul that sleepeth and sigheth constantly because o'er the face of its water the breathing have not go and instead of glad son and daughter wild thing be moan on when the heart know well the father the eye will be always day but now they grow dim the rather that the light be more than they believe amidst thy sorrow that the blight that swathe the earth be only a shade that borrow life from thy spirit 's dearth god 's heart be the fount of beauty thy heart be its visible well if it vanish do thou thy duty that necromantic spell and thy heart to the father cry will fill with water deep thine eye may say _ beauty be die _ but thy spirit _ she go to sleep _ and i fear not thy fair soul ever will smile as thy image smile it have flee with a sudden shiver and thy body lay beguile let the flower and thy beauty perish let they go to the ancient dust but the hope that the child cherish they be the father 's trust 3 a great church in a empty square a place of echo tone foot pass not oft enough to wear the grass between the stone the jarring sound that haunt its gate like distant thunder boom the boding heart half-listening wait as for a come doom the door stand wide the church be bare oh horror ghastly sore a gulf of death with hideous stare yawn in the earthen floor as if the ground have sink away into a void below : its shapeless side of dark-hued clay hang ready aye to go i be myself a horrid grave my very heart turn gray this charnel-hole -- will no one save and force my foot away the change dead be there i know in terror ever new yet down the frightful slope i go that downward goeth too beneath the caverned floor i hie and seem with anguish dull to enter by the empty eye into a monstrous skull stumble on what i dare not guess and wade through the gloom less deep the shades my eye oppress i see the awful tomb my step have lead I to a door with iron clench and bar grim death hide there a ghastlier store great spider in he ward the portal shake the bar be bow as if a earthy wind that never bear a leaf or cloud be press hard behind they shake they groan they outward strain what sight of dire dismay will freeze its form upon my brain and turn it into clay they shake they groan they bend they crack the bar the door divide : a flood of glory at they back have burst the portal wide flow in the light of vanish day the joy of long-set moon the flood of radiance billowy play in sweet-conflicting tune the gulf be fill with flash tide a awful gulf no more a maze of fern clothes all its side of moss all its floor and float through the stream appear such form of beauty rare as every aim at beauty here have find its _ would be _ there i say : ` tis well no hand come nigh to turn my step astray ` tis good we can not choose but die that life may have its way 4 before i sleep some dream draw nigh which be not fancy mere for sudden light a inward eye and wondrous thing appear thus unawares with vision wide a steep hill once i saw in faint dream light which ever hide they fountain and they law and up and down the hill recline a host of statue old such wondrous form as you might find deep under ancient mould they lay wild scatter all along and maim as if in fight but every one of all the throng be precious to the sight betwixt the night and hill they range in dead composure cast as suddenly the dream be change and all the wonder past the hill remain but what it bear be break reedy stalk bent hither thither droop o'er like flower o'er weedy walk for each dim form of marble rare bent a wind-broken reed so hang on autumn-field long-bare some tall and straggle weed the autumn night hang like a pall hang mournfully and dead and if a wind have wake at all it have but moan and flee 5 i lay and dream of thought and sleep be bear a heavenly joy : i dream of two who always keep I happy as a boy i be with they my heart-bell ring with joy my heart above they present heaven my earth o'erhung and earth be glad with love the dream grow troubled crowd go on and seek they varied end till stream on stream the crowd have go and sweep away my friend i be alone a miry road i follow all in vain no well-known hill the landscape show it be a wretched plain where mound of rubbish ugly pit and brick-field scar the globe those waste where desolation sit without she ancient robe a drizzling rain proclaim the sky as wretched as the earth i wander on and weary sigh be all my lot be worth when sudden as i turn my way burst in the ocean-wave : and lo a blue wild-dancing bay fantastic rock and cave i weep with joy ah sometimes so in common daylight grief a beauty to the heart will go and bring the heart relief and wander reft of hope or friend if such a thing should be one day we take the downward bend and lo eternity i weep with joy delicious tear which dream alone bestow until mayhap from out the year we sleep and further go 6 now i will mould a dream awake which i asleep would dream from all the form of fancy take one that shall also seem seem in my verse -lrb- if not my brain -rrb- which sometimes may rejoice in airy form of fancy 's train though nobler be my choice some truth o'er all the land may lie in child 's dream at night _ they _ do not build the charm sky that dome they with delight and o'er the year that follow soon so all unlike the dream wander they odour gleam they moon and flow they wind and stream now i would dream that i awake in scent of cool night air above I star-clouds close and break beneath -- where be i where a strange delight pervade my breast of ancient picture dim where fair form on the water rest or in the breeze swim i rest on arm as soft as strong great arm of woman-mould my head be pillow whence a song in many a ripple fold o'erflood I from its bubble spring : a titan goddess bear I float on she unseen wing through gracious midnight air and i be bear o'er sleep sea o'er murmur ear of corn over the billowy top of tree o'er rose pale till morn over the lake -- ah nearer float down on the water 's breast let I look deep and gaze doat on that white lily 's nest the harebell 's bed as o'er we pass swing all its bell about from wave blade of polished grass flash moony splendor out old home we brush in wooded glade no eye at window shine for all true man and noble maid be out in dream like mine and foam-bell-kiss drift and break from wind-wave of the south against my brow and eye awake and yet i see no mouth light laughter ripple down the air light sigh float up below and o'er I ever radiant pair the queen 's great star-eye go and motion like a dream wave waft I in gladness dim through air just cool enough to lave with sense each conscious limb but ah the dream elude the rhyme as dream break free from sleep the dream will keep its own free time in mazy float or sweep and think too keen for joy awake as on the horizon far a dead pale light the circle break but not a dawn star no there i can not dare not go pale woman wander there with cold fire murderous eyeball glow and child see despair the joy have lose its dreamy zest i feel a pang of loss my wander hand o'er mound of rest find only mound of moss beneath the bare night-star i lie cold wind be moan past : alas the earth with grief will die the great earth be aghast i look above -- there dawn no face around -- no footstep come no voice inhabit this great space god know but keepeth dumb i wake and know that god be by and more than dream will give and that the heart that moan and die shall yet awake and live to aurelio saffi _ to god and man be simply true : do as thou hast be wont to do : _ or _ of the old more in the new : _ mean all the same when say to you i love thee thou art calm and strong firm in the right mild to the wrong thy heart in every rage throng a chamber shut for prayer and song defeat thou know ` st not canst not know only thy aim so lofty go they need as long to root and grow as any mountain swathe in snow go on and prosper holy friend i weak and ignorant would lend a voice thee strong and wise to send prosper onward without end sonnet to amd methink i see thee lie calm and low silent and dark within thy earthy bed thy mighty hand in which i trust dead rest with thy long arm from work or blow and the night-robe around thy tall form flow down from the kingly face and from the head save by its thick dark curl uncover -- my brother dear from childhood lie so not often since thou go ` st i think of thee -lrb- with inward care and questioning oppressed -rrb- and yet ere long i seek thee in thy rest and bring thee home my heart as full as free as sure that thou wilt take I tenderly as then when youth and nature make we bless a memorial of africa i upon a rock high on a mountain side thousand of foot above the lake-sea 's lip a rock in which old water ' rise and dip plunge and recoil and backward eddy tide have age-long worn while race live and die involve channel where the sea-weed 's drip follow the ebb and now earth-grass sip fresh dew from heaven whereby on earth they bide -- i sit and gaze southwards a dry flow of wither wind blow on my drooping strength from o'er the awful desert 's burning length behind I pile away and upward go great sweep of savage mountain -- up away where panther roam and snow gleam all the day ii ah god the world need many hour to make nor hast thou cease the making of it yet but wilt be work on when death have set a new mound in some churchyard for my sake on flow the century without a break uprise the mountain age without let the moss suck the rock 's breast rarely wet year more than past the young earth yet will take but in the dumbness of the rolling time no veil of silence will encompass I -- thou wilt not once forget and let I be : i easier think that thou as i my rhyme wouldst rise and with a tenderness sublime unfold a world that i thy child might see a gift my gift would find thee fast asleep and arise a dream in thee a violet sky o'er the roll and sweep of a purple and pallid sea and a crescent moon from my sky should creep in the golden dream to thee thou shouldst lay thee down and sadly list to the wail of we cold birth-time and build thee a temple glory-kissed in the heart of the sunny clime its column should rise in a music-mist and its roof in a spirit-rhyme its pillar the solemn hill should bind ` neath arch of starry deep its floor the earth all vein and line its organ the ocean-sweep and swing in the hand of the grey-robed wind its censer the blossom-heap and ` tis almost do for in this my rhyme thanks to thy mirror-soul thou wilt see the mountain and hear the chime of the water after the roll and the star of my sky thy sky will climb and with heaven roof in the whole the man of song thou wanderest in the land of dream o man of many song to thee the actual only seem -- no realm to thee belong seest thou those mountain in the east o man of ready aim ' t be only vapor that thou seest in mountain form and name nay nay i know they all too well each ridge and peak and dome in that cloud-land in one high dell nesteth my little home better thing better to smell a violet than sip the careless wine better to list one music tone than watch the jewel ' shine better to have the love of one than smile like morning dew better to have a living seed than flower of every hue better to feel a love within than be lovely to the sight better a homely tenderness than beauty 's wild delight better to love than be beloved though lonely all the day better the fountain in the heart than the fountain by the way better a feeble love to god than for woman 's love to pine better to have the make god than the woman make divine better be feed by mother 's hand than eat alone at will better to trust in god than say : my goods my storehouse fill better to be a little wise than learn overmuch better than high be lowly thought for truthful thought be such better than thrill a listen crowd sit at a wise man 's foot but better teach a child than toil to make thyself complete better to walk the realm unseen than watch the hour 's event better the smile of god alway than the voice of man 's consent better to have a quiet grief than a tumultuous joy better than manhood age 's face if the heart be of a boy better the thanks of one dear heart than a nation 's voice of praise better the twilight ere the dawn than yesterday 's mid-blaze better a death when work be do than earth 's most favor birth better a child in god 's great house than the king of all the earth the journey hark the rain be on my roof every sound drop through the dark on my soul with dull reproof like a half-extinguished spark i alas how be i here in the midnight and alone catch within a net of fear all my dream of beauty go i will rise : i must go forth better face the hideous night better dare the unseen north than be still without the light black wind rush round my brow sow with stinging point of rain place or time i know not now -- i be here and so be pain i will leave the sleep street hie I forth on darker road ah i can not stay my foot onward onward something goad i will take the mountain path beard the storm within its den know the worst of this dim wrath vex thus the soul of man chasm ` neath chasm rock pile on rock : root and crumble earth and stone hark the torrent 's thunder shock hark the sway pine tree 's groan ah i faint i fall i die sink to nothingness away -- lo a streak upon the sky lo the opening eye of day ii mountain height that lift they snow o'er a valley green and low and a wind path that go guide by the river 's flow and a music rise ever as of peace and low content from the pebble-paven river as a odour upward send and a sighing of the storm far away amid the hill like the humming of a swarm that the summer forest fill and a frequent fall of rain from a cloud with ragged weft and a burst of wind amain from the mountain 's sudden cleft then a night that have a moon stain all the cloudy white sinking with a soundless tune deep into the spirit 's night then a morning clear and soft amber on the purple hill warm high day of summer oft cool by wander windy rill joy to travel thus along with the universe around i the center of the throng every sight and every sound speeding with its burden laden speeding homeward to my soul mine the eye the star be make in i the heart of all this whole iii hill retreat on either hand sink down into the plain slowly through the level land glide the river to the main what be that before I white gleam through the dusky air dimmer in the gathering night still behold i know not where be it but a chalky ridge bare by many a trodden mark or a river-spanning bridge mile away into the dark or the foremost leap wave of the everlasting sea where the undivided lave time with its eternity no ti but a eye-made sight in my brain a fancied gleam or a thousand thing as white set in darkness well might seem there it waver shine be go what it be i can not tell when the morning star have shone i shall see and know it well onward onward through the night matter it i can not see i be move in a might dwelling in the dark and I up or down or here or there i can never be alone my own be tell I where god be as the father know iv joy o joy the eastern sea answer to the eastern sky wide and feature gloriously with swift billow burst high nearer nearer oh the sheen on a thousand wave at once oh the change crowd green oh my beating heart 's response down rejoice to the strand where the sea-waves shore-ward lean curve they graceful head and stand gleam with ethereal green then in foam fall heavily -- this be what i see at night lo a boat i 'll forth on thee dancing-floor for my delight from the bay wind-wing we glance sea-wind seize I by the hair what a terrible expanse how the ocean tumble there i be helpless here afloat for the wild wave know not I gladly would i change my boat for the snow wing of the sea look below each watery whirl cast in beauty 's living mould look above each feathery curl faintly tinge with morning gold -- oh i tremble with the gush of a everlasting youth love and fear together rush : i be free in god the truth prayer we doubt the word that tell we : ask and ye shall have you prayer we turn we thought as to a task with will constrain and rare and yet we have these scanty prayer yield gold without alloy : o god but he that trust and dare must have a boundless joy rest when round the earth the father 's hand have gently draw the dark send off the sun to fresher land and curtain in the lark ` tis sweet all tire with glowing day to fade with fade light to lie once more the old weary way upfold in the night a mother o'er the couch may bend and rose-leaf kiss heap : in soothing dream with sleep they blend till even in dream we sleep and if we wake while night be dumb ` tis sweet to turn and say it be a hour ere dawn come and i will sleep till day ii there be a dearer warmer bed where one all day may lie earth 's bosom pillow the head and let the world go by instead of mother 's love-lit eye the church 's storied pane all blank beneath cold starry sky or sound in the rain the great world shout forward fare : this chamber hide from none hide safe from all for no one care for those whose work be do cheer thee my heart though tired and slow a unknown grassy place somewhere on earth be wait now to rest thee from thy race iii there be a calmer than all calm a quiet more deep than death : a folding in the father 's palm a breathing in he breath a rest make deeper by alarm and stormy sound combine : the child within its mother 's arm sleep sounder for the wind there need no curtained bed to hide the world with all its war nor grassy cover to divide from sun and moon and star a window open to the sky a sense of changeless life with oft return still surprise repel the sound of strife iv as one bestride a wild scared horse beneath a stormy moon and still he heart with quiet force beat on its own calm tune so if my heart with trouble now be throb in my breast thou art my deeper heart and thou o god dost ever rest when mighty sea-winds madly blow and tear the scatter wave as still as summer wood below lie darkle ocean cave : the wind of word may toss my heart but what be that to I ` tis but a surface storm -- thou art my deep still rest sea to aj scott with the follow poem i walk all night : the darkness do not yield around I fall a mist a weary rain endure long till a faint dawn reveal a temple 's front cloud-curtained on the plain close be the lofty door that lead within but by a wicket one might entrance gain o light and awe and silence enter in the blackness and chaotic rain be lose in hopeful space then i hear a thin sweet sound of voice low together toss as if they seek a harmony to find which they know once but none of all that host could call the far-fled music back to mind loud voice distance-low wander along the pillared path and up the arch twine with sister-arch rise throng on throng up to the roof 's dim distance if sometimes self-gathered voice make a burst of song straightway i hear again but as the chime of many bell through sabbath morning send each its own tale to tell of heavenly clime yet such the hope one might be well content here to be low and lowly keep a door for like truth 's herald solemnly that go i hear thy voice and humbly love it more walk the word-sea to this ear of mine than any voice of power i hear before yet as the harp may tremulous combine low ghostlike sound with organ 's loudest tone let not my music fear to come to thine : thy heart with organ-tempest of its own will hear aeolian sigh from thin chord blow light first-born of the create voice minister of god 's spirit who be send to wait upon he first what time he go move about ` mid the tumultuous noise of each unpiloted element upon the face of the void formless deep thou who do come unbodied and alone ere yet the sun be set he rule to keep or ever the moon shone or e'er the wander star-flock forth be drive thou garment of the invisible whose skirt falleth on all thing from the lofty heaven thou comforter be with I as thou wert when first i long for word to be a radiant garment for my think like thee we lay we down in sorrow wrapt in the old mantle of we mother night in vexing dream we ` strive until the morrow grief lift we eyelid up -- and lo the light the sunlight on the wall and vision rise of shine leaf that make sweet melody of wind-borne wave with thee upon they crest of rippled sand on which thou rainest down of quiet lake that smooth for thee they breast of cloud that show thy glory as they own o joy o joy the vision be go by light gladness motion be reality thou art the god of earth the skylark spring far up to catch thy glory on he wing and thou dost bless he first that highest soar the bee come forth to see thee and the flower worship thee all day long and through the sky follow thy journey with they earnest eye river of life thou pourest on the wood and on thy wave float forth the waken bud the tree lean towards thee and in loving pain keep turn still to see thee yet again and nothing in thine eye be mean or low : where'er thou art on every side

which the sensuous be breathe till summer-sleep fall on they heart and eye the night be mild and innocent of ill 'twa but a sleep day that breathe low and babble in its sleep the moon at length grow sleepy too she level glance creep through sleep branch to they curtained eye as down the steep bank of the west she slide slowly and slowly but alas alas the awful time ` twixt moondown and sunrise it be a ghostly time a low thick fog steam up and swathe the tree and overwhelm the float couch with pall on pall of gray the sky be desolate dull and meaningless the blaze hue of the last sunset eve and the pale magic moonshine that have make the common strange -- all be sweep clean away the earth around the great sky over be like a desert theater tomb-dumb the light long dead the first sick gray of morn ooze through rent in the slow-mouldering curtain the sweet sound flee away for evermore nought leave except a creep chill a sense as if dead deed be strow upon the stage as if dead body simulated life and speak dead word without inform think a horror as of power without a soul dark undefined and mighty unto ill jar through the earth and through the vault-like air and on the sleeper fall a wondrous dream that dure till sunrise fill all the cell remotest of the throbbing heart and brain and as i watch they ever and anon the quiver limb and half-unclosèd eye witness of torture scarce endure and yet endure for still the dream have mastery and hold they in a helplessness supine till by degree the labor breath grow calm save frequent murmured sigh and o'er each face steal radiant sadness and a hopeful grief and the convulsive motion pass away upon they face read they i gaze -- read they earnestly like wondrous book -- when suddenly the vapor of the dream rise and envelop I and through my soul pass with possession will fall fast asleep and through the portal of the spirit-land upon whose frontier time and space grow dumb quench like a cloud that all the roar wind drive not beyond the mountain top i go and enter behold they in they dream they world inwrapt I for the time as mine and what befel they there i saw and tell the inner dream it be a drizzly morning where i stand the cloud have sink and fill with fold on fold the chimneyed city so the smoke rise not but spread dilute in the cloud and fall a black precipitate on miry street where dim gray face vision-like go by but half-awake half satisfied with sleep slave engine have begin they ceaseless growl of labor iron band and huge stone block that hold they to they task strain shake until the city tremble those pale-visaged form be hasten on to feed they groan strength with labor to the full look there they come poor amid poverty she with she gown draw over she meek head he try much but fruitless half to shield she from the rain they enter the wide gate amid the jar and clash and shudder of the awful force that conquer force still vibrate on as if with a excess of power hungry for work with differ strength to different task they part to be the soul of knowledge unto strength for man have eke he body out with wheel and crank and belt and lever pinion screw -- one body all pervade still with life from man the maker 's will ` mid keen-eyed man thin feature and exact he part be find hers where the dusk air shine with lustrous eye and there they labor through the murky day whose air be livid mist they only breath foul float dust of swift revolving wheel and feathery spoil of fast contorted thread make a sultry chaos in the sun until at length slow swell the welcome dark a dull lethean heave tide of death up from the cave of night to make a end and fill every corner of the place choke in its wave the clanking of the loom and earth put on she sleeping dress and take she child home into its bosom-fold and nurse they as a mother-ghost might sit with she neglect darling in the dark so with dim satisfaction in they heart though with tired foot and ache head they go parting the clinging fog to find they home it be a dreary place unfinished wall far drearier than ruin overspread with long-worn sweet forgetfulness amidst earth-heap and brick rain-pool and ugliness rise up around banish further yet the earth with its spring-time young-mother smile from child 's eye that have forget to play but though the house be dull and wrapt in fog it yet awake to life yea cheerfulness when darkness ope a fire-eye in the grate and the dim candle 's smoky flame reveal a room which could not be all desolate be a temple prove by the sign see in the ancient place for here be light and blaze fire with darkness on its skirt bread and pure water ready to make clean beside a chest of holiday attire and in the twilight edge of the light a book scarce see and for the wondrous veil those human form behind which lay conceal the holy of holy god 's own secret place the lowly human heart wherein he dwell and by the table-altar they sit down to eat they eucharist god feed they : they food be love make visible in form -- incarnate love in food for he to whom a common meal can be no eucharist who thanks for food and strength not for the love that make cold water for its blessedness and wine for gladness ' sake have yet to learn the heart-delight of inmost thankfulness for innermost reception then they sit rest with silence the soul 's inward sleep which feedeth it with strength till gradually they grow aware of light that overcome the light within and through the dingy blind cast from the window-frame two shadow-gloom that make a cross of darkness on the white dark messenger of light itself unseen the woman rise and half she put aside the veil that hide the whole of glorious night and lo a wind have mow the earth-sprung fog and lo on high the white exultant moon from clear blue window curtain all with white greet they at they shadowy window low with quiet smile for two thing make she glad : one that she see the glory of the sun for while the earth lay all athirst for light she drink the fountain-wave the other joy spring from herself : she fight the darkness well thin the great cone-shadow of the earth pale its ebon hue with radiant shower upon its sloping side the woman say with hopeful look : to-morrow will be bright with sunshine for we holiday -- to-morrow -- think we shall see the green field in the sun so with heart hope for a simple joy yet high withal be no less than the sun they lay they down in nightly death that wait patiently for the day that sun be high when they awake at length the moon low down have almost vanish clothe upon with light and night be swallow up of day in haste chide they weariness that league with sleep they have clothe themselves in clean attire by the low door stoop with priestly heart enter god 's vision-room he wonder-world one side the street the window all be moon to light the other that in shadow lay the path be almost dry the wind asleep and down the sunny side a woman come in a red cloak that make the whole street glad -- fit clothing though she be so feeble and old for when they stop and ask she how she fare she say with cheerful word and smile that owe none of its sweetness to a ivory lining : i be always better in the open air dear heart say they how freely she will breathe in the open air of heaven she stand in the morn like a belated autumn-flower in spring daze by the rush of the new-born life up the earth 's wind cavern-stair to see through window-bud the call wake sun or as in dream we meet the ghost of one beloved in youth who walketh with few word and they be of the past yet joy to she she too from earthy grave be climb up unto the spirit-window high and far she the new life for a celestial spring answer the light that shineth evermore with hopeful sadness thus they pass along dissolve street towards the smile of spring of which green vision gleam and glide by across far-narrowing avenue of brick : the ripple only of she laughter float through the low wind cavern of the town yet not a stone upon the paven street but shareth in the impulse of she joy heaven 's life that thrill anew through the outworn earth descend like the angel that do stir bethesda 's pool and make the sleepy wave pulse with quick healing through the withered limb in joyous pang by a unfinished street forth come they on a wide and level space green field lay side by side and hedgerow tree stand here and there as wait for some good but no calm river meditate through the weary flat to the less level sea no forest tree on pillared stem and bough bent in great gothic arch bear aloft a cloudy temple-roof of tremulous leaf no clear line where the kiss lip of sky and earth meet undulating but a haze that hide -- oh if it hide wild wave alas it hide but field it hide but field and tree save eastward where a few hill far away come forth in the sun or draw back when the cloud go over they dissolve they in shade but the life-robe of earth be beautiful as all most common thing be loveliest a forest of green wave fairy tree that carpet the earth for lowly foot bend unto they tread lowliest of all earth 's lowly child bear for minister unto the heavenly stranger stately man that he by subtle service from all kind from every breeze and every bound wave from night-sky cavernous with heap of storm and from the hill rejoicing in the sun might grow a humble lowly child of god lowly as know he high parentage humble because all beauty wait on he like lady-servant minister for love and he that have not rock and hill and stream must learn to look for other beauty near to know the face of ocean solitude the darkness dash with glory and the shades wind-fretted and the mingled tint upthrown from shallow bed or rain from the sky and he that have not ocean and dwell low not hill-befriended if he eye have cease to drink enjoyment from the billowy grass and from the road-side flower -lrb- like one who dwell with homely feature round he every day and so take refuge in the loving eye which be they heaven the dwelling-place of light -rrb- must straightway lift he eye unto the heaven like god 's great palette where he artist hand never can strike the brush but beauty wake vast sweepy comet-curve that net the soul in pleasure endless sky-stairs patient cloud white till they blush at the sun 's goodnight kiss and filmy pallor and great mountain crag but beyond all absorb all the rest lie the great heaven the expression of deep space foreshorten to a vaulted dome of blue the infinite crowd in a single glance where yet the eye descend depth within depth like mystery of truth clothe in high form evasive spiritual no limit but something that deny a end and yet can be behold by wonder human eye there look up one well may feel how vain to search for god in this vast wilderness for over he would arch void depth for ever nor ever would he find a god or heaven though lift wing be he to soar abroad through boundless height of space or eye to dive to microscopic depths : he would come back and say _ there be no god _ and sit and weep till in he heart a child 's voice wake and cry _ father my father _ then the face of god break forth with eye everywhere suddenly and not a space of blue nor floating cloud nor grassy vale nor distant purple height but tremble with a presence all divine say _ here i be my child _ gaze awhile they let the lesson of the sky sink deep into they heart withdraw then they eye they know the earth again and as they go oft in the change heaven those distant hill shine clear upon the horizon then awake a strange and unknown longing in they soul as if for something love in year go by and vanish in its beauty and its love so long that it retain no name or form and lay on childhood 's verge all but forget wrapt in the enchanted rose-mist of that land : as if amidst those hill be wood dell summer and gentle wind and odour free deep sleep water gorgeous flower and bird pure winged throat but here all thing around be in they spring the very light that lay upon the grass seem new-born like the grass spring with it from the earth the very stone look warm the brown ploughed earth seem swell up fill like a sponge with sunbeam which lay still nestle unseen and broodingly and warm in every little nest corner or crack wherein might hide a blind and sleepy seed wait the touch of penetrative life to wake and grow and beautify the earth the mossy stem and bough where yet no life exuberant overflow in bud and leaf be clothe in golden splendor interweave with many shadow from the branch bare and through they top the west wind rush go call aloud the sleep sap within : the thrill pass downward from the root in air to the root tremulous in the embrace ground and though no bud with little dot of light sparkle the darkness of the hedgerow twig soften expand in the warm light-bath seem the dry smoky bark thus in the field they spend they holiday and when the sun be near the go down they turn they home with strengthened heart for they be fill with light and with the spring and like the bee go back to they dark house laden with bless sight with gladsome sound home to they treasure-cave where henceforth sudden gleam of spring would pass thorough the four-walled darkness of the room and sound of spring-time whisper tremble by though stony street with iron echo round and as they cross a field they come by chance upon a place where once a home have be fragment of ruin wall half-overgrown with moss for even stone have they green robe it have be a small cottage with a plot of garden-ground in front map out with walk now scarce discernible but that the grass be thinner the ground harder to the foot : the place be simply shadow with a old almost erase human carefulness close by the ruin wall where once have be the door divide it from the great world make it _ home _ a single snowdrop grow 'twa the sole remnant of a family of flower that in this garden once have dwell vanish with all they hue of glowing life save one too white for death and as its form arise within the brain a feeling spring up in they soul new white and delicate a wait longing patient hopefulness the snowdrop of the heart the heavenly child pale with the earthly cold hang its meek head endure all and so victorious the summer 's earnest in the wake earth the spirit 's in the heart i love thee flower with a love almost human tenderly the spring 's first child yea thine my hope heart upon thy inner leaf and in thy heart enough of green to tell thou know ` st the grass in thy white mind remember lowly friend but most i love thee for that little stain of earth on thy transfigure radiancy which thou hast lift with thee from thy grave the soiling of thy garment on thy road travel forth into the light and air the heaven of thy pure rest some gentle rain will surely wash thee white and send the earth back to the place of earth but now it sign thee child of earth of human birth as we with careful hand uproot it they bear the little plant a willing captive home willing to enter dark abode secure in its own tale of light as once of old bearing all heaven in word of promise the angel of the annunciation come it carry all the spring into that house a pot of mould its only tie to earth its heaven a ell of blue ` twixt chimney-tops its world henceforth that little low-ceiled room symbol and child of spring it take its place ` midst all those type to be a type with they of what so many feel not know it the hidden springtime that be draw nigh and henceforth when the shadow of the cross will enter clothe in moonlight still and dark the flower will nestle at its foot till day pale droop heart-content to rest they go and all night long the snowdrop glimmer white amid the dark unconscious and unseen before the sun have crown he eastern hill with its world-diadem they wake i look out of the window of the inner dream and see the edge of the sun 's glory rise eastward behind the hill the lake-cup 's rim and as it come it suck up in itself as deed drink word or daylight candle-flame that other sun rise to light the dream they lay awake and thoughtful comfort with yesterday which nested in they heart yet haunt with the sound of grind wheel the outer dream and as they lay and look into the room it waver change dissolve beneath the sun which mingle both the morning in they eye till the true conquer and the unreal pass no wall but wood bath in a level sun no ceiling but the vestal sky of morn no bed but flower float ` mid float leaf on water which grow audible as they stir and lift up they head and a low wind that flow from out the west wash from they eye the last film of the dream and they sit up silent for one long cool delicious breath gaze upon each other lose and find with a dumb ecstasy new undefined follow a long embrace and then the oar break up they prison-band and through the wood they slowly go beneath a firmament of bough and cloud leave filmy and pale in the sunshine but shadowy on the grass and rove odour meet they on they way sun-quickened odour which the fog have slay and they green sky have many a blossom-moon and constellation thick with starry flower and deep and still be all the wood except for the memnonian glory-stricken bird and golden beetle ` mid the shadowy root green goblin of the grass and mining mouse and on the leave the fairy butterfly or doubt in the air scarlet and blue the divine depth of summer clasp the earth but ` twixt they heart and summer 's perfectness come a divide thought that seem to say : _ ye wear strange look _ do summer speak or they they say within : we know that ye be fair bright flower but ye shine far away as in a land of other thought alas alas where shall we find the snowdrop-bell half-blown what shall we do we feel the throbbing spring burst in new and unexpressive thought we heart be swell like a tied-up bud and summer crush they with too much light action be bubble up within we soul the wood oppress we more than stony street that be the life indeed this be the dream summer be too complete for grow heart they need a broken season and a land with shadow point ever far away where incompleteness rouse longing thought with spire abrupt and broken sphere and circle cut that they may be widen evermore : through shatter cloudy roof look in the sky a discord from a loftier harmony and tempest waken peace within we thought drive they inward to the inmost rest come my beloved we will haste and go to those pale face of we fellow man we loving heart burn with summer-fire will cast a glow upon they pallidness we hand will help they far as servant may hand be apostle still to saviour-heart so we may share they blessedness with they so may the snowdrop time be likewise ours and earth smile tearfully the spirit smile wherewith she smile upon we holiday as a sweet child may laugh with weep eye if ever we return these glorious flower may all be snowdrop of a higher spring they eye one moment meet and then they know that they do mean the same thing in they heart so with no farther word they turn and go back to the boat and so across the mere i wake from out my dream and know my room my darling book the cherub form above i know ` tis springtime in the world without i feel it springtime in my world within i know that bend o'er a early flower crocus or primrose or anemone the heart that striveth for a higher life and have not yet be conquer findeth there a beauty deep unshared by any rise a human loveliness about the flower that a heath-bell upon a lonely waste have more than scarlet splendor on thick leaf that a blue opening ` midst rain-bosomed cloud be more than paphian sun-set harmony that higher beauty dwell on earth because man seek a higher home than paradise and have lose be rouse thereby to fill a deeper need than could be fill by all the lose ten time restore and so he love the snowdrop more than the magnolia spring-hope be more to he than summer-joy dark town than eden-grove with river four after a old legend the monk be pray in he cell and he do pray full sore he have be pray on he knee for two long hour and more and in the midst and suddenly he feel he eye ope wide and he lift not he head but see a man 's foot he beside and almost to he foot there reach a garment strangely knit some woman 's finger age agone have tremble in make it the monk 's eye go up the garment until a hand they spy a cut from a chisel be on it and another scar beside then he eye spring to the face with a single thirsty bind 'twa he and he nigh have faint he eye have the master find on he ear fall the convent bell that tell he the poor do wait for he hand to divide the daily bread all at the convent-gate and a storm of thought within he blow hither and thither long and the bell keep call all the time with its iron merciless tongue he look in the master 's eye and he spring to he foot in strength : though i find he not when i come back i shall find he the more at length he go and he feed the poor all at the convent-gate and like one bereft with heavy foot go back to be desolate he stand by the door unwilling to see the cell so bare he open the door and lo the master be stand there i have wait for thee because the poor have not to wait and i stand beside thee all the time in the crowd at the convent-gate \* \* \* \* \* but it seem to I though the story sayeth no word of this if the monk have stay the lord would have stay nor crushed that heart of he for out of the far-off time a word sound tenderly : the poor ye have always with you and ye have not always I the tree 's prayer alas ` tis cold and dark the wind all night have sing a wintry tune hail from black cloud that swallow up the moon have beat against my bark oh when will it be spring the sap move not within my withered vein through all my frozen root creep numbing pain that they can hardly cling the sun shine out last morn i feel the warmth through every fiber float i think i hear a thrush 's piping note of hope and sadness bear then come the sea-cloud drive the tempest hiss through all my outstretched bough hither and thither toss I in its snow beneath the joyless heaven o for the sunny leaf almost i have forget the breath of June forget the feathery light-flake from the moon the pray summer-eve o for the joyous bird which be the tongue of we mute longing tree o for the billowy odour and the bee abroad in scatter herd the blessing of cool shower the gratefulness that thrill through every shoot the child play round my deep-sunk root shadow in hot noon hour alas the cold clear dawn through the bare lattice-work of twig around another weary day of moan sound on the thin-shadowed lawn yet winter 's noon be past : i 'll stretch my arm all night into the wind endure all day the chill air and unkind my leaf _ will _ come at last a story of the sea-shore introduction i seek the long clear twilight of the north when from its nest of tree my father 's house see the aurora deepen into dawn far northward in the east o'er the hill-top and front the splendor of the northern west where sunset die into that ghostly gleam that round the horizon creepeth all the night back to the jubilance of gracious morn i find my home in homeliness unchanged for love that maketh home unchangeable receive I to the rights of sonship still o vault summer-heaven bear on the hill once more thou didst embrace I whom a child thy droop fulness nourish into joy once more the valley picture forth with sigh rise on my present vision and behold in nothing have the dream bemock the truth : the water run as garrulous as before the wild flower crowd round my welcome foot the hill arise and dwelt alone in heaven and all have learn new tale against i come once more i trod the well-known field with he whose fatherhood have make I search for god 's and it be old and new like the wild flower the water and the hill but dearer far once on a day my cousin frank and i drive on a seaward road the dear white mare which oft have bear I to the lonely hill beside I sit a maiden on whose face i have not look since we be boy and girl but the old friendship straightway bloom anew the heaven be sunny and the earth be green the harebell large and oh so plentiful while butterfly as blue as they dance on bear purposeless on pulse of clear joy in sportive time to they aeolian clang that day as we talk on without restraint bring near by memory of day that be and therefore be for ever -- by the joy of motion through a warm and shine air by the glad sense of freedom and like thought and by the bond of friendship with the dead she tell the tale which i would mould anew to a more lasting form of utterance for i have wander back to childish year and ask she if she know a ruin old whose masonry descend to the wave face up the sea-cliff at whose rocky foot the billow fall and die along the coast 'twa one of my child marvel for each year we turn we back upon the ripening corn and seek the border of the desert sea o joy of water mingle with the fear of a blind force that know not what to do but spend its strength of wave in lash aye the rock which laugh they into foam and flight but oh the varied riches of that port for almost to the beach but that a wall inclose they reach the garden of a lord he shady walk he ancient tree of state he river which with course indefinite wander across the sand without the wall and lose itself in find out the sea : within it float swan white splendor lay beneath the fairy leap of a wire bridge vanish and reappear amid the shades and lead you where the peacock 's plumy heaven bear azure sun with green and golden ray ah here the sky show higher and the cloud more summer-gracious fill with stranger shape and when they rain it be a golden rain that sparkle as it fall a odorous rain but there be one dream-spot -- my tale must wait until i tell the wonder of that spot it be a little room build somehow -- how i do not know -- against a steep hill-side whose top be with a circular temple crown see from far wave when wind be off the shore -- so that beclouded ever in the night of a luxuriant ivy its low door half-filled with rainbow hue of deep-stained glass appear to open right into the hill never to sesame of mine that door yield that room but through one undyed pane gaze with reverent curiosity i see a little chamber round and high which but to see be to escape the heat and bathe in coolness of the eye and brain for it be dark and green upon one side a window unperceived from without block up by ivy manifold whose leave like crowd head of gazer row on row climb to the top and all the light that come through the thick veil be green oh kindest hue but in the midst the wonder of the place against the back-ground of the ivy boss on a low column stand white pure and still a woman-form in marble cold and clear i know not what it be it may have be a silence or a echo fainter still but that form yet if form it can be call so undefined and pale gleam vision-like in the lone treasure-chamber of my soul surround with its mystic temple dark then come the think too joyous to keep joy turn to very sadness for relief : to sit and dream through long hot summer day shroud in coolness and sea-murmuring forget by all till twilight shades grow dark and read and read in the arabian night till all the beautiful grow possible and then when i have read they every one to find behind the door against the wall old volume full of tale such as in dream one find in bookshop strange in tortuous street beside I over I soul of the place fill the gloom with calm delirium that wondrous woman-statue evermore white radiant fading as the darkness grow into a ghostly pallor that put on to stare eye a vague and shift form but the old castle on the shatter shore -- not the green refuge from the summer heat -- draw forth we talk that day for as i say i ask she if she know it she reply i know it well and add instantly : a woman use to live my mother tell in one of its low vault so near the sea that in high tide and northern wind it be no more a castle-vault but a sea-cave i find there i reply a turret stair lead from level of the ground above down to a vault whence through a opening square half window and half loophole you look forth wide o'er the sea but the dim-sounding wave be many foot beneath and shrink in size to a great ripple i could tell you now a tale i make about a little girl dark-eyed and pale with long seaweed-like hair who haunt that room and gaze o'er the deep call it she mother with a childish glee because she know no other this say she be not a child but woman almost old whose coal-black hair have partly turn to gray with sorrow and with madness and she dwell not in that room high on the cliff but down low down within the margin of spring tide and then she tell I all she know of she as we drive onward through the sunny day it be a simple tale with few few fact a life that clomb one mountain and look forth then sudden sink to a low dreary plain and wander ever in the sound of wave till fear and fascination overcome and lead she tremble into life and joy alas how many such be tell by night in fisher-cottage along the shore farewell old summer-day i lay you by to tell my story and the thought that rise within a heart that never dare believe a life be at the mercy of a sea the story aye as it listeth blow the listless wind fill great sail and bend lordly mast or make billow in the green corn field and hunting lazy cloud across the blue : now like a vapor o'er the sunny sea it blow the vessel from the harbor 's mouth out ` mid the broken crest of seaward wave and hover of long-pinioned ocean bird as if the white wave-spot have take wing but though all space be full of spot of white the sailor see the little handkerchief that flutter still though wet with heavy tear which draw it earthward from the sunny wind blow wind draw out the cord that bind the twain and break not though outlengthened till the maid can only say _ i know he be not here _ blow wind yet gently gently blow o wind and let love 's vision slowly gently die and the dim sail pass ghost-like o'er the deep linger a little o'er the vanish hull with a white farewell to the strain eye for never more in morning 's level beam will the wide wing of she sea-shadowing sail from the green-billowed east come dancing in nor ever glide home beneath the star with a faint darkness o'er the fainter sea will she the ocean-swimmer send a cry of home-come sailor that shall wake the street with sudden panting of dream-scaring joy blow gently wind blow slowly gentle wind weep not oh maiden ti not time to weep torment not thou thyself before thy time the hour will come when thou wilt need thy tear to cool the burning of thy desert brain go to thy work break into song sometimes to die away forget in the lapse of dreamy thought ere natural pause ensue oft in the day thy time-outspeeding heart send thy ready eye to scout the east like child that weary of she mother 's pace and run before and yet perforce must wait the time draw nigh oft turn from she work with bare arm and uncovered head she clomb the landward slope of the prophetic hill from whose green head as on the verge of time seer-like she gaze shade she hope-rapt eye from the bewilderment of work-day light far out on the eternity of wave if from the hade of the nether world she prayer might draw the climb skyey sail up o'er the threshold of the horizon line for when he come she be to be he wife and celebrate with rite of church and home the apotheosis of maidenhood time pass the shadow of a fear that hang far off upon the horizon of she soul draw near with deepen gloom and clearing form till it o'erspread and fill she atmosphere and lose all shape because it fill all space reach beyond the bound of consciousness but ever in swift incarnation dart forth from its infinite a stony stare a blank abyss a awful emptiness ah god why be we soul lone helpless sea tortured with such immitigable storm what be this love that now on angel wing sweep we amid the star in passionate calm and now with demon arm fast cincturing drop we through all gyration of keen pain down the black vortex till the giddy whirl give faint respite to the ghastly brain not these the maiden 's question come he yet or be i widow ere my wedding day ah range along we shore on peak or cliff or stone-ribbed promontory or pier head maiden have aye be stand the same pain deaden the heart-throb the same gathering mist dim the eye that would be keen as death the same fixed longing on the changeless face over the edge he vanish -- come no more : there as in childhood 's dream upon that line without a parapet to shield the sense voidness go sheer down to oblivion : over that edge he vanish -- come no more o happy those for whom the possible open its gate of madness and become the real around they those to whom henceforth there be but one to-morrow the next morn they wedding day ever one step remove the husband 's foot ever upon the verge of the day 's threshold whiteness aye and flower ready to meet he ever in a dream but faith and expectation conquer still and so she morrow come at last and lead the death-pale maiden-ghost dazzle confuse into the land whose shadow fall on ours and be we dream of too deep blessedness may not some madness be a kind of faith shall not the possible become the real life not the god who have create dream so stand we question upon the shore and gaze hopeful towards the unrevealed long look the maiden till the visible half vanish from she eye the earth have cease that lay behind she and the sea be all except the narrow shore which yet give room for she sea-haunting foot where solid land where rock and hill stop fright suddenly and earth flow henceforth on in tremble wave a featureless a half re-molten world halfway to the unseen the invisible half see in the condensed and flowing sky which lay so grimly smooth before she eye and brain and shrink soul where power of man could never heap up mole or pyramid or dig a valley in the unstable gulf fight for aye to make invisible to swallow up and keep she smooth blue smile unwrinkled and unspotted with the land not all the change on the restless wave save it from a still monotony whose only utterance be a dreary song of stifled wail on the shrink shore such frenzy slow invade the poor girl not hers the hover sense of marriage bell tuning the air with fragrance of sweet sound but the low dirge that ever rise and die recur without pause or any close like one verse chaunt aye in sleepless brain down to the shore it draw she from the height like witch 's demon-spell that fearful moan she know that somewhere in the green abyss he body swing in curve of watery force now in a circle slow revolve and now sway like wind-swung bell when surface wave sink they root deep enough to reach the waif hither and thither idly to and fro wander unheed through the heedless sea a kind of fascination seize she brain and draw she onward to the ridgy rock that run a little way into the deep like question ask of fate by longing heart bind which the eternal ocean break in sigh along they flat and furrow and jagged back out to the lonely point where the green mass arise and sink heave slow and forceful she go and recoil in terror ever draw ever repel with inward shuddering at the great heartless miserable depth she think the ocean lay in wait for she entice she with horror 's glittering eye and with the hope that in a hour sure fix in some far century aeon remote she conscious still of love despite the sea should in the wash of perennial wave sweep o'er some stray bone or transform dust of he who love she on this happy earth know by a dreamy thrill in thawing nerve for so the fragment of wild song she sing betoken as she sit and watch the tide till as it slowly grow it touch she foot when terror overcome -- she rise and flee towards the shore with fear-bewildered eye and stumble on the rock with hasty step cry they be come come at my heel perhaps like this the song she use to wail in the rough northern tongue of aberdeen : -- ye 'll hae I yet ye 'll hae I yet sae lang a ' braid a ' never a hame its nae the depth i fear a bit but oh the wideness aye the same the jaw -lrb- 1 -rrb- come up wus ' eerie bark cryin ' i be creepy cauld a ' green come doon come doon he be lyin ' stark come doon a ' steek he glowerin ' een syne wisht they haud they weary roar a ' slide awa ' a ' i

greet than aye think lang -lrb- footnote 1 : jaw : _ english _ breaker -rrb- where'er she flee the same voice follow she whispering innumerable of water-drop grow together to a giant voice that sometimes in hoarse rush undertone sometimes in thunderous peal of billowy shout call after she to come and make no stay from the dim mist that brood seaward far and from the lonely tossing of the wave where rise and fall the rave wilderness voice pursue arm and beckon hand reach shoreward from the shudder mystery then sometimes uplift on a rocky peak a lonely form betwixt the sea and sky watcher on shore behold she fling wild arm high o'er she head in tossing like the wave then fix they with clasped hand of prayer intense forward appeal to the bitter sea then sudden from she shoulder she would tear she garment one by one and cast they far into the roaring of the heedless surge a vain oblation to the hungry wave such she do mean it and she pitying friend clothe she in vain -- they gift do bribe the sea but such a fire be burn in she brain the cold wind lap she and the sleet-like spray flash all unheed on she tawny skin as oft she bring she food and fling it far reserve scarce a morsel for she need -- fling it -- with naked arm and streaming hair float like sea-weed on the tide of wind coal-black and lustreless -- to feed the sea but after each poor sacrifice despair like the return wave that bear it far rush surge back upon she sickening heart while evermore she moan low-voiced between -- half-muttered and half-moaned : ye 'll hae I yet ye 'll ne'er be sair till ye hae ta'en mysel ' and as the night grow thick upon the sea quench it all except its voice of storm blotting it from the region of the eye though still it toss within the haunt brain enter by the portal of the ear -- she step by step withdraw like dream man who power of motion all but paralyse with a eternity of slowness drag he earth-bound lead-like irresponsive foot back from a living corpse 's stare eye till on the narrow beach she turn she round then clothe in all the might of the unseen terror grow ghostly and she shriek and flee up to the battered base of the old tower and round the rock and through the arched gap cleave the blackness of the vault within then sink upon the sand and gasp and rave this be she secret chamber this she place of refuge from the outstretched demon-deep all eye and voice for she argus more dread than he with hundred lidless watch orb there cower in a nook she sit all night she eye fix on the entrance of the cave through which a pale light shimmer from the sea until she sleep and see the sea in dream except in stormy night when all be dark and the wild tempest sweep with slanting wing against she refuge and the heavy spray shoot through the doorway serpentine cold arm to seize the fore-doomed morsel of the sea : then she sleep never and she would have die but that she evermore be sting to life by new sea-terror sometimes the sea-gull with clang pinion dart through the arch and flap they round she face sometimes a wave if tide be high and wind from off the sea rush through the door and in its watery mesh clasp she waist-high then out again to sea out to the devilish laughter and the fog while she cling scream to the bare rock-wall then sit unmoving till the low gray dawn grow on the misty dance of spout wave that mix the gray with white picture one-hued see in the framework of the arched door : then the old fascination draw she out till wrapt in misty spray moveless she stand upon the border of the dawn sea and yet she have a chamber in she soul the innermost of all a quiet place but which she could not enter for the love that keep she out for ever in the storm could she have enter all have be as still as summer evening or a mother 's arm and she have find she lose love sleep there thou too hast such a chamber quiet place where god be wait for thee be it gain or the confused murmur of the sea of human voice on the rock of fame that will not let thee enter be it care for the provision of the unborn day as if thou wert a god that must foresee lest he great sun should chance forget to rise or pride that thou art some one in the world and man must bow before thee oh go mad for love of some one lose for some old voice which first thou madest sing and after sob some heart thou foundest rich and leftest bare choke its well of faith with thy false deed not like thy god who keep the better wine until the last and if he giveth grief giveth it first and end the tale with joy madness be nearer god than thou : go mad and be ennoble far above thyself she brain be ill she heart be well : she love it be the unbroken cord between the twain that draw she ever to the ocean marge though to she feverous phantasy unfit ` mid the tumultuous brood of shape distort to see one simple form it be the fear of fix destiny unavoidable and not the longing for the well-known face that draw she draw she to the urgent sea better to die better to rave for love than to recover with sick sneering heart or if that thou art noble in some hour madden with thought of that which could not be thou mightst have yield to the burning wind that sweep in tempest through thy scorching brain and rush into the thick cold night of the earth and clamour to the wave and beat the rock and never find the way back to the seat of conscious rule and power to bear thy pain but god have make thee stronger to endure for other end beyond thy present choice : wilt thou not own she story a fit theme for poet 's tale in she most frantic mood not call the maniac _ sister _ tenderly for she go mad for love and not for gold and in the fade form whose eye like sun too fierce for freshness and for dewy bloom have parch and pale the hue of tender spring can not thy love unmask a youthful shape deform by tempest of the soul and sea fit to remind thee of a story old which god have in he keep -- of thyself but god forget not man because they sleep the darkness last all night and clear the eye then come the morning and the joy of light o surely madness hideth not from he nor doth a soul cease to be beautiful in he sight when its beauty be withdraw and hide by pale eclipse from human eye surely as snow be friendly to the spring a madness may be friendly to the soul and shield it from a more enduring loss from the ice-spear of a heart-reaching frost so after year the winter of she life come the sure spring to she man have forget close the rent link of the social chain and leave she outside they charm ring into the chill wind and the howling night god send out for she and she enter in where there be no more sea what messenger run from the door of love-contented heaven to lead she towards the real ideal home the sea she terror and the wintry wind for on a morn of sunshine while the wind yet blow and heave yet the billowy sea with memory of the night of deep unrest they find she in a basin of the rock which bury in a firmament of sea when ocean wind heap up the tidal wave yet in the respiration of the surge lift clear its edge of rock full to the brim with deep clear rest water plentiful there in the blessedness of sleep which god give he beloved she lay drowned and still o life of love conquer at last by fate o life raise from the dead by savior death o love unconquered and invincible the sea have cool the burning of that brain have lay to rest those limb so fever-tense that scarce relax in sleep and now she lie sleep the sleep that follow after pain 'twa one night more of agony and fear of shrink from the onset of the sea one cry of desolation when she fear become a fact and then -- god know the rest o cure of all we misery -- _ god know _ o thou whose foot tread ever the wet sand and howl rock along the wear shore roam the confines of the endless sea strain not thine eye across bedimm with tear no sail come back across that tender line turn thee unto thy work let god alone he will do he part then across the wave will float faint whisper from the better land veil in the dust of water we call storm to thine avert ear do thou thy work and thou shalt follow follow and find thine own o thou who liv ` st in fear of the _ to come _ around whose house the storm of terror break all night to whose love-sharpened ear all day the invisible be call at thy door to render up that which thou can ` st not keep be it a life or love open thy door and carry forth thy dead unto the marge of the great sea bear it into the flood brave the cold that creepeth to thy heart and lay thy coffin as a ark of hope upon the billow of the infinite sea give god thy dead to keep : so float it back with sigh and prayer to waft it through the dark back to the spring of life say -- it be dead but thou the life of life art yet alive and thou can ` st give the dead its dear old life with new abundance perfect the old god see my sadness feel it in thyself ah god the earth be full of cry and moan and dull

still go forward with a quiet will that get but do not miss with gentle step she pass along and once a low half-murmured song utter she share of bliss it be a little maiden-child you see not frolicsome and wild as such a child should be for though she be just nine no more another little child she bear almost as big as she with tender care of strain arm she keep it circle from all harm with face turn from the sun for in that perfect tiny heart the mother sister nurse have part she womanhood begin at length they reach a ugly ditch the slippery sloping bank of which flower and long grass line some ragged-robin baby spy and spread he little arm out wide as he have find a mine what baby want that baby have : a law unalterable as -- the poor shall serve the rich she kneeleth down with eager eye and reach far out for the prize topple into the ditch and slant down the bank she roll but in she little bosom 's fold she clasp the baby tight and in the ditch 's muddy flow no safety

baby be quite dry and baby laugh and baby crow and baby be right she know that nothing can be wrong and so with troubled heart yet stout she plan how ever to get out with meditation long the bank be higher than she head and slippery too as i have say and what to do with baby for even the monkey when he go need both he finger and he toe -- she be perplexed as may be but all she puzzling be no good though stare up the bank she stand which as she sink grow higher until invade with dismay lest baby 's patience should give way she free she from the mire and up and down the ditch not glad but patient she do promenade splash splash go she poor foot and baby think it rare good fun and do not want it to be do and the ditch flower be sweet but oh the world that she have leave the mead from she so lately reave a infant proserpine lay like a fabled land above a paradise of sunny love in warmth and light divine while with the hot sun overhead she she low watery way do tread ` mid slimy weed and frog while now and then from distant field the sound of laughter faintly peal or bark of village dog and once the ground begin to shake and she poor little heart to quake for fear of add woe till look up at last perforce she see the head of a huge horse go past upon its nose and with a sound of tear grass and puff breath that awful be and horn of frightful size a cow look through the broken hedge and gaze down on she from the edge with great big juno eye and so the sun go on and on and horse and cow and horn be go and still no help come near till at the last she hear the sound of human footstep on the ground and then she cry : _ i _ be here it be a man much to she joy who look amaze at girl and boy and reach he hand so strong give I the child he say but no she would not let the baby go she have endure too long so with a smile at she alarm he stretch down both he lusty arm and lift they together and have thank she helper she do hasten homeward painfully wet in the sunny weather at home at length lo scarce a speck be on the child from heel to neck though she be sorely mire nor give she sign of grief 's unrest till hide upon she mother 's breast she weep till she be tired and intermix with sob wail she tell she mother all the tale -- but -- here she wet cheek glow -- mother i do not through it all i do not once let baby fall -- i never let he go ah I if on this star-world 's face we man and woman have like grace to bear and shield each other we race would soon be young again its heart as free of ache and pain as that of this child-mother love 's ordeal a recollection and attempt completion of a prose fragment read in childhood know ` st thou that sound upon the window pane say the youth quietly as outstretched he lay where for a hour outstretch he have lie pillow upon she knee to he do say the thoughtful maiden : it be but the rain that have be gather in the west all day be still my dearest let my eye yet rest awhile upon thy face so calm and blest know ` st thou that sound from silence slowly work say the youth and he eyelid softly rise reveal to she eye the depths of thought that lay beneath she in a still repose i know it say the maiden it be nought but the loud wintry wind that ever blow swing the great arm of the dreary pine which each with other in its pain entwine hear ` st thou the baying of my hound say he draw back the lattice-bar and let they in through a cloud-rift the light fall noiselessly upon the cottage floor and gaunt and thin leap in the stag-hound bound as in glee shake the rain-drop from they shaggy skin and as the maiden close the spattered glass a shadow faint over the floor do pass the youth half-raised be lean on he hand and when again beside he sit the maid he eye for a slow minute move scan she calm peace-lighted face and then he say monotonous like solemn-read command : for love be of the earth earthy and lay down lifeless in its mother 's womb at last the strange sound through the great pine-branch pass again a shadow as it be of glass over the moonbeam on the cottage floor shapeless and dim almost unseen doth pass a mingled sound of rain-drop at the door but not a sound upon the window be a look of sorrowing doubt the youth 's face wear and the two hound half-rose and gaze at he eye he countenance by the taper dim now nothing of these thing the maiden note but turn she face with half-reproachful look as doubt whether he the word have quote out of some evil earth-begotten book or upward from he spirit 's depths have float those word like bubble in a low dead brook but he eye seem to question -- yea or no and so the maiden answer : ` tis not so love be of heaven and heavenly a faint smile part he lip as a think unexpressed be speak in he heart and for a while he gently lay he head upon she breast he thought a bark that by a sunny isle at length have find the haven of its rest yet must not long remain but forward go : he lift up he head and answer : no -- maiden i have love other maiden pale she red lip grow i love they yes but they one after one in trial 's hour do fail for after sunset cloud again be gray a sudden light flash through the silken veil that droop hide she eye and then there lay a stillness on she face wait and then the little clock ring out the hour of ten moan again the great pine-branches bow as if they try in vain the wind to stem still look in she eye the youth say -- thou art not more beautiful than some of they but more of earnestness be on thy brow thine eye be beam like some dark-bright gem that pour from hidden heart upon the night the ray it gather from the noon-day light look on this hand beloved thou didst see the horse that break from many it do hold : two hour shall pass away and it will be all wither up and dry wrinkled and old big-veined and skinny to extremity calmly upon he look the maiden bold the stag-hound rise and gaze on he and then with a low whine lay themselves down again a minute 's silence and the youth spake on : dearest i have a fearful thing to bear -lrb- a pain-cloud cross he face and then be go -rrb- at midnight when the moon set wilt thou dare to go with I or must i go alone to meet a agony that will not spare she speak not rise and towards she mantle go he eye do thank she -- she be well content not yet not yet it be not time for see the hand have far to travel to the hour yet time be scarcely leave for tell thee the past and present and the come power of the great darkness that will fall on I : rose and jasmine twine the bridal bower -- if ever bower and bridal joy be mine horror and darkness must that bower entwine under he head the maiden put she arm and knelt beside half lean on he breast as soul and body she would shield all harm from he whose love have make she being blest and well the healing of she eye might charm he doubt thought again to trust rest he draw and hide she face he heart upon then speak with low voice sound changeless on strange word they be and fearful that he speak the maiden move not once nor once reply and ever as he speak the wind do make a feebler moan until away it die then the rain cease and not a movement brake the silence save the clock that do divide the hour into quick moment spark of time scorch the soul that watcheth for the chime he speak of sin that pride have cause in he of suffering merciful and wanderings wild of faint noontide and of ocean dim of earthly beauty that have oft beguile and then the sudden storm and contest grim from each emerge new-born more a child wander again throughout the teaching earth no rest attain only a new birth but when i find a heart that be like to mine with love to live through the unloving hour fold in faith like violet that have lien fold in warm earth till the sunny shower calleth they forth thought with my thought to twine weave around we both a fragrant bower where we within may sleep together draw fold in love until the morning dawn then shall i rest my weary day 's work o'er a deep sleep bathing steep all my soul dissolve out the earth-stain evermore thou too shalt sleep with I and be make whole all all time 's billow over we shall pour then ebb away and far beneath we roll : we shall behold they like a stormy lake ` neath the clear height of peace where we awake she face on he she lip on he lip press be the sole answer that the maiden make with both he arm he hold she to he breast 'twa but a moment yet before he say one other word of power to strengthen lest she should give way amid the trial dread the clock give out the warn to the hour and on the thatch fall sound as of a shower one long kiss and the maiden rise a fear fall like a shadow dim upon she heart a tremble as at something ghostly near but she be bold for they be not to part then the youth rise he cheek pale he eye clear and help the maid whose tremble hand do thwart she haste to tie she gather mantle 's fold then forth they go into the midnight cold the moon be sunken low in the dim west curl upward on the steep horizon 's brink a leaf of glory fall to its rest the maiden 's hand still tremble scarce could link she to he side but he arm round she waist steal gently so she walk and do not sink she hand on he right side soon hold he fast and so together wind they onward pass and cling to he side she feel full well the strong and measure beating of he heart but as the float moon aye lower fall slowly she feel its bound force depart till like a throbbing bird nor can she tell whether it beat at length and with a start she feel the arm relax around she flung and on she circling arm he lean and hang but as he step more and more feeble grow she feel she strength and courage rise amain he lift up he head the moon be low almost on the world 's edge a smile of pain be on he lip as he large eye turn slow seek for hers which like a heavy rain pour love on he in many a love-lit gleam so they walk like two soul link by one dream -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : in a lovely garden walk two lover go hand in hand two wan sick figure talk they sit in the flowery land on the cheek they kiss each other and they kiss upon the mouth fast clasped they one another -- and back come they health and youth two little bell ring shrilly and the dream go with the hour : she lay in the cloister stilly he far in the dungeon-tower _ translate from uhland _ -rrb- hang he head behind each come a hound with slow and noiseless paw upon the road what be that shine on the weedy ground nought but the bright eye of the dingy toad the silent pine range every way around a deep stream on the left side hardly flow they path be towards the moon die alone -- it touch the horizon dip be go its last gleam fall upon dim glazed eye a old man totter feebly in she hold stoop with bended knee that could not rise nor longer could he arm she waist infold the maiden tremble but through this disguise she love behold what never could grow old and so the aged man she young and warm clasped closer yet with she supporting arm till with short drag step he turn aside into a closer thicket of tall fir whose bare straight slender stem behind they hide a smooth gray rock not a pine-needle stir till they go in then a low wind blow wide o'er they cone-top it swell until it whirr through the long stem as if aeolian chord for mould mystic sound in lack of word but as they enter by a narrow cleft into the rock 's heart suddenly it cease and the tall pine stand still as if bereft of a strong passion or from pain release once more they weave they strange dark moveless weft o'er the dull midnight sky and in the east a mist arise and clomb the skyey stair and like sad thought the bat come unawares ` tis a dark chamber for the bridal night o poor pale savior bride a faint rush-lamp he kindle with he shake hand its light paint a tiny halo on the damp that fill the cavern to its unseen height like a death-candle on the midnight swamp within each side the entrance lie a hound with liquid light he green eye gleam round a couch just raise above the rocky floor of withered oak and beech-leaf that the wind have toss about till weary covered o'er with skin of bear which feathery moss line and last of lamb with wool long soft and hoar receive the old man 's bended limb recline gently the maiden do herself unclothe and lay beside he trust and not loath again the storm among the tree o'erhead the hound prick up they ear they eye flash fire seem to the tremble maiden that a tread light and yet clear amid the wind 's loud ire as drip foot o'er smooth slab hither speed come often up as with a fierce desire to enter but as oft make quick retreat and look forth the hound stand on they foot then come half querulous a whisper old feeble and hollow as from out a chest : take my face on you bosom i be cold straightway she bare she bosom 's white soft nest and then he head she gentle hand love-bold with its gray withered face against she press ah maiden it be very old and chill but thy warm heart beneath it grow not still again the wind fall and the rain-cloud pour rush to earth and soon she hear the sound of a fierce torrent through the thick night roar the lamp go out as by the darkness drown no more the morn will dawn oh never more like century the feeble hour go round dead night lay o'er she clasping as she lay within she holy place unburied clay the hour stand still she life sink down so low that but for wretchedness no life she know a charnel wind sing on a moan -- _ no _ earth 's center be the grave from which it blow earth 's love and beauty all pass sigh slow rose and lily child friend the few but so transparent blanch in every part she see the pale worm lie in each heart and worst of all o death of gladsome life a voice within awake and cry : in sooth there be no need of sorrow care and strife for all that woman beauty call and truth be but a glow from heart with fancy rife pass away with slowly fading youth gaze on they narrowly they waver blot look at they fixedly and they be not and all the answer the poor child could make lay in the tighten grasp of she two hand she feel as if she lay moulder awake within the sepulchre 's fast stony band and care not though she die but for he sake and the dark horror grow like drift sand till nought seem beautiful not god nor light and yet she brave the false deny night but after hope be dead a faint light streak creep through a crevice in the rocky wall it fall upon she bosom and he cheek from god 's own eye that light-glance seem to fall backward he draw he head and do not speak but gaze with large deep eye angelical upon she face old age have flee away -- youth everlasting in she bosom lay with a low cry of joy closer she creep and on he bosom hide a face that glow seek amends for terror while he sleep she have be faithful : the beloved owe love youth and gladness unto she who weep gushingly on he heart she warm tear flow a baptism for the life that would not cease and when the sun arise they sleep in peace a prayer for the past all sight and sound of every year all group and form each leaf and gem be thine o god nor need i fear to speak to thee of they too great thy heart be to

fill each nook of my ache and misty breast over some shine shore there hangeth a space of blue a parting ` mid thin cloud hoar where the sunlight be fall through the glad wave be kiss the shore rejoice and tell it for ever the boat glide on while its oar be flash out of the river oh to be there with thee thou and i only my love the sparkling sand and the sea and the sunshine of god above my eye make picture my eye make picture when they be shut coleridge fair morn i bring my greet to lofty sky and pale save where cloud-shred be fleeting before the drive gale the weary branch toss careless of autumn 's grief shadow and sunlight cross on each earth-spotted leaf i will escape they grieving and so i close my eye and see the light boat heave where the billow fall and rise i see the sunlight glance upon its silvery sail where a youth 's wild heart be dance and a maiden grow pale and i be quietly pacing the smooth stone o'er and o'er where the merry wave be chase each other to the shore word come to I while listen where the rock and water meet and the little shell be glisten in sand-pool at my foot away the white sail gleam again i close my eye and the autumn light be streaming from pale blue cloudless sky upon the lone hill fall ` mid the sound of heather-bell where the run stream be call unto the silent well along the pathway lonely my horse and i move slow no living thing save only the home-returning crow and the moon so large be peer up through the white cloud foam and i be gladly near my father 's house my home as i be gently dream the solemn tree look out the hill the water seem in still sleep round about and in my soul be ring tone of a spirit-lyre as my beloved be singing amid a sister-choir if peace be in my spirit how oft i would close my eye and all the earth inherit and all the changeful sky thus leave the sermon dreary thus leave the lonely hearth no more a spirit weary -- a free one of the earth death when like a garment fling aside at night this body lie or sculpture of cold rest when through its shaded window come no light and the white hand be fold on its breast how will it be with I its tenant now how shall i feel when first i wander out how look on tear from loved eye fall how look forth upon dim mystery round about shall i go forth slow-floating like a mist over the city with its crowded wall over the tree and meadow where i list over the mountain and they ceaseless fall over the red cliff and fantastic rock over the sea far-down fleeting away white sea-bird shine and the billowy shock heave unheard they shore-besieging spray or will a veil o'er all material thing slow-falling hide they from the spirit 's sight even as the veil which the sun 's radiance fling o'er star that have be shine all the night and will the spirit be entrance alone like one in a exalted opium-dream -- time space and all they varied dweller go and sunlight vanish and all thing that seem think only wake think that doth not own the lapse of age or the change of place think in which only that which _ be _ be know the substance here the form confine to space or as a child that sob itself to sleep wearied with labor which the grow call play wake in smile as soon as morn doth peep spring up to labor all the joyous day shall we lie down weary and sleep until we soul be cleanse by long and dreamless rest till of repose we drink we thirsting fill and wake all peaceful smile pure and blest i know not -- only know one needful thing : god be i shall be ever in he view i only need strength for the travailing will for the work thou givest I to do lesson for a child i there breathe not a breath of the morning air but the spirit of love be move there not a tremble leaf on the shadowy tree mingle with thousand in harmony but the spirit of god doth make the sound and the thought of the insect that creepeth around and the sunshiny butterfly come and go like beautiful thought move to and fro and not a wave of they busy wing be unknown to the spirit that moveth all thing and the long-mantled moth that sleep at noon and dance in the light of the mystic moon -- all have one be that love they all not a fly in the spider 's web can fall but he care for the spider and care for the fly and he care for each little child 's smile or sigh how it can be i can not know he be wiser than i and it must be so ii the tree-root meet in the spongy ground look where water lay because they meet they twine around embrace and go they way drop dash on drop as the rain-shower fall yet they strive not but join together and they rise from the earth a bright clear well singing in sunny weather sound meet sound in the wavy air they kiss as sister true yet jostle not on they journey fair each on its own path fly wind meet wind in a garden green each for its own way plead and a trample whirlwind dance between till the flower of love lay dead iii to ccp the bird on the leafy tree the bird in the cloudy sky the fish in the wavy sea the stag on the mountain high the albatross asleep on the wave of the rock deep the bee on its light wing bear over the bend corn -- what be the thought in the breast of the little bird at rest what be the thought in the song which the lark in the sky prolong what mean the dolphin 's ray wind he watery way what be the thought of the stag stately on yonder crag what doth the albatross think dream upon the brink of the mountain billow and then dream down in its glen what be the thought of the bee fleeting so silently flit from part to part speedily gently rove like the love of a thoughtful heart ever at rest and move what be the life of they think doth praise they soul employ i think it can be nought but the tremble movement to and fro of a bright life-giving joy and the god of cloudless day who soul and heart doth know taketh they joy for praise and biddeth its fountain flow and if in thy life on earth in the chamber or by the hearth mid the crowded city 's tide or high on the lone hill-side thou canst cause a thought of peace or a ache thought to cease or a gleam of joy to burst on a soul in gladness nurst spare not thy hand my child though the gladden should never know the well-spring amid the wild whence the water of blessing flow find thy reward in the thing which thou hast be bless to do let the joy of other cause joy to spring up in thy bosom too and if the love of a grateful heart as a rich reward be give lift thou the love of a grateful heart to the god of love in heaven hope defer summer be come again the sun be bright and the soft wind be breathe we will joy and see in each other 's eye the light of the same joy smile hopeful we employ shall like the bird ' be airy castle thing build by gay hope and fond imagining people the land within we we will tell of the green hill and of the silent sea and of all summer thing that calmly dwell a wait paradise for you and I and if we thought should wander upon sorrow yet hope will wait upon the far-off morrow look on those leave it be not summer 's mouth that breathe that hue upon they and look there -- on that thin tree see through its branch bare how low the sun be in the mid-day south this day be but a gleam of gladness fly back from the past to tell we what be go for the dead leaf be fall and we heart which with the world be ever change so give back in echo sad and low the rustling sigh wherewith dead leaf depart : a sound not murmur but faint and wild a sorrow for the past that have no child -- no sweet-voiced child with the bright name of hope we be like you poor leaf but have more scope for sorrow for we summer pass away with a slow year-long overshadow decay yea spring 's first blossom disappear slay by the shadow of the come year come round I my beloved we will hold all of we compass thus : a winter day be draw nigh we we be grow old and if we be not as a ring enchant about each other 's heart to keep we gay the young who claim that joy which haunt we vision once will push we far away into the desolate region dim and gray where the sea have no moaning and the cloud no rain of tear but apathy doth shroud all be and all time but if we keep together thus the tide of youth will sweep round we with thousand joyous wave as round some palmy island of the deep and we youth hover round we like the breath of one that sleep and sleepeth not to death thus onward hand in hand to part grave the sundered door into one palace home through age 's thicket falter we will go if he who lead we will it so believe in we youth and in the past within we tend to the last love 's radiant lamp which burn in cave or dome and like the lamp that age long have glow in bless grave when once the weary load of tomb-built year be heave up and cast for youth and immortality away will flash abroad in open day clear as a star in heaven 's blue-vaulted night shine till then through every wrinkled fold with the transfiguration 's conquer might that youth we face wonder shall behold and shall be glad not fear to be old the death of the old year the weary old year be dead at last he corpse ` mid the ruin of time be cast where the moulder wreck of lose thought lie and the rich-hued blossom of passion die to a withering grass that droop o'er he grave the shadowy titan 's refuge cave strange light from pale moony memory lie on the weedy column beneath its eye and strange be the sound of the ghostlike breeze in the linger leave on the skeleton tree and strange be the sound of the fall shower when the cloud of dead pain o'er the spirit lower unheard in the home he inhabiteth the land where all lose thing be gather by death alone i recline in the closing year voice nor breathing nor step be near and i say in the weariness of my breast : weary old year thou art go to rest o weary old year i would i might be one hour alone in thy die with thee would thou wert a spirit whose low lament might mix with the sigh from my spirit send for i be weary of man and life weary of restless unchanging strife weary of change that be ever change weary of thought that be ever range ever fall in effort vain flutter upspringing from earth again struggle once more through the darkness to wing that hang o'er the birthplace of everything and choke yet again in the vapor 's breast sinking once more to a helpless rest i be weary of tear that scarce be dry ere they fount be fill as the cloud go by weary of feeling where each in the throng mock at the rest as they crowd along where pride over all like a god on high sit enshrine in he self-complacency where selfishness crawl the snake-demon of ill the least suspect where busiest still where all thing evil and painful entwine and all in they hate and they sorrow be mine : o weary old year i would i might be one hour by thy die to weep with thee peace the soul 's slumber be round I shed the sleep where think life but its pain be dead and my musing lead I a spirit-band through the wide realm of they native land till i stand by the couch of the mighty die a lonely shore in the midnight lie he lay as if he have lay he to sleep and the star above he they watch do keep and the mournful wind with the dreamy sigh the homeless wanderer of the sky be the only attendant whose gentle breath soothe he yet on the couch of death and the die wave of the heedless sea fall at he foot most listlessly but he lay in peace with he solemn eye look far through the mist of futurity a smile gleam over the death-dew that lay on he withered cheek as life ebb away a darkness lay on he forehead vast but the light of expectancy o'er it be cast -- a light that shine from the coming day travel unseen to the east away in he cloudy robe that lay shadow wide i stretch myself motionless by he side and he eye with they calm unimpassioned power soothing my heart like a evening shower lead in a spectral far-billowing train the hour of the past through my spirit again there be fear of evil whose stony eye freeze joy in its gush melody some float afar on thy tranquil wave and the heart look up from its search for a grave while other as guest to the bosom come and leave its wild child more sorrow less shame for the death-look part from they chilling brow and they bless the head that before they bow and float away in the far-off gloom thankfulness follow they to they tomb there be hope that find not a place to rest they foot ` mid the rush of all-ocean 's breast and home to the sickening heart fly back but change into sorrow upon they track and through the moan of the darkening sea bear no leaf from the olive-tree there be joy that look forth with they maiden eye and smile and be go with a sad surprise and the love of the earthly whose beauteous form beckon I on through sunshine and storm but when the bound heart spring high meeting she smile with a speechless sigh the arm sink home with a painful start clasp a vacancy to the heart and the voice of the die i seem to hear but whether he breathing be in mine ear or the sound of the break billow roll the linger accent upon my soul i know not but thus they seem to bear reproof to my soul for its faint despair : -- blame not life it be scarce begin blame not mankind thyself art one and change be holy oh blame it never thy soul shall live by its change ever not the bubble change of a stagnant pool but the change of a river flow and full where all that be noble and good will grow mightier still as the full tide flow till it join the hide the boundless sea roll through depths of eternity blame not thy thought that it can not reach that which the infinite must teach bless thy god that the word come nigh to guide thee home to thy native sky where all thing be homely and glorious too and the child be wonder and glad and true and he point away to a eastern star that gleam through he robe o'er the ocean afar and i know that a star have look o'er the rim of my world that lay all dreary and dim and be slowly dissolve the darkness deep which like evil nurse have soothe I to sleep and rise higher and shine clearer would draw the day-spring ever nearer till the sunshine of god burst full on the morn and every hill and valley would start with the joy of light and new gratitude bear to he who have lead I home to he heart and all thing that live in my world within with the gladness of tear to he foot come in and the false self be banish with fiend to dwell in the gloomiest haunt of he native hell and pride that rule like a god above be tread ` neath the foot of triumphant love and again he point across the sea and another vision arise in I : and i know i walk a ocean of fear yet of safety too for the master be near and every wave of sorrow or dread o'er which strong faith should upraise my head would show from the height of its troubled crest still nearer and nearer the land of rest and when the storm-spray on the wind should arise and with tear unbidden should blind mine eye and hide from my vision the home of love i know i must look to the star above and the mist of passion would quickly flee and the storm would faint to serenity and again it seem as if word find scope the sorrowing word of a farewell hope : i will meet thee again in that deathless land whenever thy foot shall imprint the strand and the loveliest thing that have here be mine shall there in eternal beauty shine for there i shall live and never die part of a glorious eternity for the death of time be _ to be forget _ and i go where oblivion entereth not he be dead he have go to the rest of he race with a sad smile freeze upon he face deadness cloud he eye and he death-bell ring and my sorrowing thought he low requiem sing and with tremble step he worn body cast in the wide charnel-house of the dreary past thus meet the noble old year he end : rest he in peace for he be my friend as my thought return from they wander a voice in my spirit be linger and its sound be like spring 's first breeze 's hum when the oak-leaves fall and the young leaf come : time dieth ever be ever bear : on the footstep of night so treadeth the morn shadow and brightness death and birth chasing each other o'er the round earth but the spirit of time from he tomb be spring the dust of decay from he pinion fling ever renew he glorious youth scatter around he the dew of truth oh let it raise in the desert heart fountain and flower that shall never depart this spirit will fill we with think sublime for the _ end of god _ be the spirit of time a song in a dream i dream of a song i hear it sing in the ear that sleep not its music ring and the tone be uphold by harmony deep where the spirit float yea soar on they sweep with each wild unearthly word and tone upward it know not whither bind in a calm delirium of mystic sound -- up where the genius of thought alone loveth in silence to drink he fill of dew that from unknown cloud distil a woman 's voice the deep echo awake in the cavern and solitude of my soul but such a voice have never break through the sea of sound that about we roll choke the ear in the daylight strife there be sorrow and triumph and death and life in each chord-note of that prophet-song blended in one harmonious throng : such a chant ere my voice have flee from death be it mine to mould of the parting breath a thanksgiving i thank thee boundless giver that the thought thou givest flow in sound that like a river all through the darkness go and though few should swell the pleasure by share this my wine my heart will clasp its treasure this secret gift of thine my heart the joy inherit and will oft be sing to rest and some wander hope
