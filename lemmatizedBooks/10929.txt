once a pup now do not courteous reader toss you head contemptuously and exclaim of course he be i could have tell _ you _ that you know very well that you have often see a man above six foot high broad and powerful as a lion with a bronzed shaggy visage and the stern glance of a eagle of whom you have say or think or hear other say it be scarcely possible to believe that such a man be once a squalling baby if you have see we hero in all the strength and majesty of full-grown doghood you would have experience a vague sort of surprise have we tell you -- as we now repeat -- that the dog crusoe be once a pup -- a soft round sprawl squeak pup as fat as a tallow candle and as blind as a bat but we draw particular attention to the fact of crusoe 's have once be a pup because in connection with the day of he puppyhood there hang a tale this peculiar dog may thus be say to have have two tail -- one in connection with he body the other with he career this tale though short be very harrowing and as it be intimately connect with crusoe 's subsequent history we will relate it here but before do so we must beg we reader to accompany we beyond the civilized portion of the united state of america -- beyond the frontier settlement of the far west into those wild prairie which be water by the great missourus river -- the father of water -- and he numerous tributary here dwell the pawnee the sioux the delawarer the crow the blackfeet and many other tribe of red indian who be gradually retreat step by step towards the rocky mountain as the advance white man cut down they tree and plough up they prairie here too dwell the wild horse and the wild ass the deer the buffalo and the badger all man and brute alike wild as the power of untame and ungovernable passion can make they and free as the wind that sweep over they mighty plain there be a romantic and exquisitely beautiful spot on the bank of one of the tributary above refer to -- long stretch of mingled woodland and meadow with a magnificent lake lie like a gem in its green bosom -- which go by the name of the mustang valley this remote vale even at the present day be but thinly people by white man and be still a frontier settlement round which the wolf and the bear prowl curiously and from which the startle deer bound terrify away at the period of which we write the valley have just be take possession of by several family of squatter who tire of the turmoil and the squabble of the _ then _ frontier settlement have push boldly into the far west to seek a new home for themselves where they could have elbow room regardless alike of the danger they might encounter in unknown land and of the redskin who dwell there the squatter be well arm with axis rifle and ammunition most of the woman be use to danger and alarm and place implicit reliance in the power of they father husband and brother to protect they and well they might for a bolder set of stalwart man than these backwoodsman never tread the wilderness each have be train to the use of the rifle and the axe from infancy and many of they have spend so much of they life in the wood that they be more than a match for the indian in he own peculiar pursuit of hunting and war when the squatter first issue from the wood border the valley a immense herd of wild horse or mustang be browse on the plain these no sooner behold the cavalcade of white man than utter a wild neigh they toss they flow mane in the breeze and dash away like a whirlwind this incident procure the valley its name the new-comer give one satisfied glance at they future home and then set to work to erect log hut forthwith soon the axe be hear ring through the forest and tree after tree fall to the ground while the occasional sharp ring of a rifle tell that the hunter be cater successfully for the camp in course of time the mustang valley begin to assume the aspect of a thrive settlement with cottage and wave field cluster together in the midst of it of course the savage soon find it out and pay it occasional visit these dark-skinned tenant of the wood bring fur of wild animal with they which they exchange with the white man for knife and bead and bauble and trinket of brass and tin but they hate the pale-face with bitter hatred because they encroachment have at this time materially curtail the extent of they hunting-grounds and nothing but the number and know courage of the squatter prevent these savage from butcher and scalp they all the leader of this band of pioneer be a major hope a gentleman whose love for nature in its wildest aspect determine he to exchange barrack life for a life in the wood the major be a first-rate shot a bold fearless man and a enthusiastic naturalist he be past the prime of life and be a bachelor be unencumbered with a family he first act on reach the site of the new settlement be to commence the erection of a block-house to which the people might retire in case of a general attack by the indian in this block-house major hope take up he abode as the guardian of the settlement and here the dog crusoe be bear here he sprawl in the early morn of life here he leap and yelp and wag he shaggy tail in the excessive glee of puppyhood and from the wooden portal of this block-house he bound forth to the chase in all the fire and strength and majesty of full-grown doghood crusoe 's father and mother be magnificent newfoundlander there be no doubt as to they being of the genuine breed for major hope have receive they as a parting gift from a brother officer who have bring they both from newfoundland itself the father 's name be crusoe the mother 's name be fan why the father have be so call no one could tell the man from whom major hope 's friend have obtain the pair be a poor illiterate fisherman who have never hear of the celebrated robinson in all he life all he know be that fan have be name after he own wife as for crusoe he have get he from a friend who have get he from another friend whose cousin have receive he as a marriage-gift from a friend of _ he _ and that each have say to the other that the dog 's name be crusoe without reason be ask or give on either side on arrive at new york the major 's friend as we have say make he a present of the dog not be much of a dog fancier he soon tire of old crusoe and give he away to a gentleman who take he down to florida and that be the end of he he be never hear of more when crusoe junior be bear he be bear of course without a name that be give to he afterwards in honor of he father he be also bear in company with a brother and two sister all of whom drown themselves accidentally in the first month of they existence by fall into the river which flow past the block-house -- a calamity which occur doubtless in consequence of they have go out without they mother 's leave little crusoe be with he brother and sister at the time and fall in along with they but be save from share they fate by he mother who see what have happen dash with a agonize howl into the water and seize he in she mouth bring he ashore in a half-drowned condition she afterwards bring the other ashore one by one but the poor little thing be dead and now we come to the harrowing part of we tale for the proper understanding of which the foregoing dissertation be needful one beautiful afternoon in that charming season of the american year call the indian summer there come a family of sioux indian to the mustang valley and pitch they tent close to the block-house a young hunter stand lean against the gate-post of the palisade watch the movement of the indian who have just finish a long palaver or talk with major hope be now in the act of prepare supper a fire have be kindle on the greensward in front of the tent and above it stand a tripod from which depend a large tin camp-kettle over this hang a ill-favoured indian woman or squaw who besides attend to the contents of the pot bestow sundry cuff and kick upon she little child which sit near to she playing with several indian cur that gambol round the fire the master of the family and he two son recline on buffalo robe smoke they stone pipe or calumet in silence there be nothing peculiar in they appearance they face be neither dignified nor coarse in expression but wear a aspect of stupid apathy which form a striking contrast to the countenance of the young hunter who seem a amuse spectator of they proceedings the youth refer to be very unlike in many respects to what we be accustom to suppose a backwoods hunter should be he do not possess that quiet gravity and staid demeanor which often characterize these man true he be tall and strongly make but no one would have call he stalwart and he frame indicate grace and agility rather than strength but the point about he which render he different from he companion be he bound irrepressible flow of spirit strangely couple with a intense love of solitary wander in the wood none seem so well fit for social enjoyment as he none laugh so heartily or express such glee in he mischief-loving eye yet for day together he go off alone into the forest and wander where he fancy lead he as grave and silent as a indian warrior after all there be nothing mysterious in this the boy follow implicitly the dictate of nature within he he be amiable straightforward sanguine and intensely _ earnest _ when he laugh he let it out as sailor have it with a will when there be good cause to be grave no power on earth could make he smile we have call he boy but in truth he be about that uncertain period of life when a youth be say to be neither a man nor a boy he face be good-looking -lrb- _ every _ earnest candid face be -rrb- and masculine he hair be reddish-brown and he eye bright-blue he be costume in the deerskin cap leggings moccasin and leathern shirt common to the western hunter you seem tickled wus ' the injun dick varley say a man who at that moment issue from the blockhouse that be just what i be joe blunt reply the youth turn with a broad grin to he companion have a care lad do not laugh at 'em too much they soon take offence a ' they redskin never forgive but i be only laugh at the baby return the youth point to the child which with a mixture of boldness and timidity be play with a pup wrinkle up its fat visage into a smile when its playmate rush away in sport and open wide its jet-black eye in grave anxiety as the pup return at full gallop it ` ud make a owl laugh continue young varley to see such a queer pictur ' o ' itself he pause suddenly and a dark frown cover he face as he see the indian woman stoop quickly down catch the pup by its hind-leg with one hand seize a heavy piece of wood with the other and strike it several violent blow on the throat without take the trouble to kill the poor animal outright the savage then hold its still writhe body over the fire in order to singe off the hair before put it into the pot to be cook the cruel act draw young varley 's attention more closely to the pup and it flash across he mind that this could be no other than young crusoe which neither he nor he companion have before see although they have often hear other speak of and describe it have the little creature be one of the unfortunate indian cur the two hunter would probably have turn from the sickening sight with disgust feeling that however much they might dislike such cruelty it would be of no use attempt to interfere with indian usage but the instant the idea that it be crusoe occur to varley he utter a yell of anger and spring towards the woman with a bind that cause the three indian to leap to they foot and grasp they tomahawk blunt do not move from the gate but throw forward he rifle with a careless motion but a expressive glance that cause the indian to resume they seat and pipe with a emphatic wah of disgust at have be startle out of they propriety by a trifle while dick varley snatch poor crusoe from he dangerous and painful position scowl angrily in the woman 's face and turn on he heel walk up to the house hold the pup tenderly in he arm joe blunt gaze after he friend with a grave solemn expression of countenance till he disappear then he look at the ground and shake he head joe be one of the regular out-and-out backwoods hunter both in appearance and in fact -- broad tall massive lion-like gifted with the hunting stalk run and trail-following power of the savage and with a superabundance of the shooting and fight power the daring and dash of the anglo-saxon he be grave too -- seldom smile and rarely laugh he expression almost at all time be a compound of seriousness and good-humour with the rifle he be a good steady shot but by no mean a crack one he ball never fail to _ hit _ but it often fail to _ kill _ after meditate a few seconds joe blunt again shake he head and mutter to himself the boy 's bold enough but he be too reckless for a hunter there be no need for that yell now -- none at all have utter this sagacious remark he throw he rifle into the hollow of he left arm turn round and stride off with a long slow step towards he own cottage blunt be a american by birth but of irish extraction and to a attentive ear there be a faint echo of the _ brogue _ in he tone which seem to have be hand down to he as a threadbare and almost worn-out heirloom poor crusoe be singe almost naked he wretched tail seem little better than a piece of wire file off to a point and he vent he misery in piteous squeak as the sympathetic varley confide he tenderly to the care of he mother how fan manage to cure he no one can tell but cure he she do for in the course of a few week crusoe be as well and sleek and fat as ever chapter ii _ a shooting-match and its consequence _ -- _ new friend introduce to the reader _ -- _ crusoe and he mother change master _ shortly after the incident narrate in the last chapter the squatter of the mustang valley lose they leader major hope suddenly announce he intention of quit the settlement and return to the civilized world private matter he say require he presence there -- matter which he do not choose to speak of but which would prevent he return again to reside among they go he must and be a man of determination go he do but before go he distribute all he goods and chattel among the settler he even give away he rifle and fan and crusoe these last however he resolve should go together and as they be well worth have he announce that he would give they to the best shot in the valley he stipulate that the winner should escort he to the nearest settlement eastward after which he might return with the rifle on he shoulder accordingly a long level piece of ground on the river 's bank with a perpendicular cliff at the end of it be select as the shooting-ground and on the appoint day at the appoint hour the competitor begin to assemble well lad first as usual exclaimed joe blunt as he reach the ground and find dick varley there before he i have bin here more than a hour lookin ' for a new kind o ' flower that jack morgan tell I he would see and i have find it too look here do you ever see one like it before blunt lean he rifle against a tree and carefully examine the flower why yes i have seed a-many o ' they up about the rocky mountain but never one here-away it seem to have go lose itself the last i seed if i remimber rightly wo near the head-water o ' the yellowstone river it wo -- jest where i shoot a grizzly bar be that the bar that give you the wipe on the cheek ask varley forget the flower in he interest about the bear it wo i put six ball in that bar 's carcass and stick my knife into its heart ten time afore it give out a ' it nearly rip the shirt off my back afore i wos do with it i would give my rifle to get a chance at a grizzly exclaimed varley with a sudden burst of enthusiasm whoever get it would not have much to brag of remark a burly young backwoodsman as he join they he remark be true for poor dick 's weapon be but a sorry affair it miss fire and it hang fire and even when it do fire it remain a matter of doubt in its owner 's mind whether the slight deviation from the direct line make by he bullet be the result of _ he _ or _ its _ bad shooting further comment upon it be check by the arrival of a dozen or more hunter on the scene of action they be a sturdy set of bronzed bold fearless man and one feel on look at they that they would prove more than a match for several hundred of indian in open fight a few minute after the major himself come on the ground with the prize rifle on he shoulder and fan and crusoe at he heel -- the latter tumble scramble and yelp after its mother fat and clumsy and happy as possible have evidently quite forget that it have be nearly roasted alive only a few week before immediately all eye be on the rifle and its merit be discuss with animation and well do it deserve discussion for such a piece have never before be see on the western frontier it be shorter in the barrel and larger in the bear than the weapon chiefly in vogue at that time and besides be of beautiful workmanship be silver-mounted but the grand peculiarity about it and that which afterwards render it the mystery of mystery to the savage be that it have two set of lock -- one percussion the other flint -- so that when cap fail by take off the one set of lock and affix the other it be convert into a flint rifle the major however take care never to run short of cap so that the flint lock be merely hold as a reserve in case of need now lad cry major hope step up to the point whence they be to shoot remember the term he who first drive the nail obtain the rifle fan and she pup and accompany I to the nearest settlement each man shoot with he own gun and draw lot for the chance agree cry the man well then wipe you gun and draw lot henrus will fix the nail here it be the individual who step or rather plunge forward to receive the nail be a rare and remarkable specimen of mankind like he comrade he be half a farmer and half a hunter like they too he be clothe in deerskin and be tall and strong -- nay more he be gigantic but unlike they he be clumsy awkward loose-jointed and a bad shot nevertheless henrus be a immense favorite in the settlement for he good-humour know no bound no one ever see he frown even when fight with the savage as he be sometimes compel to do in self-defence he go at they with a sort of jovial rage that be almost laughable inconsiderate recklessness be one of he chief characteristic so that he comrade be rather afraid of he on the war-trail or in the hunt where caution and frequently _ soundless _ motion be essential to success or safety but when henrus have a comrade at he side to check he he be safe enough be humble-minded and obedient man use to say he must have be bear under a lucky star for notwithstanding he natural inaptitude for all sort of backwoods life he manage to scramble through everything with safety often with success and sometimes with credit to see henrus stalk a deer be worth a long day 's journey joe blunt use to say he be all jint together from the top of he head to the sole of he moccasin he throw he immense form into the most inconceivable contortion and slowly wind he way sometimes on hand and knee sometimes flat through bush and brake as if there be not a bone in he body and without the slightest noise this sort of work be so much against he plunge nature that he take long to learn it but when through hard practice and the loss of many a fine deer he come at length to break himself in to it he gradually progress to perfection and ultimately become the best stalker in the valley this and this alone enable he to procure game for be short-sighted he could hit nothing beyond fifty yard except a buffalo or a barn-door yet that same lithe body which seem as though totally unhinge could no more be bent when the muscle be string than a iron post no one wrestle with henrus unless he wish to have he back broken few could equal and none could beat he at run or leap except dick varley when henrus run a race even joe blunt laugh outright for arm and leg go like independent flail when he leap he hurl himself into space with a degree of violence that seem to insure a somersault yet he always come down with a crash on he foot plunge be henri 's forte he generally lounge about the settlement when unoccupied with he hand behind he back apparently in a reverie and when call on to act he seem to fancy he must have lose time and could only make up for it by _ plunge _ this habit get he into many awkward scrape but he herculean power as often get he out of they he be a french-canadian and a particularly bad speaker of the english language we offer no apology for this elaborate introduction of henrus for he be as good-hearted a fellow as ever live and deserve special notice but to return the sort of rifle practice call drive the nail by which this match be to be decide be and we believe still be common among the hunter of the far west it consist in this : a ordinary large-headed nail be drive a short way into a plank or a tree and the hunter stand at a distance of fifty yard or so fire at it until they succeed in drive it home on the present occasion the major resolve to test they shooting by make the distance seventy yard some of the older man shake they head it be too far say one ye might as well try to snuff the nose o ' a mosquito jim scragg be the only man as 'll hit that say another the man refer to be a long lank lantern-jawed fellow with a cross-grained expression of countenance he use the long heavy kentucky rifle which from the ball be little larger than a pea be call a pea-rifle jim be no favorite and have be name scragg by he companion on account of he appearance in a few minute the lot be draw and the shooting begin each hunter wipe out the barrel of he piece with he ramrod as he step forward then place a ball in the palm of he left hand he draw the stopper of he powder-horn with he tooth and pour out as much powder as suffice to cover the bullet this be the regular _ measure _ among they little time be lose in firing for these man do not hang on they aim the point of the rifle be slowly raise to the object and the instant the sight cover it the ball speed to its mark in a few minute the nail be encircle by bullet hole scarcely two of which be more than a inch distant from the mark and one -- fire by joe blunt -- enter the tree close beside it ah joe say the major i think you would have carry off the prize so do not i sir return blunt with a shake of he head have it a-bin a half-dollar at a hundred yard i would ha ' do better but i never _ could _ hit the nail it be too small to _ see _ that be cos ye have get no eye remark jim scragg with a sneer as he step forward all tongue be now hush for the expect champion be about to fire the sharp crack of the rifle be follow by a shout for jim have hit the nail-head on the edge and part of the bullet stick to it that win if there be no better say the major scarce able to conceal he disappointment who come next to this question henrus answer by step up to the line straddle he leg and execute preliminary movement with he rifle that seem to indicate a intention on he part to throw the weapon bodily at the mark he be receive with a shout of mingled laughter and applause after gaze steadily at the mark for a few seconds a broad grin overspread he countenance and look round at he companion he say -- ha me boy i can-not behold de nail at all can ye ` behold ' the _ tree _ shout a voice when the laugh that follow this announcement have somewhat abate oh oui reply henrus quite coolly i can see _ he _ a ' a goot small bit of de forest beyond fire at it then if ye hit the tree ye desarve the rifle -- leastway ye ought to get the pup henrus grin again and fire instantly without take aim the shot be follow by a exclamation of surprise for the bullet be find close beside the nail it be more be good luck than good shootin ' remark jim scragg possiblement answer henrus modestly as he retreat to the rear and wipe out he rifle mais i have kill most of my deer by dat same goot luck bravo henrus say major hope as he pass you _ deserve _ to win anyhow who be next dick varley cry several voice where 's varley come on youngster a ' take yer shot the youth come forward with evident reluctance it be of no manner o ' use he whisper to joe blunt as he pass i can not depend on my old gun never give in whisper blunt encouragingly poor varley 's want of confidence in he rifle be merit for on pull the trigger the faithless lock miss fire lend he another gun cry several voice ` gainst rule lay down by major hope say scragg well so it be try again varley do try again and so successfully too that the ball hit the nail on the head leave a portion of the lead stick to its edge of course this be greet with a cheer and a loud dispute begin as to which be the better shot of the two there be other to shoot yet cry the major make way look out the man fall back and the few hunter who have not yet fire take they shot but without come nearer the mark it be now agree that jim scragg and dick varley be the two best shot should try over again and it be also agree that dick should have the use of blunt 's rifle lot be again draw for the first shot and it fall to dick who immediately step out aim somewhat hastily and fire hit again shout those who have run forward to examine the mark _ half _ the bullet cut off by the nail head some of the more enthusiastic of dick 's friend cheer lustily but the most of the hunter be grave and silent for they know jim 's power and feel that he would certainly do he best jim now step up to the line and look earnestly at the mark throw forward he rifle at that moment we friend crusoe tire of torment he mother waddle stupidly and innocently into the midst of the crowd of man and in so do receive henrus 's heel and the full weight of he elephantine body on its fore paw the horrible and electric yell that instantly issue from he agonized throat could only be compare as joe blunt express it to the last dyin ' screech o ' a bustin ' steam biler we can not say that the effect be startling for these backwoodsman have be bear and breed in the midst of alarm and be so use to they that a bustin ' steam biler itself unless it have blow they fairly off they leg would not have startle they but the effect such as it be be sufficient to disconcert the aim of jim scragg who fire at the same instant and miss the nail by a hair 's - breadth ` turn round in tower wrath scragg aim a kick at the poor pup which have it take effect would certainly have terminate the innocent existence of that remarkable dog on the spot but quick as lightning henrus interpose the butt of he rifle and jim 's shin meet it with a violence that cause he to howl with rage and pain oh pardon I broder cry henrus shrink back with the drollest expression of mingled pity and glee jim 's discretion on this occasion be superior to he valor he turn away with a coarse expression of anger and leave the ground meanwhile the major handed the silver rifle to young varley it could not have fall into better hand he say you 'll do it credit lad i know that full well and let I assure you it will never play you false only keep it clean do not overcharge it aim true and it will never miss the mark while the hunter crowd round dick to congratulate he and examine the piece he stand with a mingled feeling of bashfulness and delight at he unexpected good fortune recover himself suddenly he seize he old rifle and drop quietly to the outskirts of the crowd while the man be still busy handle and discuss the merit of the prize go up unobserved to a boy of about thirteen year of age and touch he on the shoulder here marston you know i often say ye should have the old rifle when i be rich enough to get a new one take it _ now _ lad it be come to ye sooner than either o ' we expect dick say the boy grasp he friend 's hand warmly ye be true as heart of oak it be good of ` ee that be a fact not a bit boy it cost I nothin ' to give away a old gun that i have no use for a 's worth little but it make I right glad to have the chance to do it marston have long for a rifle ever since he could walk but he prospects of obtain one be very poor indeed at that time and it be a question whether he do not at that moment experience as much joy in handle the old piece as he friend feel in shoulder the prize a difficulty now occur which have not before be think of this be no less than the absolute refusal of dick varley 's canine property to follow he fan have no idea of change master without she consent be ask or she inclination be consult you 'll have to tie she up for a while i fear say the major no fear answer the youth dog natur 's like human natur ' say this he seize crusoe by the neck stuff he comfortably into the bosom of he hunting-shirt and walk rapidly away with the prize rifle on he shoulder fan have not bargain for this she stand irresolute gaze now to the right and now to the leave as the major retire in one direction and dick with crusoe in another suddenly crusoe who although comfortable in body be ill at ease in spirit give utterance to a melancholy howl the mother 's love instantly prevail for one moment she prick up she ear at the sound and then lower they trot quietly after she new master and follow he to he cottage on the margin of the lake chapter iii _ speculative remark with which the reader may or may not agree -- a old woman -- hope and wish commingle with hard fact -- the dog crusoe 's education begin _ it be pleasant to look upon a serene quiet humble face on such a face do richard varley look every night when he enter he mother 's cottage mr varley be a widow and she have follow the fortune of she brother daniel hood ever since the death of she husband love for she only brother induce she to forsake the peaceful village of maryland and enter upon the wild life of a backwoods settlement dick 's mother be thin and old and wrinkled but she face be stamp with a species of beauty which _ never _ fade -- the beauty of a loving look ah the brow of snow and the peach-bloom cheek may snare the heart of man for a time but the _ loving look _ alone can forge that adamantine chain that time age eternity shall never break mistake we not reader and bear with we if we attempt to analyze this look which characterize mr varley a rare diamond be worth stop to glance at even when one be in a hurry the brightest jewel in the human heart be worth a thought or two by _ a loving _ _ look _ we do not mean a look of love bestow on a beloved object _ that _ be common enough and thankful should we be that it be so common in a world that be overfull of hatred still less do we mean that smile and look of intense affection with which some people -- good people too -- greet friend and foe alike and by which effort to work out they _ beau ideal _ of the expression of christian love they do signally damage they cause by sadden the serious and repel the gay much less do we mean that _ perpetual _ smile of good-will which argue more of personal comfort and self-love than anything else no the loving look we speak of be as often grave as gay its character depend very much on the face through which it beam and it can not be counterfeit its _ ring _ defy imitation like the clouded sun of April it can pierce through tear of sorrow like the noontide sun of summer it can blaze in warm smile like the northern light of winter it can gleam in depths of woe -- but it be always the same modify doubtless and render more or less patent to other accord to the natural amiability of he or she who bestow it no one can put it on still less can any one put it off its range be universal it embrace all mankind though _ of course _ it be intensify on a few favored object its seat be in the depths of a renew heart and its foundation lie in love to god young varley 's mother live in a cottage which be of the smallest possible dimension consistent with comfort it be make of log as indeed be all the other cottage in the valley the door be in the center and a passage from it to the back of the dwelling divide it into two room one of these be sub-divide by a thin partition the inner room be mr varley 's bedroom the outer dick 's daniel hood 's dormitory be a corner of the kitchen which apartment serve also as a parlor the room be light by two window one on each side of the door which give to the house the appearance of have a nose and two eye house of this kind have literally get a sort of _ expression _ on -- if we may use the word -- they countenance _ square _ window give the appearance of easy-going placidity _ longish _ one that of surprise mr varley 's be a surprise cottage and this be in keep with the scene in which it stand for the clear lake in front stud with island and the distant hill beyond compose a scene so surprisingly beautiful that it never fail to call forth a expression of astonished admiration from every new visitor to the mustang valley my boy exclaim mr varley as she son enter the cottage with a bind why so hurry to-day deary I where get you the grand gun win it mother win it my son ay win it mother druve the nail _ almost _ and would ha ' druve it _ altogether _ have i bin more use to joe blunt 's rifle mr varley 's heart beat high and she face flush with pride as she gaze at she son who lay the rifle on the table for she inspection while he rattle off a animated and somewhat disjointed account of the match deary I now that be good that be cliver but what be that scrape at the door oh that be fan i forget she here here fan come in good dog he cry rise and open the door fan enter and stop short evidently uncomfortable my boy what do ye with the major 's dog win she too mother win she my son ay win she and the pup too see here it be and he pluck crusoe from he bosom crusoe have find he position to be one of great comfort have fall into a profound slumber and on be thus unceremoniously awaken he give forth a yelp of discontent that bring fan in a state of frantic sympathy to he side there you be fan take it to a corner and make yourself at home -- ay that be right mother give she somethin' to eat she be hungry i know by the look o ' she eye deary I dick say mr varley who now proceed to spread the youth 's mid-day meal before he do ye drive the nail three time no only once and that not parfetly bring 'em all down at one shot -- rifle fan a ' pup well well now that be cliver but -- here the old woman pause and look grave but what mother you 'll be wantin ' to go off to the mountain now i fear I boy wantin ' _ now _ exclaim the youth earnestly i be _ always _ wantin ' i have bin wantin ' ever since i could walk but i will not go till you let I mother that i will not and he strike the table with he fist so forcibly that the platter ring again you be a good boy dick but you be too young yit to ventur ' among the redskin a ' yit if i do not ventur ' young i would better not ventur ' at all you know mother dear i do not want to leave you but i be bear to be a hunter and everybody in they part be a hunter and i can not hunt in the kitchen you know mother at this point the conversation be interrupt by a sound that cause young varley to spring up and seize he rifle and fan to show she tooth and growl hist mother that be like horse ' hoof he whisper open the door and gaze intently in the direction whence the sound come louder and louder it come until a opening in the forest show the advance cavalcade to be a party of white man in another moment they be in full view -- a band of about thirty horseman clothe in the leathern costume and arm with the long rifle of the far west some wear portion of the gaudy indian dress which give to they a brilliant dashing look they come on straight for the block-house and salute the varley with a jovial cheer as they sweep past at full speed dick return the cheer with compound interest and call out they be trapper mother i 'll be back in a hour bound off like a deer through the wood take a short cut in order to reach the block-house before they he succeed for just as he arrive at the house the cavalcade wheel round the bend in the river dash up the slope and come to a sudden halt on the green vault from they foam steed they tie they to the stockade of the little fortress which they enter in a body hot haste be in every motion of these man they be trapper they say on they way to the rocky mountain to hunt and trade fur but one of they number have be treacherously murder and scalp by a pawnee chief and they resolve to revenge he death by a attack on one of the pawnee village they would teach these red reptile to respect white man they would come of it what might and they have turn aside here to procure a additional supply of powder and lead in vain do the major endeavor to dissuade these reckless man from they purpose they scoff at the idea of return good for evil and insist on be supply the log hut be a store as well as a place of defense and as they offer to pay for it there be no refuse they request -- at least so the major think the ammunition be therefore give to they and in half-an-hour they be away again at full gallop over the plain on they mission of vengeance vengeance be mine i will repay saith the lord but these man know not what god say because they never read he word and do not own he sway young varley 's enthusiasm be considerably damp when he learn the errand on which the trapper be bent from that time forward he give up all desire to visit the mountain in company with such man but he still retain a intense longing to roam at large among they rocky fastness and gallop out upon the wide prairie meanwhile he dutifully tend he mother 's cattle and sheep and contented himself with a occasional deer-hunt in the neighbouring forest he devote himself also to the training of he dog crusoe -- a operation which at first cost he many a deep sigh every one have hear of the sagacity and almost reasoning capability of the newfoundland dog indeed some have even go the length of say that what be call instinct in these animal be neither more nor less than reason and in truth many of the noble heroic and sagacious deed that have actually be perform by newfoundland dog incline we almost to believe that like man they be gifted with reasoning power but every one do not know the trouble and patience that be require in order to get a juvenile dog to understand what its master mean when he be endeavor to instruct it crusoe 's first lesson be a interesting but not a very successful one we may remark here that dick varley have present fan to he mother to be she watch-dog resolve to devote all he power to the training of the pup we may also remark in reference to crusoe 's appearance -lrb- and we do not remark it sooner chiefly because up to this period in he eventful history he be little better than a ball of fat and hair -rrb- that he coat be mingle jet-black and pure white and remarkably glossy curly and thick a week after the shooting-match crusoe 's education begin have feed he for that period with he own hand in order to gain he affection dick take he out one sunny forenoon to the margin of the lake to give he he first lesson and here again we must pause to remark that although a dog 's heart be generally gain in the first instance through he mouth yet after it be thoroughly gain he affection be noble and disinterested he can scarcely be drive from he master 's side by blow and even when thus harshly repel be always ready on the shortest notice and with the slightest encouragement to make it up again well dick varley begin by call out crusoe crusoe come here pup of course crusoe know he name by this time for it have be so often use as a prelude to he meal that he naturally expect a feed whenever he hear it this portal to he brain have already be open for some day but all the other door be fast lock and it require a great deal of careful pick to open they now crusoe come here crusoe bound clumsily to he master 's side cock he ear and wag he tail -- so far he education be perfect we say he bound _ clumsily _ for it must be remember that he be still a very young pup with soft flabby muscle now i be goin ' to begin yer edication pup think o ' that whether crusoe thought of that or not we can not say but he look up in he master 's face as he speak cock he ear very high and turn he head slowly to one side until it could not turn any farther in that direction then he turn it as much to the other side whereat he master burst into a uncontrollable fit of laughter and crusoe immediately begin bark vociferously come come say dick suddenly check he mirth we must not play pup we must work draw a leathern mitten from he belt the youth hold it to crusoe 's nose and then throw it a yard away at the same time exclaim in a loud distinct tone fetch it crusoe enter at once into the spirit of this part of he training he dash gleefully at the mitten and proceed to worry it with intense gratification as for fetch it he neither understand the word nor care a straw about they dick varley rise immediately and rescue the mitten resume he seat on a rock come here crusoe he repeat oh certainly by all means say crusoe -- no he do not exactly _ say _ it but really he _ look _ these word so evidently that we think it right to let they stand as they be write if he could have finish the sentence he would certainly have say go on with that game over again old boy it be quite to my taste -- the jolliest thing in life i assure you at least if we may not positively assert that he would have say that no one else can absolutely affirm that he would not well dick varley do do it over again and crusoe worry the mitten over again utterly regardless of fetch it then they do it again and again and again but without the slightest apparent advancement in the path of canine knowledge and then they go home during all this try operation dick varley never once betray the slightest feeling of irritability or impatience he do not expect success at first he be not therefore disappoint at failure next day he have he out again -- and the next -- and the next -- and the next again with the like unfavourable result in short it seem at last as if crusoe 's mind have be deeply imbue with the idea that he have be bear expressly for the purpose of worry that mitten and he mean to fulfil he destiny to the letter young varley have take several small piece of meat in he pocket each day with the intention of rewarding crusoe when he should at length be prevail on to fetch the mitten but as crusoe be not aware of the treat that await he of course the mitten never be fetch at last dick varley see that this system would never do so he change he tactic and the next morning give crusoe no breakfast but take he out at the usual hour to go through he lesson this new course of conduct seem to perplex crusoe not a little for on he way down to the beach he pause frequently and look back at the cottage and then expressively up at he master 's face but the master be inexorable he go on and crusoe follow for _ true _ love have now take possession of the pup 's young heart and he prefer he master 's company to food varley now begin by let the learner smell a piece of meat which he eagerly seek to devour but be prevent to he immense disgust then the mitten be throw as heretofore and crusoe make a few step towards it but be in no mood for play he turn back fetch it say the teacher i will not reply the learner mutely by means of that expressive sign -- _ not do it _ hereupon dick varley rise take up the mitten and put it into the pup 's mouth then retire a couple of yard he hold out the piece of meat and say fetch it crusoe instantly spit out the glove and bound towards the meat -- once more to be disappoint this be do a second time and crusoe come forward _ with the mitten in he mouth _ it seem as if it have be do accidentally for he drop it before come quite up if so it be a fortunate accident for it serve as the tiny fulcrum on which to place the point of that mighty lever which be destine ere long to raise he to the pinnacle of canine erudition dick varley immediately lavish upon he the tenderest caress and give he a lump of meat but he quickly try it again lest he should lose the lesson the dog evidently feel that if he do not fetch that mitten he should have no meat or caress in order however to make sure that there be no mistake dick lay the mitten down beside the pup instead of put it into he mouth and retire a few pace cry fetch it crusoe look uncertain for a moment then he pick up the mitten and lay it at he master 's foot the lesson be learn at last dick varley tumble all the meat out of he pocket on the ground and while crusoe make a hearty breakfast he sit down on a rock and whistle with glee at have fairly pick the lock and open _ another _ door into one of the many chamber of he dog 's intellect chapter iv _ we hero enlarged upon -- grump _ two year pass away the mustang valley settlement advance prosperously despite one or two attack make upon it by the savage who be however firmly repel dick varley have now become a man and he pup crusoe have become a full-grown dog the silver rifle as dick 's weapon have come to be name be well know among the hunter and the redskin of the border-land and in dick 's hand its bullet be as deadly as its owner 's eye be quick and true crusoe 's education too have be complete faithfully and patiently have he young master train he mind until he fit he to be a meet companion in the hunt to carry and fetch be now but trifling portion of the dog 's accomplishment he could dive a fathom deep in the lake and bring up any article that might have be drop or throw in he swimming power be marvellous and so powerful be he muscle that he seem to spurn the water while pass through it with he broad chest high out of the curl wave at a speed that neither man nor beast could keep up with for a moment he intellect now be sharp and quick as a needle he never require a second bidding when dick go out hunting he use frequently to drop a mitten or a powder-horn unknown to the dog and after walk mile away from it would stop short and look down into the mild gentle face of he companion crusoe he say in the same quiet tone with which he would have address a human friend i have drop my mitten go fetch it pup dick continue to call it pup from habit one glance of intelligence pass from crusoe 's eye and in a moment he be away at full gallop nor do he rest until the lose article be lie at he master 's foot dick be loath to try how far back on he track crusoe would run if desire he have often go back five and six mile at a stretch but he power do not stop here he could carry article back to the spot from which they have be take and leave they there he could head the game that he master be pursue and turn it back and he would guard any object he be desire to watch with unflinching constancy but it would occupy too much space and time to enumerate all crusoe 's quality and power he biography will unfold they in personal appearance he be majestic have grow to a immense size even for a newfoundland have he visage be at all wolfish in character he aspect would have be terrible but he possess in a eminent degree that mild humble expression of face peculiar to he race when rouse or excite and especially when bound through the forest with the chase in view he be absolutely magnificent at other time he gait be slow and he seem to prefer a quiet walk with dick varley to anything else under the sun but when dick be incline to be boisterous crusoe 's tail and ear rise at a moment 's notice and he be ready for anything moreover he obey command instantly and implicitly in this respect he put to shame most of the boy of the settlement who be by no means famed for they habit of prompt obedience crusoe 's eye be constantly watch the face of he master when dick say go he go when he say come he come if he have be in the midst of a excited bind at the throat of a stag and dick have call out down crusoe he would have sink to the earth like a stone no doubt it take many month of training to bring the dog to this state of perfection but dick accomplish it by patience perseverance and _ love _ besides all this crusoe could speak he speak by means of the dog 's dumb alphabet in a way that defy description he converse so to speak with he extremity -- he head and he tail but he eye he soft brown eye be the chief medium of communication if ever the language of the eye be carry to perfection it be exhibit in the person of crusoe but indeed it would be difficult to say which part of he expressive face express most -- the cocked ear of expectation the drooped ear of sorrow the bright full eye of joy the half-closed eye of contentment and the frown eye of indignation accompany with a slight a very slight pucker of the nose and a gleam of dazzling ivory -- ha no enemy ever see this last piece of canine language without a full appreciation of what it mean then as to the tail -- the modulation of meaning in the varied wag of that expressive member -- oh it be useless to attempt description mortal man can not conceive of the delicate shades of sentiment expressible by a dog 's tail unless he have study the subject -- the wag the waggle the cock the droop the slope the wriggle away with description -- it be impotent and valueless here as we have say crusoe be meek and mild he have be bite on the sly by half the ill-natured cur in the settlement and have only show he tooth in return he have no enmity -- though several enemy -- and he have a thousand friend particularly among the rank of the weak and the persecute whom he always protect and avenge when opportunity offer a single instance of this kind will serve to show he character one day dick and crusoe be sit on a rock beside the lake -- the same identical rock near which when a pup the latter have receive he first lesson they be converse as usual for dick have elicit such a fund of intelligence from the dog 's mind and have inject such wealth of wisdom into it that he feel convinced it understand every word he say this be capital weather crusoe be not it pup crusoe make a motion with he head which be quite as significant as a nod ha my pup i wish that you and i might go and have a slap at the grizzly bar and a look at the rocky mountain would not it be nut pup crusoe look dubious what you do not agree with I now tell I pup would not ye like to grip a bar still crusoe look dubious but make a gentle motion with he tail as though he would have say i have see neither rocky mountain nor grizzly bar and know nothin ' about 'em but i be open to conviction you be a brave pup rejoin dick stroke the dog 's huge head affectionately i would not give you for ten time you weight in golden dollar -- if there be sich thing crusoe make no reply whatever to this he regard it as a truism unworthy of notice he evidently feel that a comparison between love and dollar be preposterous at this point in the conversation a little dog with a lame leg hobble to the edge of the rock in front of the spot where dick be seat and look down into the water which be deep there whether it do so for the purpose of admire its very plain visage in the liquid mirror or find out what be go on among the fish we can not say as it never tell we but at that moment a big clumsy savage-looking dog rush out from the neighbouring thicket and begin to worry it punish he crusoe say dick quickly crusoe make one bind that a lion might have be proud of and seize the aggressor by the back lift he off he leg and hold he howl in the air -- at the same time cast a look towards he master for further instruction pitch he in say dick make a sign with he hand crusoe turn and quietly drop the dog into the lake have regard he struggle there for a few moment with grave severity of countenance he walk slowly back and sit down beside he master the little dog make good its retreat as fast as three leg would carry it and the surly dog have swum ashore retire sulkily with he tail very much between he leg little wonder then that crusoe be beloved by great and small among the well-disposed of the canine tribe of the mustang valley but crusoe be not a mere machine when not actively engage in dick varley 's service he busy himself with private little matter of he own he undertake modest little excursion into the wood or along the margin of the lake sometimes alone but more frequently with a little friend whose whole heart and be seem to be swallow up in admiration of he big companion whether crusoe botanize or geologize on these excursion we will not venture to say assuredly he seem as though he do both for he poke he nose into every bush and tuft of moss and turn over the stone and dig hole in the ground -- and in short if he do not understand these science he behave very much as if he do certainly he know as much about they as many of the human species do in these walk he never take the slightest notice of grump -lrb- that be the little dog 's name -rrb- but grump make up for this by take excessive notice of he when crusoe stop grump stop and sit down to look at he when crusoe trot on grump trot on too when crusoe examine a bush grump sit down to watch he and when he dig a hole grump look into it to see what be there grump never help he he sole delight be in look on they do not converse much these two dog to be in each other 's company seem to be happiness enough -- at least grump think so there be one point at which grump stop short however and cease to follow he friend and that be when he rush headlong into the lake and disport himself for a hour at a time in its cool water crusoe be both by nature and training a splendid water-dog grump on the contrary held water in abhorrence so he sit on the shore of the lake disconsolate when he friend be bathing and wait till he come out the only time when grump be thoroughly nonplussed be when dick varley 's whistle sound faintly in the far distance then crusoe would prick up he ear and stretch out at full gallop clearing ditch and fence and brake with he strong elastic bind and leave grump to patter after he as fast as he four-inch leg would carry he poor grump usually arrive at the village to find both dog and master go and would betake himself to he own dwelling there to lie down and sleep and dream perchance of ramble and gambol with he gigantic friend chapter v _ a mission of peace -- unexpected joy -- dick and crusoe set off for the land of the redskin and meet with adventure by the way as a matter of course -- night in the wild wood _ one day the inhabitant of mustang valley be throw into considerable excitement by the arrival of a officer of the united state army and a small escort of cavalry they go direct to the blockhouse which since major hope 's departure have become the residence of joe blunt -- that worthy have by general consent be deem the fittest man in the settlement to fill the major 's place soon it begin to be noised abroad that the stranger have be send by government to endeavor to bring about if possible a more friendly state of feeling between the whites and the indian by means of present and promise and fair speech the party remain all night in the block-house and ere long it be report that joe blunt have be request and have consent to be the leader and chief of a party of three man who should visit the neighbouring tribe of indian to the west and north of the valley as government agent joe 's knowledge of two or three different indian dialect and he well-known sagacity render he a most fitting messenger on such a errand it be also whisper that joe be to have the choosing of he comrade in this mission and many be the opinion express and guess make as to who would be choose that same evening dick varley be sit in he mother 's kitchen clean he rifle he mother be prepare supper and talk quietly about the obstinacy of a particular hen that have take to lay she egg in place where they could not be find fan be coil up in a corner sound asleep and crusoe be sit at one side of the fire look on at thing in general i wonder remark mr varley as she spread the table with a pure white napkin -- i wonder what the sodger be doin ' wus ' joe blunt as often happen when a individual be mention the worthy refer to open the door at that moment and step into the room good e ` en t ` ye dame say the stout hunter doff he cap and rest he rifle in a corner while dick rise and place a chair for he the same to you master blunt answer the widow you have jist come in good time for a cut o ' venison thanks mistress i s ` pose we be beholden to the silver rifle for that to the hand that aim it rather suggest the widow nay then say raither to the dog that turn it say dick varley but for crusoe that buck would ha ' bin couch in the wood this night oh if it come to that retort joe i

sodger that be eatin ' buffalo tongue up at the block-house as if they would niver eat meat before and do not hope to eat again for a twelvemonth -- ay what o ' they interrupted mr varley i have bin

soon a ' i thank he that you first visit to the redskin will be on a errand o ' peace ` bless be the peace-maker : for they shall be call the child of god ' dick grasp he mother 's hand and press it to he cheek in silence at the same moment crusoe see that the deeper feeling of he master be touch and deem it he duty to sympathize rise up and thrust he nose against he ah pup cry the young man hastily you must go too -- of course crusoe go joe blunt hum i do not know that there be no dependin ' on a dog to keep he tongue quiet in time o ' danger believe I exclaim dick flash with enthusiasm

block-house at daybreak to-morrow -- good luck to ye mistress till we meet agin joe blunt rise and take up he rifle -- without which he scarcely ever move a foot from he own door -- leave the cottage with rapid stride my son say mr varley kiss dick 's cheek as he resume he seat put this in the little pocket i make for it in you hunting-shirt she hand he a small pocket bible dear mother he say as he place the book carefully within the breast of he coat the redskin that take that from I must take my scalp first but do not fear for I you have often say the lord would protect I so he will mother for sure it be a errand o ' peace ay that be it that be it murmur the widow in a half-soliloquy dick varley spend that night in converse with he mother and next morning at daybreak he be at the place of meeting mount on he sturdy little horse with the silver rifle on he shoulder and crusoe by he side that be right lad that be right nothin ' like keepin ' yer time say joe as he lead out a pack-horse from the gate of the block-house while he own charger be hold ready saddle by a man name daniel brand who have be appoint to the charge of the block-house in he absence where 's henrus -- oh here he come exclaim dick as the hunter refer to come thunder up the slope at a charge on a horse that resemble its rider in size and not a little in clumsiness of appearance ah me boy he be a goot one to go cry henrus remark dick 's smile as he pull up no hoss on de plain can beat dis one surement now then henri lend a hand to fix this pack we have no time to palaver by this time they be join by several of the soldier and a few hunter who have come to see they start remember joe say one if you do not come back in three month we 'll all come out in a band to seek you if we do not come back in less than that time what be left o ' we will not be worth seekin ' for say joe tighten the girth of he saddle put a bit in yer own mouth henrus cry another as the canadian arrange he steed 's bridle yell need it more than yer horse when ye git ` mong the red reptile vraiment if mon mout ' need one bit yours will need one padlock now lad mount cry joe blunt as he vault into the saddle dick varley spring lightly on he horse and henrus make a rush at he steed and hurl he huge frame across its back with a violence that ought to have bring it to the ground but the tall raw-boned broad-chested roan be accustom to the eccentricity of its master and stand the shock bravely be appoint to lead the pack-horse henrus seize its halter then the three cavalier shake they rein and wave they hand to they comrade they spring into the wood at full gallop and lay they course for the far west for some time they gallop side by side in silence each occupy with he own thought crusoe keep close beside he master 's horse the two elder hunter evidently ruminate on the object of they mission and the prospects of success for they countenance be grave and they eye cast on the ground dick varley too think upon the red-men but he musing be deeply tinged with the bright hue of a _ first _ adventure the mountain the plain the indian the bear the buffalo and a thousand other object dance wildly before he mind 's eye and he blood career through he vein and flush he forehead as he think of what he should see and do and feel the elastic vigor of youth respond in sympathy to the light spring of he active little steed he be a lover of nature too and he flash eye glance observantly from side to side as they sweep along -- sometimes through glade of forest tree sometimes through belt of more open ground and shrubbery anon by the margin of a stream or along the shore of a little lake and often over short stretch of flowering prairie-land -- while the firm elastic turf send up a muffle sound from the tramp of they mettlesome charger it be a scene of wild luxuriant beauty that might almost -lrb- one could fancy -rrb- have draw involuntary homage to its bountiful creator from the lip even of a infidel after a time joe blunt rein up and they proceed at a easy ambling pace joe and he friend henrus be so use to these beautiful scene that they have long cease to be enthusiastically affect by they though they never cease to delight in they i hope say joe that they sodger 'll go they way soon i have no notion o ' they chap when they be leave at a place wus ' nothin ' to do but whittle stick why joe exclaim dick varley in a tone of surprise i think you be admirin ' the beautiful face o ' nature all this time and ye be only thinkin ' about the sodger now that be strange not so strange after all lad answer joe when a man 's use to a thing he git to admire a ' enjoy it without speakin ' much about it but it _ be _ true boy that mankind git in coorse o ' time to think little o ' the blissin 's he be use to oui c'est _ vraus _ murmur henrus emphatically well joe blunt it may be so but i be thankful _ i be _ not use to this sort o ' thing yet exclaim varley let 's have another gallop -- so ho come along crusoe shout the youth as he shake he rein and fly over a long stretch of prairie on which at that moment they enter joe smile as he follow he enthusiastic companion but after a short run he pull up hold on youngster he cry ye must larn to do as ye be bid lad it be trouble enough to be among wild injun and wild buffalo as i hope soon to be without havin ' wild comrade to look after dick laugh and rein in he pant horse i 'll be as obedient as crusoe he say and no one can beat he besides continue joe the horse will not travel far if we begin by runnin ' all the wind out o ' they wah exclaimed henrus as the lead horse become restive i think we must give to he de pack-hoss for to lead eh not a bad notion henri we 'll make that the penalty of runnin ' off again so look out master dick i be down reply dick with a modest air obedient as a baby and will not run off again -- till -- the next time by the way joe how many day ' provision do ye bring two that be ` nough to carry we to the great prairie which be three week distant from this we own good rifle must make up the difference and keep we when we get there and s ` pose we neither find deer nor buffalo suggest dick i s ` pose we 'll have to starve dat be cumfer ` able to tink upon remark henrus more comfortable to think o ' than to undergo say dick but i s ` pose there be little chance o ' that well not much reply joe blunt pat he horse 's neck but d'ye see lad ye niver can count for sartin on anythin ' the deer and buffalo ought to be thick in they plain at this time -- and when the buffalo _ be _ thick they cover the plain till ye can hardly see the end o ' they but ye see sometimes the rascally redskin take it into they head to burn the prairie and sometimes ye find the place that should ha ' bin black wus ' buffalo black as a coal wus ' fire for mile a ' mile on end at other time the redskin go huntin ' in ` ticlur place and sweep they clean o ' every hoof that do not git away sometimes too the animal seem to take a scunner at a place and keep out o ' the way but one way or another man gin ' rally manage to scramble through look yonder joe exclaim dick point to the summit of a distant ridge where a small black object be see move against the sky that be a deer be not it joe shaded he eye with he hand and gaze earnestly at the object in question ye be right boy and by good luck we have get the wind of he cut in a ' take you chance now there be a long strip o ' wood as 'll let ye git close to he before the sentence be well finish dick and crusoe be off at full gallop for a few hundred yard they course along the bottom of a hollow then turn to the right they enter the strip of wood and in a few minute gain the edge of it here dick dismount you can not help I here crusoe stay where you be pup and hold my horse crusoe seize the end of the line which be fasten to the horse 's nose in he mouth and lay down on a hillock of moss submissively place he chin on he forepaw and watch he master as he step noiselessly through the wood in a few minute dick emerge from among the tree and creep from bush to bush succeed in get to within six hundred yard of the deer which be a beautiful little antelope beyond the bush behind which he now crouch all be bare open ground without a shrub or a hillock large enough to conceal the hunter there be a slight undulation in the ground however which enable he to advance about fifty yard farther by means of lie down quite flat and work himself forward like a serpent farther than this he could not move without be see by the antelope which browse on the ridge before he in fancied security the distance be too great even for a long shot but dick know of a weak point in this little creature 's nature which enable he to accomplish he purpose -- a weak point which it share in common with animal of a higher order -- namely curiosity the little antelope of the north american prairie be intensely curious about everything that it do not quite understand and will not rest satisfied until it have endeavor to clear up the mystery avail himself of this propensity dick do what both indian and hunter be accustom to do on these occasion -- he put a piece of rag on the end of he ramrod and keep he person conceal and perfectly still wave this miniature flag in the air the antelope notice it at once and prick up its ear begin to advance timidly and slowly step by step to see what remarkable phenomenon it could be in a few seconds the flag be lower a sharp crack follow and the antelope fall dead upon the plain ha boy that be a good supper anyhow cry joe as he gallop up and dismount goot dat be better nor dry meat add henrus give he to I i will put he on my hoss vich be strongar dan yourn but ver be you hoss he 'll be here in a minute reply dick put he finger to he mouth and give forth a shrill whistle the instant crusoe hear the sound he make a savage and apparently uncalled-for dash at the horse 's heel this wild act so contrary to the dog 's gentle nature be a mere piece of act he know that the horse would not advance without get a fright so he give he one in this way which send he off at a gallop crusoe follow close at he heel so as to bring the line alongside of the nag 's body and thereby prevent its get entangled but despite he best effort the horse get on one side of a tree and he on the other so he wisely let go he hold of the line and wait till more open ground enable he to catch it again then he hang heavily back gradually check the horse 's speed and finally trot he up to he master 's side ` tis a cliver cur good sooth exclaim joe blunt in surprise ah joe you have not see much of crusoe yet he be as good as a man any day i have do little else but train he for two year go by and he can do most anything but shoot -- he can not handle the rifle nohow ha then i tink perhaps him could if he wo try say henrus plunge on to he horse with a laugh and arrange the carcass of the antelope across the pommel of he saddle thus they hunt and gallop and trot and amble on through wood and plain all day until the sun begin to descend below the tree-top of the bluff on the west then joe blunt look about he for a place on which to camp and finally fix on a spot under the shadow of a noble birch by the margin of a little stream the carpet of grass on its bank be soft like green velvet and the ripple water of the brook be clear as crystal -- very different from the muddy missourus into which it flow while dick varley fell and cut up firewood henrus unpack the horse and turn they loose to graze and joe kindle the fire and prepared venison steak and hot tea for supper in excursion of this kind it be customary to hobble the horse -- that be to tie they fore-leg together so that they can not run either fast or far but be free enough to amble about with a clumsy sort of hop in search of food this be deem a sufficient check on they tendency to roam although some of the know horse sometimes learn to hop so fast with they hobble as to give they owner much trouble to recapture they but when out in the prairie where indian be know or suppose to be in the neighborhood the horse be picket by means of a pin or stake attach to the end of they long lariat as well as hobble for indian deem it no disgrace to steal or tell lie though they think it disgraceful to be find out in do either and so expert be these dark-skinned native of the western prairie that they will creep into the midst of a enemy 's camp cut the lariat and hobble of several horse spring suddenly on they back and gallop away they not only steal from white man but tribe that be at enmity steal from each other and the boldness with which they do this be most remarkable when indian be travel in a country where enemy be prowl they guard they camp at night with jealous care the horse in particular be both hobble and picket and sentry be post all round the camp yet in spite of these precaution hostile indian manage to elude the sentry and creep into the camp when a thief thus succeed in effect a entrance he chief danger be past he rise boldly to he foot and wrap he blanket or buffalo robe round he he walk up and down as if he be a member of the tribe at the same time he dexterously cut the lariat of such horse as he observe be not hobble he dare not stoop to cut the hobble as the action would be observe and suspicion would be instantly arouse he then leap on the best horse he can find and utter a terrific war-whoop dart away into the plain drive the loosen horse before he no such dark thief be suppose to be near the camp under the birch-tree however so joe and dick and henrus eat they supper in comfort and let they horse browse at will on the rich pasturage a bright ruddy fire be soon kindle which create as it be a little ball of light in the midst of surround darkness for the special use of we hardy hunter within this magic circle all be warm comfortable and cheery outside all be dark and cold and dreary by contrast when the substantial part of supper be dispose of tea and pipe be introduce and conversation begin to flow then the three saddle be place in a row each hunter wrap himself in he blanket and pillow he head on he saddle stretch he foot towards the fire and go to sleep with he loaded rifle by he side and he hunting-knife handy in he belt crusoe mount guard by stretch himself out _ couchant _ at dick varley 's side the faithful dog sleep lightly and never move all night but have any one observe he closely he would have see that every fitful flame that burst from the sink fire every unusual puff of wind and every motion of the horse that feed or rest hard by have the effect of reveal a speck of glitter white in crusoe 's watchful eye chapter vi _ the great prairie of the far west _ -- _ a remarkable colony discover and a miserable night endure _ of all the hour of the night or day the hour that succeed the dawn be the purest the most joyous and the best at least so think we and so think hundred and thousand of the human family and so think dick varley as he spring suddenly into a sit posture next morning and throw he arm with a exult feeling of delight round the neck of crusoe who instantly sit up to greet he this be a unusual piece of enthusiasm on the part of dick but the dog receive it with marked satisfaction rub he big hairy cheek against that of he young master and arise from he sedentary position in order to afford free scope for the use of he tail ho joe blunt henrus up boy up the sun will have the start o ' we i 'll catch the nag so say dick bound away into the wood with crusoe gambolling joyously at he heel dick soon catch he own horse and crusoe catch joe 's then the former mount and quickly bring in the other two return to the camp he find everything packed and ready to strap on the back of the pack-horse that be the way to do it lad cry joe here henri look alive and git yer beast ready i do believe ye be goin ' to take another snooze henrus be indeed at that moment indulge in a gigantic stretch and a cavernous yawn but he finish both hastily and rush at he poor horse as if he intend to slay it on the spot he only throw the saddle on its back however and then throw himself on the saddle now then all ready ay -- ouus yi and away they go at full stretch again on they journey thus day after day they travel and night after night they lay they down to sleep under the tree of the forest until at length they reach the edge of the great prairie it be a great a memorable day in the life of dick varley that on which he first behold the prairie -- the vast boundless prairie he have hear of it talk of it dream about it but he have never -- no he have never realize it ` tis always thus we conception of thing that we have not see be almost invariably wrong dick 's eye glitter and he heart swell and he cheek flush and he breath come thick and quick there it be he gasp as the great rolling plain break suddenly on he enraptured gaze that be it -- oh -- dick utter a yell that would have do credit to the fiercest chief of the pawnee and be unable to utter another word he swing he cap in the air and spring like a arrow from a bow over the mighty ocean of grass the sun have just rise to send a flood of golden glory over the scene the horse be fresh so the elder hunter gladden by the beauty of all around they and inspire by the irresistible enthusiasm of they young companion give the rein to the horse and fly after he it be a glorious gallop that first headlong dash over the boundless prairie of the far west the prairie have often be compare most justly to the ocean there be the same wide circle of space bound on all side by the horizon there be the same swell or undulation or succession of long low unbroken wave that mark the ocean when it be calm they be canopy by the same pure sky and sweep by the same untrammelled breeze there be island too -- clump of tree and willow-bush -- which rise out of this grassy ocean to break and relieve its uniformity and these vary in size and number as do the isle of ocean be numerous in some place while in other they be so scarce that the traveller do not meet one in a long day 's journey thousand of beautiful flower deck the greensward and number of little bird hop about among they now lad say joe blunt rein up we trouble begin to-day we trouble -- we joy you mean exclaimed dick varley p ` r ` aps i do not mean nothin ' o ' the sort retort joe man wo never intend to swaller he joy without a strong mixtur ' o ' trouble i s ` pose he could not stand 'em pure ye see we have get to the prairie now -- one blind hoss might see dat interrupted henrus a ' we may or may not diskiver buffalo a ' water 's scarce too so we 'll need to look out for it pretty sharp i guess else we 'll lose we horse in which case we may as well give out at once besides there be rattlesnake about in sandy place we 'll ha ' to look out for they a ' there be badger hole we 'll need to look sharp for they lest the horse put they foot in 'em a ' there be injun who 'll look out pretty sharp for _ we _ if they once get wind that we be in they part oui yi me boy and there be rain and tunder and lightin ' add henrus point to a dark cloud which be see rise on the horizon ahead of they it 'll be rain remark joe but there be no thunder in the air jist now we 'll make for yonder clump o ' bush and lay by till it be past turn a little to the right of the course they have be follow the hunter gallop along one of the hollow between the prairie wave before mention in the direction of a clump of willow before reach it however they pass over a bleak and barren plain where there be neither flower nor bird here they be suddenly arrest by a most extraordinary sight -- at least it be so to dick varley who have never see the like before this be a colony of what joe call prairie-dog on first behold they crusoe utter a sort of half growl half bark of surprise cock he tail and ear and instantly prepare to charge but he glance up at he master first for permission observe that he finger and he look command silence he drop he tail at once and step to the rear he do not however cease to regard the prairie-dog with intense curiosity these remarkable little creature have be egregiously misnamed by the hunter of the west for they bear not the slightest resemblance to dog either in formation or habit they be in fact the marmot and in size be little larger than squirrel which animal they resemble in some degree they burrow under the light soil and throw it up in mound like mole thousand of they be run about among they dwelling when dick first behold they but the moment they catch sight of the horseman rise over the ridge they set up a tremendous hubbub of consternation each little beast instantly mount guard on the top of he house and prepare as it be to receive cavalry the most ludicrous thing about they be that although the most timid and cowardly creature in the world they seem the most impertinent thing that ever live know that they hole afford they a perfectly safe retreat they sit close beside they and as the hunter slowly approach they elevate they head wag they little tail show they tooth and chatter at they like monkey the nearer they come the more angry and furious do the prairie-dog become until dick varley almost fall off he horse with suppress laughter they let the hunter come close up wax louder and louder in they wrath but the instant a hand be raise to throw a stone or point a gun a thousand little head dive into a thousand hole and a thousand little tail wriggle for a instant in the air -- then a dead silence reign over the desert scene bien they 's have dive into de bo ' - el of de eart ' say henrus with a broad grin presently a thousand nose appear and nervously disappear like the wink of a eye then they appear again and a thousand pair of eye follow instantly like jack in the box they be all on the top of they hillock again chatter and wag they little tail as vigorously as ever you could not say that you _ saw _ they jump out of they hole suddenly as if by magic they _ be _ out then dick toss up he arm and suddenly as if by magic they be go they number be incredible and they city be full of riotous activity what they occupation be the hunter could not ascertain but it be perfectly evident that they visit a great deal and gossip tremendously for they run about from house to house and sit chat in group but it be also observe that they never go far from they own house each seem to have a circle of acquaintance in the immediate neighborhood of he own residence to which in case of sudden danger he always flee but another thing about these prairie-dog -lrb- perhaps consider they size we should call they prairie-doggie -rrb- another thing about they we say be that each doggie live with a owl or more correctly a owl live with each doggie this be such a extraordinary _ fact _ that we could scarce hope that man would believe we be we statement not support by dozen of trustworthy traveller who have visit and write about these region the whole plain be cover with these owl each hole seem to be the residence of a owl and a doggie and these incongruous couple live together apparently in perfect harmony we have not be able to ascertain from traveller _ why _ the owl have go to live with these doggie so we beg humbly to offer we own private opinion to the reader we assume then that owl find it absolutely needful to have hole probably prairie-owl can not dig hole for themselves have discover however a race of little creature that could they very likely determine to take forcible possession of the hole make by they find no doubt that when they do so the doggie be too timid to object and discover moreover that they be sweet innocent little creature the owl resolve to take they into partnership and so the thing be settle -- that be how it come about no doubt of it there be a report that rattlesnake live in these hole also but we can not certify we reader of the truth of this still it be well to be acquaint with a report that be current among the man of the backwoods if it be true we be of opinion that the doggie 's family be the most miscellaneous and remarkable on the face of -- or as henrus say in the bo ' - el of the earth dick and he friend be so deeply absorb in watch these curious little creature that they do not observe the rapid spread of the black cloud over the sky a few heavy drop of rain now warn they to seek shelter so wheeling round they dash off at full speed for the clump of willow which they gain just as the rain begin to descend in torrent now lad do it slick off pack and saddle cry joe blunt jump from he horse i 'll make a hut for ye right off a hut joe what sort o ' hut can ye make here inquire dick ye 'll see boy in a minute ach lend I a hand here dick de bockle be tight as de hoss 's own skin ah dere all right hallo what be this exclaimed dick as crusoe advance with something in he mouth i declare it be a bird o ' some sort a prairie-hen remark joe as crusoe lay the bird at dick 's foot capital for supper ah dat chien be superb goot dog come here i vill clap you but crusoe refuse to be caress meanwhile joe and dick form a sort of beehive-looking hut by bend down the stem of a tall bush and thrust they point into the ground over this they throw the largest buffalo robe and place another on the ground below it on which they lay they pack of goods these they further secure against wet by place several robe over they and a skin of parchment then they sit down on this pile to rest and consider what should be do next ` tis a bad look-out say joe shake he head i fear it be reply dick in a melancholy tone henrus say nothing but he sigh deeply on look up at the sky which be now of a uniform watery gray while black cloud drive athwart it the rain be pour in torrent and the wind begin to sweep it in broad sheet over the plain and under they slight cover so that in a short time they be wet to the skin the horse stand meekly beside they with they tail and head equally pendulous and crusoe sit before he master look at he with a expression that seem to say could not you put a stop to this if you be to try this 'll never do i 'll try to git up a fire say dick jump up in desperation ye may save yerself the trouble remark joe dryly -- at least as dryly as be possible in the circumstance however dick do try but he fail signally everything be soak and saturate there be no large tree most of the bush be green and the dead one be soak the covering be slobbery the skin they sit on be slobbery the earth itself be slobbery so dick throw he blanket -lrb- which be also slobbery -rrb- round he shoulder and sit down beside he companion to grin and bear it as for joe and henrus they be old hand and accustom to such circumstance from the first they have resign themselves to they fate and wrap they wet blanket round they sit down side by side wisely to endure the evil that they could not cure there be a old rhyme by whom compose we know not and it matter little which run thus -- for every evil under the sun there be a remedy -- or there be none if there be -- try and find it if there be not -- never mind it there be deep wisdom here in small compass the principle involve deserve to be heartily recommend dick never hear of the line but he know the principle well so he begin to never mind it by sit down beside he companion and whistle vociferously as the wind render this a difficult feat he take to singing instead after that he say let 's eat a bite joe and then go to bed be all means say joe who produce a mass of dry deer 's meat from a wallet it be cold grub say dick and tough but the hunter ' tooth be sharp and strong so they eat a hearty supper and wash it down with a drink of rain water collect from a pool on the top of they hut they now try to sleep for the night be advance and it be so dark that they could scarce see they hand when hold up before they face they sit back to back and thus in the form of a tripod begin to snooze joe 's and henrus 's seasoned frame would have remain stiff as post till morning but dick 's body be young and pliant so he have not be asleep a few seconds when he fall forward into the mud and effectually awaken the other joe give a grunt and henrus exclaim hah but dick be too sleepy and miserable to say anything crusoe however rise up to show he sympathy and lay he wet head on he master 's knee as he resume he place this catastrophe happen three time in the space of a hour and by the third time they be all awaken up so thoroughly that they give up the attempt to sleep and amuse each other by recount they hunting experience and tell story so engross do they become that day break sooner than they have expect and just in proportion as the gray light of dawn rise higher into the eastern sky do the spirit of these weary man rise within they soak body chapter vii _ the wallering peculiarity of buffalo bull -- the first buffalo hunt and its consequence -- crusoe come to the rescue -- pawnee discover -- a monster buffalo hunt -- joe act the part of ambassador _ fortunately the day that succeed the dreary night describe in the last chapter be warm and magnificent the sun rise in a blaze of splendor and fill the atmosphere with steam from the moist earth the unfortunate in the wet camp be not slow to avail themselves of he cheer ray they hang up everything on the bush to dry and by dint of extreme patience and cut out the comparatively dry heart of several piece of wood they light a fire and boil some rain-water which be soon convert into soup this and the exercise necessary for the performance of these several duty warm and partially dry they so that when they once more mount they steed and ride away they be in a state of comparative comfort and in excellent spirit the only annoyance be the cloud of mosquito and large fly that assail man and horse whenever they check they speed i tell ye wot it be say joe blunt one fine morning about a week after they have begin to cross the prairie it be my ` pinion that we 'll come on buffalo soon they track be fresh a ' yonder 's one o ' they waller that be bin use not long agone i 'll go have a look at it cry dick trot away as he speak everything in these vast prairie be new to dick varley and he be keep in a constant state of excitement during the first week or two of he journey it be true he be quite familiar with the name and habit of all the animal that dwell there for many a time and oft have he listen to the yarn of the hunter and trapper of the mustang valley when they return laden with rich fur from they periodical hunting expedition but this knowledge of he only serve to whet he curiosity and he desire to _ see _ the denizen of the prairie with he own eye and now that he wish be accomplish it greatly increase the pleasure of he journey dick have just reach the wallow refer to by joe blunt and have rein up he steed to observe it leisurely when a faint hissing sound reach he ear look quickly back he observe he two companion crouch on the neck of they horse and slowly descend into a hollow of the prairie in front of they as if they wish to bring the rise ground between they and some object in advance dick instantly follow they example and be soon at they heel ye need not look at the waller whisper joe for a ' tother side o ' the ridge there be a bull _ wallerin _ ' ye do not mean it exclaim dick as they all dismount and picket they horse to the plain ouus say henrus tumble off he horse while a broad grin overspread he good-natured countenance it be one fact one buffalo bull be wollerin ' like a enormerous hog also dere be t ` ousand o ' buffalo farder on can ye trust yer dog keepin ' back inquire joe with a dubious glance at crusoe trust he ay i wish i be as sure o ' myself look to yer primin ' then a ' we 'll have tongue and marrow bone for supper to-night i ` se warrant hist down on yer knee and go softly we might ha ' run they down on horseback but it be bad to wind yer beast on a trip like this if ye can help it a ' it be about as easy to stalk they leastway we 'll try lift yer head slowly dick a ' do not show more nor the half o ' t above the ridge dick elevate he head as direct and the scene that meet he view be indeed well calculate to send a electric shock to the heart of a ardent sportsman the vast plain beyond be absolutely blacken with countless herd of buffalo which be browse on the rich grass they be still so far distant that they bellowing and the trampling of they myriad hoof only reach the hunter like a faint murmur on the breeze in the immediate foreground however there be a group of about half-a-dozen buffalo cow feed quietly and in the midst of they a enormous old bull be enjoy himself in he wallow the animal towards which we hunter now creep with murderous intent be the fiercest and the most ponderous of the ruminate inhabitant of the western wilderness the name of _ buffalo _ however be not correct the animal be the _ bison _ and bear no resemblance whatever to the buffalo proper but as the hunter of the far west and indeed traveller generally have adopt the misnomer we bow to the authority of custom and adopt it too buffalo roam in countless thousand all over the north american prairie from the hudson bay territory north of canada to the shore of the gulf of mexico the advance of white man to the west have drive they to the prairie between the missourus and the rocky mountain and have somewhat diminish they number but even thus diminish they be still innumerable in the more distant plain they color be dark brown but it vary a good deal with the season the hair or fur from its great length in winter and spring and exposure to the weather turn quite light but when the winter coat be shed off the new growth be a beautiful dark brown almost approach to jet-black in form the buffalo somewhat resemble the ox but its head and shoulder be much larger and be cover with a profusion of long shaggy hair which add greatly to the fierce aspect of the animal it have a large hump on the shoulder and its fore-quarter be much larger in proportion than the hind-quarter the horn be short and thick the hoof be cloven and the tail be short with a tuft of hair at the extremity it be scarcely possible to conceive a wilder or more ferocious and terrible monster than a buffalo bull he often grow to the enormous weight of two thousand pound he lion-like mane fall in shaggy confusion quite over he head and shoulder down to the ground when he be wound he become imbued with the spirit of a tiger : he stamp bellows roar and foam forth he rage with glaring eye and steam nostril and charge furiously at man and horse with utter recklessness fortunately however he be not naturally pugnacious and can be easily throw into a sudden panic moreover the peculiar position of he eye render this creature not so terrible as he would otherwise be to the hunter owe to the stiff structure of the neck and the sunken downward-looking eyeball the buffalo can not without a effort see beyond the direct line of vision present to the habitual carriage of he head when therefore he be wound and charge he do so in a straight line so that he pursuer can leap easily out of he way the pace of the buffalo be clumsy and _ apparently _ slow yet when chase he dash away over the plain in blind blundering terror at a rate that leave all but good horse far behind he can not keep the pace up however and be usually soon overtaken be the buffalo capable of the same alert and agile motion of head and eye peculiar to the deer or wild horse in addition to he bovine rage he would be the most formidable brute on earth there be no object perhaps so terrible as the headlong advance of a herd of these animal when thoroughly arouse by terror they care not for they neck all danger in front be forget or not see in the terror of that from which they fly no thundering cataract be more tremendously irresistible than the black bellowing torrent which sometimes pour through the narrow defile of the rocky mountain or sweep like a roar flood over the tremble plain the wallow to which we have refer be a luxury usually indulge in during the hot month of summer when the buffalo be torment by fly and heat and drought at this season they seek the low grounds in the prairie where there be a little stagnant water lie amongst the grass and the ground underneath be saturate be soft the leader of the herd a shaggy old bull usually take upon himself to prepare the wallow it be a rugged monster of the largest size that do so on the present occasion to the intense delight of dick varley who beg joe to lie still and watch the operation before try to shoot one of the buffalo cow joe consent with a nod and the four spectator -- for crusoe be as much take up with the proceedings as any of they -- crouch in the grass and look on come up to the swampy spot the old bull give a grunt of satisfaction and go down on one knee plunge he short thick horn into the mud tear it up and cast it aside have repeat this several time he plunge he head in and bring it forth saturate with dirty water and bedaub with lump of mud through which he fierce eye gaze with a ludicrous expression of astonishment straight in the direction of the hunter as if he mean to say i have do it that time and no mistake the other buffalo seem to think so too for they come up and look on with a expression that seem to say well do old fellow try that again the old fellow do try it again and again and again plunge and ram and tear up the earth until he form a excavation large enough to contain he huge body in this bath he lay himself comfortably down and begin to roll and wallow about until he mix up a trough full of thin soft mud which completely cover he when he come out of the hole there be scarcely a atom of he former self visible the coat of mud thus put on by bull be usually permit by they to dry and be not finally get rid of until long after when oft-repeated rolling on the grass and washing by rain at length clear it away when the old bull vacate this delectable bath another bull scarcely if at all less ferocious-looking step forward to take he turn but he be interrupt by a volley from the hunter which scatter the animal right and left and send the mighty herd in the distance fly over the prairie in wild terror the very turmoil of they own mad flight add to they panic and the continuous thunder of they hoof be hear until the last of they disappear on the horizon the family party which have be fire at however do not escape so well joe 's rifle wound a fat young cow and dick varley bring it down henrus have do he best but as the animal be too far distant for he limited vision he miss the cow he fire at and hit the young bull whose bath have be interrupt the other scatter and flee well do dick exclaim joe blunt as they all run up to the cow that have fall you first shot at the buffalo be a good un come now a ' i 'll show ye how to cut it up a ' carry off the tit-bits ah mon dear ole bull exclaim henrus gaze after the animal which he have wound and which be now limp slowly away you be not worth goin ' after farewell -- adieu he 'll be tough enough i warrant say joe a ' we have more meat here nor we can lift but would not it be as well to put the poor brute out o ' pain suggest dick oh he 'll die soon enough reply joe tuck up he sleeve and draw he long hunting-knife dick however be not satisfy with this way of look at it say that he would be back in a few minute he reload he rifle and call crusoe to he side walk quickly after the wound bull which be now hide from view in a hollow of the plain in a few minute he come in sight of it and run forward with he rifle in readiness down crusoe he whisper wait for I here crusoe crouch in the grass instantly and dick advance as he come on the bull observe he and turn round bellow with rage and pain to receive he the aspect of the brute on a near view be so terrible that dick involuntarily stop too and gaze with a mingled feeling of wonder and awe while it bristle with passion and blood-streaked foam drop from its open jaw and its eye glare furiously see that dick do not advance the bull charge he with a terrific roar but the youth have firm nerve and although the rush of such a savage creature at full speed be calculate to try the courage of any man especially one who have never see a buffalo bull before dick do not lose presence of mind he remember the many story he have listen to of this very thing that be now happen so crush down he excitement as well as he could he cock he rifle and await the charge he know that it be of no use to fire at the head of the advance foe as the thickness of the skull together with the matted hair on the forehead render it impervious to a bullet when the bull be within a yard of he he leap lightly to one side and it pass just as it do so dick aim at its heart and fire but he knowledge of the creature 's anatomy be not yet correct the ball enter the shoulder too high and the bull check himself as well as he could in he headlong rush turn round and make at dick again the failure couple with the excitement prove too much for dick he could not resist discharge he second barrel at the brute 's head as it come on he might as well have fire at a brick wall it shake its shaggy front and with a hideous bellow thunder forward again dick spring to one side but in do so a tuft of grass or a stone catch he foot and he fall heavily to the ground up to this point crusoe 's admirable training have nail he to the spot where he have be leave although the twitching of every fiber in he body and a low continuous whine show how gladly he would have hail permission to join in the combat but the instant he see he master down and the buffalo turn to charge again he spring forward with a roar that would have do credit to he bovine enemy and seize he by the nose so vigorous be the rush that he well-nigh pull the bull down on its side one toss of its head however send crusoe high into the air but it accomplish this feat at the expense of its nose which be tear and lacerate by the dog 's tooth scarcely have crusoe touch the ground which he do with a sound thump than he spring up and fly at he adversary again this time however he adopt the plan of bark furiously and bite by rapid yet terrible snap as he find opportunity thus keep the bull entirely engross and afford dick a opportunity of reload he rifle which he be not slow to do dick then step close up and while the two combatant be roar in each other 's face he shoot the buffalo through the heart it fall to the earth with a deep groan crusoe 's rage instantly vanish on behold this and he seem to be fill with tumultuous joy at he master 's escape for he gambol round he and whine and fawn upon he in a manner that could not be misunderstand good dog thank ` ee my pup say dick patting crusoe 's head as he stoop to brush the dust from he leggings i do not know what would ha ' become o ' I but for you help crusoe crusoe turn he head a little to one side wag he tail and look at dick with a expression that say quite plainly i would die for you i would -- not once or twice but ten time fifty time if need be -- and that not merely to save you life but even to please you there be no doubt whatever that crusoe feel something of this sort the love of a newfoundland dog to its master be beyond calculation or expression he who once gain such love carry the dog 's life in he hand but let he who read note well and remember that there be only one coin that can purchase such love and that be _ kindness _ the coin too must be genuine kindness merely _ express _ will not do it must be _ feel _ hallo boy ye have bin i ' the war exclaim joe raise himself from he task as dick and crusoe return you look more like it than i do retorted dick laugh this be true for cut up a buffalo carcass with no other instrument than a large knife be no easy matter yet western hunter and indian can do it without cleaver or saw in a way that would surprise a civilized butcher not a little joe be cover with blood up to the elbow he hair happen to have a knack of get into he eye have be so often brush off with bloody hand that he whole visage be speckled with gore and he dress be by no means immaculate while dick related he adventure or _ mis _ - adventure with the bull joe and henrus complete the cut out of the most delicate portion of the buffalo -- namely the hump on its shoulder -- which be a choice piece much finer than the best beef -- and the tongue and a few other part the tongue of buffalo be superior to those of domestic cattle when all be ready the meat be sling across the back of the pack-horse and the party remount they horse continue they journey have first cleansed themselves as well as they could in the rather dirty water of a old wallow see say henrus turn to dick and point to a circular spot of green as they ride along that be one old _ dry _ waller ay remark joe after the waller dry it become a ring o ' greener grass than the rest o ' the plain as ye see ti say the first hunter use to wonder greatly at these myster ` ous circle and they invent all sort o ' story to account for 'em some say they wo fairy-ring but at last they come to know they wo nothin ' more nor less than place where buffalo wo use to waller in it be often seem to I that if we know the _ raison _ o ' thing we would not be so much puzzle wus ' they as we be the truth of this last remark be so self-evident and incontrovertible that it elicit no reply and the three friend ride on for a considerable time in silence it be now past noon and they be think of call a halt for a short rest to the horse and a pipe to themselves when joe be hear to give vent to one of those peculiar hiss that always accompany either a surprise or a caution in the present case it indicate both what now joe injun ejaculate joe eh fat you say ou be dey crusoe at this moment utter a low growl ever since the day he have be partially roasted he have maintain a rooted antipathy to red-men joe immediately dismount and place he ear to the ground listen intently it be a curious fact that by place the ear close to the ground sound can be hear distinctly which could not be hear at all if the listener be to maintain a erect position they be arter the buffalo say joe rise a ' i think it be likely they be a band o ' pawnee listen a ' ye 'll hear they shout quite plain dick and henrus immediately lay down and place they ear to the ground now I hear note say henrus jump up but I ear be like I eye -- ver ' short-sighted i do hear something say dick as he get up but the beating o ' my own heart make row enough to spoil my hearin ' joe blunt smile ah lad ye be young a ' yer blood 's too hot yet but bide a bit -- you 'll cool down soon i wos like you once now lad what think ye we should do you know best joe ouus nodoubtedly ' then wot i advise be that we gallop to the broken sand hillock ye see yonder get behind they a ' take a peep at the redskin if they be pawnee we 'll go up to they at once if not we 'll hold a council o ' war on the spot have arrange this they mount and hasten towards the hillock in question which they reach after ten minute ' gallop at full stretch the sandy mound afford they concealment and enable they to watch the proceedings of the savage in the plain below the scene be the most curious and exciting that can be conceive the center of the plain before they be crowd with hundred of buffalo which be dash about in the most frantic state of alarm to whatever point they gallop they be meet by yell savage on horseback who could not have be fewer in number than a thousand all be arm with lance bow and quiver and mount on active little horse the indian have completely surround the herd of buffalo and be now advance steadily towards they gradually narrow the circle and whenever the terrify animal endeavor to break through the line they rush to that particular spot in a body and scare they back again into the center thus they advance until they close in on they prey and form a unbroken circle round they whilst the poor brute keep eddy and surge to and fro in a confused mass hook and climb upon each other and bellow furiously suddenly the horseman make a rush and the work of destruction begin the tremendous turmoil raise a cloud of dust that obscure the field in some place and hide it from we hunter ' view some of the indian gallop round and round the circle send they arrow whiz up to the feather in the side of the fattest cow other dash fearlessly into the midst of the black heaving mass and with they long lance pierce dozen of they to the heart in many instance the buffalo infuriate by wound turn fiercely on they assailant and gore the horse to death in which case the man have to trust to they nimble leg for safety sometimes a horse get jam in the center of the sway mass and could neither advance nor retreat then the savage rider leap upon the buffalo ' back and spring from one to another like a acrobat gain the outer edge of the circle not fail however in he strange flight to pierce with he lance several of the fattest of he stepping-stone as he speed along a few of the herd succeed in escape from the blood and dust of this desperate battle and make off over the plain but they be quickly overtake and the lance or the arrow bring they down on the green turf many of the dismount rider be chase by bull but they step lightly to one side and as the animal pass drive they arrow deep into they side thus the tumultuous war go on amid thunder tread and yell and bellow till the green plain be transform into a sea of blood and mire and every buffalo of the herd be lay low it be not to be suppose that such reckless warfare be invariably wage without damage to the savage many be the wound and bruise receive that day and not a few bone be break but happily no life be lose now lad now be we time a bold and fearless look 's the best at all time do not look as if ye doubt they friendship and mind wotever ye do do not use yer arm follow I say this joe blunt leap on he horse and bound over the ridge at full speed gallop headlong across the plain the savage observe the stranger instantly and a loud yell announce the fact as they assemble from all part of the field brandish they bow and spear joe 's quick eye soon distinguish they chief towards whom he gallop still at full speed till within a yard or two of he horse 's head then he rein up suddenly so rapidly do joe and he comrade approach and so instantaneously do they pull up that they steed be throw almost on they haunch the indian chief do not move a muscle he be a tall powerful savage almost naked and mount on a coal-black charger which he sit with the ease of a man accustom to ride from infancy he be indeed a splendid-looking savage but he face wear a dark frown for although he and he band have visit the settlement and traffic with the fur-trader on the missourus he do not love the pale-face whom he regard as intruder on the hunting-grounds of he father and the peace that exist between they at that time be of a very fragile character indeed it be deem by the trader impossible to travel through the indian country at that period except in strong force and it be the very boldness of the present attempt that secure to we hunter anything like a civil reception joe who could speak the pawnee tongue fluently begin by explain the object of he visit and speak of the present which he have bring for the great chief but it be evident that he word make little impression as he discourse to they the savage crowd round the little party and begin to handle and examine they dress and weapon with a degree of rudeness that cause joe considerable anxiety mahtawa believe that the heart of the pale-face be true say the savage when joe pause but he do not choose to make peace the pale-face be grasp they never rest they turn they eye to the great mountain and say ` there we will stop ' but even there they will not stop they be never satisfied mahtawa know they well this speech sink like a death-knell into the heart of the hunter for they know that if the savage refuse to make peace they would scalp they all and appropriate they goods to make thing worse a dark-visaged indian suddenly catch hold of henrus 's rifle and ere he be aware have pluck it from he hand the blood rush to the gigantic hunter 's forehead and he be on the point of spring at the man when joe say in a deep quiet voice -- be still henri you will but hasten death at this moment there be a movement in the outskirts of the circle of horseman and another chief ride into the midst of they he be evidently higher in rank than mahtawa for he speak authoritatively to the crowd and step in before he the hunter draw little comfort from the appearance of he face however for it scowl upon they he be not so powerful a man as mahtawa but he be more gracefully form and have a more noble and commanding countenance have the pale-face no wigwam on the great river that they should come to spy out the land of the pawnee he demand we have not come to spy you country answer joe raise himself proudly as he speak and take off he cap we have come with a message from the great chief of the pale-face who live in the village far beyond the great river where the sun rise he say why should the pale-face and the red-man fight they be brother the same manitou -lrb- \* -rrb- watch over both the pale-face have more bead and gun and blanket and knife and vermilion than they require they wish to give some of these thing for the skin and fur which the red-man do not know what to do with the great chief of the pale-face have send I to say why should we fight let we smoke the pipe of peace -lrb- footnote \* : the indian name for god -rrb- at the mention of bead and blanket the face of the wily chief brighten for a moment then he say sternly -- the heart of the pale-face be not true he have come here to trade for himself san-it-sa-rish have eye that can see they be not shut be not these you goods the chief point to the pack-horse as he speak trapper do not take they goods into the heart of a enemy 's camp return joe san-it-sa-rish be wise and will understand this these be gift to the chief of the pawnee there be more await he when the pipe of peace be smoke i have say what message shall we take back to the great chief of the pale-faces san-it-sa-rish be evidently mollify the hunting-field be not the council tent he say the pale-face will go with we to we village of course joe be too glad to agree to this proposal but he now deem it politic to display a little firmness we can not go till we rifle be restore it will not do to go back and tell the great chief of the pale-face that the pawnee be thief the chief frowned angrily the pawnee be true they be not thief they choose to _ look _ at the rifle of the pale-face it shall be return the rifle be instantly restore and then we hunter ride off with the indian towards they camp on the way they meet hundred of woman and child go to the scene of the great hunt for it be they special duty to cut up the meat and carry it into camp the man consider that they have do quite enough in kill it return to smoke and eat away the fatigue of the chase as they ride along dick varley observe that some of the brave as indian warrior be style be eat piece of the bloody liver of the buffalo in a raw state at which he express not a little disgust ah boy you be green yet remark joe blunt in a undertone mayhap ye 'll be thankful to do that same yerself some day well i 'll not refuse to try when it be needful say dick with a laugh meanwhile i be content to see the redskin do it joe blunt chapter viii _ dick and he friend visit the indian and see many wonder -- crusoe too experience a few surprise and teach indian dog a lesson -- a indian dandy -- a foot-race _ the pawnee village at which they soon arrive be situate in the midst of a most interesting and picturesque scene it occupy a extensive plain which slope gently down to a creek -lrb- \* -rrb- whose wind course be mark by a broken line of wood here and there intersperse with a fine clump of tree between the trunk of which the blue water of a lake sparkle in the distance hundred of tent or lodge of buffalo-skin cover the ground and thousand of indian -- man woman and child -- move about the busy scene some be sit in they lodge lazily smoke they pipe but these be chiefly old and infirm veteran for all the young man have go to the hunt which we have just describe the woman be stoop over they fire busily prepare maize and meat for they husband and brother while myriad of little brown and naked child romp about everywhere fill the air with they yell and scream which be only equal if not surpass by the yelp dog that seem innumerable -lrb- footnote \* : in america small river or rivulet be term creek -rrb- far as the eye could reach be see scatter herd of horse these be tend by little boy who be totally destitute of clothing and who seem to enjoy with infinite zest the pastime of shooting-practice with little bow and arrow no wonder that these indian become expert bowman there be urchin there scarce two foot high with round bullet of body and short spindle-shanks who could knock blackbird off the tree at every shot and cut the head off the taller flower with perfect certainty there be much need too for the utmost proficiency they could attain for the very existence of the indian tribe of the prairie depend on they success in hunting the buffalo there be hundred and thousand of north american savage who would undoubtedly perish and they tribe become extinct if the buffalo be to leave the prairie or die out yet although animal be absolutely essential to they existence they pursue and slay they with improvident recklessness sometimes kill hundred of they merely for the sake of the sport the tongue and the marrow bone in the bloody hunt describe in the last chapter however the slaughter of so many be not wanton because the village that have to be supply with food be large and just previous to the hunt they have be live on somewhat reduce allowance even the blackbird shoot by the brown-bodied urchin before mention have be thankfully put into the pot thus precarious be the supply of food among the red-man who on one day be starve and the next be revel in superabundance but to return to we story at one end of this village the creek spring over a ledge of rock in a low cascade and open out into a beautiful lake the bosom of which be stud with small island here be thousand of those smaller species of wild water-fowl which be either too brave or too foolish to be scare away by the noise of the camp and here too dozen of child be sport on the beach or paddle about in they light bark canoe be not it strange remark dick to henri as they pass among the tent towards the center of the village -- be not it strange that they injun should be so fond o ' fightin ' when they have get all they can want -- a fine country lot o ' buffalo a ' as far as i can see happy home oui it be remarkaibel vraiment bot dey do more love war to peace dey love to be excit-ed i s ` pose humph one would think the hunt we seed a little agone would be excitement enough but i say that must he the chief tent by the look o ' t dick be right the horseman pull up and dismount opposite the principal chief 's tent which be a larger and more elegant structure than the other meanwhile a immense concourse of woman child and dog gather round the stranger and while the latter yelp they dislike to white man the former chatter continuously as they discuss the appearance of the stranger and they errand which latter soon become know a end be put to this by san-it-sa-rish desire the hunter to enter the tent and spread a buffalo robe for they to sit on two brave carry in they pack and then lead away they horse all this time crusoe have keep as close as possible to he master 's side feeling extremely uncomfortable in the midst of such a strange crowd the more especially that the ill-looking indian cur give he expressive look of hatred and exhibit some desire to rush upon he in a body so that he have to keep a sharp look-out all round he when therefore dick enter the tent crusoe endeavor to do so along with he but he be meet by a blow on the nose from a old squaw who scold he in a shrill voice and bid he begone either we hero 's knowledge of the indian language be insufficient to enable he to understand the order or he have resolve not to obey it for instead of retreat he draw a deep gurgle breath curl he nose and display a row of tooth that cause the old woman to draw back in alarm crusoe 's be a forgiving spirit the instant that opposition cease he forget the injury and be meekly advance when dick hold up he finger go outside pup and wait crusoe 's tail droop with a deep sigh he turn and leave the tent he take up a position near the entrance however and sit down resignedly so meek indeed do the poor dog look that six mangy-looking cur feel they dastardly heart embolden to make a rush at he with boisterous yell crusoe do not rise he do not even condescend to turn he head toward they but he look at they out of the corner of he dark eye wrinkle -- very slightly -- the skin of he nose exhibit two beautiful fang and give utterance to a soft remark that might be describe as quiet deep-toned gurgle it be not much but it be more than enough for the valiant six who pause and snarl violently it be a peculiar trait of crusoe 's gentle nature that the moment any danger cease he resume he expression of nonchalant gravity the expression on this occasion be misunderstand however and as about two dozen additional yelp dog have join the rank of the enemy they advance in close order to the attack crusoe still sit quiet and keep he head high but he _ look _ at they again and exhibit four fang for they inspection among the pack there be one indian dog of large size -- almost as large as crusoe himself -- which keep well in the rear and apparently urge the lesser dog on the little dog do not object for little dog be generally the most pugnacious at this big dog crusoe direct a pointed glance but say nothing meanwhile a particularly small and vicious cur with a mere rag of a tail creep round by the back of the tent and come upon crusoe in rear snap at he tail sharply and then flee shriek with terror and surprise no doubt at its own temerity crusoe do not bark he seldom bark he usually either say nothing or give utterance to a prolonged roar of indignation of the most terrible character with bark as it be mingle through it it somewhat resemble that peculiar and well-known species of thunder the prolonged roll of which be mark at short interval in its course by cannon-like crack it be a continuous but so to speak _ knot _ roar on receive the snap crusoe give forth _ the _ roar with a majesty and power that scatter the pugnacious front rank of the enemy to the wind those that still remain half stupified he leap over with a huge bind and alight fang first on the back of the big dog there be one hideous yell a muffle scramble of a instant 's duration and the big dog lay dead upon the plain it be a awful thing to do but crusoe evidently feel that the peculiar circumstance of the case require that a example should be make and to say truth all thing consider we can not blame he the news must have be carry at once through the canine portion of the camp for crusoe be never interfere with again after that dick witness this little incident but he observe that the indian chief care not a straw about it and as he dog return quietly and sit down in its old place he take no notice of it either but continue to listen to the explanation which joe give to the chief of the desire of the pale-face to be friend with the red-men joe 's eloquence would have do little for he on this occasion have he hand be empty but he follow it up by open one of he pack and display the glittering contents before the equally glittering eye of the chief and he squaw these say joe be the gift that the great chief of the pale-face send to the great chief of the pawnee and he bid I say that there be many more thing in he store which will be trade for skin with the red-man when they visit he and he also say that if the pawnee will not steal horse any more from the pale-face they shall receive gift of knife and gun and powder and blanket every year wah grunt the chief it be good the great chief be wise we will smoke the pipe of peace the thing that afford so much satisfaction to san-it-sa-rish be the veriest trifle penny looking-glass in yellow gilt tin frame bead of various color needle cheap scissors and knife vermilion paint and coarse scarlet cloth etc they be of priceless value however in the estimation of the savage who delight to adorn themselves with leggings make from the cloth beautifully work with bead by they own ingenious woman they be thankful too for knife even of the commonest description have none but bone one of they own and they glory in daub they face with intermingled streak of charcoal and vermilion to gaze at they visage when thus treat in the little penny looking-glass be they summit of delight joe present the chief with a portion of these coveted goods and tie up the remainder we may remark here that the only thing which prevent the savage from take possession of the whole at once without ask permission be the promise of the annual gift which they know would not be forthcoming be any evil to befall the deputy of the pale-faces nevertheless it cost they a severe struggle to restrain they hand on this occasion and joe and he companion feel that they would have to play they part well in order to fulfil they mission with safety and credit the pale-face may go now and talk with the brave say san-it-sa-rish after carefully examine everything that be give to he a council will be call soon and we will smoke the pipe of peace accept this permission to retire the hunter immediately leave the tent and be now at liberty to do what they please they amuse themselves by wander about the village he be a cute chap that remark joe with a sarcastic smile i do not feel quite easy about gettin ' away he 'll bother the life out o ' we to get all the goods we have get and ye see as we have other tribe to visit we must give away as little as we can here ha you be right say henrus dat fellow 's eye twinkle at de knife and ting like two star fire-fly ye should say star be too soft a ' beautiful to compare to the eye o ' yon savage say dick laughing i wish we be well away from they that rascal mahtawa be a ugly customer true lad return joe have _ he _ bin the great chief we scalp have bin dryin ' in the smoke o ' a pawnee wigwam afore now what now lad joe 's question be put in consequence of a gleeful smile that overspread the countenance of dick varley who reply by point to a wigwam towards which they be approach oh that be only a dandy exclaimed joe there be lot o ' they in every injun camp they be fit for nothin ' but dress poor contemptible critter joe accompany he remark with a sneer for of all pitiable object he regard a unmanly man as the most despicable he consent however to sit down on a grassy bank and watch the proceedings of this indian dandy who have just seat himself in front of he wigwam for the purpose of make he toilet he begin it by grease he whole person carefully and smoothly over with buffalo fat until he shine like a patent leather boot then he rub himself almost dry leave the skin sleek and glossy have proceed thus far he take up a small mirror a few inch in diameter which he or some other member of the tribe must have procure during one of they few excursion to the trading-fort of the pale-face and examine himself as well as he could in so limit a space next he take a little vermilion from a small parcel and rub it over he face until it present the somewhat demoniac appearance of a fiery red he also draw a broad red score along the crown of he head which be closely shave with the exception of the usual tuft or scalplock on the top this scalplock stand bristle straight up a few inch and then curve over and hang down he back about two foot immense care and attention be bestow on this lock he smooth it grease it and plait it into the form of a pigtail another application be here make to the glass and the result be evidently satisfactory to judge from the beam smile that play on he feature but not content with the general effect he try the effect of expression -- frowned portentously scowl savagely gape hideously and grin horribly a ghastly smile then we dandy fit into he ear which be bore in several place sundry ornament such as ring wampum etc and hang several string of bead round he neck besides these he affix one or two ornament to he arm wrist and ankle and touch in a few effect with vermilion on the shoulder and breast after this and a few more glance at the glass he put on a pair of beautiful moccasin which besides be richly work with bead be soft as chamoix leather and fit he foot like glove a pair of leggings of scarlet cloth be draw on attach to a waist-belt and bind below the knee with broad garter of variegated bead-work it be some time before this adoni be quite satisfied with himself he retouch the paint on he shoulder several time and modify the glare of that on he wide-mouthed high-cheek-boned visage before he could tear himself away but at last he do so and throw a large piece of scarlet cloth over he shoulder he thrust he looking-glass under he belt and proceed to mount he palfrey which be hold in readiness near to the tent door by one of he wife the horse be really a fine animal and seem worthy of a more warlike master he shoulder too be strip with red paint and feather be intertwine with he mane and tail while the bridle be decorate with various jingle ornament vault upon he steed with a large fan of wild goose and turkey feather in one hand and a whip dangle at the wrist of the other this incomparable dandy sally forth for a promenade -- that be he chief delight when there be no buffalo hunting to be do other man who be not dandies sharpen they knife smoke feast and mend they spear and arrow at such season of leisure or play at athletic game let 's follow my buck say joe blunt ouus come ` long reply henrus stride after the rider at a pace that almost compel he comrade to run hold on cry dick laughing we do not want to keep he company a distant view be quite enough o ' sich a chap as that mais you forgit i can not see far so much the better remark joe it be my opinion we have see enough o ' he ah he be goin ' to look on at the game they 's worth lookin ' at the game to which joe refer be take place on a green level plain close to the creek and a little above the waterfall before refer to some of the indian be horse-race some jump and other wrestle but the game which prove most attractive be throw the javelin in which several of the young brave be engage this game be play by two competitor each arm with a dart in a arena about fifty yard long one of the player have a hoop of six inch in diameter at a signal they start off on foot at full speed and on reach the middle of the arena the indian with the hoop roll it along before they and each do he best to send a javelin through the hoop before the other he who succeed count so many point if both miss the nearest to the hoop be allow to count but not so much as if he have ringed it the indian be very fond of this game and will play at it under a broiling sun for hour together but a good deal of the interest attach to it be owe to the fact that they make it a means of gamble indian be inveterate gambler and will sometimes go on until they lose horse bow blanket robe and in short they whole personal property the consequence be as might be expect that fierce and bloody quarrel sometimes arise in which life be often lose try you hand at that say henrus to dick by all means cry dick hand he rifle to he friend and spring into the ring enthusiastically a general shout of applause greet the pale-face who throw off ' he coat and tighten he belt while a young indian present he with a dart now see that ye do we credit lad say joe i 'll try answer dick in a moment they be off the young indian roll away the hoop and dick throw he dart with such vigor that it go deep into the ground but miss the hoop by a foot at least the young indian 's first dart go through the center ha exclaim joe blunt to the indian near he the lad 's not use to that game try he at a race bring out you best brave -- he whose bind be like the hunt deer we need scarcely remind the reader that joe speak in the indian language and that the above be a correct rendering of the sense of what he say the name of tarwicadium or the little chief immediately pass from lip to lip and in a few minute a indian a little below the medium size bound into the arena with a indiarubber-like elasticity that cause a shade of anxiety to pass over joe 's face ah boy he whisper i be afeard you 'll find he a tough customer that be just what i want reply dick he be supple enough but he want muscle in the thigh we 'll make it a long heat right lad ye be right joe now proceed to arrange the condition of the race with the chief around he it be fix that the distance to be run should be a mile so that the race would be one of two mile out and back moreover the competitor be to run without any clothes except a belt and a small piece of cloth round the loin this to the indian be nothing for they seldom wear more in warm weather but dick would have prefer to keep on part of he dress the law of the course however would not permit of this so he strip and stand forth the _ beau-ideal _ of a well-formed agile man he be greatly superior in size to he antagonist and more muscular the savage be slender and extremely lithe and springy ha i will run too shout henrus bounce forward with clumsy energy and throw off he coat just as they be go to start the savage smile at this unexpected burst and make no objection consider the thing in the light of a joke the signal be give and away they go oh it would have do you good to have see the way in which henrus manoeuvre he limb on this celebrated occasion he go over the ground with huge elephantine bound run and jump he could not have be say to have one style of run he have a dozen style all of which come into play in the course of half as many minute the other two run like the wind yet although henrus _ appear _ to be go heavily over the ground he keep up with they to the turning-point as for dick it become evident in the first few minute that he could outstrip he antagonist with ease and be hang back a little all the time he shoot ahead like a arrow when they come about half-way back and it be clear that the real interest of the race be to lie in the competition between henrus and tarwicadium before they be two-third of the way back dick walk in to the winning-point and turn to watch the other henrus 's wind be about go for he exert himself with such violence that he waste half he strength the indian on the contrary be comparatively fresh but he be not so fleet as he antagonist whose tremendous stride carry he over the ground at a incredible pace on they come neck and neck till close on the score that mark the winning-point here the value of enthusiasm come out strongly in the case of henrus he _ feel _ that he could not gain a inch on tarwicadium to save he life but just as he come up he observe the anxious face of he comrade and the half-sneering countenance of the savage he heart thump against he rib every muscle thrill with a gush of conflict feeling and he _ hurl _ himself over the score like a cannon shot full six inch ahead of the little chief but the thing do not by any means end here tarwicadia pull up the instant he have pass not so we canadian such a clumsy and colossal frame be not to be check in a moment the crowd of indian open up to let he pass but unfortunately a small tent that stand in the way be not so oblige into it he go head foremost like a shell carry away the corner post with he shoulder and bring the whole affair down about he own ear and those of its inmate among whom be several child and two or three dog it require some time to extricate they all from the ruin but when this be effect it be find that no serious damage have be do to life or limb chapter ix _ crusoe act a conspicuous and humane part _ -- _ a friend gain _ -- _ a great feast _ when the foot-race be conclude the three hunter hang about look on at the various game for some time and then stroll towards the lake ye may be thankful yer neck 's whole say joe grin as henrus rub he shoulder with a rueful look a ' we 'll have to send that injun and he family a knife and some bead to make up for the fright they get ha a ' fat be to be give to I for my break shoulder credit man credit say dick varley laugh credit fat be dat honor and glory lad and the praise of they savage ha de praise more probeebale de ill-vill of de rascale i seed dem scowl at I not ver ' pritty that be true henrus but sich as it be it be all ye 'll git i vish

they up and exchange they wi ' the fellow hereaway for horse and skin -- so i be tell at this moment there be a wild cry of terror hear a short distance ahead of they rush forward they observe a indian woman fly frantically down the river 's bank towards the waterfall a hundred yard above which a object be see struggle in the water ` tis she child cry joe as the mother 's frantic cry reach he ear it 'll be over the fall in a minute run dick you be quickest they have all start forward at speed but dick and crusoe be far ahead and abreast of the spot in a few seconds save it pup cry dick point to the child which have be catch in a eddy and be for a few moment hover on the edge of the stream that rush impetuously towards the fall the noble newfoundland do not require to be tell what to do it seem a natural instinct in this sagacious species of dog to save man or beast that chance to be struggle in the water and many be the authentic story relate of newfoundland dog save life in case of shipwreck indeed they be regularly train to the work in some country and nobly fearlessly disinterestedly do they discharge they trust often in the midst of appalling danger crusoe spring from the bank with such impetus that he broad chest plough up the water like the bow of a boat and the energetic workings of he muscle be indicate by the force of each successive propulsion as he shoot ahead in a few seconds he reach the child and catch it by the hair then he turn to swim back but the stream have get hold of he bravely he struggle and lift the child breast-high out of the water in he powerful effort to stem the current in vain each moment he be carry inch by inch down until he be on the brink of the fall which though not high be a large body of water and fall with a heavy roar he raise himself high out of the stream with the vigor of he last struggle and then fall back into the abyss by this time the poor mother be in a canoe as close to the fall as she could with safety approach and the little bark dance like a cockle-shell on the turmoil of water as she stand with uplifted paddle and stare eyeball await the rise of the child crusoe come up almost instantly but _ alone _ for the dash over the fall have wrench the child from he tooth he raise himself high up and look anxiously round for a moment then he catch sight of a little hand raise above the boiling flood in one moment he have the child again by the hair and just as the prow of the indian woman 's canoe touch the shore he bring the child to land spring towards he the mother snatch she child from the flood and gaze at its death-like face with eyeball start from they socket then she lay she cheek on its cold breast and stand like a statue of despair there be one slight pulsation of the heart and a gentle motion of the hand the child still live open up she blanket she lay she little one against she naked warm bosom draw the cover close around it and sit down on the bank weep aloud for joy come -- come ` way quick cry henrus hurry off to hide the emotion which he could not crush down ay she do not need we help now say joe follow he comrade as for crusoe he walk along by he master 's side with he usual quiet serene look of good-will towards all mankind doubtless a feeling of gladness at have save a human life fill he shaggy breast for he wag he tail gently after each shake of he drip side but he meek eye be downcast save when raise to receive the welcome and unusually fervent caress crusoe do not know that those three man love he as though he have be a brother on they way back to the village the hunter be meet by a little boy who say that a council be to be hold immediately and they presence be request the council be hold in the tent of the principal chief towards which all the other chief and many of the note brave hurry like all indian council it be precede by smoke the medicine pipe and be follow by speech from several of the best orator the substance of the discourse differ little from what have be already relate in reference to the treaty between the pale-face and upon the whole it be satisfactory but joe blunt could not fail to notice that mahtawa maintain sullen silence during the whole course of the meeting he observe also that there be a considerable change in the tone of the meeting when he inform they that he be bind on a similar errand of peace to several of the other tribe especially to one or two tribe which be the pawnee ' bitter enemy at that time these grasp savage have quite make up they mind that they be to obtain the entire contents of the two bale of goods be much mortify on hearing that part be to go to other indian tribe some of they even hint that this would not be allow and joe fear at one time that thing be go to take a unfavourable turn the hair of he scalp as he afterwards say begin to lift a little and feel oneasy but san-it-sa-rish stand honestly to he word say that it would be well that the pale-face and the pawnee should be brother and hope that they would not forget the promise of annual present from the hand of the great chief who live in the big village near the rise sun have settle this matter amicably joe distribute among the indian the proportion of he goods design for they and then they all adjourn to another tent where a great feast be prepare for they be ye hungry inquire joe of dick as they walk along ay that be i i feel as if i could eat a buffalo alive why it be my ` pinion we have taste nothin ' since daybreak-this mornin ' well i have often tell ye that they redskin think it a disgrace to give in eatin ' till all that be set before they at a feast be bolt we 'll ha ' to stretch oursel 's we will i ` se get a plenty room remark henrus ye have but ye 'll wish ye have more in a little bien i not care in quarter of a hour all the guest invite to this great medicine feast be assemble no woman be admit they never be at indian feast we may remark in pass that the word medicine as use among the north american indian have a very much wider signification than it have with we it be a almost inexplicable word when ask they can not give a full or satisfactory explanation of it themselves in the general we may say that whatever be mysterious be medicine jugglery and conjuring of a noisy mysterious and we must add rather silly nature be medicine and the juggler be a medicine man these medicine man undertake cure but they be regular charlatan and know nothing whatever of the disease they pretend to cure or they remedy they carry bag contain sundry relic these be medicine bag every brave have he own private medicine bag everything that be incomprehensible or suppose to be supernatural religious or medical be medicine this feast be a unusual one in honor of stranger and in connection with a peculiar and unexpected event be medicine even crusoe since he gallant conduct in save the indian child be medicine and dick varley 's double-barrelled rifle which have be a object of wonder ever since he arrival at the village be tremendous medicine of course the indian be array in they best several wear necklace of the claw of the grizzly bear of which they be extremely proud and a gaudily picturesque group they be the chief however have undergo a transformation that well-nigh upset the gravity of we hunter and render dick 's effort to look solemn quite abortive san-it-sa-rish have once be to the trading-fort of the pale-face and while there have receive the customary gift of a blue surtout with brass button and a ordinary hat such as gentleman wear at home as the coat be a good deal too small for he a terrible length of dark bony wrist appear below the cuff the waist be too high and it be with great difficulty that he manage to button the garment across he broad chest be ignorant of the nature of a hat the worthy savage have allow the paper and string with which it have be originally cover to remain on suppose they to be part and parcel of the hat and this together with the high collar of the coat which give he a crushed-up appearance the long black naked leg and the paint visage give to he a _ tout ensemble _ which we can compare to nothing as there be nothing in nature comparable to it those guest who assemble first pass they time in smoke the medicine pipe until the other should arrive for so long as a single invite guest be absent the feast can not begin dignified silence be maintain while the pipe thus circulate from hand to hand when the last guest arrive they begin the man be seat in two row face to face feast of this kind usually consist of but one species of food and on the present occasion it be a enormous caldron full of maize which have to be devour about fifty sit down to eat a quantity of what may be term thick porridge that would have be ample allowance for a hundred ordinary man before commence san-it-sa-rish desire a aged medicine man to make a oration which he do fluently and poetically its subject be the praise of the giver of the feast at the end of each period there be a general hou hou of assent -- equivalent to the hear hear of civilized man other orator then follow all of whom speak with great ease and fluency and some in the most impassioned strain work themselves and they audience up to the highest pitch of excitement now shout with frenzied violence till they eye glare from they socket and the vein of they forehead swell almost to burst as they speak of war and chase anon break into soft modulate and please tone while they dilate upon the pleasure of peace and hospitality after these have finish a number of wooden bowl full of maize porridge be put down between the guest -- one bowl to each couple face each other but before commence a portion be lay aside and dedicate to they god with various mysterious ceremony for here as in other place where the gospel be not know the poor savage fancy that they could propitiate god with sacrifice they have never hear of the sacrifice of a broken spirit and a contrite heart this offering be make the feast begin in earnest not only be it a rule in this feast that every mouthful should be swallow by each guest however unwilling and unable he should be to do so but he who could dispose of it with greatest speed be deem the greatest man -- at least on that occasion -- while the last to conclude he supper be look upon with some degree of contempt it seem strange that such a custom should ever have arise and one be not a little puzzle in endeavor to guess at the origin of it there be one fact that occur to we as the probable cause the indian be as we have before hint frequently reduce to a state border on starvation and in a day after he may be burden with superabundance of food he oftentimes therefore eat as much as he can stuff into he body when he be bless with plenty so as to be the better able to withstand the attack of hunger that may possibly be in store for he the amount that a indian will thus eat at a single meal be incredible he seem to have the power of distend himself for the reception of a quantity that would kill a civilized man child in particular become like tightly inflate little balloon after a feast and as they wear no clothing the extraordinary rotundity be very obvious not to say ridiculous we conclude therefore that unusual power of gormandize be useful come at last to be cultivate as praiseworthy by good fortune dick and joe blunt happen to have such enormous glutton as _ vis--vis _ that the portion of they respective bowl which they could not devour be gobble up for they by good capacity and digestion with no small amount of effort henrus manage to dispose of he own share but he be last of be do and fall in the savage ' esteem greatly the way in which that sticky compost of boil maize go down be absolutely amazing the man opposite dick in particular be a human boa-constrictor he well-nigh suffocate dick with suppress laughter he be a great raw-boned savage with a throat of indiarubber and go quickly and quietly on swallow mass after mass with the solemn gravity of a owl it matter not a straw to he that dick take comparatively small mouthful and nearly choke on they too for want of liquid to wash they down have dick eat none at all he would have uncomplainingly dispose of the whole jack the giant-killer 's feat be nothing to he and when at last the bowl be empty he stop short like a machine from which the steam have be suddenly cut off and lay down he buffalo horn-spoon _ without _ a sigh dick sigh though with relief and gratitude when he bowl be empty i hope i may never have to do it again say joe that night as they wend they way back to the chief 's tent after supper i would not be fit for anything for a week arter it dick could only laugh for any allusion to the feast instantly bring back that owl-like gourmand to whom he be so deeply indebted henrus groan oh mes boy i be speechless i be ready for bust ouus -- hah i veesh it va to-morrow many a time that night do henrus veesh it va to-morrow as he lay helpless on he back look up through the roof of the chief 's tent at the star and listen enviously to the plethoric snore of joe blunt he be entertain however during those wake hour with a serenade such as few civilized ear ever listen to this be nothing else than a vocal concert perform by all the dog of the village and as they amount to nearly two thousand the orchestra be a pretty full one these wretch howl as if they have all go mad yet there be method in they madness for they congregate in a crowd before begin and sit down on they haunch then one which seem to be the conductor raise he snout to the sky and utter a long low melancholy wail the other take it up by two and three until the whole pack have they nose point to the star and they throat distend to the uttermost while a prolonged yell fill the air then it sink gradually one or two -lrb- bad performer probably -rrb- make a yelp attempt to get it up again at the wrong time again the conductor raise he nose and out it come -- full swing there be no vociferous bark it be simple wolfish howl increase in fervor to a electric yell with slight bark run continuously through it like a obbligato accompaniment when crusoe first hear the unwonted sound he spring to he foot bristle up like a hyena show all he tooth and bound out of the tent blaze with indignation and astonishment when he find out what it be he return quite sleek and with a look of profound contempt on he countenance as he resume he place by he master 's side and go to sleep chapter x _ perplexity _ -- _ we hunter plan they escape _ -- _ unexpected interruption _ -- _ the table turn _ -- _ crusoe mount guard _ -- _ the escape _ dick varley sit before the fire ruminate we do not mean to assert that dick have be previously eat grass by no means for several day past he have be mentally subsisting on the remarkable thing that he hear and see in the pawnee village and wonder how he be to get away without be scalp he be now chew the cud of this intellectual fare we therefore repeat emphatically -- in case any reader should have presume to contradict we -- that dick varley sit before the fire _ ruminate _ joe blunt likewise sit by the fire along with he ruminate too and smoking besides henrus also sit there smoking and look a little the worse of he late supper i do not like the look o ' thing say joe blow a whiff of smoke slowly from he lip and watch it as it ascend into the still air that blackguard mahtawa be determine not to let we off till he git all we goods a ' if he git they he may as well take we scalp too for we would come poor speed in the prairie without gun horse or goods dick look at he friend with a expression of concern what be to be do say he ve must escape answer henrus but he tone be not a hopeful one for he know the danger of they position better than dick ay we must escape -- at least we must try say joe but i 'll make one more effort to smooth over san-it-sa-rish a ' git he to snub that villain mahtawa just as he speak the villain in question enter the tent with a bold haughty air and sit down before the fire in sullen silence for some minute no one speak and henrus who happen at the time to be examine the lock of dick 's rifle continue to inspect they with a appearance of careless indifference that he be far from feel now this rifle of dick 's have become a source of unceasing wonder to the indian -- wonder which be greatly increase by the fact that no one could discharge it but himself dick have during he short stay at the pawnee village amuse himself and the savage by exhibit he marvellous power with the silver rifle since it have be win by he at the memorable match in the mustang valley it have scarce ever be out of he hand so that he have become decidedly the best shot in the settlement could bark squirrel -lrb- that be hit the bark of the branch on which a squirrel happen to be stand and so kill it by the concussion alone -rrb- and could drive the nail every shot the silver rifle as we have say become great medicine to the red-man when they see it kill at a distance which the few wretched gun they have obtain from the fur-trader could not even send a spend ball to the double shot too fill they with wonder and admiration but that which they regard with a almost supernatural feeling of curiosity be the percussion cap which in dick 's hand always explode but in theirs be utterly useless this result be simply owe to the fact that dick after firing hand the rifle to the indian without renew the cap so that when they load and attempt to fire of course it merely snap when he wish again to fire he adroitly exchange the old cap for a new one he be immensely tickled by the solemn look of the indian at this most incomprehensible of all medicine and keep they for some day in ignorance of the true cause intend to reveal it before he leave but circumstance now arise which banish all trifling thought from he mind mahtawa raise he head suddenly and say point to the silver rifle mahtawa wish to have the two-shotted medicine gun he will give he best horse in exchange mahtawa be liberal answer joe but the pale-faced youth can not part with it he have far to travel and must shoot buffalo by the way the pale-faced youth shall have a bow and arrow to shoot the buffalo rejoin the indian he can not use the bow and arrow answer joe he have not be train like the red-man mahtawa be silent for a few seconds and he dark brow frown more heavily than ever over he eye the pale-face be too bold he exclaim work himself into a passion they be in the power of mahtawa if they will not give the gun he will take it he spring suddenly to he foot as he speak and snatch the rifle from henrus 's hand henrus be ignorant of the language have not be able to understand the foregoing conversation although he see well enough that it be not a agreeable one but no sooner do he find himself thus rudely and unexpectedly deprive of the rifle than he jump up wrench it in a twinkle from the indian 's grasp and hurl he violently out of the tent in a moment mahtawa draw he knife utter a savage yell and spring on the reckless hunter who however catch he wrist and hold it as if in a vice the yell bring a dozen warrior instantly to the spot and before dick have time to recover from he astonishment henrus be surround and pinion despite he herculean struggle before dick could move joe blunt grasp he arm and whisper quickly do not rise you can not help he they dare not kill he till san-it-sa-rish agree though much surprised dick obey but it require all he effort both of voice and hand to control crusoe whose mind be much too honest and straightforward to understand such subtle piece of diplomacy and who strive to rush to the rescue of he ill-used friend when the tumult have partly subside joe blunt rise and say -- have the pawnee brave turn traitor that they draw the knife against those who have smoke with they the pipe of peace and eat they maize the pale-face be three the pawnee be thousand if evil have be do let it be lay before the chief mahtawa wish to have the medicine gun although we say no we could not part with it he try to take it by force be we to go back to the great chief of the pale-face and say that the pawnee be thief be the pale-face henceforth to tell they child when they steal ` that be bad that be like the pawnee ' no this must not be the rifle shall be restore and we will forget this disagreement be it not so there be a evident disposition on the part of many of the indian with whom mahtawa be no favorite to applaud this speech but the wily chief spring forward and with flash eye seek to turn the table the pale-face speak with soft word but he heart be false be he not go to make peace with the enemy of the pawnee be he not go to take goods to they and make they gift and promise the pale-face be spy they come to see the weakness of the pawnee camp but they have find that it be strong shall we suffer the false heart to escape shall they live no we will hang they scalp in we wigwam for they have _ strike a chief _ and we will keep all they goods for we squaw -- wah this allusion to keep all the goods have more effect on the mind of the vacillate savage than the chief 's eloquence but a new turn be give to they thought by joe blunt remark in a quiet almost contemptuous tone -- mahtawa be not the _ great _ chief true true they cry and immediately hurry to the tent of san-it-sa-rish once again this chief stand between the hunter and the savage who want but a signal to fall on they there be a long palaver which end in henrus be set at liberty and the rifle be restore that evening as the three friend sit beside they fire eat they supper of boil maize and buffalo meat they laugh and talk as carelessly as ever but the gaiety be assume for they be at the time plan they escape from a tribe which they foresee would not long refrain from carry out they wish and rob perhaps murder they ye see say joe with a perplexed air while he draw a piece of live charcoal from the fire with he finger and light he pipe -- ye see there be more difficulty in the way o ' gettin ' off than ye think -- oh nivare mind de difficulty interrupted henrus whose wrath at the treatment he have receive have not yet cool down ve must jump on de best horse ve can git hold shake we fist at de red reptile and go away fast as ve can de best hoss _ must _ vin de race joe shake he head a hundred arrow would be in we back before we get twenty yard from the camp besides we can not tell which be the best horse we own be the best in my ` pinion but how be we to git ' em i know who have charge o ' they say dick i see they grazing near the tent o ' that poor squaw whose baby be save by crusoe either she husband look after they or some neighbor that be well say joe that be one o ' my difficulty go what be the other well d'ye see they be troublesome we can not git the horse out o ' camp without bein ' see for the red rascal would see what we be at in a jiffy then if we do git 'em out we can not go off without we bale a ' we need not think to take 'em from under the nose o ' the chief and he squaw without bein ' ax question to go off without they would niver do at all joe say dick earnestly i have hit on a plan have ye dick -- what be ' t come and i 'll let ye see answer dick rise hastily and quit the tent follow by he comrade and he faithful dog it may be as well to remark here that no restraint whatever have yet be put on the movement of we hunter as long as they keep to they leg for it be well know that any attempt by man on foot to escape from mount indian on the plain would be hopeless moreover the savage think that as long as there be a prospect of they be allow to depart peaceably with they goods they would not be so mad as to fly from the camp and by so do risk they life and declare war with they entertainer they have therefore be permit to wander unchecked as yet far beyond the outskirts of the camp and amuse themselves in paddle about the lake in the small indian canoe and shooting wild-fowl dick now lead the way through the labyrinth of tent in the direction of the lake and they talk and laugh loudly and whistle to crusoe as they go in order to prevent they purpose be suspect for the purpose of further disarm suspicion they go without they rifle dick explain he plan by the way and it be at once warmly approve of by he comrade on reach the lake they launch a small canoe into which crusoe be order to jump then embark they paddle swiftly to the opposite shore singing a canoe song as they dip they paddle in the moonlit water of the lake arrive at the other side they haul the canoe up and hurry through the thin belt of wood and willow that intervene between the lake and the prairie here they pause be that the bluff joe no dick that be too near t ` other one 'll be best -- far away to the right it be a little one and there be other near it the sharp eye o ' the redskin will not be so likely to be prowlin ' there come on then but we 'll have to take down by the lake first in a few minute the hunter be thread they way through the outskirts of the wood at a rapid trot in the opposite direction from the bluff or wooded knoll which they wish to reach this they do lest prying eye should have follow they in quarter of a hour they turn at right angle to they track and strike straight out into the prairie and after a long run they edge round and come in upon the bluff from behind it be merely a collection of stunt but thick-growing willow force they way into the center of this they begin to examine it it 'll do say joe de very ting remark henrus come here crusoe crusoe bound to he master 's side and look up in he face look at this place pup smell it well crusoe instantly set off all round among the willow in and out snuff everywhere and whine with excitement come here good pup that will do now lad we 'll go back so say dick and he friend leave the bluff and retrace they step to the camp before they have go far however joe halted and say -- d'ye know dick i doubt if the pup 's so cliver as ye think what if he do not quite onderstand ye dick reply by take off he cap and throw it down at the same time exclaim take it yonder pup and point with he hand towards the bluff the dog seize the cap and go off with it at full speed towards the willow where it leave it and come gallop back for the expect reward -- not now as in day of old a bit of meat but a gentle stroke of its head and a hearty clap on its shaggy side good pup go now a ' fetch it away he go with a bind and in a few seconds come back and deposit the cap at he master 's foot will that do ask dick triumphantly ay lad it will the pup 's worth its weight in goold ouus i have say and i say it agen de dog be _ human _ so he be if not fat be he without pause to reply to this perplexing question dick step forward again and in half-an-hour or so they be back in the camp now for _ you _ part of the work joe yonder 's the squaw that own the half-drowned baby everything depend on she dick point to the indian woman as he speak she be sit beside she tent and playing at she knee be the identical youngster who have be save by crusoe i 'll manage it say joe and walk towards she while dick and henrus return to the chief 's tent do the pawnee woman thank the great spirit that she child be save begin joe as he come up she do answer the woman look up at the hunter and she heart be warm to the pale-face after a short silence joe continue -- the pawnee chief do not love the pale-face some of they hate they the dark flower know it answer the woman she be sorry she would help the pale-face if she could this be utter in a low tone and with a meaning glance of the eye joe hesitate again -- could he trust she yes the feeling that fill she breast and prompt she word be not those of the indian just now -- they be those of a _ mother _ whose gratitude be too full for utterance will the dark flower say joe catch the name she have give herself help the pale-face if he open he heart to she will she risk the anger of she nation she will reply the woman she will do what she can joe and he dark friend now drop they high-sounding style of speech and speak for some minute rapidly in a undertone it be finally arrange that on a give day at a certain hour the woman should take the four horse down the shore of the lake to its lower end as if she be go for firewood there cross the creek at the ford and drive they to the willow bluff and guard they till the hunter should arrive have settle this joe return to the tent and inform he comrade of he success during the next three day joe keep the indian in good-humour by give they one or two trinket and speak in glowing term of the riches of the white man and the readiness with which they would part with they to the savage if they would only make peace meanwhile during the dark hour of each night dick manage to abstract small quantity of goods from they pack in room of which he stuff in piece of leather to keep up the size and appearance the goods thus take out he conceal about he person and go off with a careless swagger to the outskirts of the village with crusoe at he heel arrive there he tie the goods in a small piece of deerskin and give the bundle to the dog with the injunction take it yonder pup crusoe take it up at once dart off at full speed with the bundle in he mouth down the shore of the lake towards the ford of the river and be soon lose to view in this way little by little the goods be convey by the faithful dog to the willow bluff and leave there while the stuff pack still remain in safe keep in the chief tent joe do not at first like the idea of thus sneak off from the camp and more than once make strong effort to induce san-it-sa-rish to let he go but even that chief 's countenance be not so favourable as it have be it be clear that he could not make up he mind to let slip so good a chance of obtain gun powder and shot horse and goods without any trouble so joe make up he mind to give they the slip at once a dark night be choose for the attempt and the indian woman go off with the horse to the place where firewood for the camp be usually cut unfortunately the suspicion of that wily savage mahtawa have be awaken and he stick close to the hunter all day -- not know what be go on but feel convinced that something be brewing which he resolve to watch without mention he suspicion to any one i think that villain 's away at last whisper joe to he comrade it be time to go lad the moon will not be up for a hour come along have ye get the big powder-horn joe ay ay all right stop stop my knife my couteau ah here i be now boy the three set off as usual stroll carelessly to the outskirts of the camp then they quicken they pace and gain the lake push off in a small canoe at the same moment mahtawa step from the bush leap into another canoe and follow they ha he must die muttered henrus not at all say joe we 'll manage he without that the chief land and stride boldly up to they for he know well that whatever they purpose might be they would not venture to use they rifle within sound of the camp at that hour of the night as for they knife he could trust to he own active limb and the wood to escape and give the alarm if need be the pale-faces hunt very late he say with a malicious grin do they love the dark better than the sunshine not so reply joe coolly but we love to walk by the light of the moon it will be up in less than a hour and we mean to take a long ramble to-night the pawnee chief love to walk by the moon too he will go with the pale-face good ejaculate joe come along then the party immediately set forward although the savage be a little take by surprise at the indifferent way in which joe receive he proposal to accompany they he walk on to the edge of the prairie however and then stop the pale-face must go alone say he mahtawa will return to he tent joe reply to this intimation by seize he suddenly by the throat and choke back the yell that would otherwise have bring the pawnee warrior rush to the scene of action in hundred mahtawa 's hand be on the handle of he scalping-knife in a moment but before he could draw it he arm be glue to he side by the bear-like embrace of henrus while dick tie a handkerchief quickly yet firmly round he mouth the whole thing be accomplish in two minute after take he knife and tomahawk away they loosen they gripe and escort he swiftly over the prairie mahtawa be perfectly submissive after the first convulsive struggle be over he know that the man who walk on each side of he grasp he arm be more than he match singly so he wisely make no resistance hurry he to a clump of small tree on the plain which be so far distant from the village that a yell could not be hear they remove the bandage from mahtawa 's mouth _ must _ he be kill inquire henrus in a tone of commiseration not at all answer joe we 'll tie he to a tree and leave he here then he vill be starve to deat ' oh dat be more horrobell he must take he chance o ' that i have no doubt he friend 'll find he in a day or two a ' he be game to last for a week or more but you 'll have to run to the willow bluff dick and bring a bit of line to tie he we can not spare it well but there be no help but there _ be _ help retort dick just order the villain to climb into that tree why so lad do not ask question but do what i bid ye the hunter smile for a moment as he turn to the indian and order he to climb up a small tree near to which he stand mahtawa look surprised but there be no alternative joe 's authoritative tone brook no delay so he spring into the tree like a monkey crusoe say dick _ watch he _ the dog sit quietly down at the foot of the tree and fix he eye on the savage with a glare that speak unutterable thing at the same time he display he full complement of tooth and utter a sound like distant thunder joe almost laugh and henrus do laugh outright come along he be safe now cry dick hurry away in the direction of the willow bluff which they soon reach and find that the faithful squaw have tie they steed to the bush and moreover have bundle up they goods into a pack and strap it on the back of the pack-horse but she have not remain with they bless yer dark face ejaculate joe as he spring into the saddle and ride out of the clump of bush he be follow immediately by the other and in three minute they be fly over the plain at full speed on gain the last far-off ridge that afford a distant view of the wood skirt the pawnee camp they draw up and dick put he finger to he mouth draw a long shrill whistle it reach the willow bluff like a faint echo at the same moment the moon arise and more clearly reveal crusoe 's cataleptic glare at the indian chief who be utterly unarmed be at the dog 's mercy the instant the whistle fall on he ear however he drop he eye cover he tooth and leap through the bush fly over the plain like a arrow at the same instant mahtawa descend from he tree run as fast as he could towards the village utter the terrible war-whoop when near enough to be hear no sound send such a thrill through a indian camp every warrior fly to arm and vault on he steed so quickly be the alarm give that in less than ten minute a thousand hoof be thunder on the plain and faintly reach the ear of the fugitive joe smile it 'll puzzle they to come up wus ' nag like ours they be in prime condition too -- lot o ' wind in ' em if we only keep out o ' badger hole we may laugh at the red varmint joe 's opinion of indian horse be correct in a very few minute the sound of hoof die away but the fugitive do not draw bridle during the remainder of that night for they know not how long the pursuit might be continue by pond and brook and bluff they pass down in the grassy bottom and over the prairie wave -- nor check they headlong course till the sun blaze over the level sweep of the eastern plain as if it arise out of the mighty ocean then they spring from the saddle and hastily set about the preparation of they morning meal chapter xi _ evening meditation and morning reflection -- buffalo badger antelope and accident -- a old bull and the wolf -- mad tail -- henrus floor etc _ there be nothing that prepare one so well for the enjoyment of rest both mental and physical as a long-protracted period of excitement and anxiety follow up by bodily fatigue excitement alone banish rest but unite with severe physical exertion it prepare for it at least courteous reader this be we experience and certainly this be the experience of we three hunter as they lay on they back beneath the branch of a willow bush and gaze serenely up at the twinkling star two day after they escape from the indian village they speak little they be too tired for that also they be too comfortable they respective supper of fresh antelope steak shot that day have just be dispose of they foot be direct towards the small fire on which the say steak have be cook and which still throw a warm ruddy glow over the encampment they blanket be wrap comfortably round they and tuck in as only hunter and mother know _ how _ to tuck they in they respective pipe deliver forth at state interval three richly yellow puff of smoke as if a three-gun battery be play upon the sky from that particular spot of earth the horse be picket and hobble in a rich grassy bottom close by from which the quiet munch of they equine jaw sound pleasantly for it tell of healthy appetite and promise speed on the morrow the fear of be overtake during the night be now past and the faithful crusoe by virtue of sight hearing and smell guarantee they against sudden attack during the hour of slumber a perfume of wild flower mingle with the loved odour of the weed and the tinkle of a tiny rivulet fall sweetly on they ear in short the pale-face be supremely happy and disposed to be thankful for they recent deliverance and they present comfort i wonder what the star be say dick languidly take the pipe out of he mouth bit o ' fire suggest joe i tink dey be vorlds muttered henrus a ' have peepel in dem i have hear man say dat a long silence follow during which no doubt the star-gazer be work out various theory in they own mind wonder say dick again how far off they be a mile or two maybe say joe henrus be about to laugh sarcastically at this but on further consideration he think it would be more comfortable not to so he lay still in another minute he say -- joe blunt you be ver ' igrant do not you know dat de book say de star be hondred tousand -- oh milleryon of mile away to here and dat dey be more bigger dan di vorld joe snore lightly and he pipe fall out of he mouth at this point so the conversation drop presently dick ask in a low tone i say henrus be ye asleep ouus reply henry faintly do not speak or you vill vaken I ah crusoe you be not asleep be you pup no need to ask that question the instantaneous wag of that speak tail and the glance of that wakeful eye as the dog lift he head and lay he chin on dick 's arm show that he have be listen to every word that be speak we can not say whether he understand it but beyond all doubt he hear it crusoe never presume to think of go to sleep until he master be as sound as a top then he venture to indulge in that light species of slumber which be familiarly know as sleep with one eye open but comparatively as well as figuratively speak crusoe sleep usually with one eye and a half open and the other half be never very tightly shut gradually dick 's pipe fall out of he mouth a event which the dog with a exercise of instinct almost if not quite amount to reason regard as a signal for he to go off the camp fire go slowly out the star twinkle down at they reflection in the brook and a deep breathing of wearied man be the only sound that rise in harmony with the purling stream before the sun rise next morning and while many of the brighter star be still struggle for existence with the approach day joe be up and buckle on the saddle-bag while he shout to he unwilling companion to rise if it depend on you he say the pawnee would not be long afore they get we scalp jump ye dog a ' lend a hand will ye a snore from dick and a deep sigh from henrus be the answer to this pathetic appeal it so happen however that henrus 's pipe in fall from he lip have empty the ash just under he nose so that the sigh refer to draw a quantity thereof into he throat and almost choke he nothing could have be a more effective awakener he be up in a moment cough vociferously most man have a tendency to vent ill-humour on some one and they generally do it on one whom they deem to be worse than themselves henri therefore instead of growl at joe for rouse he scold dick for not rise ha mauvais dog bad chien vill you dare to look to I crusoe do look with amiable placidity as though to say howl away old boy i will not budge till dick do with a mighty effort giant sleep be throw off at last and the hunter be once more on they journey canter lightly over the soft turf ho let 's have a run cry dick unable to repress the feeling arouse by the exhilarating morning air have a care boy cry joe as they stretch out at full gallop keep off the ridge it be riddled wus ' badger -- ha i think so at that moment dick 's horse put its foot into a badger-hole and turn completely over send its rider through the air in a curve that a east indian acrobat would have envy for a few seconds dick lay flat on he back then he jump up and laugh while he comrade hurry up anxiously to he assistance no bone break inquire joe dick give a hysterical gasp i -- i think not let 's have a look no nothin ' to speak o ' be good luck ye should niver go slap through a badger country like that boy always keep i ' the bottom where the grass be short now then up ye go that be it dick remount though not with quite so elastic a spring as usual and they push forward at a more reasonable pace accident of this kind be of common occurrence in the prairie some horse however be so well train that they look sharp out for these hole which be generally find to be most numerous on the high and dry grounds but in spite of all the caution both of man and horse many ugly fall take place and sometimes bone be break they have not go far after this accident when a antelope leap from a clump of willow and make for a belt of woodland that lay along the margin of a stream not half-a-mile off hurrah cry dick forget he recent fall come along crusoe and away they go again full tilt for the horse have not be injure by its somersault the antelope which dick be thus wildly pursue be of the same species as the one he have shoot some time before -- namely the prong-horned antelope these graceful creature have long slender limb delicately-formed head and large beautiful eye the horn be black and rather short they have no branch like the antler of the red-deer but have a single projection on each horn near the head and the extreme point of the horn curve suddenly inwards form the hook or prong from which the name of the animal be derive they color be dark yellowish brown they be so fleet that not one horse in a hundred can overtake they and they sight and sense of smell be so acute that it would be next to impossible to kill they be it not for the inordinate curiosity which we have before refer to the indian manage to attract these simple little creature by merely lie down on they back and kick they heel in the air or by wave any white object on the point of a arrow while the hunter keep conceal by lie flat in the grass by these mean a herd of antelope may be induce to wheel round and round a object in timid but intense surprise gradually approach until they come near enough to enable the hunter to make sure of he mark thus the animal which of all other _ ought _ to be the most difficult to slay be in consequence of they insatiable curiosity more easily shoot than any other deer of the plain may we not gently suggest to the reader for he or she consideration that there be human antelope so to speak whose case bear a striking resemblance to the prong-horn of the north american prairie dick 's horse be no match for the antelope neither be crusoe so they pull up shortly and return to they companion to be laugh at it be no manner o ' use to wind yer horse lad after sich game they be not much worth a ' if i mistake not we 'll be among the buffalo soon there be fresh track everywhere and the herd be scatter now ye see when they keep together in band o ' thousand ye do not so often fall in wus ' they but when they scatter about in two a ' three a ' six ye may shoot they every day as much as ye please several group of buffalo have already be see on the horizon but as a red-deer have be shoot in a belt of woodland the day before they do not pursue they the red-deer be very much larger than the prong-horned antelope and be highly esteem both for its flesh and its skin which latter become almost like chamoix leather when dress notwithstanding this supply of food the hunter could not resist the temptation to give chase to a herd of about nine buffalo that suddenly come into view as they overtop a undulation in the plain it be no use cry dick i _ must _ go at they joe himself catch fire from the spirit of he young friend so call to henrus to come on and let the pack-horse remain to feed he dash away in pursuit the buffalo give one stare of surprise and then flee as fast as possible at first it seem as if such huge unwieldy carcass could not run very fast but in a few minute they manage to get up a pace that put the horse to they mettle indeed at first it seem as if the hunter do not gain a inch but by degree they close with they for buffalo be not long wind on near the herd the three man diverge from each other and select they animal henrus be short-sighted naturally single out the largest and the largest -- also naturally -- be a tough old bull joe bring down a fat young cow at the first shot and dick be equally fortunate but he well-nigh shoot crusoe who just as he be about to fire rush in unexpectedly and spring at the animal 's throat for which piece of recklessness he be order back to watch the pack-horse meanwhile henrus by dint of yell throw he arm wildly about and digging he heel into the side of he long-legged horse succeed in come close up with the bull which once or twice turn he clumsy body half round and glare furiously at its pursuer with its small black eye suddenly it stick out its tail stop short and turn full round henrus stop short also now the stick out of a buffalo 's tail have a peculiar significance which it be well to point out it serve in a sense the same purpose to the hunter that the compass do to the mariner -- it point out where to go and what to do when gallop away in ordinary flight the buffalo carry he tail like ordinary cattle which indicate that you may push on when wound he lash it from side to side or carry it over he back up in the air this indicate look out haul off a bit but when he carry it stiff and horizontal with a _ slight curve _ in the middle of it it say plainly keep back or kill I as quick as you can for that be what indian call the _ mad tail _ and be a sign that mischief be brew henrus 's bull display the mad tail just before turn but he do not observe it and accordingly wait for the bull to move and show he shoulder for a favourable shot but instead of do this he put he head down and foam with rage go at he full tilt the big horse never stir it seem to be petrified henrus have just time to fire at the monster 's neck and the next moment be sprawl on he back with the horse rolling over four or five yard beyond he it be a most effective tableau -- henrus rub he shin and grin with pain the horse gaze in affright as he rise tremble from the plain and the buffalo bull look on half stunned and evidently very much surprised at the result of he charge fortunately before he could repeat the experiment dick gallop up and put a ball through he heart joe and he comrade feel a little ashamed of they exploit on this occasion for there be no need to have kill three animal -- they could not have carry with they more than a small portion of one -- and they upbraid themselves several time during the operation of cut out the tongue and other choice portion of the two victim as for the bull he be almost totally useless so they leave he as a gift to the wolf now that they have come among the buffalo wolf be often see sneak about and lick they hungry jaw but although they approach pretty near to the camp at night they do not give the hunter any concern even crusoe become accustomed to they at last and cease to notice they these creature be very dangerous sometimes however and when hard press by hunger will even attack man the day after this hunt the traveller come upon a wounded old buffalo which have evidently escape from the indian -lrb- for a couple of arrow be stick in its side -rrb- only to fall a prey to he deadly enemy the white wolf these savage brute hang on the skirt of the herd of buffalo to attack and devour any one that may chance from old age or from be wound to linger behind the rest the buffalo be tough and fierce however and fight so desperately that although surround by fifty or a hundred wolf he keep up the unequal combat for several day before he finally succumb the old bull that we traveller discover have evidently be long engage with he ferocious adversary for he limb and flesh be tear in shred in many place and blood be streaming from he side yet he have fight so gallantly that he have toss and stamp to death dozen of the enemy there could not have be fewer than fifty wolf round he and they have just conclude another of many futile attack when the hunter come up for they be range in a circle round they huge adversary -- some lie down some sit on they haunch to rest and other sneak about loll out they red tongue and lick they chop as if impatient to renew the combat the poor buffalo be nearly spend and it be clear that a few hour more would see he tear to shred and he bone pick clean ugh de brute ejaculate henrus they do not seem to mind we a bit remark dick as they ride up to within pistol shoot it 'll be merciful to give the old fellow a shot say joe they varmint be sure to finish he at last joe raise he rifle as he speak and fire the old bull give he last groan and fall while the wolf alarm by the shot flee in all direction but they do not run far they know well that some portion at least of the carcass would fall to they share so they sit down at various distance all round to wait as patiently as they might for the hunter to retire dick leave the scene with a feeling of regret that the villanous wolf should have they feast so much sooner than they expect yet after all why should we call these wolf villanous they do nothing wrong -- nothing contrary to the law of they peculiar nature nay if we come to reason upon it they rank higher in this matter than man for while the wolf do no violence to the law of its instinct man often deliberately silence the voice of conscience and violate the law of he own nature but we will not insist on the term good reader if you object strongly to it we be willing to admit that the wolf be _ not _ villanous but _ assuredly _ they be unlovable in the course of the afternoon the three horseman reach a small creek the bank of which be line with a few stunt shrub and tree have eat nothing since the night before they dismount here to feed as joe express it cur ` ous thing remark joe as he strike a light by means of flint steel and tinder-box -- cur ` ous thing that we be make to need sich a lot o ' grub if we could only get on like the sarpint now wot can breakfast on a rabbit and then wait a month or two for dinner be not it cur ` ous dick admit that it be and stoop to blow the fire into a blaze here henri utter a cry of consternation and stand speechless with he mouth open what be the matter what be ' t cry dick and joe seize they rifle instinctively de -- grub -- he -- be -- forgat there be a look of blank horror and then a burst of laughter from dick varley well well cry he we have get lot o ' tea a ' sugar a ' some flour we can git on wus ' that till we shoot another buffalo or a -- ha dick observe a wild turkey stalk among the willow as he speak it be fully a hundred yard off and only its head be see above the leaf this be a matter of little moment however for by aim a little lower he know that he must hit the body but dick have drive the nail too often to aim at its body he aim at the bird 's eye and cut its head off fetch it crusoe in three minute it be at dick 's foot and it be not too much to say that in five minute more it be in the pot as this unexpected supply make up for the loss of the meat which henri have forget at they last halting-place they equanimity be restore and while the meal be in preparation dick shoulder he rifle and go into the bush to try for another turkey he do not get one however but he shoot a couple of prairie-hen which be excellent eating moreover he find a large quantity of wild grape and plum these be unfortunately not nearly ripe but dick resolve to try he hand at a new dish so he stuff the breast of he coat full of they after the pot be empty dick wash it out and put a little clean water in it then he pour some flour in and stir it well while this be heat he squeeze the sour grape and plum into what joe call a mush mixed it with a spoonful of sugar and empty it into the pot he also skim a quantity of the fat from the remains of the turkey soup and add that to the mess which he stir with earnest diligence till it boil down into a sort of thick porridge d'ye think it 'll be good ask joe gravely i have I doubt of it we 'll see -- hold the tin dish henrus take care of de finger ha it look magnifique -- superb the first spoonful produce a expression on henrus 's face that need not to be interpret it be as sour as vinegar ye 'll ha ' to eat it yerself dick lad cry joe throw down he spoon and spit out the unsavoury mess nonsense cry dick bolt two or three mouthful and try to look as if he like it try again it be not so bad as you think ho-o-o-o-o cry henrus after the second mouthful ti vingre all de sugare in de pack would not make more sweeter one bite of it dick be oblige to confess the dish a failure so it be throw out after have be offer to crusoe who give it one sniff and turn away in silence then they mount and resume they journey at this place mosquito and horse-fly trouble we hunter and they steed a good deal the latter especially be very annoying to the poor horse they bite they so much that the blood at last come trickle down they side they be trouble also once or twice by cockchafer and locust which annoy they not indeed by bite but by fly blindly against they face and often-narrowly miss hit they in the eye once particularly they be so bad that henrus in he wrath open he lip to pronounce a malediction on the whole race when a cockchafer fly straight into he mouth and to use he own forcible expression nearly knock he off de hoss but these be minor evil and scarcely cost the hunter a thought chapter xii _ wanderings on the prairie _ -- _ a war party _ -- _ chase by indian _ -- _ a bold leap for life _ for many day the three hunter wander over the trackless prairie in search of a village of the sioux indian but fail to find one for the indian be in the habit of shift they ground and follow the buffalo several time they see small isolate band of indian but these they carefully avoid fear they might turn out to be war party and if they fall into they hand the white man could not expect civil treatment whatever nation the indian might belong to during the greater portion of this time they meet with numerous herd of buffalo and deer and be well supply with food but they have to cook it during the day be afraid to light a fire at night while indian be prowl about one night they halt near the bed of a stream which be almost dry they have travel a day and a night without water and both man and horse be almost choke so that when they see the tree on the horizon which indicate the presence of a stream they push forward with almost frantic haste hope it be not dry say joe anxiously as they gallop up to it no there be water lad and they dash forward to a pool that have not yet be dry up they drink long and eagerly before they notice that the pool be strongly impregnate with salt many stream in those part of the prairie be quite salt but fortunately this one be not utterly undrinkable though it be very unpalatable we 'll make it better lad say joe digging a deep hole in the sand with he hand a little below the pool in a short time the water filter through and though not render fresh it be nevertheless much improve we may light a fire to-night d'ye think inquire dick we have not seed injun for some day p ` r ` ap ` twould be better not say joe but i daresay we be safe enough a fire be therefore light in as sheltered a spot as could be find and the three friend bivouac as usual towards dawn they be arouse by a angry growl from crusoe it be a wolf likely say dick but all three seize and cock they rifle nevertheless again crusoe growl more angrily than before and spring out of the camp snuff the breeze anxiously up lad catch the nag there be something in the wind for the dog niver do that afore in a few seconds the horse be saddle and the pack secure call in the dog whisper joe blunt if he bark they 'll find out we whereabouts here crusoe come -- it be too late the dog bark loudly and savagely at the moment and a troop of indian come course over the plain on hear the unwonted sound they wheel directly and make for the camp it be a war party fly lad nothin ' 'll save we scalp now but we horse ' heel cry joe in a moment they vault into the saddle and urge they steed forward at the utmost speed the savage observe they and with a exult yell dash after they feel that there be now no need of concealment the three horseman strike off into the open prairie intend to depend entirely on the speed and stamen of they horse as we have before remark they be good one but the indian soon prove that they be equally well if not better mount it 'll be a hard run say joe in a low mutter tone and look furtively over he shoulder the varmint be mount on wild horse -- leastway they be wild not long agone they chap can throw the lasso and trip a mustang as well as a mexican mind the badger-hole dick -- hold in a bit henrus yer nag do not need drivin ' a foot in a hole just now would cost we we scalp keep down by the creek lad ha how dey yell say henrus in a savage tone look back and shake he rifle at they a act that cause they to yell more fiercely than ever dis old pack-hoss give I moche trobel the pace be now tremendous pursuer and pursue rise and sink on the prairie billow as they sweep along till they come to what be term a divide ridge which be a cross wave as it be that cut the other in two thus form a continuous level here they advance more easily but the advantage be equally share with they pursuer who continue the headlong pursuit with occasional yell which serve to show the fugitive that they at least do not gain ground a little to the right of the direction in which they be fly a blue line be see on the horizon this indicate the existence of tree to joe 's practice eye and feeling that if the horse break down they could better make a last manful stand in the wood than on the plain he urge he steed towards it the savage notice the movement at once and utter a yell of exultation for they regard it as a evidence that the fugitive doubt the strength of they horse ye have not get we yet mutter joe with a sardonic grin if they get near we dick keep yer eye open a ' look out for yer neck else they 'll drop a noose over it they will afore ye know they be near a ' haul ye off like a sack dick nod in reply but do not speak for at that moment he eye be fix on a small creek ahead which they must necessarily leap or dash across it be line with clump of scatter shrubbery and he glance rapidly for the most suitable place to pass joe and henrus do the same and have diverge a little to the different point choose they dash through the shrubbery and be hide from each other 's view on approach the edge of the stream dick find to he consternation that the bank be twenty foot high opposite he and too wide for any horse to clear wheeling aside without check speed at the risk of throw he steed he ride along the margin of the stream for a few hundred yard until he find a ford -- at least such a spot as might be clear by a bold leap the temporary check however have enable a indian to gain so close upon he heel that he exult yell sound close in he ear with a vigorous bind he gallant little horse go over crusoe could not take it but he rush down the one bank and up the other so that he only lose a few yard these few yard however be sufficient to bring the indian close upon he as he clear the stream at full gallop the savage whirl he lasso swiftly round for a second and in another moment crusoe utter a tremendous roar as he be trip up violently on the plain dick hear the cry of he faithful dog and turn quickly round just in time to see he spring at the horse 's throat and bring both steed and rider down upon he dick 's heart leap to he throat have a thousand savage be rush on he he would have fly to the rescue of he favorite but a unexpected obstacle come in the way he fiery little steed excite by the headlong race and the howl of the indian have take the bit in he tooth and be now unmanageable dick tear at the rein like a maniac and in the height of he frenzy even raise the butt of he rifle with the intent to strike the poor horse to the earth but he better nature prevail he check the uplifted hand and with a groan drop the rein and sink almost helplessly forward on the saddle for several of the indian have leave the main body and be pursue he alone so that there would have be now no chance of he reach the place where crusoe fall even if he could have turn he horse spiritless and utterly indifferent to what he fate might be dick varley ride along with he head droop and keep he seat almost mechanically while the mettlesome little steed fly on over wave and hollow gradually he awaken from this state of despair to a sense of danger glance round he observe that the indian be now far behind he though still pursue he also observe that he companion be gallop mile away on the horizon to the left and that he have foolishly allow the savage to get between he and they the only chance that remain for he be to outride he pursuer and circle round towards he comrade and this he hope to accomplish for he little horse have now prove itself to be superior to those of the indian and there be good running in he still urge he forward therefore he soon leave the savage still farther behind and feeling confident that they could not now overtake he he rein up and dismount the pursuer quickly draw near but short though it be the rest do he horse good vault into the saddle he again stretch out and now skirt along the margin of a wood which seem to mark the position of a river of considerable size at this moment he horse put he foot into a badger-hole and both of they come heavily to the ground in a instant dick rise pick up he gun and leap unhurt into the saddle but on urge he poor horse forward he find that its shoulder be badly sprain there be no room for mercy however -- life and death be in the balance -- so he ply the lash vigorously and the noble steed warm into something like a run when again it stumble and fall with a crash on the ground while the blood burst from its mouth and nostril dick could hear the shout of triumph utter by he pursuer my poor poor horse he exclaim in a tone of the deepest commiseration while he stoop and stroke its foam-studded neck the die steed raise its head for a moment it almost seem as if to acknowledge the tone of affection then it sink down with a gurgle groan dick spring up for the indian be now upon he and bound like a antelope into the thickest of the shrubbery which be nowhere thick enough however to prevent the indian follow still it sufficiently retard they to render the chase a more equal one than could have be expect in a few minute dick gain a strip of open ground beyond and find himself on the bank of a broad river whose evidently deep water rush impetuously along they unobstructed channel the bank at the spot where he reach it be a sheer precipice of between thirty and forty foot high glance up and down the river he retreat a few pace turn round and shake he clenched fist at the savage accompany the action with a shout of defiance and then run to the edge of the bank spring far out into the boiling flood and sink the indian pull up on reach the spot there be no possibility of gallop down the wood-encumbered bank after the fugitive but quick as think each red-man leap to the ground and fitting a arrow to he bow await dick 's re-appearance with eager gaze young though he be and unskilled in such wild warfare dick know well enough what sort of reception he would meet with on come to the surface so he keep under water as long as he could and strike out as vigorously as the care of he rifle would permit at last he rise for a few seconds and immediately half-a-dozen arrow whiz through the air but most of they fall short -- only one pass close to he cheek and go with a whip into the river he immediately sink again and the next time he rise to breathe he be far beyond the reach of he indian enemy chapter xiii _ escape from indian -- a discovery -- alone in the desert _ dick varley have spend so much of he boyhood in sport about among the water of the river and lake near which he have be rear and especially during the last two year have spend so much of he leisure time in rolling and diving with he dog crusoe in the lake of the mustang valley that he have become almost as expert in the water as a south sea islander so that when he find himself whirling down the rapid river as already describe he be more impressed with a feeling of gratitude to god for he escape from the indian than anxiety about get ashore he be not altogether blind or indifferent to the danger into which he might be hurl if the channel of the river should be find lower down to be break with rock or should a waterfall unexpectedly appear after float down a sufficient distance to render pursuit out of the question he strike into the bank opposite to that from which he have plunge and clamber up to the greensward above strip off the greater part of he clothing and hang it on the branch of a bush to dry then he sit down on the trunk of a fall tree to consider what course he have best pursue in he present circumstance these circumstance be by no means calculate to inspire he with hope or comfort he be in the midst of a unknown wilderness hundred of mile from any white man 's settlement surround by savage without food or blanket he companion go he know not whither -- perhaps take and kill by the indian he horse dead and he dog the most trusty and loving of all he friend lose to he probably for ever a more veteran heart might have quail in the midst of such accumulate evil but dick varley possess a strong young and buoyant constitution which unite with a hopefulness of disposition that almost nothing could overcome enable he very quickly to cast aside the gloomy view of he case and turn to its brighter aspect he still grasp he good rifle that be some comfort and as he eye fall upon it he turn with anxiety to examine into the condition of he powder-horn and the few thing that he have be fortunate enough to carry away with he about he person the horn in which western hunter carry they powder be usually that of a ox it be close up at the large end with a piece of hard wood fit tightly into it and the small end be close with a wooden peg or stopper it be therefore completely water-tight and may be for hour immerse without the powder get wet unless the stopper should chance to be knock out dick find to he great satisfaction that the stopper be fast and the powder perfectly dry moreover he have by good fortune fill it full two day before from the package that contain the general stock of ammunition so that there be only two or three charge out of it he percussion cap however be completely destroy and even though they have not be it would have matter little for he do not possess more than half-a-dozen but this be not so great a misfortune as at first it might seem for he have the spare flint lock and the little screw-driver necessary for fix and unfix they stow away in he shot pouch to examine he supply of bullet be he next care and slowly he count they out one by one to the number of thirty this be a pretty fair supply and with careful economy would last he many day have relieve he mind on these all-important point he carefully examine every pouch and corner of he dress to ascertain the exact amount and value of he wealth besides the leather leggings moccasin deerskin hunting-shirt cap and belt which compose he costume he have a short heavy hunting-knife a piece of tinder a little tin pannikin which he have be in the habit of carry at he belt and a large cake of maple sugar this last be a species of sugar which be procure by the indian from the maple-tree several cake of it have be carry off from the pawnee village and dick usually carry one in the breast of he coat besides these thing he find that the little bible for which he mother have make a small inside breast-pocket be safe dick 's heart smite he when he take it out and undo the clasp for he have not look at it until that day it be firmly bind with a brass clasp so that although the binding and the edge of the leaf be soak the inside be quite dry on open the book to see if it have be damage a small paper fall out pick it up quickly he unfold it and read in he mother 's handwriting : _ call upon I in the time of trouble and i will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify I my son give I thine heart _ dick 's eye fill with tear while the sound as it be of he mother 's voice thus reach he unexpectedly in that lonely wilderness like too many whose heart be young and gay dick have regard religion if not as a gloomy at least as not a cheerful thing but he feel the comfort of these word at that moment and he resolve seriously to peruse he mother 's parting gift in time to come the sun be hot and a warm breeze gently shake the leaf so that dick 's garment be soon dry a few minute serve to change the lock of he rifle draw the wet charge dry out the barrel and re-load then throw it across he shoulder he enter the wood and walk lightly away and well he might poor fellow for at that moment he feel light enough in person if not in heart he worldly goods be not such as to oppress he but the little note have turn he thought towards home and he feel comfort traverse the belt of woodland that mark the course of the river dick soon emerge on the wide prairie beyond and here he pause in some uncertainty as to how he should proceed he be too good a backwoodsman albeit so young to feel perplexed as to the point of the compass he know pretty well what hour it be so that the sun show he the general bearing of the country and he know that when night come he could correct he course by the pole star dick 's knowledge of astronomy be limit he know only one star by name but that one be a inestimable treasure of knowledge he perplexity be owe to he uncertainty as to the direction in which he companion and they pursuer have go for he have make up he mind to follow they trail if possible and render all the succor he single arm might afford to desert they and make for the settlement he hold would be a faithless and cowardly act while they be together joe blunt have often talk to he about the route he mean to pursue to the rocky mountain so that if they have escape the indian he think there might be some chance of find they at last but to set against this there be the probability that they have be take and carry away in a totally different direction or they might have take to the river as he have do and go farther down without he observe they then again if they have escape they would be sure to return and search the country round for he so that if he leave the spot he might miss they oh for my dear pup crusoe he exclaim aloud in this dilemma but the faithful ear be shut now and the deep silence that follow he cry be so oppressive that the young hunter spring forward at a run over the plain as if to fly from solitude he soon become so absorb however in he effort to find the trail of he companion that he forget all other consideration and run straight forward for hour together with he eye eagerly fix on the ground at last he feel so hungry have taste no food since supper-time the previous evening that he halt for the purpose of eat a morsel of maple sugar a line of bush in the distance indicate water so he speed on again and be soon seat beneath a willow drinking water from the cool stream no game be to be find here but there be several kind of berry among which wild grape and plum grow in abundance with these and some sugar he make a meal though not a good one for the berry be quite green and intensely sour all that day dick varley follow up the trail of he companion which he discover at a ford in the river they have cross therefore in safety though still pursue so he run on at a regular trot and with a little more hope than he have feel during the day towards night however dick 's heart sink again for he come upon innumerable buffalo track among which those of the horse soon become mingle up so that he lose they altogether hope to find they again more easily by broad daylight he go to the nearest clump of willow he could find and encamp for the night remember the use formerly make of the tall willow he set to work to construct a cover to protect he from the dew as he have no blanket or buffalo skin he use leaf and grass instead and find it a better shelter than he have expect especially when the fire be light and a pannikin of hot sugar and water smoke at he foot but as no game be to be find he be again compel to sup off unripe berry before lie down to rest he remember he resolution and pull out the little bible read a portion of it by the fitful blaze of the fire and feel great comfort in its bless word it seem to he like a friend with whom he could converse in the midst of he loneliness the plunge into the river have break dick 's pipe and destroy he tobacco he now feel the want of that luxury very severely and never have want it before he be greatly surprise to find how much he have become enslave to the habit it cost he more than a hour 's rest that night the craving for he wonted pipe the sagacious reader will doubtless not fail here to ask himself the question whether it be wise in man to create in himself a unnatural and totally unnecessary appetite which may and often do entail hour -- ay sometimes month -- of exceed discomfort but we would not for a moment presume to suggest such a question to he we have a distinct objection to the ordinary method of what be call draw a moral it be much better to leave wise man to do this for themselves next morning dick rise with the sun and start without breakfast prefer to take he chance of find a bird or animal of some kind before long to feed again on sour berry he be disappointed however in find the track of he companion the ground here be hard and sandy so that little or no impression of a distinct kind be make on it and as buffalo have traverse it in all direction he be soon utterly bewildered he think it possible that by run out for several mile in a straight line and then take a wide circuit round he might find the track emerge from the confusion make by the buffalo but he be again disappoint for the buffalo track still continue and the ground become less capable of show a footprint soon dick begin to feel so ill and weak from eat such poor fare that he give up all hope of discover the track and be compel to push forward at he utmost speed in order to reach a less barren district where he might procure fresh meat but the farther he advance the worse and more sandy do the district become for several day he push on over this arid waste without see bird or beast and to add to he misery he fail at last to find water for a day and a night he wander about in a burning fever and he throat so parched that he be almost suffocate towards the close of the second day he see a slight line of bush away down in a hollow on he right with eager step he stagger towards they and on draw near beheld -- bless sight -- a stream of water glancing in the beam of the setting sun dick try to shout for joy but he parched throat refuse to give utterance to the voice it matter not exert all he remain strength he rush down the bank drop he rifle and plunge headforemost into the stream the first mouthful send a thrill of horror to he heart it be salt as brine the poor youth 's cup of bitterness be now full to overflow crawl out of the stream he sink down on the bank in a species of lethargic torpor from which he awaken next morning in a rage fever delirium soon render he insensible to he suffering the sun rise like a ball of fire and shine down with scorching power on the arid plain what matter it to dick he be far away in the shady grove of the mustang valley chase the deer at time but more frequently cool he limb and sport with crusoe in the bright blue lake now he be in he mother 's cottage tell she how he have think of she when far away on the prairie and what a bright sweet word it be she have whisper in he ear -- so unexpectedly too anon he be scour over the plain on horseback with the savage at he heel and at such time dick would spring with almost supernatural strength from the ground and run madly over the burning plain but as if by a species of fascination he always return to the salt river and sink exhaust by its side or plunge helplessly into its water these sudden immersion usually restore he for a short time to reason and he would crawl up the bank and gnaw a morsel of the maple sugar but he could not eat much for it be in a tough compact cake which he jaw have not power to break all that day and the next night he lay on the bank of the salt stream or rush wildly over the plain it be about noon of the second day after he attack that he creep slowly out of the water into which he have plunge a few seconds before he mind be restore but he feel a indescribable sensation of weakness that seem to he to be the approach of death creep towards the place where he rifle lay he fall exhaust beside it and lay he cheek on the bible which have fall out of he pocket there while he eye be close in a dreamy sort of half-waking slumber he feel the rough hairy coat of a animal brush against he forehead the idea of be tear to piece by wolf flash instantly across he mind and with a shriek of terror he spring up -- to be almost overwhelm by the caress of he faithful dog yes there he be bound round he master bark and whine and give vent to every possible expression of canine joy chapter xiv _ crusoe 's return and he private adventure among the indian -- dick at a very low ebb -- crusoe save he _ the means by which crusoe manage to escape from he two-legged captor and rejoin he master require separate and special notice in the struggle with the fall horse and indian which dick have see begin but not conclude he be almost crush to death and the instant the indian gain he foot he send a arrow at he head with savage violence crusoe however have be so well use to dodge the blunt-headed arrow that be wont to be shoot at he by the boy of the mustang valley that he be quite prepared and elude the shaft by a active bind moreover he utter one of he own peculiar roar fly at the indian 's throat and drag he down at the same moment the other indian come up and one of they turn aside to the rescue this man happen to have a old gun of the cheap sort at that time exchange for peltry by the fur-trader with the butt of this he strike crusoe a blow on the head that send he sprawl on the grass the rest of the savage as we have see continue in pursuit of dick until he leap into the river then they return take the saddle and bridle off he dead horse and rejoin they comrade here they hold a court-martial on crusoe who be now bind foot and muzzle with cord some be for kill he other who admire he noble appearance immense size and courage think it would be well to carry he to they village and keep he there be a pretty violent dispute on the subject but at length it be agree that they should spare he life in the meantime and perhaps have a dog-dance round he when they get to they wigwam this dance of which crusoe be to be the chief though passive performer be peculiar to some of the tribe east of the rocky mountain and consist in kill a dog and cut out its liver which be afterwards slice into shred or string and hang on a pole about the height of a man 's head a band of warrior then come and dance wildly round this pole and each one in succession go up to the raw liver and bite a piece off it without however put he hand near it such be the dog-dance and to such be poor crusoe destine by he fierce captor especially by the one whose throat still bear very evident mark of he tooth but crusoe be much too clever a dog to be dispose of in so disgust a manner he have privately resolve in he own mind that he would escape but the hopelessness of he ever carry that resolution into effect would have be apparent to any one who could have see the way in which he muzzle be secure and he four paw be tie together in a bunch as he hang suspend across the saddle of one of the savage this particular party of indian who have follow dick varley determine not to wait for the return of they comrade who be in pursuit of the other two hunter but to go straight home so for several day they gallop away over the prairie at night when they encamp crusoe be throw on the ground like a piece of old lumber and leave to lie there with a mere scrap of food till morning when he be again throw across the horse of he captor and carry on when the village be reach he be throw again on the ground and would certainly have be tear to piece in five minute by the indian cur which come howling round he have not a old woman come to the rescue and drive they away with the help of she grand-son -- a little naked creature just able to walk or rather to stagger -- she drag he to she tent and undoing the line that fasten he mouth offer he a bone although lie in a position that be unfavourable for eat purpose crusoe open he jaw and take it a awful crash be follow by two crunch -- and it be go and crusoe look up in the old squaw 's face with a look that say plainly another of the same please and as quick as possible the old woman give he another and then a lump of meat which latter go down with a gulp but he cough after it and it be well he do not choke after this the squaw leave he and crusoe spend the remainder of that night gnawing the cord that bind he so diligent be he that he be free before morning and walk deliberately out of the tent then he shake himself and with a yell that one might have fancy be intend for defiance he bound joyfully away and be soon out of sight to a dog with a good appetite which have be on short allowance for several day the mouthful give to he by the old squaw be a mere nothing all that day he keep bound over the plain from bluff to bluff in search of something to eat but find nothing until dusk when he pounce suddenly and most unexpectedly on a prairie-hen fast asleep in one moment its life be go in less than a minute its body be go too -- feather and bone and all -- down crusoe 's ravenous throat on the identical spot crusoe lay down and sleep like a top for four hour at the end of that time he jump up bolt a scrap of skin that somehow have be overlook at supper and fly straight over the prairie to the spot where he have have the scuffle with the indian he come to the edge of the river take precisely the same leap that he master have do before he and come out on the other side a good deal higher up than dick have do for the dog have no savage to dodge and be as we have say before a powerful swimmer it cost he a good deal of run about to find the trail and it be nearly dark before he resume he journey then put he keen nose to the ground he run step by step over dick 's track and at last find he as we have show on the bank of the salt creek it be quite impossible to describe the intense joy which fill dick 's heart on again behold he favorite only those who have lose and find such a one can know it dick seize he round the neck and hug he as well as he could poor fellow in he feeble arm then he weep then he laugh and then he faint this be a consummation that take crusoe quite aback never have see he master in such a state before he seem to think at first that he be play some trick for he bound round he and bark and wag he tail but as dick lay quite still and motionless he go forward with a look of alarm snuff he once or twice and whine piteously then he raise he nose in the air and utter a long melancholy wail the cry seem to revive dick for he move and with some difficulty sit up to the dog 's evident relief there be no doubt whatever that crusoe learn a erroneous lesson that day and be firmly convinced thenceforth that the best cure for a faint fit be a melancholy yell so easy be it for the wisest of dog as well as man to fall into gross error crusoe say dick in a feeble voice dear good pup come here he crawl as he speak down to the water 's edge where there be a level patch of dry sand dig say dick point to the sand crusoe look at he in surprise as well he might for he have never hear the word dig in all he life before dick ponder a minute then a think strike he he turn up a little of the sand with he finger and point to the hole cry _ seek he out pup _ ha crusoe understand _ that _ many and many a time have he unhoused rabbit and squirrel and other creature at that word of command so without a moment 's delay he commence to dig down into the sand every now and then stop for a moment and shove in he nose and snuff interrogatively as if he fully expect to find a buffalo at the bottom of it then he would resume again one paw after another so fast that you could scarce see they go -- hand over hand as sailor would have call it -- while the sand fly out between he hind leg in a continuous shower when the sand accumulate so much behind he as to impede he motion he scrape it out of he way and set to work again with tenfold earnestness after a good while he pause and look up at dick with a it-won ` t-do-i-fear-there 's - nothing-here expression on he face seek he out pup repeat dick oh very good mutely answer the dog and go at it again tooth and nail harder than ever in the course of a quarter of a hour there be a deep yawn hole in the sand into which dick peer with intense anxiety the bottom appear slightly _ damp _ hope now reanimate dick varley and by various device he succeed in get the dog to scrape away a sort of tunnel from the hole into which he might roll himself and put down he lip to drink when the water should rise high enough impatiently and anxiously he lay watch the moisture slowly accumulate in the bottom of the hole drop by drop and while he gaze he fall into a troubled restless slumber and dream that crusoe 's return be a dream and that he be alone again perish for want of water when he awaken the hole be half full of clear water and crusoe be lap it greedily back pup he shout as he creep down to the hole and put he tremble lip to the water it be brackish but drinkable and as dick drink deeply of it he esteem it at that moment better than nectar here he lay for half-an-hour alternately drink and gaze in surprise at he own emaciated visage as reflect in the pool the same afternoon crusoe in a private hunting excursion of he own discover and catch a prairie-hen which he quietly proceed to devour on the spot when dick who see what have occur whistle to he obedience be engrain in every fiber of crusoe 's mental and corporeal be he do not merely answer at once to the call -- he _ spring _ to it leave the prairie-hen untasted fetch it pup cry dick eagerly as the dog come up in a few moment the hen be at he foot dick 's circumstance could not brook the delay of cookery he gash the bird with he knife and drink the blood and then give the flesh to the dog while he creep to the pool again for another draught ah think not reader that although we have treat this subject in a slight vein of pleasantry because it end well that therefore we tale be pure fiction not only be indian glad to satisfy the urgent craving of hunger with raw flesh but many civilized man and delicately nurture have do the same -- ay and doubtless will do the same again as long as enterprising and fearless man shall go forth to dare the danger of flood and field in the wild place of we wonderful world crusoe have finish he share of the feast before dick return from the pool then master and dog lay down together side by side and fall into a long deep peaceful slumber chapter xv _ health and happiness return _ -- incident of the journey _ -- _ a buffalo shot _ -- _ a wild horse crease _ -- _ dick 's battle with a mustang _ dick varley 's fear and trouble in the meantime be end on the day follow he awake refresh and happy -- so happy and light at heart as he feel the glow of return health course through he vein that he fancy he must have dream it all in fact he be so certain that he muscle be strong that he endeavor to leap up but be powerfully convince of he true condition by the miserable stagger that result from the effort however he know he be recover so he rise and thank god for he recovery and for the new hope that be raise in he heart he go down to the pool and drink deeply of its water then he return and sit down beside he dog open the bible and read long -- and for the first time _ earnestly _ -- the story of christ 's love for sinful man he at last fall asleep over the book and when he awaken feel so much refresh in body and mind that he determine to attempt to pursue he journey he have not proceed far when he come upon a colony of prairie-dog upon this occasion he be little inclined to take a humorous view of the vagary of these curious little creature but he shoot one and as before eat part of it raw these creature be so active that they be difficult to shoot and even when kill generally fall into they hole and disappear crusoe however soon unearth the dead animal on this occasion that night the traveller come to a stream of fresh water and dick kill a turkey so that he determine to spend a couple of day there to recruit at the end of that time he again set out but be able only to advance five mile when he break down in fact it become evident to he that he must have a longer period of absolute repose ere he could hope to continue he journey but to do so without food be impossible fortunately there be plenty of water as he course lay along the margin of a small stream and as the arid piece of prairie be now behind he he hope to fall in with bird or perhaps deer soon while he be plod heavily and wearily along ponder these thing he come to the brow of a wave from which he behold a most magnificent view of green grassy plain deck with flower and roll out to the horizon with a stream meander through it and clump of tree scatter everywhere far and wide it be a glorious sight but the most glorious object in it to dick at that time be a fat buffalo which stand grazing not a hundred yard off the wind be blow towards he so that the animal do not scent he and as he come up very slowly and it be turn away it do not see he crusoe would have spring forward in a instant but he master 's finger impose silence and caution tremble with eagerness dick sink flat down in the grass cock both barrel of he piece and rest it on he left hand with he left elbow on the ground he wait until the animal should present its side in a few seconds it move dick 's eye glance along the barrel but it tremble -- he wonted steadiness of aim be go he fire and the buffalo spring off in terror with a groan of despair he fire again -- almost recklessly -- and the buffalo fall it rise once or twice and stumble forward a few pace then it fall again meanwhile dick reload with tremble hand and advance to give it another shot but it be not needful -- the buffalo be already dead now crusoe say dick sit down on the buffalo 's shoulder and pat he favorite on the head we be all right at last you and i shall have a jolly time o ' t pup from this time for ` ard dick pause for breath and crusoe wag he tail and look as if to say -- pshaw _ as if _ we tell you what it be reader it be of no use at all to go on write as if when we tell you what crusoe say if there be any language in eye whatever -- if there be language in a tail in a cocked ear in a mobile eyebrow in the point of a canine nose -- if there be language in any terrestrial thing at all apart from that which flow from the tongue then crusoe _ speak _ do we not speak at this moment to _ you _ and if so then tell I wherein lie the difference between a write _ letter _ and a give _ sign _ yes crusoe speak he say to dick as plain as dog could say it slowly and emphatically that be my opinion precisely dick you be the dearest most beloved jolliest fellow that ever walk on two leg you be and whatever 's you opinion be mine no matter _ how _ absurd it may be dick evidently understand he perfectly for he laugh as he look at he and pat he on the head and call he a funny dog then he continue he discourse : -- yes pup we 'll make we camp here for a long bit old dog in this beautiful plain we 'll make a willow wigwam to sleep in you and i jist in yon clump o ' tree not a stone 's - throw to we right where we 'll have a run o ' pure water beside we and be near we buffalo at the same time for ye see we 'll need to watch he lest the wolf take a notion to eat he -- that 'll be _ you _ duty pup then i 'll skin he when i get strong enough which 'll be in a day or two i hope and we 'll put one-half of the skin below we and t ` other half above we i ' the camp a ' sleep a ' eat a ' take it easy for a week or two -- will not we pup hoora-a-a-y shout crusoe with a jovial wag of he tail that no human arm with hat or cap or kerchief ever equal poor dick varley he smile to think how earnestly he have be talk to the dog but he do not cease to do it for although he enter into discourse the drift of which crusoe 's limited education do not permit he to follow he find comfort in hear the sound of he own voice and in know that it fall pleasantly on another ear in that lonely wilderness we hero now set about he preparation as vigorously as he could he cut out the buffalo 's tongue -- a matter of great difficulty to one in he weak state -- and carry it to a pleasant spot near to the stream where the turf be level and green and deck with wild flower here he resolve to make he camp he first care be to select a bush whose branch be long enough to form a canopy over he head when bent and the end thrust into the ground the complete of this exhaust he greatly but after a rest he resume he labor the next thing be to light a fire -- a comfort which he have not enjoy for many weary day not that he require it for warmth for the weather be extremely warm but he require it to cook with and the mere _ sight _ of a blaze in a dark place be a most heart-cheering thing as every one know when the fire be light he fill he pannikin at the brook and put it on to boil and cut several slice of buffalo tongue he thrust short stake through they and set they up before the fire to roast by this time the water be boil so he take it off with difficulty nearly burn he finger and singe the tail of he coat in so do into the pannikin he put a lump of maple sugar and stir it about with a stick and taste it it seem to he even better than tea or coffee it be absolutely delicious really one have no notion what he can do if he make believe _ very hard _ the human mind be a nicely balanced and extremely complex machine and when throw a little off the balance can be make to believe almost anything as we see in the case of some poor monomaniac who have fancy that they be make of all sort of thing -- glass and porcelain and such like no wonder then that poor dick varley after so much suffering and hardship come to regard that pannikin of hot sirup as the most delicious beverage he ever drink during all these operation crusoe sit on he haunch beside he and look and you have not no you have not get the most distant notion of the way in which that dog manoeuvre with he head and face he open he eye wide and cock he ear and turn he head first a little to one side then a little to the other after that he turn it a _ good deal _ to one side and then a good deal more to the other then he bring it straight and raise one eyebrow a little and then the other a little and then both together very much then when dick pause to rest and do nothing crusoe look mild for a moment and yawn vociferously presently dick move -- up go the ear again and crusoe come in military parlance to the position of attention at last supper be ready and they begin dick have purposely keep the dog 's supper back from he in order that they might eat it in company and between every bite and sup that dick take he give a bite -- but not a sup -- to crusoe thus lovingly they eat together and when dick lay that night under the willow branch look up through they at the star with he foot to the fire and crusoe close along he side he think it the best and sweetest supper he ever eat and the happiest evening he ever spend -- so wonderfully do circumstance modify we notion of felicity two week after this richard be himself again the muscle be springy and the blood course fast and free as be its wont only a slight and perhaps salutary feeling of weakness remain to remind he that young muscle might again become more helpless than those of a aged man or a child dick have leave he encampment a week ago and be now advance by rapid stage towards the rocky mountain closely follow the trail of he lose comrade which he have no difficulty in finding and keep now that crusoe be with he the skin of the buffalo that he have kill be now strap to he shoulder and the skin of another animal that he have shoot a few day after be cut up into a long line and slung in a coil round he neck crusoe be also laden he have a little bundle of meat sling on each side of he for some time past numerous herd of mustang or wild horse have cross they path and dick be now on the look-out for a chance to _ crease _ one of those magnificent creature on one occasion a band of mustang gallop close up to he before they be aware of he presence and stop short with a wild snort of surprise on behold he then wheeling round they dash away at full gallop they long tail and mane fly wildly in the air and they hoof thunder on the plain dick do not attempt to crease one upon this occasion fear that he recent illness might have render he hand too unsteady for so extremely delicate a operation in order to crease a wild horse the hunter require to be a perfect shot and it be not every man of the west who carry a rifle that can do it successfully crease consist in send a bullet through the gristle of the mustang 's neck just above the bone so as to stun the animal if the ball enter a hair 's - breadth too low the horse fall dead instantly if it hit the exact spot the horse fall as instantaneously and dead to all appearance but in reality he be only stunned and if leave for a few minute will rise and gallop away nearly as well as ever when hunter crease a horse successfully they put a rope or halter round he under jaw and hobble round he foot so that when he rise he be secure and after considerable trouble reduce to obedience the mustang which roam in wild freedom on the prairie of the far west be descend from the noble spanish steed that be bring over by the wealthy cavalier who accompany fernando cortez the conqueror of mexico in he expedition to the new world in 1518 these bold and we may add lawless cavalier be mount on the finest horse that could be procure from barbary and the desert of the old world the poor indian of the new world be strike with amazement and terror at these awful being for never have see horse before they believe that horse and rider be one animal during the war that follow many of the spaniard be kill and they steed bound into the wild of the new country to enjoy a life of unrestrained freedom these be the forefather of the present race of magnificent creature which be find in immense drove all over the western wilderness from the gulf of mexico to the confines of the snowy region of the far north at first the indian behold these horse with awe and terror but gradually they become accustomed to they and finally succeed in capture great number and reduce they to a state of servitude not however to the service of the cultivate field but to the service of the chase and war the savage soon acquire the method of capture wild horse by means of the lasso -- as the noose at that end of a long line of raw hide be term -- which they adroitly throw over the head of the animal and secure they have previously run they down at the present day many of the savage tribe of the west almost live upon horseback and without these useful creature they could scarcely subsist as they be almost indispensable in the chase of the buffalo mustang be regularly take by the indian to the settlement of the white man for trade but very poor specimen be these of the breed of wild horse this arise from two cause first the indian can not overtake the finest of a drive of wild mustang because he own steed be inferior to the best among the wild one besides be weight with a rider so that only the weak and inferior animal be capture and secondly when the indian do succeed in lasso a first-rate horse he keep it for he own use thus those who have not visit the far-off prairie and see the mustang in all the glory of untrammelled freedom can form no adequate idea of its beauty fleetness and strength the horse however be not the only creature import by cortez there be priest in he army who ride upon ass and although we can not imagine that the father charge with the cavalier and be unhorse or rather un-assed in battle yet somehow the ass get rid of they rider and join the spanish charger in they joyous bind into a new life of freedom hence wild ass also be find in the western prairie but think not reader of those poor miserable wretch we see at home which seem little better than rough door-mat sew up and stuff with head tail and leg attach and just enough of life infuse to make they move no the wild ass of the prairie be a large powerful swift creature he have the same long ear it be true and the same hideous exasperating bray and the same tendency to flourish he heel but for all that he be a very fine animal and often wages _ successful _ warfare with the wild horse but to return the next drive of mustang that dick and crusoe saw be feed quietly and unsuspectingly in a rich green hollow in the plain dick 's heart leap up as he eye suddenly fall on they for he have almost discover himself before he be aware of they presence down pup he whisper as he sink and disappear among the grass which be just long enough to cover he when lie quite flat crusoe crouch immediately and he master make he observation of the drive and the disposition of the ground that might favor he approach for they be not within rifle range have do so he creep slowly back until the undulation of the prairie hide he from view then he spring to he foot and run a considerable distance along the bottom until he gain the extreme end of a belt of low bush which would effectually conceal he while he approach to within a hundred yard or less of the troop here he make he arrangement throw down he buffalo robe he take the coil of line and cut off a piece of about three yard in length on this he make a run noose the longer line he also prepare with a run noose these he throw in a coil over he arm he also make a pair of hobble and place they in the breast of he coat and then take up he rifle advance cautiously through the bush -- crusoe follow close behind he in a few minute he be gaze in admiration at the mustang which be now within easy shot and utterly ignorant of the presence of man for dick have take care to approach in such a way that the wind do not carry the scent of he in they direction and well might he admire they the wild horse of these region be not very large but it be exceedingly powerful with prominent eye sharp nose distended nostril small foot and a delicate leg they beautiful mane hang at great length down they arched neck and they thick tail sweep the ground one magnificent fellow in particular attract dick 's attention he be of a rich dark-brown color with black mane and tail and seem to be the leader of the drive although not the nearest to he he resolve to crease this horse it be say that crease generally destroy or damage the spirit of the horse so dick determine to try whether he power of close shooting would not serve he on this occasion go down on one knee he aim at the creature 's neck just a hair 's - breadth above the spot where he have be tell that hunter usually hit they and fire the effect upon the group be absolutely tremendous with wild cry and snort terror they toss they proud head in the air uncertain for one moment in which direction to fly then there be a rush as if a hurricane sweep over the place and they be go but the brown horse be down dick do not wait until the other have flee he drop he rifle and with the speed of a deer spring towards the fall horse and affix the hobble to he leg he aim have be true although scarcely half a minute elapse between the shot and the fix of the hobble the animal recover and with a frantic exertion rise on he haunch just as dick have fasten the noose of the short line in he under jaw but this be not enough if the horse have gain he foot before the longer line be place round he neck he would have escape as the mustang make the second violent plunge that place it on its leg dick fling the noose hastily it catch on one ear and would have fall off have not the horse suddenly shake its head and unwittingly seal its own fate by bring the noose round its neck and now the struggle begin dick know well enough from hearsay the method of break down a wild horse he know that the indian choke they with the noose round the neck until they fall down exhaust and cover with foam when they creep up fix the hobble and the line in the lower jaw and then loosen the lasso to let the horse breathe and resume its plunging till it be almost subdue when they gradually draw near and breathe into its nostril but the violence and strength of this animal render this a apparently hopeless task we have already see that the hobble and noose in the lower jaw have be fix so that dick have nothing now to do but to choke he captive and tire he out while crusoe remain a quiet though excited spectator of the scene but there seem to be no possibility of choke this horse either the muscle of he neck be too strong or there be something wrong with the noose which prevent it from act for the furious creature dash and bound backwards and sideways in its terror for nearly a hour drag dick after it till he be almost exhaust and yet at the end of that time although fleck with foam and pant with terror it seem as strong as ever dick hold both line for the short one attach to its lower jaw give he great power over it at last he think of seek assistance from he dog crusoe he cry lay hold pup the dog seize the long line in he tooth and pull with all he might at the same moment dick let go the short line and throw all he weight upon the long one the noose tighten suddenly under this strain and the mustang with a gasp fall choke to the ground dick have often hear of the manner in which the mexican break they horse so he determine to abandon the method which have already almost worn he out and adopt the other as far as the means in he power render it possible instead therefore of loosen the lasso and re-commencing the struggle he tear a branch from a neighbouring bush cut the hobble stride with he leg across the fall steed seize the end of the short line or bridle and then order crusoe to quit he hold he loosen the noose which compress the horse 's neck and have already well-nigh terminate its existence one or two deep sob restore it and in a moment it leap to its foot with dick firmly on its back to say that the animal leap and kick in its frantic effort to throw this intolerable burden would be a tame manner of express what take place word can not adequately describe the scene it rear plunge shriek vault into the air stand straight up on its hind leg and then almost as straight upon its fore one but its rider hold on like a burr then the mustang race wildly forwards a few pace then as wildly back and then stand still and tremble violently but this be only a brief lull in the storm so dick saw that the time be now come to assert the superiority of he race stay back crusoe and watch my rifle pup he cry and raise he heavy switch he bring it down with a sharp cut across the horse 's flank at the same time loosen the rein which hitherto he have hold tight the wild horse utter a passionate cry and spring forward like the bolt from a cross-bow and now commence a race which if not so prolonged be at least as furious as that of the far-famed mazeppa dick be a splendid rider however -- at least as far as stick on go he might not have come up to the precise pitch desiderate by a riding-master in regard to carriage etc but he ride that wild horse of the prairie with as much ease as he have formerly ridden he own good steed whose bone have be pick by the wolf not long ago the pace be tremendous for the youth 's weight be nothing to that muscular frame which bound with cat-like agility from wave to wave of the undulating plain in ungovernable terror in a few minute the clump of willow where crusoe and he rifle lay be out of sight behind but it matter not for dick have look up at the sky and note the position of the sun at the moment of start away they go on the wing of the wind mile after mile over the ocean-like waste -- curve slightly aside now and then to avoid the bluff that occasionally appear on the scene for a few minute and then sweep out of sight behind they then they come to a little rivulet it be a mere brook of a few foot wide and two or three yard perhaps from bank to bank over this they fly so easily that the spring be scarcely feel and continue the headlong course and now a more barren country be around they sandy ridge and scrubby grass appear everywhere remind dick of the place where he have be so ill rock too be scatter about and at one place the horse dash with clatter hoof between a couple of rocky sand-hill which for a few seconds hide the prairie from view here the mustang suddenly shy with such violence that he rider be nearly throw while a rattlesnake dart from the path soon they emerge from this pass and again the plain become green and verdant presently a distant line of tree show that they be approach water and in a few minute they be close on it for the first time dick feel alarm he seek to check he steed but no force he could exert have the smallest influence on it tree and bush fly past in bewildering confusion the river be before he what width he could not tell but he be reckless now like he charger which he strike with the willow rod with all he force as they come up one tremendous bind and they be across but dick have to lie flat on the mustang 's back as it crash through the bush to avoid be scrape off by the tree again they be on the open plain and the wild horse begin to show sign of exhaustion now be its rider 's opportunity to assert he dominion he ply the willow rod and urge the pant horse on until it be white with foam and labor a little in its gait then dick gently draw the halter and it break into a trot still tighter and it walk and in another minute stand still tremble in every limb dick now quietly rub its neck and speak to it in soothing tone then he wheel it gently round and urge it forward it be quite subdue and docile in a little time they come to the river and ford it after which they go through the belt of woodland at a walk by the time they reach the open prairie the mustang be recover sufficiently to feel its spirit return so dick give it a gentle touch with the switch and away they go on they return journey but it amaze dick not a little to find how long that journey be very different be the pace too from the previous mad gallop and often would the poor horse have stop have dick allow he but this might not be the shades of night be approach and the camp lay a long way ahead at last it be reach and crusoe come out with great demonstration of joy but be send back lest he should alarm the horse then dick jump off he back stroke he head put he cheek close to he mouth and whisper softly to he after which he fasten he to a tree and rub he down slightly with a bunch of grass have do this he leave he to graze as far as he tether would permit and after sup with crusoe lay down to-rest not a little elated with he success in this first attempt at crease and break a mustang chapter xvi _ dick become a horse tamer -- resume he journey -- charlie 's doings -- misfortune which lead to but do not terminate in the rocky mountain -- a grizzly bear _ there be a proverb -- or a say -- or at least somebody or book have tell we that some irishman once say be aisy or if ye can not be aisy be as aisy as ye can now we count that good advice and strongly recommend it to all and sundry have we be at the side of dick varley on the night after he tame of the wild horse we would have strongly urge that advice upon he whether he would have listen to it or not be quite another question we rather think not reader if you wish to know why go and do what he do and if you feel no curious sensation about the region of the loin after it we will tell you why dick varley would not have listen to that advice can a man feel as if he joint be wrench out of they socket and listen to advice -- be that advice good or bad can he feel as though these joint be try to re-set and re-dislocate themselves perpetually and listen to advice can he feel as if he be sit down on red-hot iron when he be not sit down at all and listen to advice can he -- but no why pursue the subject poor dick spend that night in misery and the greater part of the follow day in sleep to make up for it when he get up to breakfast in the afternoon he feel much better but shaky now pup he say stretch himself we 'll go and see we horse _ ours _ pup yours and mine : do not you help to catch he eh pup crusoe acknowledge the fact with a wag and a playful bow-wow -- wow-oo-ow and follow he master to the place where the horse have be picket it be stand there quite quiet but look a little timid dick go boldly up to it and pat its head and stroke its nose for nothing be so likely to alarm either a tame or a wild horse as any appearance of timidity or hesitation on the part of those who approach they after treat it thus for a short time he stroke down its neck and then its shoulder -- the horse eye he all the time nervously gradually he stroke its back and limb gently and walk quietly round and round it once or twice sometimes approach and sometimes go away but never either hesitate or do anything abruptly this do he go down to the stream and fill he cap with water and carry it to the horse which snuff suspiciously and back a little so he lay the cap down and go up and pat he again presently he take up the cap and carry it to he nose the poor creature be almost choke with thirst so that the moment he understand what be in the cap he bury he lip in it and suck it up this be a great point gain : he have accept a benefit at the hand of he new master he have become a debtor to man and no doubt he feel the obligation dick fill the cap and the horse empty it again and again and again until its burning thirst be slake then dick go up to he shoulder pat he undo the line that fasten he and vault lightly on he back we say _ lightly _ for it be so but it be not _ easily _ as dick could have tell you however he be determine not to forego the training of he steed on account of what _ he _ would have call a little bit pain at this unexpected act the horse plunge and rear a good deal and seem incline to go through the performance of the day before over again but dick pat and stroke he into quiescence and have do so urge he into a gallop over the plain cause the dog to gambol round in order that he might get accustom to he this try he nerve a good deal and no wonder for if he take crusoe for a wolf which no doubt he do he must have think he a very giant of the pack by degree they break into a furious gallop and after breathe he well dick return and tie he to the tree then he rub he down again and give he another drink this time the horse smell he new master all over and dick feel that he have conquer he by kindness no doubt the tremendous run of the day before could scarcely be call kindness but without this subdue run he never could have bring the office of kindness to bear on so wild a steed during all these operation crusoe sit look on with demure sagacity -- drinking in wisdom and take note we know not whether any note make by the canine race have ever be give to the world but certain be we that if the note and observation make by crusoe on that journey be publish they would to say the least surprise we next day dick give the wild horse he second lesson and he name he call he charlie after a much-loved companion in the mustang valley and long and heartily do dick varley laugh as he tell the horse he future designation in the presence of crusoe for it strike he as somewhat ludicrous that a mustang which two day ago paw the earth in all the pride of independent freedom should suddenly come down so low as to carry a hunter on he back and be name charlie the next piece of instruction begin by crusoe be lead up under charlie 's nose and while dick pat the dog with he right hand he pat the horse with he left it back a good deal at first and snorted but crusoe walk slowly and quietly in front of he several time each time come nearer until he again stand under he nose then the horse smell he nervously and give a sigh of relief when he find that crusoe pay no attention to he whatever dick then order the dog to lie down at charlie 's foot and go to the camp to fetch he rifle and buffalo robe and pack of meat these and all the other thing belong to he be present for inspection one by one to the horse who arch he neck and put forward he ear and eye they at first but smell they all over and seem to feel more easy in he mind next the buffalo robe be rub over he nose then over he eye and head then down he neck and shoulder and lastly be place on he back then it be take off and _ fling _ on after that it be strap on and the various little item of the camp be attach to it this do dick take up he rifle and let he smell it then he put he hand on charlie 's shoulder vault on to he back and ride away charlie 's education be complete and now we hero 's journey begin again in earnest and with some prospect of its speedy termination in this course of training through which dick put he wild horse he have be at much greater pain and have take far longer time than be usually the case among the indian who will catch and break and ride a wild horse into camp in less than _ three hour _ but dick want to do the thing well which the indian be not careful to do besides it must be bear in remembrance that this be he first attempt and that he horse be one of the best and most high-spirited while those catch by the indian as we have say be generally the poorest of a drive dick now follow the trail of he lose companion at a rapid pace yet not so rapidly as he might have do be averse to exhaust he good dog and he new companion each night he encamp under the shade of a tree or a bush when he could find one or in the open prairie when there be none and picketing he horse to a short stake or pin which he carry with he for the purpose light he fire have supper and lay down to rest in a few day charlie become so tame and so accustomed to he master 's voice that he seem quite reconcile to he new life there can be no doubt whatever that he have a great dislike to solitude for on one occasion when dick and crusoe go off a mile or so from the camp where charlie be tie and disappear from he view he be hear to neigh so loudly that dick run back think the wolf must have attack he he be all right however and exhibit evident token of satisfaction when they return on another occasion he fear of be leave alone be more clearly demonstrate dick have be unable to find wood or water that day so he be oblige to encamp upon the open plain the want of water be not seriously feel however for he have prepare a bladder in which he always carry enough to give he one pannikin of hot sirup and leave a mouthful for crusoe and charlie dry buffalo dung form a substitute for fuel spread he buffalo robe he light he fire put on he pannikin to boil and stick up a piece of meat to roast to the great delight of crusoe who sit look on with much interest suddenly charlie who be picket a few hundred yard off in a grassy spot break he halter close by the headpiece and with a snort of delight bound away prance and kick up he heel dick heave a deep sigh for he feel sure that he horse be go however in a little charlie stop and raise he nose high in the air as if to look for he old equine companion but they be go no answering neigh reply to he and he feel probably for the first time that he be really alone in the world have no power of smell whereby he might have trace they out as the dog would have do he look in a bewildered and excited state all round the horizon then he eye fall on dick and crusoe sit by they little fire charlie look hard at they and then again at the horizon and then come to the conclusion no doubt that the matter be quite beyond he comprehension he quietly take to feed dick avail himself of the chance and try to catch he but he spend a hour with crusoe in the vain attempt and at last they give it up in disgust and return to the fire where they finish they supper and go to bed next morning they see charlie feeding close at hand so they take breakfast and try to catch he again but it be of no use he be evidently coquet with they and dodge about and defy they utmost effort for there be only a few inch of line hang to he head at last it occur to dick that he would try the experiment of forsake he so he pack up he thing roll up the buffalo robe throw it and the rifle on he shoulder and walk deliberately away come along crusoe he cry after walk a few pace but crusoe stand by the fire with he head up and a expression on he face that say hallo man what be wrong you have forget charlie hold on be you mad come here crusoe cry he master in a decide tone crusoe obey at once whatever mistake there might be there be evidently none in that command so he lower he head and tail humbly and trot on with he master but he perpetually turn he head as he go first on this side and then on that to look and wonder at charlie when they be far away on the plain charlie suddenly become aware that something be wrong he trot to the brow of a slope with he head and tail very high up indeed and look after they then he look at the fire and neighed then he trot quickly up to it and see that everything be go he begin to neigh violently and at last start off at full speed and overtake he friend pass within a few foot of they and wheeling round a few yard off stand tremble like a aspen leaf dick call he by he name and advance while charlie meet he half-way and allow himself to be saddle bridle and mount forthwith after this dick have no further trouble with he wild horse at he next camping-place which be in the midst of a cluster of bush close beside a creek dick come unexpectedly upon a little wooden cross which mark the head of a grave there be no inscription on it but the christian symbol tell that it be the grave of a white man it be impossible to describe the rush of mingled feeling that fill the soul of the young hunter as he lean on the muzzle of he rifle and look at this solitary resting-place of one who doubtless like himself have be a rove hunter have he be young or old when he fall have he a mother in the distant settlement who watch and long and wait for the son that be never more to gladden she eye have he be murder or have he die there and be bury by he sorrowing comrade these and a thousand question pass rapidly through he mind as he gaze at the little cross suddenly he start could it be the grave of joe or henrus for a instant the idea send a chill to he heart but it pass quickly for a second glance show that the grave be old and that the wooden cross have stand over it for year dick turn away with a saddened heart and that night as he pore over the page of he bible he mind be fill with many thought about eternity and the world to come he too must come to the grave one day and quit the beautiful prairie and he loved rifle it be a sad thought but while he meditate he think upon he mother after all he murmur there must be happiness _ without _ the rifle and youth and health and the prairie my mother 's happy yet she do not shoot or ride like wild-fire over the plain then that word which have be send so sweetly to he through she hand come again to he mind my son give I thine heart and as he read god 's book he meet with the word delight thyself in the lord and he shall give thee the desire of thine heart _ the desire of thine heart _ dick repeat this and ponder it till he fall asleep a misfortune soon after this befall dick varley which well-nigh cause he to give way to despair for some time past he have be approach the eastern slope of the rocky mountain -- those ragged jagged mighty hill which run through the whole continent from north to south in a continuous chain and form as it be the backbone of america one morning as he throw the buffalo robe off he shoulder and sit up he be horrify to find the whole earth cover with a mantle of snow we say he be horrify for this render it absolutely impossible any further to trace he companion either by scent or sight for some time he sit muse bitterly on he sad fate while he dog come and lay he head sympathizingly on he arm ah pup he say i know ye would help I if ye could but it be all up now there be no chance of findin ' they -- none to this crusoe reply by a low whine he know full well that something distressed he master but he have not yet ascertain what it be as something have to be do dick put the buffalo robe on he steed and mount say as he be in the habit of do each morning lead on pup crusoe put he nose to the ground and run forward a few pace then he return and run about snuff and scrape up the snow at last he look up and utter a long melancholy howl ah i know it say dick push forward come on pup you 'll have to _ follow _ now any way we must go on the snow that have fall be not deep enough to offer the slightest obstruction to they advance it be indeed only one of those occasional shower common to that part of the country in the late autumn which season have now creep upon dick almost before he be aware of it and he fully expect that it would melt away in a few day in this hope he keep steadily advance until he find himself in the midst of those rocky fastness which divide the water that flow into the atlantic from those that flow into the pacific ocean still the slight crust of snow lay on the ground and he have no means of know whether he be go in the right direction or not game be abundant and there be no lack of wood now so that he night bivouac be not so cold or dreary as might have be expect travel however have become difficult and even dangerous owe to the rugged nature of the ground over which he proceed the scenery have completely change in its character dick no longer course over the free open plain but he pass through beautiful valley fill with luxuriant tree and hem in by stupendous mountain whose rugged side rise upward until the snow-clad peak pierce the cloud there be something awful in these dark solitude quite overwhelming to a youth of dick 's temperament he heart begin to sink lower and lower every day and the utter impossibility of make up he mind what to do become at length agonizing to have turn and go back the hundred of mile over which he have travel would have cause he some anxiety under any circumstance but to do so while joe and henrus be either wander about there or in the power of the savage be he feel out of the question yet in which way should he go whatever course he take might lead he farther and farther away from they in this dilemma he come to the determination of remain where he be at least until the snow should leave the ground he feel great relief even when this hopeless course be decide upon and set about make himself a encampment with some degree of cheerfulness when he have complete this task he take he rifle and leave charlie picket in the center of a dell where the long rich grass rise high above the snow go off to hunt on turn a rocky point he heart suddenly bound into he throat for there not thirty yard distant stand a huge grizzly bear yes there he be at last the monster to meet which the young hunter have so often long -- the terrible size and fierceness of which he have hear so often speak about by the old hunter there it stand at last but little do dick varley think that the first time he should meet with he foe should be when alone in the dark recess of the rocky mountain and with none to succor he in the event of the battle go against he yes there be one the faithful crusoe stand by he side with he hair bristle all he formidable tooth expose and he eye glare in they socket alas for poor crusoe have he go into that combat alone one stroke of that monster 's paw would have hurl he dead upon the ground chapter xvii _ dick 's first fight with a grizzly _ -- _ adventure with a deer _ -- _ a surprise _ there be no animal in all the land so terrible and dangerous as the grizzly bear not only be he the largest of the species in america but he be the fiercest the strongest and the most tenacious of life -- fact which be so well understand that few of the western hunter like to meet he single-handed unless they happen to be first-rate shot and the indian deem the encounter so dangerous that to wear a collar compose of the claw of a grizzly bear of he own killing be count one of the highest honor to which a young warrior can attain the grizzly bear resemble the brown bear of europe but it be larger and the hair be long the point be of a paler shade about the head there be a considerable mixture of gray hair give it the grizzly appearance from which it derive its name the claw be dirty white arched and very long and so strong that when the animal strike with its paw they cut like a chisel these claw be not embed in the paw as be the case with the cat but always project far beyond the hair thus give to the foot a very ungainly appearance they be not sufficiently curved to enable the grizzly bear to climb tree like the black and brown bear and this inability on they part be often the only hope of the pursued hunter who if he succeed in ascend a tree be safe for the time at least from the bear 's assault but caleb be a patient creature and will often wait at the foot of the tree for many hour for he victim the average length of he body be about nine foot but he sometimes attain to a still larger growth caleb be more carnivorous in he habit than other bear but like they he do not object to indulge occasionally in vegetable diet be partial to the bird-cherry the choke-berry and various shrub he have a sweet tooth too and revel in honey -- when he can get it the instant the grizzly bear behold dick varley standing in he path he rise on he hind leg and make a loud hissing noise like a man breathing quick but much harsher to this crusoe reply by a deep growl and show the utmost extent of he tooth gum and all and dick cock both barrel of he rifle to say that dick varley feel no fear would be simply to make he out that sort of hero which do not exist in nature -- namely a _ perfect _ hero he _ do _ feel a sensation as if he bowels have suddenly melt into water let not we reader think the worse of dick for this there be not a man living who have meet with a huge grizzly bear for the first time in he life in a wild solitary place all alone have not experience some such sensation there be no cowardice in this feeling fear be not cowardice act in a wrong and contemptible manner because of we fear be cowardice it be say that wellington or napoleon we forget which once stand watch the muster of the man who be to form the forlorn-hope in storm a citadel there be many brave strong stalwart man there in the prime of life and flush with the blood of high health and courage there be also there a few stern-browed man of riper year who stand perfectly silent with lip compress and as pale as death yonder veteran say the general point to these soldier be man whose courage i can depend on they _ know _ what they be go to the other _ do not _ yes these young soldier _ very probably _ be brave the other _ certainly _ be dick varley stand for a few seconds as if thunderstruck while the bear stand hiss at he then the liquefaction of he interior cease and he feel a glow of fire gush through he vein now dick know well enough that to fly from a grizzly bear be the sure and certain way of be tear to piece as when take thus by surprise they almost invariably follow a retreat enemy he also know that if he stand where he be perfectly still the bear would get uncomfortable under he stare and would retreat from he but he neither intend to run away himself nor to allow the bear to do so he intend to kill it so he raise he rifle quickly draw a bead as the hunter express it on the bear 's heart and fire it immediately drop on its fore leg and rush at he back crusoe out of the way pup shout dick as he favorite be about to spring forward the dog retire and dick leap behind a tree as the bear pass he give it the contents of the second barrel behind the shoulder which bring it down but in another moment it rise and again rush at he dick have no time to load neither have he time to spring up the thick tree beside which he stand and the rocky nature of the ground out of which it grow render it impossible to dodge round it he only resource be flight but where be he to fly to if he run along the open track the bear would overtake he in a few seconds on the right be a sheer precipice one hundred foot high on the left be a impenetrable thicket in despair he think for a instant of club he rifle and meet the monster in close conflict but the utter hopelessness of such a effort be too apparent to be entertain for a moment he glance up at the overhang cliff there be one or two rent and projection close above he in the twinkling of a eye he spring up and grasp a ledge of about a inch broad ten or twelve foot up to which he cling while he glance upward another projection be within reach he gain it and in a few seconds he stand upon a ledge about twenty foot up the cliff where he have just room to plant he foot firmly without wait to look behind he seize he powder-horn and load one barrel of he rifle and well be it for he that he early training have fit he to do this with rapidity for the bear dash up the precipice after he at once the first time it miss its hold and fall back with a savage growl but on the second attempt it sink its long claw into the fissure between the rock and ascend steadily till within a foot of the place where dick stand at this moment crusoe 's obedience give way before a sense of dick 's danger utter one of he lion-like roar he rush up the precipice with such violence that although naturally unable to climb he reach and seize the bear 's flank despite he master 's stern order to keep back and in a moment the two roll down the face of the rock together just as dick complete load know that one stroke of the bear 's paw would be certain death to he poor dog dick leap from he perch and with one bind reach the ground at the same moment with the struggle animal and close beside they and before they have cease roll he place the muzzle of he rifle into the bear 's ear and blow out its brain crusoe strange to say escape with only one scratch on the side it be a deep one but not dangerous and give he but little pain at the time although it cause he many a smart for some week after thus happily end dick 's first encounter with a grizzly bear and although in the course of he wild life he shoot many specimen of caleb he use to say that he a ' pup be never so near goin ' under as on the day he drop _ that _ bar have refresh himself with a long draught from a neighbouring rivulet and wash crusoe 's wound dick skin the bear on the spot we chaw he up that time do not we pup say dick with a smile of satisfaction as he survey he prize crusoe look up and assent to this give we a hard tussle though very nigh send we both under do not he pup crusoe agree entirely and as if the remark remind he of honorable scar he lick he wound ah pup cry dick sympathetically do ' t hurt ye eh poor dog hurt he such a question no he should think not better ask if that leap from the precipice hurt yourself so crusoe might have say but he do not he take no notice of the remark whatever we 'll cut he up now pup continue dick the skin 'll make a splendid bed for you a ' I o ' night and a saddle for charlie dick cut out all the claw of the bear by the root and spend the remainder of that night in clean they and string they on a strip of leather to form a necklace independently of the value of these enormous claw -lrb- the largest as long as a man 's middle finger -rrb- as a evidence of prowess they form a remarkably graceful collar which dick wear round he neck ever after with as much pride as if he have be a pawnee warrior when it be finish he hold it out at arm 's - length and say crusoe my pup be not ye proud of it i 'll tell ye what it be pup the next time you a ' i floor caleb i 'll put the claw round _ you _ neck a ' make ye wear em ever arter so i will the dog do not seem quite to appreciate this piece of prospective good fortune vanity have no place in he honest breast and sooth to say it have not a large place in that of he master either as we may well grant when we consider that this first display of it be on the occasion of he hunter 's soul have at last realize its brightest day-dream dick 's danger and triumph seem to accumulate on he rather thickly at this place for on the very next day he have a narrow escape of be kill by a deer the way of it be this have run short of meat and not be particularly fond of grizzly bear steak he shoulder he rifle and sally forth in quest of game accompany by crusoe whose frequent glance towards he wounded side show that whatever may have be the case the day before it hurt he now they have not go far when they come on the track of a deer in the snow and follow it up till they spy a magnificent buck about three hundred yard off standing in a level patch of ground which be everywhere surround either by rock or thicket it be a long shot but as the nature of the ground render it impossible for dick to get nearer without be see he fire and wound the buck so badly that he come up with it in a few minute the snow have drift in the place where it stand bolt upright ready for a spring so dick go round a little way crusoe follow till he be in a proper position to fire again just as he pull the trigger crusoe give a howl behind he and disturb he aim so that he fear he have miss but the deer fall and he hurry towards it on come up however the buck spring to its leg rush at he with its hair bristle knock he down in the snow and deliberately commence stamp he to death dick be stunned for a moment and lay quite still so the deer leave off pommell he and stand look at he but the instant he move it plunge at he again and give he another pound until he be content to lie still this be do several time and dick feel he strength go fast he be surprise that crusoe do not come to he rescue and once he clear he mouth and whistle to he but as the deer give he another pound for this he do not attempt it again he now for the first time bethought he of he knife and quietly draw it from he belt but the deer observe the motion and be on he again in a moment dick however spring up on he left elbow and make several desperate thrust upward succeed in stab the animal to the heart rise and shake the snow from he garment he whistle loudly to crusoe and on listen hear he whine piteously he hurry to the place whence the sound come and find that the poor dog have fall into a deep pit or crevice in the rock which have be conceal from view by a crust of snow and he be now make frantic but unavailing effort to leap out dick soon free he from he prison by means of he belt which he let down for the dog to grasp and then return to camp with as much deer-meat as he could carry dear meat it certainly be to he for it have nearly cost he he life and leave he all black and blue for week after happily no bone be break so the incident only confine he a day to he encampment soon after this the snow fall thicker than ever and it become evident that a unusually early winter be about to set in among the mountain this be a terrible calamity for if the regular snow of winter set in it would be impossible for he either to advance or retreat while he be sit on he bearskin by the camp-fire one day think anxiously what he should do and feel that he must either make the attempt to escape or perish miserably in that secluded spot a strange unwonted sound strike upon he ear and cause both he and crusoe to spring violently to they foot and listen could he be dream -- it seem like the sound of human voice for a moment he stand with he eye rivet on the ground he lip apart and he nostril distend as he listen with the utmost intensity then he dart out and bound round the edge of a rock which conceal a extensive but narrow valley from he view and there to he amazement he behold a band of about a hundred human being advance on horseback slowly through the snow chapter xviii _ a surprise and a piece of good news -- the fur-trader -- crusoe prove and the peigan pursue _ dick 's first and most natural impulse on behold this band be to mount he horse and fly for he mind naturally enough recur to the former rough treatment he have experience at the hand of indian on second thought however he consider it wiser to throw himself upon the hospitality of the stranger for thought he they can but kill I a ' if i remain here i be like to die at any rate so dick mount he wild horse grasp he rifle in he right hand and follow by crusoe gallop full tilt down the valley to meet they he have hear enough of the custom of savage tribe and have also of late experienced enough to convince he that when a man find himself in the midst of a overwhelming force he best policy be to assume a air of confident courage he therefore approach they at he utmost speed the effect upon the advance band be electrical and little wonder for the young hunter 's appearance be very striking he horse from have rest a good deal of late be full of spirit its neck be arched its nostril expand and its mane and tail never have be check in they growth fly wildly around he in voluminous curl dick 's own hair not have be clip for many month appear scarcely less wild as they thunder down the rocky pass at what appear a break-neck gallop add to this the grandeur of the scene out of which they spring and the gigantic dog that bound by he side and you will not be surprise to hear that the indian warrior cluster together and prepare to receive this bold horseman as if he in he own proper person be a complete squadron of cavalry it be probable also that they fully expect the tribe of which dick be the chief to be at he heel as he draw near the excitement among the stranger seem very great and from the peculiarity of the various cry that reach he he know that there be woman and child in the band -- a fact which in such a place and at such a season be so unnatural that it surprise he very much he note also that though the man in front be indian they dress be those of trapper and hunter and he almost leap out of he saddle when he observe that _ pale-face _ be among they but he have barely time to note these fact when he be up with the band accord to indian custom he do not check he speed till he be within four or five yard of the advance-guard who stand in a line before he quite still and with they rifle lie loosely in they left palm then he rein he steed almost on its haunch one of the indian advance and speak a few word in a language which be quite unintelligible to dick who reply in the little pawnee he could muster that he do not understand he why you must be a trapper exclaim a thick-set middle-aged man ride out from the group can you speak english ay that can i cry dick joyfully ride up and shake the stranger heartily by the hand a ' right glad be i to fall in wus ' a white-skin a ' a civil tongue in he head good sooth sir reply the stranger with a quiet smile on he kind weather-beaten face i can return you the compliment for when i saw you come thunder down the corrie with that wonderful horse and no less wonderful dog of yours i think you be the wild man o ' the mountain himself and have a ambush ready to back you but young man do you mean to say that you live here in the mountain all alone after this fashion no that i do not i have come here in my travels but truly this bea not my home but sir -lrb- for i see you be what the fur-trader call a bourgeois -rrb- how come it that such a band as this ride i ' the mountain d'ye mean to say that _ they _ live here dick look round in surprise as he speak upon the crowd of mount man and woman with child and pack-horse that now surround he ` tis a fair question lad i be a principal among the fur-trader whose chief trading-post lie near the pacific ocean on the west side of these mountain and i have come with these trapper and they family as you see to hunt the beaver and other animal for a season in the mountain we have never be here before but that be a matter of little moment for it be not the first time i have be on what may be call a discovery-trading expedition we be somewhat entangled however just now among these wild pass and if you can guide we out of we difficulty to the east side of the mountain i 'll thank you heartily and pay you well but first tell I who and what you be if it be a fair question my name be dick varley and my home 's in the mustang valley near the missourus river as to _ what _ i be -- i be nothin ' yet but i hope to desarve the name o ' a hunter some day i can guide you to the east side o ' the mountain for i have come from there but more than that i can not do for i be a stranger to the country here like yourself but you be on the east side o ' the mountain already if i mistake not only these mountain be so rugged and jumble up that it be not easy tellin ' where ye be and what continue dick may be the name o ' the bourgeois who speak to I my name be cameron -- walter cameron -- a well-known name among the scottish hill although it sound a little strange here and now young man will you join my party as guide and afterwards remain as trapper it will pay you better i think than rove about alone dick shake he head and look grave i 'll guide you say he as far as my knowledge 'll help I but after that i must return to look for two comrade whom i have lose they have be drive into the mountain by a band of injun god grant they may not have bin scalp the trader 's face look troubled and he speak with one of he indian for a few minute in earnest hurry tone what be they like young man dick describe they the same continue the trader they have be see lad not more than two day ago by this indian here when he be out hunting alone some mile away from we camp he come suddenly on a band of indian who have two prisoner with they

truth for once thanks thanks good sir cry dick have we not best turn back and follow they at once nay friend not quite so fast reply cameron point to he people these must be provide for first but i shall be ready before the sun go down and now as i presume you do not bivouac in the snow will you kindly conduct we to you encampment if it be not far hence although burn with impatience to fly to the rescue of he friend dick feel constrain to comply with so reasonable a request so he lead the way to he camping-place where the band of fur-trader immediately begin to pitch they tent cut down wood kindle fire fill they kettle with water cook they food and in fact make themselves comfortable the wild spot which a hour before have be so still and grand and gloomy be now as if by magic transform into a bustling village with bright fire blaze among the rock and bush and merry voice of man woman and child ring in the air it seem almost incredible and no wonder dick in he bewilderment have difficulty in believe it be not all a dream in day long go by the fur-trade in that country be carry on in a very different way from the manner in which it be now conduct these wild region indeed be still as lonesome and untenanted -lrb- save by wild beast and wander tribe of indian -rrb- as they be then but the indian of the present day have become accustomed to the pale-face trader whose little wooden fort or trading-post be dot here and there at wide interval all over the land but in the day of which we write it be not so the fur-trader at that time go forth in armed band into the heart of the indian ' country and he who go forth do so with he life in he hand as in the case of the soldier who go out to battle there be great probability that he might never return the band of which walter cameron be the chief have many month before start from one of the distant post of oregon on a hunting expedition into the then totally unknown land of the snake indian it consist of about sixty man thirty woman and as many child of various age -- about a hundred and twenty soul in all many of the boy be capable of use the gun and set a beaver-trap the man be a most motley set there be canadian half-breed iroquois and scotchmen most of the woman have indian blood in they vein and a few be pure indian the equipment of this strange band consist of upward of two hundred beaver-trap -- which be similar to we rat-trap with this difference that they have two spring and no tooth -- seventy gun a few article for trade with the indian and a large supply of powder and ball the whole -- man woman child goods and chattel -- be carry on the back of nearly four hundred horse many of these horse at start be not laden be design for the transport of fur that be to be take in the course of the season for food this adventurous party depend entirely on they gun and during the march hunter be keep constantly out ahead as a matter of course they living be precarious sometimes they kettle be overflow at other they scarce refrain from eat they horse but during the month they have already spend in the wilderness good living have be the rule starvation the exception they have already collect a large quantity of beaver skin which at that time be among the most valuable in the market although they be now scarcely saleable have shoot two wild horse seven elk six small deer and four big-horned sheep the day before they meet dick varley the camp kettle be full and the people consequently happy now master dick varley say cameron touch the young hunter on the shoulder as he stand ready equip by one of the camp-fire i be at you service the people will not need any more look after to-night i 'll divide my man -- thirty shall go after this rascally band of peigan for such i believe they be and thirty shall remain to guard the camp be you ready ready ay this hour past mount then lad the man have already be tell off and be muster down yonder where the deer give you such a lick dick need no second bidding he vault on charlie 's back and along with they commander join the man who be thirty as fine hardy reckless look fellow as one could desire for a forlorn-hope they be chat and laugh while they examine they gun and saddle-girth they horse be sorry look animal compare with the magnificent creature that dick bestrode but they be hardy nevertheless and well fit for they peculiar work my wot a blazer exclaim a trapper as dick ride up where you git he inquire a half-breed i catch he answer dick baw cry the first speaker dick take no notice of this last remark no do ye though he ask again i do answer dick quietly i crease he in the prairie you can see the mark on he neck if you look the man begin to feel that the young hunter be perhaps a little beyond they at they own trade and regard he with increase respect look sharp now lad say cameron impatiently to several dilatory member of the band night will be on we ere long who sell ye the bear-claw collar inquire another man of dick i do not buy it i kill the bear and make it do ye though all be yer lone ay that be not much be it you have begin well yonker say a tall middle-aged hunter whose general appearance be not unlike that of joe blunt jest keep clear o ' the injun a ' the grog bottle a ' ye have a glor ` ous life before ye at this point the conversation be interrupt by the order be give to move on which be obey in silence and the cavalcade descend the valley enter one of the gorge in the mountain for the first half-mile cameron ride a little ahead of he man then he turn to speak to one of they and for the first time observe crusoe trot close beside he master 's horse ah master dick he exclaim with a troubled expression that will not do it would never do to take a dog on a expedition like this why not ask dick the pup 's quiet and peaceable i doubt it not but he will betray we presence to the indian which might be inconvenient i have travel more than a thousand mile through prairie and forest among game a ' among injun a ' the pup never betray I yet say dick with suppress vehemence he have save my life more than once though you seem to have perfect confidence in you dog but as this be a serious matter you must not expect I to share in it without proof of he trustworthiness the pup may be useful to we how would you have it prove inquire dick any way you like you forget you belt at start i think i heerd ye say yes i do reply the trader smile dick immediately take hold of cameron 's coat and bid crusoe smell it which the dog do very carefully then he show he he own belt and say go back to the camp and fetch it pup crusoe be off in a moment and in less than twenty minute return with cameron 's belt in he mouth well i 'll trust he say cameron patting crusoe 's head forward lad and away they go at a brisk trot along the bottom of a beautiful valley on each side of which the mountain tower in dark mass soon the moon rise and afford light sufficient to enable they to travel all night in the track of the indian hunter who say he have see the peigan and who be constitute guide to the party hour after hour the horseman press on without check now gallop over a level plain now bound by the bank of a rivulet or bend they head to escape the bough of overhang tree and anon toiling slowly up among the rock of some narrow defile at last the moon set and the order be give to halt in a little plain where there be wood and water the horse be picket a fire kindle a mouthful of dry meat hastily eat the watch be set and then each man scrape away the snow spread some branch on the ground and wrap himself in he blanket go to sleep with he foot present towards the fire two hour be allow for rest then they be awaken and in a few minute be off again by the gray light of dawn in this way they travel two night and a day at the end of that time they come suddenly on a small party of nine indian who be seat on the ground with they snow-shoe and blanket by they side they have evidently be take by surprise but they make no attempt to escape know that it be useless each sit still with he bow and arrow between he leg on the ground ready for instant use as soon as cameron speak however in they own language they feel relieved and begin to talk where do you come from and what be you do here ask the trader we have come to trade with the white man one of they reply and to hunt we have come from the missouri we country be far away do peigans hunt with _ war-arrow _ ask cameron point to they weapon this question seem to perplex they for they see that they interrogator know the difference between a war and a hunting arrow -- the former be barb in order to render its extraction from the wound difficult while the head of the latter be round and can be draw out of game that have be kill and use again and do peigan continue cameron come from a far country to trade with the white man _ with nothing _ again the indian be silent for they have not a article to trade about they cameron now feel convinced that this party of peigan into whose hand joe blunt and henrus have fall be nothing else than a war party and that the man now before he be a scout party send out from they probably to spy out he own camp on the trail of which they have fall so he say to they : -- the peigan be not wise man they tell lie to the trader i will tell you that you be a war party and that you be only a few warrior send out to spy the trader ' camp you have also two _ pale-face _ prisoner in you camp you can not deceive I it be useless to try now conduct I to you camp my object be not war it be peace i will speak with you chief about trading with the white man and we will smoke the pipe of peace be my word good despite they proverbial control of muscle these indian could not conceal they astonishment at hear so much of they affair thus lay bare so they say that the pale-face chief be wise that he must be a great medicine man and that what he say be all true except about the white man they have never see any pale-face and know nothing whatever about those he speak of this be a terrible piece of news to poor dick and at first he heart fairly sink within he but by degree he come to be more hopeful he conclude that if these man tell lie in regard to one thing they would do it in regard to another and perhaps they might have some strong reason for deny any knowledge of joe and henrus the indian now pack up the buffalo robe on which they have sleep and the mouthful of provision they have take with they i do not believe a word of what they say about you friend say cameron to dick in a low tone while the indian be thus engage depend upon it they hope to hide they till they can send to the settlement and get a ransom or till they get a opportunity of torture they to death before they woman and child when they get back to they own village but we 'll balk they my friend do not fear the indian be soon ready to start for they be cumber with marvellously little camp equipage in less than half-an-hour after they discovery they be run like deer ahead of the cavalcade in the direction of the peigan camp chapter xix _ adventure with the peigan _ -- _ crusoe do good service as a discoverer _ -- _ the savage outwit _ -- _ the rescue _ a run of twenty mile bring the traveller to a rugged defile in the mountain from which they have a view of a beautiful valley of considerable extent during the last two day a steady thaw have be rapidly melting away the snow so that it appear only here and there in the landscape in dazzling patch at the distance of about half-a-mile from where they halt to breathe the horse before commence the descent into this vale several thin wreath of smoke be see rise above the tree be that you camp inquire cameron ride up to the indian runner who stand in a group in front look as fresh after they twenty mile ' run as though they have only have a short walk to this they answer in the affirmative add that there be about two hundred peigan there it might have be think that thirty man would have hesitate to venture to attack so large a number as two hundred but it have always be find in the experience of indian life that a few resolute white man well arm be more than a match for ten time they number of indian and this arise not so much from the superior strength or agility of the whites over they red foe as from that bull-dog courage and utter recklessness of they life in combat -- quality which the crafty savage can neither imitate nor understand the information be receive with perfect indifference by most of the trapper and with contemptuous laughter by some for a large number of cameron 's man be wild evil-disposed fellow who would have as gladly take the life of a indian as that of a buffalo just as the word be give to resume the march dick varley ride up to cameron and say in a somewhat anxious tone -- d'ye obsarve sir that one o ' the redskin have go off ahead o ' he comrade i see that master dick and it be a mistake of mine not to have stop he but he be go too far before i observe it and i think it better to appear unconcerned we must push on though and give he as short time as possible to talk with he comrade in the camp the trapper press forward accordingly at a gallop and be soon in front of the clump of tree amongst which the peigan be encamp they approach have evidently spread great alarm among they for there be a good deal of bustle and run to and fro but by the time the trapper have dismount and advance in a body on foot the savage have resume they usual quiet dignity of appearance and be seat calmly round they fire with they bow and arrow beside they there be no tent no woman or child and the general aspect of the man show cameron conclusively that he surmise about they be a war party be correct a council be immediately call the trapper range themselves on one side of the council fire and the indian on the other meanwhile we friend crusoe have be display considerable irritability against the indian and he would certainly have attack the whole two hundred single-handed if he have not be order by he master to lie still but never in he life before have crusoe obey with such a bad grace he bristle and whine in a low tremulous tone and look imploringly at dick as if for permission to fly at they the pale-face trader be glad to meet with the peigan begin cameron who determine to make no allusion to he knowledge that they be a war party for they wish to be friend with all the child of the wood and prairie they wish to trade with they -- to exchange blanket and gun and bead and other goods which the peigan require for fur of animal which the pale-face require ho ho exclaim the indian which expression might be translate hear hear but continue cameron we wish to have no war we wish to see the hatchet bury and to see all the red man and the white man smoke the pipe of peace and hunting like brother the ho -- ho -- ing at this be very emphatic now resume the trader the peigan have get two prisoner -- two pale-face -- in they camp and as we can not be on good term while we brother be detain we have come to ask for they and to _ present some gift _ to the peigan to this there be no ho at all but a prolonged silence which be at length interrupt by a tall chief step forward to address the trapper what the pale-face chief have say be good begin the indian he word be wise and he heart be not double the red-man be willing to smoke the pipe of peace and to hunt with all man as brother but they can not do it while many of they scalp be hang in the lodge of they enemy and fringe the robe of the warrior the peigan must have vengeance then they will make peace after a short pause he continue -- the chief be wrong when he say there be pale-face in the peigan camp the peigan be not at war with the pale-face neither have they see any on they march the camp be open let the pale-faces look round and see that what we say be true the chief wave he hand towards he warrior as he conclude as if to say search amongst they there be no pale-face there cameron now speak to dick in a low tone they speak confidently he say and i fear greatly that you poor comrade have either be kill or convey away from the camp and hide among the mountain in which case even though they should not be far off it would be next to impossible to find they especially when such a band of rascal be near compelling we to keep together but i 'll try what a little tempting they with goods will do at any rate we sha not give in without a scuffle it now for the first time flash across dick varley that there be something more than he imagine in crusoe 's restless anxiety which have not in the least abate and the idea of make use of he now occur to he mind i have a notion that i 'll settle this matter in a shorter time than you think he say hurriedly if you 'll agree to try what _ threatening _ will do the trader look grave and undecided i never resort to that except as a last hope he answer but i have a good deal of confidence in you prudence what would you advise dick and the trader whisper a few minute together while some of the man in order to show the indian how perfectly unconcerned they be and how ready for _ anything _ take out they pipe and begin to smoke both party be seat on the ground and during this interval the indian also hold eager discussion at length cameron stand up and say to he man in a quiet tone be ready lad for instant action when i give the word ` up ' spring to you foot and cock you gun but _ do not fire a shot till you get the word _ he then step forward and say -- the peigan warrior be double-tongued they know that they have hide the pale-face prisoner we do not wish to quarrel but if they be not deliver up at once the pale-face and the peigan will not be friend upon this the indian chief again stand forward and say the peigan be _ not _ double-tongued they have not see pale-face till to-day they can say no more without move hand or foot cameron then say in a firm tone the first peigan that move shall die up lad and ready in the twinkling of a eye the trapper spring to they foot and cock they rifle stand perfectly motionless scowl at the savage who be completely take by surprise at the unusual suddenness and informality of such a declaration of war not a man move for unlike white man they seldom risk they life in open fight and as they look at the formidable row of muzzle that wait but a word to send instant death into they midst they feel that discretion be at that time the better part of valor now say cameron while dick varley and crusoe step up beside he my young warrior will search for the pale-face prisoner if they be find we will take they and go away if they be not find we will ask the peigan to forgive we and will give they gift but in the meantime if a peigan move from the spot where he sit or lift a bow my young man shall fire and the peigan know that the rifle of the pale-face always kill without wait for a answer dick immediately say seek 'em out pup and crusoe bound away for a few minute he spring hither and thither through the camp quite regardless of the indian and snuff the air several time whine in a excited tone as if to relieve he feeling then he put he nose to the ground and run straight forward into the wood dick immediately bound after he like a deer while the trapper keep silent guard over the savage for some time crusoe run straight forward then he come to a spot where there be a good deal of drift snow on the ground here he seem to lose the trail for a little and run about in all direction whine in a most piteous tone seek 'em out pup repeat dick encouragingly while he own breast heave with excitement and expectation in a few seconds the dog resume its onward course and lead the way into a wild dark spot which be so overshadow by tree and precipitous cliff that the light of the sun scarce find entrance there be many huge mass of rock scatter over the ground which have fall from the cliff behind one of these lay a mound of dry leaf towards which crusoe dart and commence scrape violently tremble with dread that he should find this to be the grave of he murder companion dick rush forward and hastily clear away the leave the first handful throw off reveal part of the figure of a man dick 's heart beat audibly as he clear the leaf from the face and he utter a suppress cry on behold the well-known feature of joe blunt but they be not those of a dead man joe 's eye meet he with a scowl of anger which instantly give place to one of intense surprise joe blunt exclaim dick in a voice of intense amazement while crusoe snuff round the heap of leaf and whine with excitement but joe do not move neither do he speak a word in reply -- for the very good reason that he mouth be tightly bind with a band of leather he hand and foot be tie and he whole body be secure in a rigid immovable position by be bind to a pole of about he own length in a moment dick 's knife be out band and cord be sever and joe blunt be free thank god exclaim joe with a deep earnest sigh the instant he lip be loosen and thanks to _ you _ lad he add endeavor to rise but he limb have become so benumb in consequence of the cord by which they have be compress that for some time he could not move i 'll rub ye joe i 'll soon rub ye into a right state say dick go down on he knee no no lad look sharp and dig up henrus he be just beside I here dick immediately rise and push aside the heap of leaf find henrus securely bind in the same fashion but he could scarce refrain from laugh at the expression of that worthy 's face hear the voice of joe and dick varley in conversation though unable to see they person he be fill with such unbounded amazement that he eye when uncover be find to be at they largest possible stretch and as for the eyebrow they be go utterly lose among the root of he voluminous hair henrus friend i know i should find ye say dick cut the thong that bind he get up if ye can we have not much time to lose a ' mayhap we 'll have to fight afore we be do wus ' the redskin can ye rise henrus could do nothing but lie on he back and gasp eh possible mon frere oh non non _ not _ possible ouus my broder deek here he attempt to rise but be unable fall back again and the whole thing come so suddenly and make so deep a impression on he impulsive mind that he incontinently burst into tear then he burst into a long laugh suddenly he pause and scramble up to a sit posture look earnestly into dick 's face through he tearful eye oh non non he exclaim stretch himself out at full length again and close he eye it be too goot to be true i be dream i vill wait till i be wake dick rouse he out of this resolute sleep however somewhat roughly meanwhile joe have rub and kick himself into a state of animation exclaim that he feel as if he wo walkin ' on a thousand needle and pin and in a few minute they be ready to accompany they overjoyed deliverer back to the peigan camp crusoe testify he delight in various elephantine gambol round the person of he old friend who be not slow to acknowledge he service they have not treat we overly well remark joe blunt as they stride through the underwood non de rascale vraiment de be villain oui how de have talk too ` bout -- oh-o-oo-ooo-wah -- roastin ' we alive a ' puttin ' we scalp in de vigvam for de poo-poose to play wid well niver mind henrus we 'll be quit wus ' they now say joe as they come in sight of the two band who remain in precisely the same position in which they have be leave except that one or two of the more reckless of the trapper have light they pipe and take to smoking without however lay down they rifle or take they eye off the savage a loud cheer greet the arrival of the prisoner and look of considerable discomfort begin to be evince by the indian glad to see you friend say cameron as they come up ve be ` appy ov de same reply henrus swagger up in the joviality of he heart and seize the trader 's hand in he own enormous fist shall ve go to vork a ' slay dem all at vonce or von at a time we 'll consider that afterwards my lad meantime go you to the rear and get a weapon of some sort ouus ah c'est charmant he cry go with a immense flounder into the midst of the amuse trapper and slapping those next to he on the back give I veapon do me ami -- gun pistol anyting -- cannon if you have von meanwhile cameron and joe speak together for a few moment you have goods with you and horse i believe when you be capture say the former ay that we have yonder stand the horse under the pine-tree along wus ' the rest o ' the redskin troop a ' a hard time they have have o ' t as they bone may tell without speakin ' as for the goods he continue glance round the camp i do not know where -- ah yes there they be in the old pack i see all safe cameron now address the indian the peigan he say have not do well they heart have not be true to the pale-face even now i could take you scalp where you sit but white man do not like war they do not like revenge the peigan may go free consider the fewness of they number this be bold language to use towards the indian but the boldest be generally the best policy on such occasion moreover cameron feel that be arm with rifle while the indian have only bow and arrow the trapper have a great advantage over they the indian who have speak before now rise and say he be sorry there should be any cause of difference between they and add he be sorry for a great many more thing besides but he do not say he be sorry for have tell a lie but before you go you must deliver up the horse and goods belong to these man say cameron point to joe and henrus this be agree to the horse be lead out the two little pack contain joe 's goods be strap upon they and then the trapper turn to depart the indian do not move until they have mount then they rise and advance in a body to the edge of the wood to see the pale-face go away meanwhile joe speak a few word to cameron and the man be order to halt while the former dismounted and lead he horse towards the band of savage peigan he say you know the object for which i come into this country be to make peace between you and the pale-face i have often tell you so when you would not listen and when you tell I that i have a double heart and tell lie you be wrong when you say this but i do not wonder for you live among nation who do not fear god and who think it right to lie i now repeat to you what i say before it would be good for the red-man if they would make peace with the pale-face and if they would make peace with each other i will now convince you that i be in earnest and have all along be speak the truth hereupon joe blunt open he bundle of goods and present fully one-half of the gaudy and brilliant contents to the astonished indian who seem quite take aback by such generous treatment the result of this be that the two party separate with mutual expression of esteem and good-will the indian then return to the forest and the white man gallop back to they camp among the hill chapter xx _ new plan _ -- _ we traveller join the fur-trader and see many strange thing _ -- _ a curious fight _ -- _ a narrow escape and a prisoner take _ not long after the event relate in the last chapter we four friend -- dick and joe and henrus and crusoe -- agree to become for a time member of walter cameron 's band of trapper joe join because one of the object which the trader have in view be similar to he own mission -- namely the promote of peace among the various indian tribe of the mountain and plain to the west joe therefore think it a good opportunity of travel with a band of man who could secure he a favourable hearing from the indian tribe they might chance to meet with in the course of they wanderings besides as the trader carry about a large supply of goods with they he could easily replenish he own nearly exhaust pack by hunting wild animal and exchange they skin for such article as he might require dick join because it afford he a opportunity of see the wild majestic scenery of the rocky mountain and shoot the big-horned sheep which abound there and the grizzly bar as joe name they or caleb as they be more frequently style by henrus and the other man henri join because it be agreeable to the inclination of he own rollicking blunder flounder crash disposition and because he would have join anything that have be join by the other two crusoe 's reason for join be single simple easy to be express easy to be understand and commendable _ he _ join -- because dick do the very day after the party leave the encampment where dick have shoot the grizzly bear and the deer he have the satisfaction of bring down a splendid specimen of the big-horned sheep it come suddenly out from a gorge of the mountain and stand upon the giddy edge of a tremendous precipice at a distance of about two hundred and fifty yard _ you _ could not hit that say a trapper to henrus who be rather fond of jeer he about he shortsightedness non cry henrus who do not see the animal in the least say you dat ve shall see and he let fly with a promptitude that amaze he comrade and with a result that draw from they peal of laughter why you have miss the mountain oh non dat be eempossoble it be true nevertheless for he ball have be arrest in its flight by the stem of a tree not twenty yard before he while the shot be yet ring and before the laugh above refer to have peal forth dick varley fire and the animal spring wildly into the air fall down the precipice and be almost dash to piece at they foot this rocky mountain or big-horned sheep be a particularly large and fine one but be a patriarch of the flock be not well suit for food it be considerably larger in size than the domestic sheep and might be describe as somewhat resemble a deer in the body and a ram in the head its horn be the chief point of interest to dick and truly they be astounding they enormous size be out of all proportion to the animal 's body and they curve backwards and downwards and then curl up again in a sharp point these creature frequent the inaccessible height of the rocky mountain and be difficult to approach they have a great fondness for salt and pay regular visit to the numerous cavern of these mountain which be encrust with a saline substance walter cameron now change he intention of proceed to the eastward as he find the country not so full of beaver at that particular spot as he have anticipate he therefore turn towards the west penetrate into the interior of the mountain and take a considerable sweep through the lovely valley on they western slope the expedition which this enterprising fur-trader be conduct be one of the first that ever penetrate these wild region in search of fur the ground over which they travel be quite new to they and have no guide they just move about at haphazard encamp on the margin of every stream or river on which sign of the presence of beaver be discover and set they trap beaver skin at this time be worth 25 a-piece in the market of civilized land and in the snake country through which we friend be travel thousand of they be to be have from the indian for trinket and bauble that be scarce worth a farthe a beaver skin could be procure from the indian for a brass finger-ring or a penny looking-glass horse be also so numerous that one could be procure for a axe or a knife let not the reader however hastily conclude that the trader cheat the indian in this traffic though the profit be so enormous the ring or the axe be indeed a trifle to the trader but the beaver skin and the horse be equally trifle to the savage who could procure as many of they as he choose with very little trouble while the ring and the axe be in he estimation of priceless value besides be it remember to carry that ring and that axe to the far-distant haunt of the red-man cost the trader week and month of constant toil trouble anxiety and alas too frequently cost he he life the state of trade be considerably modify in these region at the present day it be not more _ justly _ conduct for in respect of the value of goods give for fur it be justly conduct _ then _ but time and circumstance have tend more to equalize the relative value of article of trade the snow which have prematurely fall have pass away and the trapper now find themselves wander about in a country so beautiful and a season so delightful that it would have seem to they a perfect paradise but for the savage tribe who hover about they and keep they ever on the _ qui vive _ they soon pass from the immediate embrace of stupendous height and dark gorge to a land of slope ridge which divide the country into a hundred luxuriant vale compose part of woodland and part of prairie through these numerous river and stream flow deviously beautify the landscape and enrich the land there be also many lake of all size and these swarm with fish while in some of they be find the much-sought-after and highly-esteemed beaver salt spring and hot spring of various temperature abound here and many of the latter be so hot that meat could be boil in they salt exist in all direction in abundance and of good quality a sulphurous spring be also discover bubble out from the base of a perpendicular rock three hundred foot high the water of which be dark-blue and taste like gunpowder in short the land present every variety of feature calculate to charm the imagination and delight the eye it be a mysterious land too for broad river burst in many place from the earth flow on for a short space and then disappear as if by magic into the earth from which they rise natural bridge span the torrent in many place and some of these be so correctly form that it be difficult to believe they have not be build by the hand of man they often appear opportunely to we trapper and save they the trouble and danger of ford river frequently the whole band would stop in silent wonder and awe as they listen to the rush of water under they foot as if another world of stream and rapid and cataract be flow below the crust of earth on which they stand some considerable stream be likewise observe to gush from the face of precipice some twenty or thirty foot from they summit while on the top no water be to be see wild berry of all kind be find in abundance and wild vegetable besides many nutritious root among other fish splendid salmon be find in the lake and river and animal life swarm on hill and in dale wood and valley plain and ravine teem with it on every plain the red-deer graze in herd by the bank of lake and stream wherever there be cluster of poplar and elder tree and sapling the beaver be see nibble industriously with he sharp tooth and commit as much havoc in the forest as if he have be arm with the woodman 's axe other sport in the eddy racoon sit in the tree-top the marten the black fox and the wolf prowl in the wood in quest of prey mountain sheep and goat browse on the rocky ridge and badger peep from they hole here too the wild horse spring snort and dishevel from he mountain retreat -- with flourish mane and tail spanking step and question gaze -- and thunder away over the plain and valley while the rock echo back he shrill neigh the huge heavy ungainly elk or moose-deer _ trot _ away from the traveller with speed equal to that of the mustang : elk seldom gallop they best speed be attain at the trot bear too black and brown and grizzly roam about everywhere so numerous be all these creature that on one occasion the hunter of the party bring in six wild horse three bear four elk and thirty red-deer have shoot they all a short distance ahead of the main body and almost without diverge from the line of march and this be a matter of everyday occurrence -- as it have need to be consider the number of mouth that have to be fill the feathered tribe be not less numerous chief among these be eagle and vulture of uncommon size the wild goose wild duck and the majestic swan in the midst of such profusion the trapper spend a happy time of it when not molest by the savage but they frequently lose a horse or two in consequence of the expertness of these thievish fellow they often wander however for day at a time without see a indian and at such time they enjoy to the full the luxury with which a bountiful god have bless these romantic region dick varley be almost wild with delight it be he first excursion into the remote wilderness he be young healthy strong and romantic and it be a question whether he or he dog 's heart or that of the noble wild horse he bestride bound most with joy at the glorious sight and sound and influence by which they be surround it would have be perfection have it not be for the frequent annoyance and alarm cause by the indian alas alas that we who write and read about those wondrous scene should have to condemn we own species as the most degrade of all the work of the creator there yet so it be man exercise he reason and conscience in the path of love and duty which he creator point out be god 's noblest work but man leave to the freedom of he own fall will sink morally lower than the beast that perish well may every christian wish and pray that the name and the gospel of the bless jesus may be send speedily to the dark place of the earth for you may read of and talk about but you _ can not conceive _ the fiendish wickedness and cruelty which cause tearless eye to glare and maddened heart to burst in the land of the heathen while we be on this subject let we add -lrb- and we young reader will come to know it if they be spare to see many year -rrb- that _ civilization _ alone will never improve the heart let history speak and it will tell you that deed of darkest hue have be perpetrate in so-called civilized though pagan land civilization be like the polish that beautify inferior furniture which water will wash off if it be but _ hot enough _ christianity resemble dye which permeate every fiber of the fabric and which nothing can eradicate the success of the trapper in procure beaver here be great in all sort of creek and river they be find one day they come to one of the curious river before mention which burst suddenly out of a plain flow on for several mile and then disappear into the earth as suddenly as it have rise even in this strange place beaver be see so the trap be set and a hundred and fifty be catch at the first lift the manner in which the party proceed be as follow : -- they march in a mass in group or in a long line accord to the nature of the ground over which they travel the hunter of the party go forward a mile or two in advance and scatter through the wood after they come the advance-guard be the bravest and most stalwart of the man mount on they best steed and with rifle in hand immediately behind follow the woman and child also mount and the pack-horse with the goods and camp equipage another band of trapper form the rear-guard to this impose cavalcade there be no strict regimental order keep but the people soon come to adopt the arrangement that be most convenient for all party and at length fall naturally into they place in the line of march joe blunt usually be the foremost and always the most successful of the hunter he be therefore seldom see on the march except at the hour of start and at night when he come back lead he horse which always groan under its heavy load of meat henrus be a hearty jovial soul and fond of society usually keep with the main body as for dick he be everywhere at once at least as much so as it be possible for human nature to be he horse never weary it seem to delight in go at full speed no other horse in the troop could come near charlie and dick indulge he by appear now at the front now at the rear anon in the center and frequently _ nowhere _ -- have go off with crusoe like a flash of lightning after a buffalo or a deer dick soon prove himself to be the best hunter of the party and it be not long before he fulfil he promise to crusoe and decorate he neck with a collar of grizzly bear claw well when the trapper come to a river where there be sign of beaver they call a halt and proceed to select a safe and convenient spot near wood and water for the camp here the property of the band be securely pile in such a manner as to form a breastwork or slight fortification and here walter cameron establish headquarters this be always the post of danger be expose to sudden attack by prowl savage who often dog the footstep of the party in they journeying to see what they could steal but cameron be a old hand and they find it difficult to escape he vigilant eye from this point all the trapper be send forth in small party every morning in various direction some on foot and some on horseback accord to the distance they have to go but they never go farther than twenty mile as they have to return to camp every evening each trapper have ten steel trap allow he these he set every night and visit every morning sometimes oftener when practicable select a spot in the stream where many tree have be cut down by beaver for the purpose of dam up the water in some place as many as fifty tree stump be see in one spot within the compass of half a acre all cut through at about eighteen inch from the root we may remark in pass that the beaver be very much like a gigantic water-rat with this marked difference that its tail be very broad and flat like a paddle the say tail be a greatly-esteemed article of food as indeed be the whole body at certain season of the year the beaver 's fore leg be very small and short and it use its paw as hand to convey food to its mouth sit the while in a erect position on its hind leg and tail its fur be a dense coat of a grayish-coloured down conceal by long coarse hair which lie smooth and be of a bright chestnut color its tooth and jaw be of enormous power with they it can cut through the branch of a tree as thick as a walking-stick at one snap and as we have say it gnaw through thick tree themselves as soon as a tree fall the beaver set to work industriously to lop off the branch which as well as the smaller trunk they cut into length accord to they weight and thickness these be then drag by main force to the water-side launch and float to they destination beaver build they house or lodge under the bank of river and lake and always select those of such depth of water that there be no danger of they be freeze to the bottom when such can not be find and they be compel to build in small rivulet of insufficient depth these clever little creature dam up the water until they be deep enough the bank throw up by they across rivulet for this purpose be of great strength and would do credit to human engineer they lodge be build of stick mud and stone which form a compact mass this freeze solid in winter and defy the assault of that housebreaker the wolverine a animal which be the beaver 's implacable foe from this lodge which be capable often of hold four old and six or eight young one a communication be maintain with the water below the ice so that should the wolverine succeed in break up the lodge he find the family not at home they have make good they retreat by the back-door when man act the part of housebreaker however he cunningly shut the back-door _ first _ by drive stake through the ice and thus stop the passage then he enter and we almost regret to say find the family at home we regret it because the beaver be a gentle peaceable affectionate hairy little creature towards which one feel a irresistible tenderness but to return from this long digression we trapper have select they several locality set they trap in the water so that when the beaver roam about at night they put they foot into they and be catch and drown for although they can swim and dive admirably they can not live altogether under water thus the different party proceed and in the morning the camp be a busy scene indeed for then the whole be engage in skin the animal the skin be always stretch dry fold up with the hair in the inside and lay by and the flesh be use for food but oftentimes the trapper have to go forth with the gun in one hand and they trap in the other while they keep a sharp look-out on the bush to guard against surprise despite they utmost effort a horse be occasionally steal before they very eye and sometimes even a unfortunate trapper be murder and all he trap carry off a event of this kind occur soon after the party have gain the western slope of the mountain three iroquois indian who belong to the band of trapper be send to a stream about ten mile off have reach they destination they all enter the water to set they trap foolishly neglect the usual precaution of one remain on the bank to protect the other they have scarcely commence operation when three arrow be discharge into they back and a party of snake indian rush upon and slew they carry away they trap and horse and scalp this be not know for several day when become anxious about they prolonged absence cameron send out a party which find they mangled body afford a loathsome banquet to the wolf and vulture after this sad event the trapper be more careful to go in larger party and keep watch as long as beaver be take in abundance the camp remain stationary but whenever the beaver begin to grow scarce the camp be raise and the party move on to another valley one day dick varley come gallop into camp with the news that there be several bear in a valley not far distant which he be anxious not to disturb until a number of the trapper be collect together to go out and surround they on receive the information walter cameron shake he head we have other thing to do young man say he than go a-hunting after bear i be just about make up my mind to send off a party to search out the valley on the other side of the blue mountain yonder and bring back word if there be beaver there for if not i mean to strike away direct south now if you have a mind to go with they you be welcome i 'll warrant you 'll find enough in the way of bear-hunting to satisfy you perhaps a little indian hunting to boot for if the banattee get hold of you horse you 'll have a long hunt before you find they again will you go ay right gladly reply dick when do we start this afternoon dick go off at once to he own part of the camp to replenish he powder-horn and bullet-pouch and wipe out he rifle that evening the party under command of a canadian name pierre set out for the blue hill they number twenty man and expect to be absent three day for they merely go to reconnoitre not to trap neither joe nor henrus be of this party both have be out hunting when it be organize but crusoe and charlie be of course pierre although a brave and trusty man be of a sour angry disposition and not a favorite with dick but the latter resolve to enjoy himself and disregard he sulky comrade be so well mount he not unfrequently shoot far ahead of he companion despite they warning that he run great risk by so do on one of these occasion he and crusoe witness a very singular fight which be worthy of record dick have feel a little wilder in spirit that morning than usual and on come to a pretty open plain he give the rein to charlie and with a _ adieu me camarade _ he be out of sight in a few minute he ride on several mile in advance without check speed and then come to a wood where rapid motion be inconvenient so he pull up and dismount tie charlie to a tree while he saunter on a short way on foot on come to the edge of a small plain he observe two large bird engage in mortal conflict crusoe observe they too and would soon have put a end to the fight have dick not check he creep as close to the belligerent as possible he find that one be a wild turkey-cock the other a white-headed eagle these two stand with they head down and all they feather bristle for a moment then they dash at each other and strike fiercely with they spur as we domestic cock do but neither fall and the fight be continue for about five minute without apparent advantage on either side dick now observe that from the uncertainty of its motion the turkey-cock be blind a discovery which cause a throb of compunction to enter he breast for standing and look on so he run forward the eagle see he instantly and try to fly away but be unable from exhaustion at he crusoe cry dick whose sympathy all lay with the other bird crusoe go forward at a bind and be meet by a peck between the eye that would have turn most dog but crusoe only wink and the next moment the eagle 's career be end dick find that the turkey-cock be quite blind the eagle have thrust out both its eye so in mercy he put a end to its suffering the fight have evidently be a long and severe one for the grass all round the spot for about twenty yard be beat to the ground and cover with the blood and feather of the fierce combatant meditate on the fight which he have just witness dick return towards the spot where he have leave charlie when he suddenly miss crusoe from he side hallo crusoe here pup where be you he cry the only answer to this be a sharp whizzing sound and a arrow pass close to he ear quiver in a tree beyond almost at the same moment crusoe 's angry roar be follow by a shriek from some one in fear or agony cock he rifle the young hunter spring through the bush towards he horse and be just in time to save a banattee indian from be strangle by the dog it have evidently scented out this fellow and pin he just as he be in the act of spring on the back of charlie for the halter be cut and the savage lay on the ground close beside he dick call off the dog and motion to the indian to rise which he do so nimbly that it be quite evident he have sustain no injury beyond the laceration of he neck by crusoe 's tooth and the surprise he be a tall strong indian for the tribe to which he belong so dick proceed to secure he at once point to he rifle and to the indian 's breast to show what he might expect if he attempt to escape dick order crusoe to keep he steady in that position the dog plant himself in front of the savage who begin to tremble for he scalp and gaze up in he face with a look which to say the least of it be the reverse of amiable while dick go towards he horse for the purpose of procure a piece of cord to tie he with the indian naturally turn he head to see what be go to be do but a peculiar _ gurgle _ in crusoe 's throat make he turn it round again very smartly and he do not venture thereafter to move a muscle in a few seconds dick return with a piece of leather and tie he hand behind he back while this be be do the indian glance several time at he bow which lay a few foot away where it have fall when the dog catch he but crusoe seem to understand he for he favor he with such a additional display of tooth and such a low -- apparently distant almost we might say subterranean -- _ rumble _ that he resign himself to he fate he hand secure a long line be attach to he neck with a run noose so that if he venture to run away the attempt would effect its own cure by produce strangulation the other end of this line be give to crusoe who at the word of command march he off while dick mount charlie and bring up the rear great be the laughter and merriment when this apparition meet the eye of the trapper but when they hear that he have attempt to shoot dick they ire be raise and a court-martial be hold on the spot hang the reptile cry one burn he shout another no no say a third do not imitate they villain : do not be cruel let 's shoot he shoot ` im cry pierre ouus dat be de ting it too goot pour lui mais it shall be doo do not ye think lad it would be better to let the poor wretch off say dick varley he have p ` r ` ap give a good account o ' we to he people there be a universal shout of contempt at this mild proposal unfortunately few of the man send on this explore expedition be imbue with the peace-making spirit of they chief and most of they seem glad to have a chance of vent they hatred of the poor indian on this unhappy wretch who although calm look sharply from one speaker to another to gather hope if possible from the tone of they voice dick be resolve at the risk of a quarrel with pierre to save the poor man 's life and have make up he mind to insist on have he conduct to the camp to be try by cameron when one of the man suggest that they should take the savage to the top of a hill about three mile farther on and there hang he up on a tree as a warn to all he tribe agree agree cry the man come on dick too seem to agree to this proposal and hastily order crusoe to run on ahead with the savage a order which the dog obey so vigorously that before the man have do laugh at he he be a couple of hundred yard ahead of they take care that he do not get off cry dick spring on charlie and stretch out at a gallop in a moment he be beside the indian scrape together the little of the indian language he know he stoop down and cut the thong that bind he say -- go white man love the indian the man cast on he deliverer one glance of surprise and the next moment bound aside into the bush and be go a loud shout from the party behind show that this act have be observe and crusoe stand with the end of the line in he mouth and a expression on he face that say you be absolutely incomprehensible dick it be all right i _ know _ but to my feeble capacity it _ seem _ wrong fat for you do dat shout pierre in a rage as he come up with a menacing look dick confront he the prisoner be mine i have a right to do with he as it like I true true cry several of the man who have begin to repent of they resolution and be glad the savage be off the lad 's right get along pierre you have no right you vas wrong ouus et i have goot vill to give you one knock on de nose dick look pierre in the face as he say this in a manner that cow he it be time he say quietly point to the sun to go on you bourgeois expect that time will not be waste pierre mutter something in a angry tone and wheeling round he horse dash forward at full gallop follow by the rest of the man the trapper encamp that night on the edge of a wide grassy plain which offer such tempting food for the horse that pierre resolve to forego he usual cautious plan of picketing they close to the camp and set they loose on the plain merely hobble they to prevent they stray far dick remonstrate but in vain a insolent answer be all he get for he pain he determine however to keep charlie close beside he all night and also make up he mind to keep a sharp look-out on the other horse at supper he again remonstrate no ` fraid say pierre whose pipe be begin to improve he temper the red reptile no dare to come in open plain when de moon so clear dun know that say a taciturn trapper who seldom venture a remark of any kind they varmint ` ud steal the two eye out o ' you ' head when they set they heart o not dat ar ' umposs ` ble for dey have no heart say a half-breed dey have von hole vere de heart va be this be receive with a shout of laughter in the midst of which a appalling yell be hear and as if by magic four indian be see on the back of four of the best horse yell like fiend and drive all the other horse furiously before they over the plain how they get there be a complete mystery but the man do not wait to consider that point catch up they gun they spring after they with the fury of madman and be quickly scatter far and wide dick order crusoe to follow and help the man and turn to spring on the back of charlie but at that moment he observe a indian 's head and shoulder rise above the grass not fifty yard in advance from he so without hesitation he dart forward intend to pounce upon he well would it have be for dick varley have he at that time possess a little more experience of the wiles and stratagem of the banattee the snake nation be subdivide into several tribe of which those inhabit the rocky mountain call the banattee be the most perfidious indeed they be confessedly the bandit of the hill and respect neither friend nor foe but rob all who come in they way dick reach the spot where the indian have disappear in less than a minute but no savage be to be see think he have creep ahead he run on a few yard farther and dart about hither and thither while he eye glance from side to side suddenly a shout in the camp attract he attention and look back he behold the savage on charlie 's back turn to fly next moment he be off and away far beyond the hope of recovery dick have leave he rifle in the camp otherwise the savage would have go but a short way as it be dick return and sit down on a mound of grass stare straight before he with a feeling akin to despair even crusoe could not have help he have he be there for nothing on four leg or on two could keep pace with charlie the banattee achieve this feat by adopt a stratagem which invariably deceive those who be ignorant of they habit and tactic when suddenly pursue the banattee sink into the grass and serpent-like creep along with wonderful rapidity not _ from _ but _ towards _ he enemy take care however to avoid he so that when the pursuer reach the spot where the pursue be suppose to be hide he hear he shout a yell of defiance far away in the rear it be thus that the banattee elude dick and gain the camp almost as soon as the other reach the spot where he have disappear one by one the trapper come back weary rage and despair in a short time they all assemble and soon begin to reproach each other ere long one or two have a fight which result in several bloody nose and black eye thus add to the misery which one would think have be bad enough without such addition at last they finish they supper and they pipe and then lay down to sleep under the tree till morning when they arise in a particularly silent and sulky mood roll up they blanket strap they thing on they shoulder and begin to trudge slowly back to the camp on foot chapter xxi _ wolf attack the horse and cameron circumvent the wolf _ -- _ a bear-hunt in which henrus shine conspicuous _ -- _ joe and the natter-list _ -- _ a alarm _ -- _ a surprise and a capture _ we must now return to the camp where walter cameron still guard the goods and the man pursue they trapping avocation here seven of the horse have be kill in one night by wolf while grazing in a plain close to the camp and on the night follow a horse that have stray be also tear to piece and devour the prompt and daring manner in which this have be do convinced the trader that white wolf have unfortunately scented they out and he set several trap in the hope of capture they white wolf be quite distinct from the ordinary wolf that prowl through wood and plain in large pack they be much larger weigh sometimes as much as a hundred and thirty pound but they be comparatively scarce and move about alone or in small band of three or four they strength be enormous and they be so fierce that they do not hesitate upon occasion to attack man himself they method of kill horse be very deliberate two wolf generally undertake the cold-blooded murder they approach they victim with the most innocent-looking and frolicsome gambol lie down and roll about and frisk presently until the horse become a little accustomed to they then one approach right in front the other in rear still frisk playfully until they think themselves near enough when they make a simultaneous rush the wolf which approach in rear be the true assailant the rush of the other be a mere feint then both fasten on the poor horse 's haunch and never let go till the sinew be cut and he be roll on he side the horse make comparatively little struggle in this deadly assault he seem paralyzed and soon fall to rise no more cameron set he trap towards evening in a circle with a bait in the center and then retire to rest next morning he call joe blunt and the two go off together it be strange that these rascally white wolf should be so bold when the smaller kind be so cowardly remark cameron as they walk along so ` tis reply joe but i have seed they other chap bold enough too in the prairie when they be in large pack and starvin ' i believe the small wolf follow the big fellow and help they to eat what they kill though they generally sit round and look on at the killing hist exclaim joe cock he gun there he be a ' no mistake there he be undoubtedly a wolf of the largest size with one of he foot in the trap he be a terrible-looking object for besides he immense size and naturally ferocious aspect he white hair bristle on end and be all cover with streak and spot of blood from he bloody jaw in he effort to escape he have bite the trap until he have break he tooth and lacerate he gum so that he appearance be hideous in the extreme and when the two man come up he struggle with all he might to fly at they cameron and joe stand look at he in a sort of wonder admiration we have better put a ball in he suggest joe after a time mayhap the chain will not stand sich tug long true joe if it break we might get a ugly nip before we kill he so say cameron fire into the wolf 's head and kill it it be find on examination that four wolf have be in the trap but the rest have escape two of they however have gnaw off they paw and leave they lie in the trap after this the big wolf do not trouble they again the same afternoon a bear-hunt be undertake which well-nigh cost one of the iroquois he life it happen thus : -- while cameron and joe be away after the white wolf henri come flounder into camp toss he arm like a maniac and shout that seven bar wo be down in de bush close by it chance that this be a idle day with most of the man so they all leap on they horse and take gun and knife sally forth to give battle to the bear arrive at the scene of action they find the seven bear busily engage in digging up root so the man separate in order to surround they and then close in the place be partly open and partly cover with thick bush into which a horseman could not penetrate the moment the bear get wind of what be go forward they make off as fast as possible and then commence a scene of firing gallop and yell that defy description four out of the seven be shoot before they gain the bush the other three be wound but make good they retreat as they place of shelter however be like island in the plain they have no chance of escape the horseman now dismount and dash recklessly into the bush where they soon discover and kill two of the bear the third be not find for some time at last a iroquoi come upon it so suddenly that he have not time to point he gun before the bear spring upon he and strike he to the earth where it hold he down instantly the place be surround by eager man but the bush be so thick and the fall tree among which the bear stand be so numerous that they could not use they gun without run the risk of shoot they companion most of they draw they knife and seem about to rush on the bear with these but the monster 's aspect as it glare around be so terrible that they hold back for a moment in hesitation at this moment henrus who have be at some distance engage in the killing of one of the other bear come rush forward after he own peculiar manner ah fat be eet -- hay de bar no go under yit just then he eye fall on the wound iroquois with the bear above he and he utter a yell so intense in tone that the bear himself seem to feel that something decisive be about to be do at last henrus do not pause but with a fly dash he spring like a spread eagle arm and leg extend right into the bear 's bosom at the same moment he send he long hunting-knife down into its heart but bruin be proverbially hard to kill and although mortally wound he have strength enough to open he jaw and close they on henrus 's neck there be a cry of horror and at the same moment a volley be fire at the bear 's head for the trapper feel that it be better to risk shoot they comrade than see they kill before they eye fortunately the bullet take effect and tumble he over at once without do damage to either of the man although several of the ball just graze henrus 's temple and carry off he cap although uninjured by the shot the poor iroquoi have not escape scathless from the paw of the bear he scalp be tear almost off and hang down over he eye while blood stream down he face he be convey by he comrade to the camp where he lay two day in a state of insensibility at the end of which time he revive and recover daily afterwards when the camp move he have to be carry but in the course of two month he be as well as ever and quite as fond of bear-hunting among other trophy of this hunt there be two deer and a buffalo which last have probably stray from the herd four or five iroquoi be round this animal whet they knife for the purpose of cut it up when henrus pass so he turn aside to watch they perform the operation quite regardless of the fact that he neck and face be cover with blood which flow from one or two small puncture make by the bear the indian begin by take off the skin which certainly do not occupy they more than five minute then they cut up the meat and make a pack of it and cut out the tongue which be somewhat troublesome as that member require to be cut out from under the jaw of the animal and not through the natural opening of the mouth one of the fore leg be cut off at the knee joint and this be use as a hammer with which to break the skull for the purpose of take out the brain these be use in the process of dress and soften the animal 's skin a axe would have be of advantage to break the skull but in the hurry of rush to the attack the indian have forget they axis so they adopt the common fashion of use the buffalo 's hoof as a hammer the shank be the handle the whole operation of flay cut up and pack the meat do not occupy more than twenty minute before leave the ground these expert butcher treat themselves to a little of the marrow and warm liver in a raw state cameron and joe walk up to the group while they be indulge in this little feast well i have often see that eat but i never could do it myself remark the former no cry joe in surprise now that be oncommon cur ` we i have _ live _ on raw liver a ' marrow-bone for two or three day at a time when we wo chase by the camanchee injun a ' do not dare to make a fire a ' it be ra'al good it be will not ye try it _ now _ cameron shake he head no thankee i 'll not refuse when i can not help it but until then i 'll remain in happy ignorance of how good it be well it _ be _ strange how some folk can not abide anything in the meat way they ha 'n' t bin use to d'ye know i have actually know man from the city as would not eat a bit o ' horseflesh for love or money would ye believe it i can well believe that joe for i have meet with such person myself in fact they be rather numerous what be you chuckle at joe chucklin ' if ye mean be that ` larfin in to myself ' it be because i be thinkin ' o ' a chap as once come out to the prairie let we walk back to the camp joe and you can tell I about he as we go along i think continued joe he come from washington but i never could make out right whether he wo a government man or not anyhow he wo a pheelosopher -- a natter-list i think he call his-self -- a naturalist suggest cameron ay that wo more like it well he wo about six foot two in he moccasin a ' as thin as a ramrod a ' as blind as a bat -- leastway he have weak eye a ' wear green spectacles he have on a gray shootin ' coat a ' trousers a ' vest a ' cap with rid whisker a ' a long nose as rid at the point as the whisker wos well this gentleman engage I a ' another hunter to go a trip with he into the prairie so off we sot one fine day on three hoss with we blanket at we back -- we wo to depend on the rifle for victuals at first i think the natter-list one o ' the cruellest beggar as iver go on two long leg for he use to go about everywhere pokin ' pin through all the beetle a ' fly a ' creepin ' thing he could sot eye on a ' stick they in a box but he tell I he come here a-purpose to git as many o ' they as he could so say i ` if that be it i 'll fill yer box in no time ' ` will ye ' say he quite pleased like ' i will ' say i a ' gallop off to a place as be fill wus ' all sort o ' crawlin ' thing so i set to work a ' whenever i seed a thing crawlin ' i sot my fut on it a ' crush it a ' soon fill my breast pocket i cotched a lot o ' butterfly too a ' stuff they into my shot-pouch a ' go back in a hour or two a ' show he the lot he put on he green spectacles a ' look at they as if he would see a rattlesnake ` my good man ' say he ` you have crush

say but he send the whole charge right into martin 's back -- martin be my comrade 's name by good luck martin have on a thick leather coat so the shot niver get the length o ' he skin one day i notice that the natter-list have stuff small cork into the muzzle of all the six barrel of he revolver i wonder what they wo for but he wo al ` ay doin ' sich queer thing that i soon forget it ` maybe ' think i jist before it go out o ' my mind -- ` maybe he think that 'll stop the pistol from goin ' off by accident ' for ye must know he would let it off three time the first day by accident a ' well-nigh blow off he leg the last time only the shot lodge in the back o ' a big toad he would jist stuff into he breeches pocket well soon after we shoot a buffalo bull so when it fall off he jump from he horse a ' run up to it so do i for i be not sure the beast be dead a ' i have jist get up when it rise a ' rush at the natter-list ` out o ' the way ' i yell for my rifle be empty but he do not move so i rush for ` ard a ' draw the pistol out o ' he belt and let fly in the bull 's rib jist as it run the poor man down martin come up that moment a ' put a ball through its heart a ' then we go to pick up the natter-list he come to in a little a ' the first thing he say be ` where 's my revolver ' when i give it to he he look at it a ' say with a solemcholy shake o ' the head ` there be a whole barrel-full lose ' it turn out that he have take to usin ' the barrel for bottle to hold thing in but he forget to draw the charge so sure enough i have fire a charge o ' bum-bee a ' beetle a '

camp and here they find the woman and child fly about in a state of terror and the few man who have be leave in charge arm themselves in the greatest haste hallo something wrong here cry cameron hasten forward follow by joe what have happen eh injun comin ' monsieur look dere answer a trapper point down the valley arm and mount at once and come to the front of the camp cry cameron in a tone of voice that silence every other and turn confusion into order the cause of all this outcry be a cloud of dust see far down the valley which be raise by a band of mount indian who approach the camp at full speed they number could not be make out but they be a sufficiently formidable band to cause much anxiety to cameron whose man at the time be scatter to the various trapping-grounds and only ten chance to be within call of the camp however with these ten he determine to show a bold front to the savage whether they come as friend or foe he therefore order the woman and child within the citadel form of the goods and pack of fur pile upon each other which point of retreat be to be defend to the last extremity then gallop to the front he collect he man and sweep down the valley at full speed in a few minute they be near enough to observe that the enemy only number four indian who be drive a band of about a hundred horse before they and so busy be they in keep the troop together that cameron and he man be close upon they before they be observe it be too late to escape joe blunt and henrus have already sweep round and cut off they retreat in this extremity the indian slip from the back of they steed and dart into the bush where they be safe from pursuit at least on horseback while the trapper get behind the horse and drive they towards the camp at this moment one of the horse spring ahead of the other and make for the mountain with its mane and tail fly wildly in the breeze marrow-bone and button shout one of the man there go dick varley 's horse so it be cry henrus and dash off in pursuit follow by joe and two other why these be we own horse say cameron in surprise as they drive they into a corner of the hill from which they could not escape this be true but it be only half the truth for besides they own horse they have secure upward of seventy indian steed a most acceptable addition to they stud which owe to casualty and wolf have be diminish too much of late the fact be that the indian who have capture the horse belong to pierre and he party be a small band of robber who have travel as be afterwards learn a considerable distance from the south steal horse from various tribe as they go along as we have see in a evil hour they fall in with pierre 's party and carry off they steed which they drive to a pass lead from one valley to the other here they unite they with the main band of they ill-gotten gain and while the greater number of the robber descend farther into the plain in search of more booty four of they be send into the mountain with the horse already procure these four utterly ignorant of the presence of white man in the valley drive they charge as we have see almost into the camp cameron immediately organize a party to go out in search of pierre and he companion about whose fate he become intensely anxious and in the course of half-an-hour as many man as he could spare with safety be despatch in the direction of the blue mountain chapter xxii _ charlie 's adventure with savage and bear _ -- _ trapping life _ it be one thing to chase a horse it be another thing to catch it little consideration and less sagacity be require to convince we of the truth of that fact the reader may perhaps venture to think this rather a trifling fact we be not so sure of that in this world of fancy to have _ any _ fact incontestably prove and establish be a comfort and whatever be a source of comfort to mankind be worthy of notice surely we reader will not deny that perhaps he will so we can only console ourself with the remark that there be people in this world who would deny _ anything _ -- who would deny that there be a nose on they face if you say there be well to return to the point which be the chase of a horse in the abstract from which we will rapidly diverge to the chase of dick varley 's horse in particular this noble charger have be ride by savage until all he old fire and blood and mettle be work up to a red heat no sooner discover that he be pursue than he give a snort of defiance which he accompany with a frantic shake of he mane and a fling of contempt in addition to a magnificent wave of he tail then he thunder up the valley at a pace which would speedily have leave joe blunt and henrus out of sight behind if -- ay that be the word _ if _ what a word that _ if _ be what a world of _ if 's _ we live in there never be anything that would not have be something else _ if _ something have not intervene to prevent it yes we repeat charlie would have leave he two friend mile and mile behind in what be call no time _ if _ he have not run straight into a gorge which be surround by inaccessible precipice and out of which there be no exit except by the entrance which be immediately bar by henrus while joe advance to catch the run-away for two hour at least do joe blunt essay to catch charlie and during that space of time he utterly fail the horse seem to have make up he mind for what be vulgarly term a lark it will not do henrus say joe advance towards he companion and wipe he forehead with the cuff of he leathern coat i can not catch he the wind 's a ` most blow out o ' I body dat be vexatiable reply henrus in a tone of commiseration s ` pose i wos make try in that case i s ` pose ye would fail but go ahead a ' do what ye can i 'll hold yer horse so henrus begin by a rush and a flourish of leg and arm that nearly frighten the horse out of he wit for half-an-hour he go through all the complication of run and twist of which he be capable without success when joe blunt suddenly utter a stentorian yell that rooted he to the spot on which he stand to account for this we must explain that in the height of the rocky mountain vast accumulation of snow take place among the crevice and gorge during winter such of these mass as form on steep slope be loosen by occasional thaw and be precipitate in the form of avalanche into the valley below carry tree and stone along with they in they thundering descent in the gloomy gorge where dick 's horse have take refuge the precipice be so steep that many avalanche have occur as be evident from the mound of heap snow that lay at the foot of most of they neither stone nor tree be carry down here however for the cliff be nearly perpendicular and the snow slip over they edge have fall on the grass below such a avalanche be now about to take place and it be this that cause joe to utter he cry of alarm and warning henrus and the horse be directly under the cliff over which it be about to be hurl the latter close to the wall of rock the other at some distance away from it joe cry again back henri back _ vite _ when the mass _ flow over _ and fall with a roar like prolonged thunder henrus spring back in time to save he life though he be knock down and almost stunned but poor charlie be completely bury under the avalanche which now present the appearance of a _ hill _ of snow the instant henrus recover sufficiently joe and he mount they horse and gallop back to the camp as fast as possible meanwhile another spectator step forward upon the scene they have leave and survey the snow hill with a critical eye this be no less than a grizzly bear which have unobserved be a spectator and which immediately proceed to dig into the mound with the purpose no doubt of disentomb the carcass of the horse for purpose of he own while he be thus actively engage the two hunter reach the camp where they find that pierre and he party have just arrive the man send out in search of they have scarcely advance a mile when they find they trudge back to the camp in a very disconsolate manner but all they sorrow be put to flight on hearing of the curious way in which the horse have be return to they with interest scarcely have dick varley however congratulate himself on the recovery of he gallant steed when he be throw into despair by the sudden arrival of joe with the tiding of the catastrophe we have just relate of course there be a general rush to the rescue only a few man be order to remain to guard the camp while the remainder mount they horse and gallop towards the gorge where charlie have be entomb on arrive they find that bruin have work with such laudable zeal that nothing but the tip of he tail be see stick out of the hole which he have dig the hunter could not refrain from laugh as they spring to the ground and standing in a semicircle in front of the hole prepare to fire but crusoe resolve to have the honor of lead the assault he seize fast hold of bruin 's flank and cause he tooth to meet therein caleb back out at once and turn round but before he could recover from he surprise a dozen bullet pierce he heart and brain now lad cry cameron set to work with a large wooden shovel work like nigger if there be any life leave in the horse it 'll soon be smother out unless we set he free the man need no urge however they work as if they life depend on they exertion dick varley in particular labor like a young hercule and henrus hurl mass of snow about in a most surprising manner crusoe too enter heartily into the spirit of the work and scrape with he forepaw send such a continuous shower of snow behind he that he be speedily lose to view in a hole of he own excavate in the course of half-an-hour a cavern be dig in the mound almost close up to the cliff and the man be begin to look about for the crushed body of dick 's steed when a exclamation from henrus attract they attention ha me ami here be be one hole the truth of this could not be doubt for the eccentric trapper have thrust he shovel through the wall of snow into what appear to be a cavern beyond and immediately follow up he remark by thrust in he head and shoulder he draw they out in a few seconds with a look of intense amazement voil joe blunt look in dere and you shall see fat you vill behold why it be the horse i do b ` lieve cry joe go ahead lad so say he resume he shovelling vigorously and in a few minute the hole be open up sufficiently to enable a man to enter dick spring in and there stand charlie close beside the cliff look as sedate and unconcerned as if all that have be go on have no reference to he whatever the cause of he safety be simple enough the precipice beside which he stand when the avalanche occur overhang its base at that point considerably so that when the snow descend a clear space of several foot wide be leave all along its base here charlie have remain in perfect comfort until he friend dig he out congratulating themselves not a little on have save the charger and bag a grizzly bear the trapper remount and return to the camp for some time after this nothing worthy of particular note occur the trapping operation go on prosperously and without interruption from the indian who seem to have leave the locality altogether during this period dick and crusoe and charlie have many excursion together and the silver rifle full many a time send death to the heart of bear and elk and buffalo while indirectly it send joy to the heart of man woman and child in camp in the shape of juicy steak and marrow-bone joe and henrus devoted themselves almost exclusively to trapping beaver in which pursuit they be so successful that they speedily become wealthy man accord to backwood notion of wealth with the beaver that they catch they purchase from cameron 's store powder and shot enough for a long hunting expedition and a couple of spare horse to carry they pack they also purchase a large assortment of such goods and trinket as would prove acceptable to indian and supply themselves with new blanket and a few pair of strong moccasin of which they stand much in need thus they go on from day to day until symptom of the approach of winter warn they that it be time to return to the mustang valley about this time a event occur which totally change the aspect of affair in these remote valley of the rocky mountain and precipitate the departure of we four friend dick joe henrus and crusoe this be the sudden arrival of a whole tribe of indian as they advent be somewhat remarkable we shall devote to it the commencement of a new chapter chapter xxiii _ savage sport -- live cataract -- a alarm -- indian and they doings -- the stampede -- charlie again _ one day dick varley be out on a solitary hunting expedition near the rocky gorge where he horse have receive temporary burial a week or two before crusoe be with he of course dick have tie charlie to a tree and be sun himself on the edge of a cliff from the top of which he have a fine view of the valley and the rugged precipice that hem it in just in front of the spot on which he sit the precipice on the opposite side of the gorge rise to a considerable height above he so that they ragged outline be draw sharply across the clear sky dick be gaze in dreamy silence at the jut rock and dark cavern and speculate on the probable number of bear that dwell there when a slight degree of restlessness on the part of crusoe attract he what be ' t pup say he lay he hand on the dog 's broad back crusoe look the answer i do not know dick but it be _ something _ you may depend upon it else i would not have disturb you dick lift he rifle from the ground and lay it in the hollow of he left arm there must be something in the wind remark dick as wind be know to be compose of two distinct gas crusoe feel perfectly safe in reply yes with he tail immediately after he add hallo do you hear that with he ear dick do hear it and spring hastily to he foot as a sound like yet unlike distant thunder come faintly down upon the breeze in a few seconds the sound increase to a roar in which be mingle the wild cry of man neither dick nor crusoe move for the sound come from behind the height in front of they and they feel that the only way to solve the question what can the sound be be to wait till the sound should solve it themselves suddenly the muffle sound give place to the distinct bellowing of cattle the clatter of innumerable hoof and the yell of savage man while at the same moment the edge of the opposite cliff become alive with indian and buffalo rush about in frantic haste -- the former almost mad with savage excitement the latter with blind rage and terror on reach the edge of the dizzy precipice the buffalo turn abruptly and toss they ponderous head as they course along the edge yet a few of they unable to check they headlong course fall over and be dash to piece on the rock below such fall dick observe be hail with shout of delight by the indian whose sole object evidently be to enjoy the sport of drive the terrify animal over the precipice the wily savage have choose they ground well for this purpose the cliff immediately opposite to dick varley be a huge projection from the precipice that hem in the gorge a species of cape or promontory several hundred yard wide at the base and narrow abruptly to a point the side of this wedge-shaped projection be quite perpendicular -- indeed in some place the top overhang the base -- and they be at least three hundred foot high broken and jagged rock of that peculiarly chaotic character which probably suggest the name to this part of the great american chain project from and be scatter all round the cliff over these the indian whose number increase every moment strive to drive the luckless herd of buffalo that have chance to fall in they way the task be easy the unsuspecting animal of which there be hundred rush in a dense mass upon the cape refer to on they come with irresistible impetuosity bellow furiously while they hoof thunder on the turf with the muffle continuous roar of a distant but mighty cataract the indian meanwhile urge they on by hideous yell and frantic gesture the advance-guard come bound madly to the edge of the precipice here they stop short and gaze affright at the gulf below it be but for a moment the irresistible momentum of the fly mass behind push they over down they come absolutely a living cataract upon the rock below some strike on the project rock in the descent and they body be dash almost in piece while they blood spurt out in shower other leap from rock to rock with awful bound until lose they foothold they fall headlong while other descend sheer down into the sweltering mass that lay shatter at the base of the cliff dick varley and he dog remain rooted to the rock as they gaze at the sickening sight as if petrified scarce fifty of that noble herd of buffalo escape the awful leap but they escape only to fall before the arrow of they ruthless pursuer dick have often hear of this tendency of the indian where buffalo be very numerous to drive they over precipice in mere wanton sport and cruelty but he have never see it until now and the sight fill he soul with horror it be not until the din and tumult of the perish herd and the shrill yell of the indian have almost die away that he turn to quit the spot but the instant he do so another shout be raise the savage have observe he and be see gallop along the cliff towards the head of the gorge with the obvious intention of gain the other side and capture he dick spring on charlie 's back and the next instant be fly down the valley towards the camp he do not however fear be overtake for the gorge could not be cross and the way round the head of it be long and rugged but he be anxious to alarm the camp as quickly as possible so that they might have time to call in the more distant trapper and make preparation for defense where away now youngster inquire cameron emerge from he tent as dick take the brook that flow in front at a fly leap come crash through the bush into the midst of the fur-pack at full speed injun ejaculate dick rein up and vault out of the saddle hundred of 'em fiend incarnate every one be they near yes a hour 'll bring they down on we be joe and henrus far from camp to-day at ten-mile creek reply cameron with a expression of bitterness as he catch up he gun and shout to several man who hurry up on see we hero burst into camp ten-mile creek mutter dick i 'll bring 'em in though he continue glance at several of the camp horse that graze close at hand in another moment he be on charlie 's back the line of one of the best horse be in he hand and almost before cameron know what he be about he be fly down the valley like the wind charlie often stretch out at full speed to please he young master but seldom have he be urge forward as he be upon this occasion the lead horse be light and wild keep well up and in a marvellously short space of time they be at ten-mile creek hallo dick wot 's to do inquire joe blunt who be up to he knee in the water set a trap at the moment he friend gallop up injun where 's henrus demand dick at the head o ' the dam there dick be off in a moment and almost instantly return with henrus gallop beside he no word be speak in time of action these man do not waste word during dick 's momentary absence joe blunt have catch up he rifle and examine the priming so that when dick pull up beside he he merely lay he hand on the saddle say all right as he vault on charlie 's back behind he young companion in another moment they be away at full speed the mustang seem to feel that unwonted exertion be require of he double weighted though he be he keep well up with the other horse and in less than two hour after dick 's leave the camp the three hunter come in sight of it meanwhile cameron have collect nearly all he force and put he camp in a state of defense before the indian arrive which they do suddenly and as usual at full gallop to the amount of at least two hundred they do not at first seem disposed to hold friendly intercourse with the trapper but assemble in a semicircle round the camp in a menacing attitude while one of they chief step forward to hold a palaver for some time the conversation on both side be polite enough but by degree the indian chief assume a imperious tone and demand gift from the trapper take care to enforce he request by hint that thousand of he countryman be not far distant cameron stoutly refuse and the palaver threaten to come to a abrupt and unpleasant termination just at the time that dick and he friend appear on the scene of action the brook be clear at a bind the three hunter leap from they steed and spring to the front with a degree of energy that have a visible effect on the savage and cameron seize the moment propose that the two party should smoke a pipe and hold a council the indian agree and in a few minute they be engage in animated and friendly intercourse the speech be long and the compliment pay on either side be inflated and we fear undeserved but the result of the interview be that cameron make the indian a present of tobacco and a few trinket and send they back to they friend to tell they that he be willing to trade with they next day the whole tribe arrive in the valley and pitch they deerskin tent on the plain opposite to the camp of the white man they number far exceed cameron 's expectation and it be with some anxiety that he proceed to strengthen he fortification as much as circumstance and the nature of the ground would admit the indian camp which number upward of a thousand soul be arrange with great regularity and be divide into three distinct section each section be compose of a separate tribe the great snake nation at that time embrace three tribe or division -- namely the shirry-dika or dog-eater the war-are-ree-ka or fish-eater and the banattee or robber these be the most numerous and powerful indian on the west side of the rocky mountain the shirry-dikas dwelt in the plain and hunt the buffalo dress well be cleanly rich in horse bold independent and good warrior the war-are-ree-kas live chiefly by fishing and be find on the bank of the river and lake throughout the country they be more corpulent slovenly and indolent than the shirry-dika and more peaceful the banattee as we have before mention be the robber of the mountain they be a wild and contemptible race and at enmity with every one in summer they go about nearly naked in winter they clothe themselves in the skin of rabbit and wolf be excellent mimic they could imitate the howling of wolf the neighing of horse and the cry of bird by which mean they could approach traveller rob they and then fly to they rocky fastness in the mountain where pursuit be vain such be the man who now assemble in front of the camp of the fur-trader and cameron soon find that the news of he presence in the country have spread far and wide among the native bring they to the neighborhood of he camp in immense crowd so that during the next few day they number increase to thousand several long palaver quickly ensue between the red man and the white and the two great chief who seem to hold despotic rule over the assemble tribe be extremely favourable to the idea of universal peace which be propound to they in several set speech of great length and very considerable power these natural orator explain they willingness to enter into amicable relation with all the surround nation as well as with the white man but say pee-eye-em the chief of the shirry-dika a man above six foot high and of immense muscular strength -- but my tribe can not answer for the banattee who be robber and can not be punish because they dwell in scatter family among the mountain the banattee be bad they can not be trust none of the banattee be present at the council when this be say and if they have be it would have matter little for they be neither fierce nor courageous although bold enough in they own haunt to murder and rob the unwary the second chief do not quite agree with pee-eye-em he say that it be impossible for they to make peace with they natural enemy the peigan and the blackfeet on the east side of the mountain it be very desirable he admit but neither of these tribe would consent to it he feel sure upon this joe blunt rise and say the great chief of the war-are-ree-ka be wise and know that enemy can not be reconcile unless deputy be send to make proposal of peace the pale-face do not know the blackfeet answer the chief who will go into the land of the blackfeet my young man have be send once and again and they scalp be now fringe to the leggings of they enemy the war-are-ree-ka do not cross the mountain but for the purpose of make war the chief speak truth return joe yet there be three man round the council fire who will go to the blackfeet and the peigan with message of peace from the snake if they wish it joe point to himself henrus and dick as he speak and add we three do not belong to the camp of the fur-trader we only lodge with they for a time the great chief of the white man have send we to make peace with the red-man and to tell they that he desire to trade with they -- to exchange hatchet and gun and blanket for fur this declaration interested the two chief greatly and after a good deal of discussion they agree to take advantage of joe blunt 's offer and appoint he as a deputy to the court of they enemy have arrange these matter to they satisfaction cameron bestow a red flag and a blue surtout with brass button on each of the chief and a variety of smaller article on the other member of the council and send they away in a particularly amiable frame of mind pee-eye-em burst the blue surtout at the shoulder and elbow in put it on as it be much too small for he gigantic frame but never have see such a article of apparel before he either regard this as the natural and proper consequence of put it on or be totally indifferent to it for he merely look at the rent with a smile of satisfaction while he squaw surreptitiously cut off the two back button and thrust they into she bosom by the time the council close the night be far advance and a bright moon be shed a flood of soft light over the picturesque and busy scene i 'll go to the injun camp say joe to walter cameron as the chief rise to depart the season 's far enough advanced already it be time to be off and if i be to speak for the redskin in the blackfeet council i would need to know what to say please yourself master blunt answer cameron i like you company and that of you friend and if it suit you i would be glad to take you along with we to the coast of the pacific but you mission among the indian be a good one and i 'll help it on all i can -- i suppose you will go also he add turn to dick varley who be still seat beside the council fire caress crusoe wherever joe go i go answer dick crusoe 's tail ear and eye demonstrate high approval of the sentiment involve in this speech and you friend henrus he go too answer joe it be as well that the redskin should see the three o ' we before we start for the east side o ' the mountain -- ho henrus come here lad henrus obey and in a few seconds the three friend cross the brook to the indian camp and be guide to the principal lodge by pee-eye-em here a great council be hold and the propose attempt at negotiation for peace with they ancient enemy fully discuss while they be thus engage and just as pee-eye-em have in the energy of a enthusiastic peroration burst the blue surtout _ almost _ up to the collar a distant rush sound be hear which cause every man to spring to he foot run out of the tent and seize he weapon what can it be joe whisper dick as they stand at the tent door lean on they rifle and listen intently dun ` no ' answer joe shortly most of the numerous fire of the camp have go out but the bright moon reveal the dusky form of thousand of indian whom the unwonted sound have startle move rapidly about the mystery be soon explain the indian camp be pitch on a open plain of several mile in extent which take a sudden bend half-a-mile distant where a spur of the mountain shut out the farther end of the valley from view from beyond this point the dull rumble sound proceed suddenly there be a roar as if a mighty cataract have be let loose upon the scene at the same moment a countless herd of wild horse come thunder round the base of the mountain and sweep over the plain straight towards the indian camp a stampede cry joe spring to the assistance of pee-eye-em whose favorite horse be picket near the tent on they come like a living torrent and the thunder of a thousand hoof be soon mingled with the howling of hundred of dog in the camp and the yell of indian as they vainly endeavor to restrain the rise excitement of they steed henrus and dick stand root to the ground gaze in silent wonder at the fierce and uncontrollable gallop of the thousand of panic-stricken horse that bear down upon the camp with the tumultuous violence of a mighty cataract as the maddened troop draw nigh the camp horse begin to snort and tremble violently and when the rush of the wild steed be almost upon they they become ungovernable with terror break they halter and hobble and dash wildly about to add to the confusion at that moment a cloud pass over the moon and throw the whole scene into deep obscurity blind with terror which be probably increase by the din of they own mad flight the gallop troop come on and with a sound like the continuous roar of thunder that for a instant drown the yell of dog and man they burst upon the camp trampling over pack and skin and dry meat etc in they headlong speed and overturn several of the smaller tent in another moment they sweep out upon the plain beyond and be soon lose in the darkness of the night while the yelping of dog as they vainly pursue they mingled and gradually die away with the distant thunder of they retreat this be a _ stampede _ one of the most extraordinary scene that can be witness in the western wilderness lend a hand henrus shout joe who be struggle with a powerful horse wot 's come over yer brain man this brute 'll git off if you do not look sharp dick and henrus both answer to the summons and they succeed in throw the struggle animal on its side and hold it down until its excitement be somewhat abate pee-eye-em have also be successful in secure he favorite hunter : but nearly every other horse belong to the camp have break loose and join the whirlwind gallop but they gradually drop out and before morning the most of they be secure by they owner as there be at least two thousand horse and a equal number of dog in the part of the indian camp which have be thus overrun by the wild mustang the turmoil as may be imagine be prodigious yet strange to say no accident of a serious nature occur beyond the loss of several charger in the midst of this exciting scene there be one heart which beat with a nervous vehemence that well-nigh burst it this be the heart of dick varley 's horse charlie well know to he be that distant rumble sound that float on the night air into the fur-trader ' camp where he be picket close to cameron 's tent many a time have he hear the approach of such a wild troop and often in day not long go by have he shrill neigh ring out as he join and lead the panic-stricken band he be first to hear the sound and by he restive action to draw the attention of the fur-trader to it as a precautionary measure they all spring up and stand by they horse to soothe they but as a brook with a belt of bush and quarter of a mile of plain intervene between they camp and the mustang as they fly past they have little or no trouble in restrain they not so however with charlie at the very moment that he master be congratulating himself on the suppose security of he position he wrench the halter from the hand of he who hold it burst through the barrier of fell tree that have be throw round the camp clear the brook at a bind and with a wild hilarious neigh resume he old place in the rank of the free-born mustang of the prairie little do dick think when the flood of horse sweep past he that he own good steed be there rejoice in he recovered liberty but crusoe know it ay the wind have bear down the information to he acute nose before the living storm burst upon the camp and when charlie rush past with the long tough halter trail at he heel crusoe spring to he side seize the end of the halter with he tooth and gallop off along with he it be a long gallop and a tough one but crusoe hold on for it be a settle principle in he mind _ never _ to give in at first the check upon charlie 's speed be imperceptible but by degree the weight of the gigantic dog begin to tell and after a time they fall a little to the rear then by good fortune the troop pass through a mass of underwood and the line get entangled bring they mad career forcibly to a close the mustang pass on and the two friend be leave to keep each other company in the dark how long they would have remain thus be uncertain for neither of they have sagacity enough to undo a complicated entanglement fortunately however in he energetic tug at the line crusoe 's sharp tooth partially sever it and a sudden start on the part of charlie cause it to part before he could escape crusoe again seize the end of it and lead he slowly but steadily back to the indian camp never halt or turn aside until he have place the line in dick varley 's hand hallo pup where have ye bin how do ye bring he here exclaim dick as he gaze in amazement at he foam-covered horse crusoe wag he tail as if to say be thankful that you have get he dick my boy and do not ask question that you know i can not answer he must ha ' break loose and jine the stampede remark joe come out of the chief 's tent at the moment but tie he up dick and come in for we want to settle about startin ' to-morrow or nixt day have fasten charlie to a stake and order crusoe to watch he dick re-enter the tent where the council have reassemble and where pee-eye-em -- have in the recent struggle split the blue surtout completely up to the collar so that he backbone be visible throughout the greater part of its length -- be hold forth in eloquent strain on the subject of peace in general and peace with the blackfeet the ancient enemy of the shirry-dika in particular chapter xxiv _ plan and prospects -- dick become home-sick and henrus metaphysical -- indian attack the camp -- a blow-up _ on the follow day the indian give themselves up to unlimited feast in consequence of the arrival of a large body of hunter with a immense supply of buffalo meat it be a regular day of rejoice upward of six hundred buffalo have be kill and as the supply of meat before they arrival have be ample the camp be now overflow with plenty feast be give by the chief and the medicine man go about the camp utter loud cry which be mean to express gratitude to the great spirit for the bountiful supply of food they also carry a portion of meat to the aged and infirm who be unable to hunt for themselves and have no young man in they family circle to hunt for they this arrival of the hunter be a fortunate circumstance as it put the indian in great good-humour and incline they to hold friendly intercourse with the trapper who for some time continue to drive a brisk trade in fur have no market for the disposal of they fur the indian of course have more than they know what to do with and be therefore glad to exchange those of the most beautiful and valuable kind for a mere trifle so that the trapper lay aside they trap for a time and devoted themselves to traffic meanwhile joe blunt and he friend make preparation for they return journey ye see remark joe to henrus and dick as they sit beside the fire in pee-eye-em 's lodge and feast on a potful of grasshopper soup which the great chief 's squaw have just place before they -- ye see my calc ` lation be as follow wot with trappin ' beaver and huntin ' we three ha ' make enough to set we up a it like we in the mustang valley -- ha interrupted dick remit for a few seconds the use of he tooth in order to exercise he tongue -- ha joe but it do not like _ I _ what give up a hunter 's life and become a farmer i should think not bon ejaculated henrus but whether the remark have reference to the grasshopper soup or the sentiment we can not tell well continue joe commence to devour a large buffalo steak with a hunter 's appetite ye 'll please yourselve lad as to that but as i wos sayin ' we have get a powerful lot o ' fur a ' a big pack o ' odds and end for the injun we chance to meet with by the way a ' powder and lead to last we a twelvemonth besides five good horse to carry we a ' we pack over the plain so if it be agreeable to you i mean to make a bee-line for the mustang valley we be pretty sure to meet with blackfeet on the way and if we do we 'll try to make peace between they a ' the snake i ` xpect it 'll be pretty well on for six week afore we git to home so we 'll start to-morrow dat be fat vill do ver ' vell say henrus vill you please donnez I one petit morsel of steak i be ready for anything joe cry dick you be leader just point the way and i 'll answer for two o ' we followin ' ye -- eh will not we crusoe we will remark the dog quietly how come it inquire dick that these indian do not care for we tobacco they like they own better i s ` pose answer joe most all the western injun do they make it o ' the dry leave o ' the shumack and the inner bark o ' the red-willow chop very small a ' mix together they call this stuff _ kinnekinnik _ but they like to mix about a fourth o ' we tobacco with it so pee-eye-em tell I a ' he be a good judge the amount that red-skin mortal smoke _ be _ oncommon what be they doin ' yonder inquire dick point to a group of man who have be feast for some time past in front of a tent within sight of we trio goin ' to sing i think reply joe as he speak six young warrior be see to work they body about in a very remarkable way and give utterance to still more remarkable sound which gradually increase until the singer burst out into that terrific yell or war-whoop for which american savage have long be famous its effect would have be appalling to unaccustomed ear then they allow they voice to die away in soft plaintive tone while they action correspond thereto suddenly the furious style be revive and the man work themselves into a condition little short of madness while they yell ring wildly through the camp this be too much for ordinary canine nature to withstand so all the dog in the neighborhood join in the horrible chorus crusoe have long since learn to treat the eccentricity of indian and they cur with dignified contempt he pay no attention to this serenade but lay sleep by the fire until dick and he companion rise to take leave of they host and return to the camp of the fur-trader the remainder of that night be spend in make preparation for set forth on the morrow and when at gray dawn dick and crusoe lay down to snatch a few hour ' repose the yell and howl in the snake camp be go on as vigorously as ever the sun have arise and he beam be just tip the summit of the rocky mountain cause the snowy peak to glitter like flame and the deep ravine and gorge to look sombre and mysterious by contrast when dick and joe and henrus mount they gallant steed and with crusoe gambolling before and the two pack-horse trot by they side turn they face eastward and bid adieu to the indian camp crusoe be in great spirit he be perfectly well aware that he and he companion be on they way home and testify he satisfaction by burst of scamper over the hill and valley doubtless he think of dick varley 's cottage and of dick 's mild kind-hearted mother undoubtedly too he think of he own mother fan and feel a glow of filial affection as he do so of this we feel quite certain he would have be unworthy the title of hero if he have not perchance he think of grump but of this we be not quite so sure we rather think upon the whole that he do dick too let he thought run away in the direction of _ home _ sweet word those who have never leave it can not by any effort of imagination realize the full import of the word home dick be a bold hunter but he be young and this be he first long expedition oftentimes when sleep under the tree and gaze dreamily up through the branch at the star have he think of home until he longing heart begin to yearn to return he repel such tender feeling however when they become too strong deem they unmanly and seek to turn he mind to the excitement of the chase but latterly he effort be in vain he become thoroughly home-sick and while admit the fact to himself he endeavor to conceal it from he comrade he think that he be successful in this attempt poor dick varley as yet he be sadly ignorant of human nature henrus know it and joe blunt know it even crusoe know that something be wrong with he master although he could not exactly make out what it be but crusoe make memorandum in the note-book of he memory he jot down the peculiar phase of he master 's new disease with the care and minute exactness of a physician and we doubt not ultimately add the knowledge of the symptom of home-sickness to he already well-filled store of erudition it be not till they have set out on they homeward journey that dick varley 's spirit revive and it be not till they reach the beautiful prairie on the eastern slope of the rocky mountain and gallop over the greensward towards the mustang valley that dick venture to tell joe blunt what he feeling have be d'ye know joe he say confidentially rein up he gallant steed after a sharp gallop -- d'ye know i have bin feelin ' awful low for some time past i know it lad answer joe with a quiet smile in which there be a dash of something that imply he know more than he choose to express dick feel surprised but he continue i wonder what it could have bin i never feel so before 'twa home-sickness boy return joe how d'ye know that the same way as how i know most thing -- by experience a ' obsarvation i have bin home-sick myself once but it be long long agone dick feel much relieve at this candid confession by such a bronzed veteran and the chord of sympathy have be strike he open up he heart at once to the evident delight of henrus who among other curious partiality be extremely fond of listen to and take part in conversation that border on the metaphysical and be hard to be understand most conversation that be not connect with eating and hunting be of this nature to henri hom ' - sik he cry veech mean bein ' sik of hom ' hah dat be fat i be always be ven i go hout on de expedition ouus vraiment i always pack up continue joe pay no attention to henrus 's remark -- i always pack up a ' set off for home when i gits home-sick it be the best cure a ' when hunter be young like you dick it be the only cure i have know feller a ` most die o ' home-sickness a ' i be tell they _ do _ go under altogether sometimes go onder exclaimed henrus ouus i vas all but die myself ven i fust try to git away from hom ' if i have not git away i not be here to-day henrus 's idea of home-sickness be so totally oppose to theirs that he comrade only laugh and refrain from attempt to set he right the fust time i wos take bad with it wo in a country somethin' like that say joe point to the wide stretch of undulating prairie dot with cluster of tree and meander streamlet that lay before they i have bin out about two month a ' be makin ' a good thing of it for game wo plenty when i begin to think somehow more than usual o ' home my mother wo alive then joe 's voice sink to a deep solemn tone as he say this and for a few minute he ride on in silence well it grow worse and worse i dream o ' home all night a ' thought of it all day till i begin to shoot bad a ' my comrade wo gittin ' tired o ' I so say i to they one night say i ' i give out lad i 'll make track for the settlement to-morrow ' they try to laugh I out of it at first but it be no go so i pack up bid they good-day a ' sot off alone on a trip o ' five hundred mile the very first mile o ' the way back i begin to mend and before two day i wos all right again joe be interrupt at this point by the sudden appearance of a solitary horseman on the brow of a eminence not half-a-mile distant the three friend instantly drive they pack-horse behind a clump of tree but not in time to escape the vigilant eye of the red-man who utter a loud shout which bring up a band of he comrade at full gallop remember henrus cry joe blunt we errand be one of _ peace _ the caution be need for in the confusion of the moment henrus be make preparation to sell he life as dearly as possible before another word could be utter they be surround by a troop of about twenty yell blackfeet indian they be fortunately not a war party and still more fortunately they be peaceably disposed and listen to the preliminary address of joe blunt with exemplary patience after which the two party encamp on the spot the council fire be light and every preparation make for a long palaver we will not trouble the reader with the detail of what be say on this occasion the party of indian be a small one and no chief of any importance be attach to it suffice it to say that the pacific overture make by joe be well receive the trifling gift make thereafter be still better receive and they separate with mutual expression of good-will several other band which be afterwards meet with be equally friendly and only one war party be see joe 's quick eye observe it in time to enable they to retire unseen behind the shelter of some tree where they remain until the indian warrior be out of sight the next party they meet with however be more difficult to manage and unfortunately blood be shed on both side before we traveller escape it be at the close of a beautiful day that a war party of blackfeet be see ride along a ridge on the horizon it chance that the prairie at this place be almost destitute of tree or shrub large enough to conceal the horse by dash down the grassy wave into the hollow between the two undulation and dismount joe hope to elude the savage so he give the word but at the same moment a shout from the indian tell that they be discover look sharp lad throw down the pack on the highest point of the ridge cry joe undoing the lashing seize one of the bale of goods and hurry to the top of the undulation with it we must keep they at arm 's - length boy -- be alive war party be not to be trust dick and henrus second joe 's effort so ably that in the course of two minute the horse be unloaded the pack pile in the form of a wall in front of a broken piece of ground the horse picket close beside they and we three traveller peep over the edge with they rifle cock while the savage -- about thirty in number -- come sweep down towards they i 'll try to git they to palaver say joe blunt but keep yer eye on 'em dick a ' if they behave ill shoot the _ horse _ o ' the leadin ' chief i 'll throw up my left hand as a signal mind lad do not hit human flesh till my second signal be give and see that henrus do not draw till i git back to ye so say joe spring lightly over the slight parapet of they little fortress and run swiftly out unarmed towards the indian in a few seconds he be close up with they and in another moment be surround at first the savage brandish they spear and ride round the solitary man yell like fiend as if they wish to intimidate he but as joe stand like a statue with he arm cross and a grave expression of contempt on he countenance they quickly desist and draw near ask he where he come from and what he be do there joe 's story be soon tell but instead of reply they begin to shout vociferously and evidently mean mischief if the blackfeet be afraid to speak to the pale-face he will go back to he brave say joe pass suddenly between two of the warrior and take a few step towards the camp instantly every bow be bent and it seem as if we bold hunter be about to be pierce by a score of arrow when he turn round and cry -- the blackfeet must not advance a single step the first that move he _ horse _ shall die the second that move _ himself _ shall die to this the blackfeet chief reply scornfully the pale-face talk with a big mouth we do not believe he word the snake be liar we will make no peace with they while he be yet speak joe throw up he hand there be a loud report and the noble horse of the savage chief lay struggle in death agony on the ground the use of the rifle as we have before hint be little know at this period among the indian of the far west and many have never hear the dreaded report before although all be aware from hearsay of its fatal power the fall of the chief 's horse therefore quite paralyzed they for a few moment and they have not recover from they surprise when a second report be hear a bullet whistle past and a second horse fall at the same moment there be a loud explosion in the camp of the pale-face a white cloud envelop it and from the midst of this a loud shriek be hear as dick henrus and crusoe bound over the pack with frantic gesture at this the gaping savage wheel they steed round the dismounted horseman spring on behind two of they comrade and the whole band dash away over the plain as if they be chase by evil spirit meanwhile joe hasten towards he comrade in a state of great anxiety for he know at once that one of the powder-horn must have be accidentally blow up no damage do boy i hope he cry on come up damage cry henrus hold he hand tight over he face oh oui great damage -- moche damage I two eye be blow out of dere hole not quite so bad as that i hope say dick who be very slightly singed and forget he own hurt in anxiety about he comrade let I see my eye exclaim joe blunt while a broad grin overspread he countenance ye have not improve yer look henri this be true the worthy hunter 's hair be singe to such a extent that he entire countenance present the appearance of a universal frizzle fortunately the skin although much blacken be quite uninjured -- a fact which when he ascertain it beyond a doubt afford so much satisfaction to henri that he caper about shout with delight as if some piece of good fortune have befall he the accident have happen in consequence of henrus have omit to replace the stopper of he powder-horn and when in he anxiety for joe he fire at random amongst the indian despite dick 's entreaty to wait a spark communicate with the powder-horn and blow he up dick and crusoe be only a little singed but the former be not dispose to quarrel with a accident which have send they enemy so promptly to the right-about this band follow they for some night in the hope of be able to steal they horse while they sleep but they be not brave enough to venture a second time within range of the death-dealing rifle chapter xxv _ danger of the prairie _ -- _ we traveller attack by indian and deliver in a remarkable manner _ there be period in the life of almost all man a when misfortune seem to crowd upon they in rapid succession when they escape from one danger only to encounter another and when to use a well-known expression they succeed in leap out of the frying-pan at the expense of plunge into the fire so be it with we three friend upon this occasion they be scarcely rid of the blackfeet who find they too watchful to be catch nap when about daybreak one morning they encounter a roving band of camanchee indian who wear such a warlike aspect that joe deem it prudent to avoid they if possible they do not see we yit i guess say joe as he and he companion drive the horse into a hollow between the grassy wave of the prairie a ' if we only can escape they sharp eye till we be in yonder clump o ' willow we be safe enough but why do not you ride up to they joe inquire dick and make peace between they and the pale-face as you ha ' do with other band because it be o ' no use to risk we scalp for the chance o ' makin ' peace wus ' a rovin ' war party keep yer head down henrus if they git only a sight o ' the top o ' yer cap they 'll be down on we like a breeze o ' wind ha let dem come say henrus they 'll come without askin ' yer leave remark joe dryly notwithstanding he defiant expression henrus have sufficient prudence to induce he to bend he head and shoulder and in a few minute they reach the shelter of the willow unseen by the savage at least so think henrus joe be not quite sure about it and dick hope for the best in the course of half-an-hour the last of the camanchee be see to hover for a second on the horizon like a speck of black against the sky and then to disappear immediately the three hunter vault on they steed and resume they journey but before that evening close they have sad evidence of the savage nature of the band from which they have escape on pass the brow of a slight eminence dick who ride first observe that crusoe stop and snuff the breeze in a anxious inquire manner what be ' t pup say dick draw up for he know that he faithful dog never give a false alarm crusoe reply by a short uncertain bark and then bound forward disappear behind a little wooded knoll in another moment a long dismal howl float over the plain there be a mystery about the dog 's conduct which couple with he melancholy cry strike the traveller with a superstitious feeling of dread as they sit look at each other in surprise come let 's clear it up cry joe blunt shake the rein of he steed and gallop forward a few stride bring they to the other side of the knoll where scatter upon the tear and bloody turf they discover the scalped and mangled remains of about twenty or thirty human being they skull have be cleft by the tomahawk and they breast pierce by the scalping-knife and from the position in which many of they lay it be evident that they have be slay while asleep joe 's brow flush and he lip become tightly compress as he mutter between he set tooth they skin be white a short examination suffice to show that the man who have thus be barbarously murder while they sleep have be a band of trapper or hunter but what they errand have be or whence they come they could not discover everything of value have be carry off and all the scalp have be take most of the body although much mutilate lay in a posture that lead we hunter to believe they have be kill while asleep but one or two be cut almost to piece and from the blood-bespattered and trampled sward around it seem as if they have struggle long and fiercely for life whether or not any of the savage have be slay it be impossible to tell for if such have be the case they comrade doubtless have carry away they body that they have be slaughter by the party of camanchee who have be see at daybreak be quite clear to joe but he burning desire to revenge the death of the white man have to be stifle as he party be so small long afterwards it be discover that this be a band of trapper who like those mention at the beginning of this volume have set out to avenge the death of a comrade but god who have retain the right of vengeance in he own hand see fit to frustrate they purpose by give they into the hand of the savage whom they have set forth to slay as it be impossible to bury so many body the traveller resume they journey and leave they to bleach there in the wilderness but they ride the whole of that day almost without utter a word meanwhile the camanchee who have observe the trio and have ride away at first for the purpose of deceive they into the belief that they have pass unobserved double on they track and take a long sweep in order to keep out of sight until they could approach under the shelter of a belt of woodland towards which the traveller now approach the indian adopt this course instead of the easier method of simply pursue so weak a party because the plain at this part be border by a long stretch of forest into which the hunter could have plunge and render pursuit more difficult if not almost useless the detour thus take be so extensive that the shades of evening be begin to descend before they could put they plan into execution the forest lay about a mile to the right of we hunter like some dark mainland of which the prairie be the sea and the scatter clump of wood the island there be no lack o ' game here say dick varley point to a herd of buffalo which rise at they approach and flee away towards the wood i think we 'll ha ' thunder soon remark joe i never feel it onnatteral hot like this without lookin ' out for a plump ha den ve better look hout for one goot tree to get b ` low suggest henrus voil he add point with he finger towards the plain dere be a lot of wild hoss a troop of about thirty wild horse appear as he speak on the brow of a ridge and advance slowly towards they hist exclaimed joe rein up hold on lad wild horse my rifle to a pop-gun there be wilder man on t ` other side o ' they what mean you joe inquire dick ride close up d'ye see the little lump on the shoulder o ' each horse say joe they be injun 's _ foot _ a ' if we do not want to lose we scalp we would better make for the forest joe prove himself to be in earnest by wheeling round and make straight for the thick wood as fast as he horse could run the other follow drive the pack-horse before they the effect of this sudden movement on the so-called wild horse be very remarkable and to one unacquainted with the habit of the camanchee indian must have appear almost supernatural in the twinkling of a eye every steed have a rider on its back and before the hunter have take five stride in the direction of the forest the whole band be in hot pursuit yell like fury the manner in which these indian accomplish this feat be very singular and imply great activity and strength of muscle on the part of the savage the camanchee be low in stature and usually be rather corpulent in they movement on foot they be heavy and ungraceful and they be on the whole a slovenly and unattractive race of man but the instant they mount they horse they seem to be entirely change and surprise the spectator with the ease and elegance of they movement they great and distinctive peculiarity as horseman be the power they have acquire of throw themselves suddenly on either side of they horse 's body and cling on in such a way that no part of they be visible from the other side save the foot by which they cling in this manner they approach they enemy at full gallop and without rise again to the saddle discharge they arrow at they over the horse ' back or even under they neck this apparently magical feat be accomplish by means of a halter of horse-hair which be pass round under the neck of the horse and both end braid into the mane on the withers thus form a loop which hang under the neck and against the breast this be catch by the hand make a sling into which the elbow fall take the weight of the body on the middle of the upper arm into this loop the rider drop suddenly and fearlessly leave he heel to hang over the horse 's back to steady he and also to restore he to he seat when desire by this stratagem the indian have approach on the present occasion almost within rifle range before they be discover and it require the utmost speed of the hunter ' horse to enable they to avoid be overtake one of the indian who be better mount than he fellow gain on the fugitive so much that he come within arrow range but reserve he shaft until they be close on the margin of the wood when be almost alongside of henrus he fit a arrow to he bow henrus 's eye be upon he however let go the line of the pack-horse which he be lead he throw forward he rifle but at the same moment the savage disappear behind he horse and a arrow whiz past the hunter 's ear henrus fire at the horse which drop instantly hurl the astonished camanchee upon the ground where he lay for some time insensible in a few seconds pursue and pursuer enter the wood where both have to advance with caution in order to avoid be sweep off by the overhang branch of the tree meanwhile the sultry heat of which joe have formerly speak increase considerably and a rumble noise as if of distant thunder be hear but the fly hunter pay no attention to it for the lead horse give they so much trouble and retard they flight so much that the indian be gradually and visibly gain on they we 'll ha ' to let the pack go say joe somewhat bitterly as he look over he shoulder we scalp 'll pay for ' t if we do not henri utter a peculiar and significant _ hiss _ between he tooth as he say p ` r ` aps ve better stop and fight dick say nothing be resolve to do exactly what joe blunt bid he and crusoe for reason best know to himself also say nothing but bound along beside he master 's horse cast a occasional glance upward to catch any signal that might be give they have pass over a considerable space of ground and be force they way at the imminent hazard of they neck through a densely-clothed part of the wood when the sound above refer to increase attract the attention of both party in a few seconds the air be fill with a steady and continuous rumble sound like the noise of a distant cataract pursuer and fugitive draw rein instinctively and come to a dead stand while the rumble increase to a roar and evidently approach they rapidly though as yet nothing to cause it could be see except that there be a dense dark cloud overspread the sky to the southward the air be oppressively still and hot what can it be inquire dick look at joe who be gaze with a expression of wonder not unmixed with concern at the southern sky dun ` no ' boy i have bin more in the wood than in the clearin ' in my day but i niver heerd the likes o ' that it be like t ` ondre say henrus mais it nevair do stop this be true the sound be similar to continuous uninterrupted thunder on it come with a magnificent roar that shake the very earth and reveal itself at last in the shape of a mighty whirlwind in a moment the distant wood bent before it and fall like grass before the scythe it be a whirling hurricane accompany by a deluge of rain such as none of the party have ever before witness steadily fiercely irresistibly it bear down upon they while the crash of fall snap and uproot tree mingle with the dire artillery of that sweeping storm like the musketry on a battle-field follow I lad shout joe turn he horse and dashing at full speed towards a rocky eminence that offer shelter but shelter be not need the storm be clearly define its limit be as distinctly mark by its creator as if it have be a living intelligence send forth to put a belt of desolation round the world and although the edge of devastation be not five hundred yard from the rock behind which the hunter be station only a few drop of ice-cold rain fall upon they it pass directly between the camanchee indian and they intend victim place between they a barrier which it would have take day to cut through the storm blow for a hour then it travel onward in its might and be lose in the distance whence it come and whither it go none could tell but far as the eye could see on either hand a avenue a quarter of a mile wide be cut through the forest it have level everything with the dust the very grass be beat flat the tree be tear shiver snapped across and crushed and the earth itself in many place be plough up and furrow with deep scar the chaos be indescribable and it be probable that century will not quite obliterate the work of that single hour while it last joe and he comrade remain speechless and awe-stricken when it pass no indian be to be see so we hunter remount they steed and with feeling of gratitude to god for have deliver they alike from savage foe and from the destructive power of the whirlwind resume they journey towards the mustang valley chapter xxvi _ anxious fear follow by a joyful surprise -- safe home at last and happy heart _ one fine afternoon a few week after the storm of which we have give a account in the last chapter old mr varley be seat beside she own chimney corner in the little cottage by the lake gaze at the glowing log with the earnest expression of one whose thought be far away she kind face be paler than usual and she hand rest idly on she knee grasp the knitting-wire to which be attach a half-finished stock on a stool near to she sit young marston the lad to whom on the day of the

she face assume a expression of anxious pain as she think of she son dick be expose to a similar fate mr varley be not give to nervous fear but as she listen to the boy 's recital of the slaughter of a party of white man news of which have just reach the valley she heart sink and she pray inwardly to he who be the husband of the widow that she dear one might be protect from the ruthless hand of the savage after a short pause during which young marston fidget about and look concern as if he have something to say which he would fain leave unsaid mr varley continue -- be it far off where the

solitude meanwhile a animated scene be go on near the block-house here thirty of the young hunter of the mustang valley be assemble actively engage in supply themselves with powder and lead and tighten they girth preparatory to set out in pursuit of the indian who have murder the white man while hundred of boy and girl and not a few matron crowd round and listen to the conversation and to the deep threat of vengeance that be utter ever and anon by the younger man major hope too be among they the worthy major unable to restrain he rove propensity determine to revisit the mustang valley and have arrive only two day before backwoodsman 's preparation be usually of the shortest and simplest in a few minute the cavalcade be ready and away they go towards the prairie with the bold major at they head but they journey be destine to come to a abrupt and unexpected close a couple of hour ' gallop bring they to the edge of one of those open plain which sometimes break up the woodland near the verge of the great prairie it stretch out like a green lake towards the horizon on which just as the band of horseman reach it the sun be descend in a blaze of glory with a shout of enthusiasm several of the younger member of the party spring forward into the plain at a gallop but the shout be mingle with one of a different tone from the older man hist -- hallo -- hold on ye catamount there be injun ahead the whole band come to a sudden halt at this cry and watch eagerly and for some time in silence the motion of a small party of horseman who be see in the far distance like black speck on the golden sky they come this way i think say major hope after gaze steadfastly at they for some minute several of the old hand signify they assent to this suggestion by a grunt although to unaccustomed eye the object in question look more like crow than horseman and they motion be for some time scarcely perceptible i see pack-horse among they cry young marston in a excited tone a ' there be three rider but there be som ` thin ' else only wot it be i can not tell ye have sharp eye younker remark one of the man a ' i do b ` lieve ye be right presently the horseman approach and soon there be a brisk fire of guess as to who they could be it be evident that the stranger observe the cavalcade of white man and regard they as friend for they do not check the headlong speed at which they approach in a few minute they be clearly make out to be a party of three horseman drive pack-horse before they and _ somethin _ ' which some of the hunter guess be a buffalo calf young marston guess too but he guess be different moreover it be utter with a yell that would have do credit to the fiercest of all the savage crusoe he shout while at the same moment he bring he whip heavily down on the flank of he little horse and spring over the prairie like a arrow one of the approach horseman be far ahead of he comrade and seem as if encircle with the fly and voluminous mane of he magnificent horse ha ho gasp marston in a low tone to himself as he fly along crusoe i would know ye dog among a thousand a buffalo calf ha git on with ye this last part of the remark be address to he horse and be follow by a whack that increase the pace considerably the space between two such rider be soon devour hallo dick -- dick varley eh why marston my boy the friend rein up so suddenly that one might have fancy they have meet like the knight of old in the shock of mortal conflict be ' t yerself dick varley dick hold out he hand and he eye glisten but he could not find word marston

hissing noise the inhabitant of the block-house be self-taught brewer and the result of they recent labor now stand display in a row of goodly cask of beer -- the only beverage with which the dweller in these far-off region be wont to regale themselves the whole scene as the cook move actively about upon the lawn and child romp round the fire and settler come flock through the forest might have recall the revelry of merry england in the olden time though the costume of the far west be perhaps somewhat different from those of old england no one of all the band assemble there on that day of

fan do you think reader that grump look at any one but crusoe if you do you be mistaken grump on that day become a regular a incorrigible utter and perfect nuisance to everybody -- not except himself poor beast grump be a dog of one idea and that idea be crusoe out of that great idea there grow one little secondary idea and that idea be that the only joy on earth worth mention be to sit on he haunch exactly six inch from crusoe 's nose and gaze steadfastly into he face wherever crusoe go grump go if crusoe stop grump be down before he in a instant if crusoe bound away which in the exuberance of he spirit he often do grump be after he like a bundle of mad hair he be in everybody 's way in crusoe 's way and be so to speak beside himself be also in he own way if people tread upon he accidentally which they often do grump utter a solitary heart-rending yell proportion in intensity to the excruciating nature of the torture he endure then instantly resume he position and he fascinate stare crusoe generally hold he head up and gaze over he little friend at what be go on around he but if for a moment he permit he eye to rest on the countenance of grump that creature 's tail become suddenly imbue with a amount of wriggle vitality that seem to threaten its separation from the body it be really quite interesting to watch this unblushing and disinterested and utterly reckless display of affection on the part of grump and the amiable way in which crusoe put up with it we say put up with it advisedly because it must have be a very great inconvenience to he see that if he attempt to move he satellite move in front of he so that he only way of escape temporarily be by jump over grump 's head grump be everywhere all day nobody almost escape trample on part of he he

beer-cask and some dance by the light of the monster fire while other listen to joe blunt as he recount they adventure on the prairie and among the rocky mountain there be sweetheart and wife and
