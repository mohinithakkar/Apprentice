beautiful joe chapter i only a cur my name be beautiful joe and i be a brown dog of medium size i be not call beautiful joe because i be a beauty mr morri the clergyman in whose family i have live for the last twelve year say that he think i must be call beautiful joe for the same reason that he grandfather down south call a very ugly color slave-lad cupid and he mother venus i do not know what he mean by that but when he say it people always look at I and smile i know that i be not beautiful and i know that i be not a thoroughbred i be only a cur when my mistress go every year to register I and pay my tax and the man in the office ask what breed i be she say part fox-terrier and part bull-terrier but he always put I down a cur i do not think she like have he call I a cur still i have hear she say that she prefer cur for they have more character than well-bred dog she father say that she like ugly dog for the same reason that a nobleman at the court of a certain king do -- namely that no one else would i be a old dog now and be write or rather get a friend to write the story of my life i have see my mistress laughing and cry over a little book that she say be a story of a horse 's life and sometimes she put the book down close to my nose to let I see the picture i love my dear mistress i can say no more than that i love she better than any one else in the world and i think it will please she if i write the story of a dog 's life she love dumb animal and it always grieve she to see they treat cruelly i have hear she say that if all the boy and girl in the world be to rise up and say that there should be no more cruelty to animal they could put a stop to it perhaps it will help a little if i tell a story i be fond of boy and girl and though i have see many cruel man and woman i have see few cruel child i think the more story there be write about dumb animal the better it will be for we in tell my story i think i have better begin at the first and come right on to the end i be bear in a stable on the outskirts of a small town in maine call fairport the first thing i remember be lie close to my mother and be very snug and warm the next thing i remember be be always hungry i have a number of brother and sister -- six in all -- and my mother never have enough milk for we she be always half starve herself so she could not feed we properly i be very unwilling to say much about my early life i have live so long in a family where there be never a harsh word speak and where no one think of ill-treating anybody or anything that it seem almost wrong even to think or speak of such a matter as hurt a poor dumb beast the man that own my mother be a milkman he keep one horse and three cow and he have a shaky old cart that he use to put he milk can in i do not think there can be a worse man in the world than that milkman it make I shudder now to think of he he name be jenkin and i be glad to think that he be get punish now for he cruelty to poor dumb animal and to human being if you think it be wrong that i be glad you must remember that i be only a dog the first notice that he take of I when i be a little puppy just able to stagger about be to give I a kick that send I into a corner of the stable he use to beat and starve my mother i have see he use he heavy whip to punish she till she body be cover with blood when i get older i ask she why she do not run away she say she do not wish to but i soon find out that the reason she do not run away be because she love jenkin cruel and savage as he be she yet love he and i believe she would have lay down she life for he now that i be old i know that there be more man in the world like jenkin they be not crazy they be not drunkard they simply seem to be possess with a spirit of wickedness there be well-to-do people yes and rich people who will treat animal and even little child with such terrible cruelty that one can not even mention the thing that they be guilty of one reason for jenkin ' cruelty be he idleness after he go he round in the morning with he milk can he have nothing to do till late in the afternoon but take care of he stable and yard if he have keep they neat and groom he horse and clean the cow and dig up the garden it would have take up all he time but he never tidy the place at all till he yard and stable get so litter up with thing he throw down that he could not make he way about he house and stable stand in the middle of a large field and they be at some distance from the road passer-by could not see how untidy the place be occasionally a man come to look at the premise and see that they be in good order but jenkin always know when to expect he and have thing clean up a little i use to wish that some of the people that take milk from he would come and look at he cow in the spring and summer he drive they out to pasture but during the winter they stand all the time in the dirty dark stable where the chink in the wall be so big that the snow sweep through almost in drift the ground be always muddy and wet there be only one small window on the north side where the sun only shine in for a short time in the afternoon they be very unhappy cow but they stand patiently and never complain though sometimes i know they must have nearly freeze in the bitter wind that blow through the stable on winter night they be lean and poor and be never in good health besides be cold they be feed on very poor food jenkin use to come home nearly every afternoon with a great tub in the back of he cart that be full of what he call peeling it be kitchen stuff that he ask the cook at the different house where he deliver milk to save for he they throw rotten vegetable fruit paring and scrap from the table into a tub and give they to he at the end of a few day a sour nasty mess it always be and not fit to give any creature sometimes when he have not many peeling he would go to town and get a load of decayed vegetable that grocer be glad to have he take off they hand this food together with poor hay make the cow give very poor milk and jenkin use to put some white powder in it to give it body as he say once a very sad thing happen about the milk that no one know about but jenkin and he wife she be a poor unhappy creature very frighten at she husband and not daring to speak much to he she be not a clean woman and i never see a worse-looking house than she keep she use to do very queer thing that i know now no housekeeper should do i have see she catch up the broom to pound potato in the pot she pound with the handle and the broom would fly up and down in the air drop dust into the pot where the potato be she pan of soft-mixed bread she often leave uncover in the kitchen and sometimes the hen walk in and sit in it the child use to play in mud puddle about the door it be the youngest of they that sicken with some kind of fever early in the spring before jenkin begin drive the cow out to pasture the child be very ill and mr jenkin want to send for a doctor but she husband would not let she they make a bed in the kitchen close to the stove and mr jenkin nurse the child as best she could she do all she work near by and i see she several time wipe the child 's face with the cloth that she use for wash she milk pan nobody know outside the family that the little girl be ill jenkin have such a bad name that none of the neighbor would visit they by-and-by the child get well and a week or two later jenkin come home with quite a frightened face and tell he wife that the husband of one of he customer be very ill with typhoid fever after a time the gentleman die and the cook tell jenkin that the doctor wonder how he could have take the fever for there be not a case in town there be a widow leave with three orphan and they never know that they have to blame a dirty careless milkman for take a kind husband and father from they \* \* \* \* \* chapter ii the cruel milkman i have say that jenkin spend most of he day in idleness he have to start out very early in the morning in order to supply he customer with milk for breakfast oh how ugly he use to be when he come into the stable on cold winter morning before the sun be up he would hang he lantern on a hook and get he milk stool and if the cow do not step aside just to suit he he would seize a broom or fork and beat they cruelly my mother and i sleep on a heap of straw in the corner of the stable and when she hear he step in the morning she always rouse I so that we could run out-door as soon as he open the stable door he always aim a kick at we as we pass but my mother teach I how to dodge he after he finish milk he take the pail of milk up to the house for mr jenkin to strain and put in the can and he come back and harness he horse to the cart he horse be call toby and a poor miserable broken-down creature he be he be weak in the knee and weak in the back and weak all over and jenkin have to beat he all the time to make he go he have be a cab horse and he mouth have be jerk and twist and saw at till one would think there could be no feeling leave in it still i have see he wince and curl up he lip when jenkin thrust in the frosty bit on a winter 's morning poor old toby i use to lie on my straw sometimes and wonder he do not cry out with pain cold and half starve he always be in the winter time and often with raw sore on he body that jenkin would try to hide by put bit of cloth under the harness but toby never murmur and he never try to kick and bite and he mind the least word from jenkin and if he swear at he toby would start back or step up quickly he be so anxious to please he after jenkin put he in the cart and take in the can he set out on he round my mother whose name be jess always go with he i use to ask she why she follow such a brute of a man and she would hang she head and say that sometimes she get a bone from the different house they stop at but that be not the whole reason she like jenkin so much that she want to be with he i have not she sweet and patient disposition and i would not go with she i watch she out of sight and then run up to the house to see if mr jenkin have any scrap for I i nearly always get something for she pity I and often give I a kind word or look with the bit of food that she throw to I when jenkin come home i often coax mother to run about and see some of the neighbor ' dog with I but she never would and i would not leave she so from morning to night we have to sneak about keep out of jenkin ' way as much as we could and yet try to keep he in sight he always saunter about with a pipe in he mouth and he hand in he pocket growl first at he wife and child and then at he dumb creature i have not tell what become of my brother and sister one rainy day when we be eight week old jenkin follow by two or three of he ragged dirty child come into the stable and look at we then he begin to swear because we be so ugly and say if we have be good-looking he might have sell some of we mother watch he anxiously and fear some danger to she puppy run and jump in the middle of we and look pleadingly up at he it only make he swear the more he take one pup after another and right there before he child and my poor distract mother put a end to they life some of they he seize by the leg and knock against the stall till they brain be dash out other he kill

the only one leave he child cry and he send they out of the stable and go out himself mother pick up all the puppy and bring they to we nest in the straw and lick they and try to bring they back to life but it be of no use they be quite dead we have they in we corner of the stable for some day till jenkin discover they and swearing horribly at we he take he stable fork and throw they out in the yard and put some earth over they my mother never seem the same after this she be weak and miserable and though she be only four year old she seem like a old dog this be on account of the poor food

my new home and a selfish lady i do not believe that a dog could have fall into a happier home than i do in a week thanks to good nursing good food and kind word i be almost well mr harry wash and

mr morri be the one who say what be to be do and what be not to be do even then when i be a young dog i use to think that she be very wise there be never any noise or confusion in the house and though there be a great deal of work to be do everything go on smoothly and pleasantly and no one ever get angry and scold as they do in the jenkin family mr morri be very particular about money matter whenever the boy come to she for money to get such thing as candy and ice cream expensive toy and other thing that boy often crave she ask they why they want they if it be for some selfish reason she say firmly : no my child we be not rich people and we must save we money for you education i can not buy you foolish thing if they ask she for money for book or something to make they pet animal more comfortable or for they outdoor game she give it to they willingly she idea about the bring up of child i can not explain as clearly as she can herself so i will give part of a conversation that she have with a lady who be call on she shortly after i come to washington street i happen to be in the house at the time indeed i use to spend the greater part of my time in the house jack one day look at I and exclaim : why do that dog stalk about first after one and then after another look at we with such solemn eye i wish that i could speak to tell he that i have so long be use to see animal kick about and trodden upon that i could not get use to the change it seem too good to be true i could scarcely believe that dumb animal have rights but while it last and human being be so kind to I i want to be with they all the time miss laura understand she draw my head up to she lap and put she face down to I : you like to be with we do not you joe stay in the house as much as you like jack do not mind though he speak so sharply when you get tire of we go out in the garden and have a romp with jim but i must return to the conversation i refer to it be one fine June day and mr morri be sew in a rocking-chair by the window i be beside she sit on a hassock so that i could look out into the street dog love variety and excitement and like to see what be go on out-door as well as human being a carriage drive up to the door and a finely-dressed lady get out and come up the step mr morris seem glad to see she and call she mrs montague i be please with she for she have some kind of perfume about she that i like to smell so i go and sit on the hearth rug quite near she they have a little talk about thing i do not understand and then the lady 's eye fall on I she look at I through a bit of glass that be hang by a chain from she neck and pull away she beautiful dress lest i should touch it i do not care any longer for the perfume and go away and sit very straight and stiff at mr morris ' foot the lady 's eye still follow I i beg you pardon mr morri she say but that be a very queer-looking dog you have there yes say mr morris quietly he be not a handsome dog and he be a new one be not he say mr montague yes and that make -- two dog a cat fifteen or twenty rabbit a rat about a dozen canary and two dozen goldfish i do not know how many pigeon a few bantam a guinea pig and -- well i do not think there be anything more they both laugh and mr montague say : you have quite a menagerie my father would never allow one of he child to keep a pet animal he say it would make he girl rough and noisy to romp about the house with cat and he boy would look like rowdy if they go about with dog at they heel i have never find that it make my child more rough to play with they pet say mr morri no i should think not say the lady languidly you boy be the most gentlemanly lad in fairport and as for laura she be a perfect little lady i like so much to have they come and see charlie they wake he up and yet do not make he naughty they enjoy they last visit very much say mr morri by the way i have hear they talk about get charlie a dog oh cry the lady with a little shudder beg they not to i can not sanction that i hate dog why do you hate they ask mrs morris gently they be such dirty thing they always smell and have vermin on they a dog say mr morris be something like a child if you want it clean and pleasant you have get to keep it so this dog 's skin be as clean as yours or mine hold still joe and she brush the hair on my back the wrong way and show mr montague how pink and free from dust my skin be mrs montague look at I more kindly and even hold out the tip of she finger to I i do not lick they i only smell they and she draw she hand back again you have never be bring in contact with the lower creation as i have say mr morri just let I tell you in a few word what a help dumb animal have be to I in the up-bringing of my child -- my boy especially when i be a young married woman go about the slum of new york with my husband i use to come home and look at my two baby as they lay in they little cot and say to he ` what be we go to do to keep these child from selfishness -- the curse of the world ' ` get they to do something for somebody outside themselves ' he always say and i have try to act on that principle laura be naturally unselfish with she tiny baby finger she would take food from she own mouth and put it into jack 's if we do not watch she i have never have any trouble with she but the boy be bear selfish tiresomely disgustingly selfish they be good boy in many way as they grow older they be respectful obedient they be not untidy and not particularly rough but they one thought be for themselves -- each one for himself and they use to quarrel with each other in regard to they rights while we be in new york we have only a small back yard when we come here i say ' i be go to try a experiment ' we get this house because it have a large garden and a stable that would do for the boy to play in then i get they together and have a little serious talk i say i be not please with the way in which they be live they do nothing for any one but themselves from morning to night if i ask they to do a errand for I it be do unwillingly of course i know they have they school for a part of the day but they have a good deal of leisure time when they might do something for some one else i ask they if they think they be go to make real manly christian boy at this rate and they say no then i ask they what we should do about it they all say ` you tell we mother and we 'll do as you say ' i propose a series of task each one to do something for somebody outside and apart from himself every day of he life they all agree to this and tell I to allot the task if i could have afford it i would have get a horse and cow and have they take charge of they but i could not do that so i invest in a pair of rabbit for jack a pair of canary for carl pigeon for ned and bantam for willie i bring these creature home put they into they hand and tell they to provide for they they be delighted with my choice and it be very amusing to see they scurry about to provide food and shelter for they pet and hear they consultation with other boy the end of it all be that i be perfectly satisfy with my experiment my boy in care for these dumb creature have become unselfish and thoughtful they have rather go to school without they own breakfast than have the inmate of the stable go hungry they be get a humane education a heart education add to the intellectual education of they school then it keep they at home i use to be worry with the linger about street corner the dawdle around with other boy and the idle often worse than idle talk indulge in now they have something to do they be man of business they be always hammer and pound at box and partition out there in the stable or clean up and if they be send out on a errand they do it and come right home i do not mean to say that we have deprive they of liberty they have they day for base-ball and foot-ball and excursion to the wood but they have so much to do at home that they will not go away unless for a specific purpose while mr morri be talk she visitor lean forward in she chair and listen attentively when she finish mr montague say quietly thank you i be glad that you tell I this i shall get charlie a dog i be glad to hear you say that reply mr morri it will be a good thing for you little boy i should not wish my boy to be without a good faithful dog a child can learn many a lesson from a dog this one point to I might be hold up as a example to many a human be he be patient quiet and obedient my husband say that he remind he of three word in the bible -- ` through much tribulation ' why do he say that ask mrs montague curiously because he come to we from a very unhappy home and mr morris go on to tell she friend what she know of my early day when she stop mr montague 's face be shock and pained how dreadful to think that there be such creature as that man jenkin in the world and you say that he have a wife and child mr morris tell I plainly be there many such unhappy home in fairport mr morris hesitate for a minute then she say earnestly : my dear friend if you could see all the wickedness and cruelty and vileness that be practice in this little town of ours in one night you could not rest in you bed mr montague look dazed i do not dream that it be as bad as that she say be we worse than other town no not worse but bad enough over and over again the say be true one-half the world do not know how the other half live how can all this misery touch you you live in you lovely house out of the town when you come in you drive about do you shopping make call and go home again you never visit the poorer street the people from they never come to you you be rich you people before you be rich you live in a state of isolation but that be not right say the lady in a wail voice i have be think about this matter lately i read a great deal in the papers about the misery of the lower class and i think we richer one ought to do something to help they mrs morri what can i do the tear come in mr morris ' eye she look at the little frail lady and say simply dear mr montague i think the root of the whole matter lie in this the lord make we all one family we be all brother and sister the lowest woman be you sister and my sister the man lie in the gutter be we brother what should we do to help these member of we common family who be not as well off as we be we should share we last crust with they you and i but for god 's grace in place we in different surroundings might be in they place i think it be wicked neglect criminal neglect in we to ignore this fact it be it be say mr montague in a despairing voice i can not help feel it tell I something i can do to help some one mr morris sink back in she chair she face very sad and yet with something like pleasure in she eye as she look at she caller you washerwoman she say have a drunken husband and a cripple boy i have often see she standing over she tub wash you delicate muslin and lace and drop tear into the water i will never send she anything more -- she shall not be trouble say mr montague hastily mr morri could not help smile i have not make myself clear it be not the wash that trouble she it be she husband who beat she and she boy who worry she if you and i take we work from she she will have that much less money to depend upon and will suffer in consequence she be a hard-working and capable woman and make a fair living i would not advise you to give she money for she husband would find it out and take it from she it be sympathy that she want if you could visit she occasionally and show that you be interested in she by talk or read to she poor foolish boy or show he a picture-book you have no idea how grateful she would be to you and how it would cheer she on she dreary way i will go to see she to-morrow say mr montague can you think of any one else i could visit a great many say mr morris but i do not think you have better undertake too much at once i will give you the address of three or four poor family where a occasional visit would do untold good that be it will do they good if you treat they as you do you richer friend do not give they too much money or too many present till you find out what they need try to feel interested in they find out they way of living and what they be go to do with they child and help they to get situation for they if you can and be sure to remember that poverty do not always take away one 's self-respect i will i will say mr montague eagerly when can you give I these address mr morris smile again and take a piece of paper and a pencil from she work basket write a few line and hand they to mr montague the lady get up to take she leave and in regard to the dog say mr morris follow she to the door if you decide to allow charlie to have one you have better let he come in and have a talk with my boy about it they seem to know all the dog that be for sale in the town thank you i shall be most happy to do so he shall have he dog when can you have he to-morrow the next day any day at all it make no difference to I let he spend a afternoon and evening with the boy if you do not object it will give I much pleasure and the little lady bow and smile and after stoop down to pat I trip down the step and get into she carriage and drive away mr morris stand look after she with a beam face and i begin to think that i should like mr montague too if i know she long enough two day later i be quite sure i should for i have a proof that she really like I when she little boy charlie come to the house he bring something for I do up in white paper mr morris open it and there be a handsome nickel-plated collar with my name on it -- beautiful joe ' be not i pleased they take off the little shabby leather strap that the boy have give I when i come and fasten on my new collar and then mr morri hold I up to a glass to look at myself i feel so happy up to this time i have feel a little ashamed of my crop ear and dock tail but now that i have a fine new collar i could hold up my head with any dog dear old joe say mr morris press my head tightly between she hand you do a good thing the other day in help I to start that little woman out of she selfish way of live i do not know about that but i know that i feel very grateful to mr montague for my new collar and ever afterward when i meet she in the street i stop and look at she sometimes she see I and stop she carriage to speak to I but i always wag my tail or rather my body for i have no tail to wag whenever i see she whether she see I or not she son get a beautiful irish setter call brisk he have a silky coat and soft brown eye and he young master seem very fond of he \* \* \* \* \* chapter vi the fox terrier billy when i come to the morrise i know nothing about the proper way of bring up a puppy i once hear of a little boy whose sister beat he so much that he say he be bring up by hand so i think as jenkin kick I so much i may say that i be bring up by foot shortly after my arrival in my new home i have a chance of see how one should bring up a little puppy one day i be sit beside miss laura in the parlor when the door open and jack come in one of he hand be lay over the other and he say to he sister guess what i have get here a bird she say no a rat no a mouse no -- a pup oh jack she say reprovingly for she think he be tell a story he open he hand and there lay the tiniest morsel of a fox terrier puppy that i ever see he be white with black and tan marking he body be pure white he tail black with a dash of tan he ear black and he face evenly mark with black and tan we could not tell the color of he eye as they be not open later on they turn out to be a pretty brown he nose be pale pink and when he get older it become jet black why jack exclaim miss laura he eye be not open why do you take he from he mother she be dead say jack poison -- leave she pup to run about the yard for a little exercise some brute have throw over a piece of poison meat and she eat it four of the pup die this be the only one leave mr robinson say he man do not understand raise pup without they mother and as he be go away he want we to have it for we always have such luck in nursing sick animal mr robinson i know be a friend of the morrise and a gentleman who be fond of fancy stock and import a great deal of it from england if this puppy come from he it be sure to be good one miss laura take the tiny creature and go upstairs very thoughtfully i follow she and watch she get a little basket and line it with cotton wool she put the puppy in it and look at he though it be midsummer and the house seem very warm to I the little creature be shiver and make a low murmuring noise she pull the wool all over he and put the window down and set he basket in the sun then she go to the kitchen and get some warm milk she dip she finger in it and offer it to the puppy but he go nose about it in a stupid way and would not touch it too young miss laura say she get a little piece of muslin put some bread in it tie a string round it and dip it in the milk when she put this to the puppy 's mouth he suck it greedily he act as if he be starve but miss laura only let he have a little every few hour for the rest of the day she give he some more milk and i hear the boy say that for many night she get up once or twice and heat milk over a lamp for he one night the milk get cold before he take it and he swell up and become so ill that miss laura have to rouse she mother and get some hot water to plunge he in that make he well again and no one seem to think it be a great deal of trouble to take for a creature that be nothing but a dog he fully repay they for all he care for he turn out to be one of the prettiest and most lovable dog that i ever see they call he billy and the two event of he early life be the opening of he eye and the swallow of he muslin rag the rag do not seem to hurt he but miss laura say that as he have get so strong and so greedy he must learn to eat like other dog he be very amusing when he be a puppy he be full of trick and he creep about in a mischievous way when one do not know he be near he be a very small puppy and use to climb inside miss laura 's jersey sleeve up to she shoulder when he be six week old one day when the whole family be in the parlor mr morri suddenly fling aside he newspaper and begin jump up and down mr morris be very much alarmed and cry out my dear william what be the matter there be a rat up my leg he say shake it violently just then little billy fall out on the floor and lay on he back look up at mr morri with a surprised face he have feel cold and think it would be warm inside mr morri ' trouser 's leg however billy never do any real mischief thanks to miss laura 's training she begin to punish he just as soon as he begin to tear and worry thing the first thing he attack be mr morri ' feel hat the wind blow it down the hall one day and billy come along and begin to try it with he tooth i dare say it feel good to they for a puppy be very like a baby and love something to bite miss laura find he and he roll he eye at she quite innocently not know that he be do wrong she take the hat away and point from it to he say bad billy then she give he two or three slap with a bootlace she never strike a little dog with she hand or a stick she say club be for big dog and switch for little dog if one have to use they the best way be to scold they for a good dog feel a severe scolding as much as a whipping billy be very much ashamed of himself nothing would induce he even to look at a hat again but he think it be no harm to worry other thing he attack one thing after another the rug on the floor curtain anything fly or flutter and miss laura patiently scold he for each one till at last it dawn upon he that he must not worry anything but a bone then he get to be a very good dog there be one thing that miss laura be very particular about and that be to have he feed regularly we both get three meal a day we be never allow to go into the dining room and while the family be at the table we lay in the hall outside and watch what be go on dog take a great interest in what any one get to eat it be quite exciting to see the morrise pass each other different dish and to smell the nice hot food billy often wish that he could get up on the table he say that he would make thing fly when he be grow he hardly ever get enough to eat i use to tell he that he would kill himself if he could eat all he want to as soon as meal be over billy and i scamper after miss laura to the kitchen we each have we own plate for food mary the cook often laugh at miss laura because she would not let she dog dish together miss laura say that if she do the larger one would get more than he share and the little one would starve it be quite a sight to see billy eat he spread he leg apart to steady himself and gobble at he food like a duck when he finish he always look up for more and miss laura would shake she head and say no billy better longing than loathing i believe that a great many little dog be kill by over feeding i often hear the morrise speak of the foolish way in which some people stuff they pet with food and either kill they by it or keep they in continual ill health a case occur in we neighborhood while billy be a puppy some people call dobson who live only a few door from the morrise have a fine bay mare and a little colt call sam they be very proud of this colt and mr dobson have promise it to he son jame one day mr dobson ask mr morris to come in and see the colt and i go too i watch mr morri while he examine it it be a pretty little creature and i do not wonder that they think so much of it when mr morri go home he wife ask he what he think of it i think he say that it will not live long why papa exclaim jack who overhear the remark it be as fat as a seal it would have a better chance for its life if it be lean and scrawny say mr morri they be over-feed it and i tell mr dobson so but he be not incline to believe I now mr morri have be bring up in the country and know a great deal about animal so i be incline to think he be right and sure enough in a few day we hear that the colt be dead poor jame dobson feel very badly a number of the neighbor ' boy go into see he and there he stand gaze at the dead colt and look as if he want to cry jack be there and i be at he heel and though he say nothing for a time i know he be angry with the dobson for sacrifice the colt 's life presently he say you will not need to have that colt stuff now he be dead dobson what do you mean why do you say that ask the boy peevishly because you stuff he while he be alive say jack saucily then we have to run for all we be worth for the dobson boy be after we and as he be a big fellow he would have whip jack soundly i must not forget to say that billy be wash regularly -- once a week with nice-smelling soap and once a month with strong-smelling disagreeable carbolic soap he have he own towel and wash cloth and after be rub and scrub he be roll in a blanket and put by the fire to dry miss laura say that a little dog that have be pet and keep in the house and have become tender should never be wash and allow to run about with a wet coat unless the weather be very warm for he would be sure to take cold jim and i be more hardy than billy and we take we bath in the sea every few day the boy take we down to the shore and we go in swim with they \* \* \* \* \* chapter vii train a puppy ned dear say miss laura one day i wish you would train billy to follow and retrieve he be four month old now and i shall soon want to take he out in the street very well sister say mischievous ned and catch up a stick he say come out into the garden dog though he be brandish he stick very fiercely i be not at all afraid of he and as for billy he love ned the morris garden be really not a garden but a large piece of ground with the grass worn bare in many place a few tree scatter about and some raspberry and currant bush along the fence a lady who know that mr morri have not a large salary say one day when she be look out of the dining-room window my dear mrs morri why do not you have this garden dig up you could raise you own vegetable it would be so much cheaper than buy they mr morris laugh in great amusement think of the hen and cat and dog and rabbit and above all the boy that i have what sort of a garden would there be and do you think it would be fair to take they playground from they the lady say no she do not think it would be fair i be sure i do not know what the boy would have do without this strip of ground many a frolic and game they have there in the present case ned walk around and around it with he stick on he shoulder billy and i stroll after he presently billy make a dash aside to get a bone ned turn around and say firmly to heel billy look at he innocently not know what he mean to heel exclaim ned again billy think he want to play and put he head on he paw he begin to bark ned laugh still he keep say to heel he would not say another word he know if he say come here or follow or go behind it would confuse billy finally as ned keep say the word over and over and point to I it seem to dawn upon billy that he want he to follow he so he come beside I and together we follow ned around the garden again and again ned often look behind with a pleased face and i feel so proud to think i be do well but suddenly i get dreadfully confuse when he turn around and say hie out the morrise all use the same word in train they dog and i have hear miss laura say this but i have forget what it mean good joe say ned turn around and pat I you have forget i wonder where jim be he would help we he put he finger in he mouth and blow a shrill whistle and soon jim come trot up the lane from the street he look at we with he large intelligent eye and wag he tail slowly as if to say well what do you want of I come and give I a hand at this training business old soberside say ned with a laugh it be too slow to do it alone now young gentleman attention to heel he begin to march around the garden again and jim and i follow closely at he heel while little billy see that he could not get we to play with he come lag behind soon ned turn around and say hie out old jim spring ahead and run off in front as if he be after something now i remember what hie out mean we be to have a lovely race wherever we like little billy loved this we run and scamper hither and thither and ned watch we laugh at we antic after tea he call we out in the garden again and say he have something else to teach we he turn up a tub on the wooden platform at the back door and sit on it and then call jim to he he take a small leather strap from he pocket it have a nice strong smell we all lick it and each dog wish to have it no joe and billy say ned hold we both by we collar you wait a minute here jim jim watch he very earnestly and ned throw the strap half-way across the garden and say fetch it jim never move till he hear the word fetch it then he run swiftly bring the strap and drop it in ned 's hand ned send he after it two or three time then he say to jim lie down and turn to I here joe it be you turn he throw the strap under the raspberry bush then look at I and say fetch it i know quite well what he mean and run joyfully after it i soon find it by the strong smell but the queerest thing happen when i get it in my mouth i begin to gnaw it and play with it and when ned call out fetch it i drop it and run toward he i be not obstinate but i be stupid ned pointed to the place where it be and spread out he empty hand that help I and i run quickly and get it he make I get it for he several time sometimes i could not find it and sometimes i drop it but he never stir he sit still till i bring it to he after a while he try billy but it soon get dark and we could not see so he take billy and go into the house i stay out with jim for a while and he ask I if i know why ned have throw a strap for we instead of a bone or something hard of course i do not know so jim tell I it be on he account he be a bird dog and be never allow to carry anything hard in he mouth because it would make he hard-mouthed and he would be apt to bite the bird when he be bring they back to any person who be shoot with he he say that he have be so carefully train that he could even carry three egg at a time in he mouth i say to he jim how be it that you never go out shooting i have always hear that you be a dog for that and yet you never leave home he hang he head a little and say he do not wish to go and then for he be a honest dog he give I the true reason \* \* \* \* \* chapter viii a ruin dog i be a sport dog he say bitterly for the first three year of my life i belong to a man who keep a livery stable here in fairport and he use to hire I out to shooting party i be a favorite with all the gentleman i be crazy with delight when i see the gun bring out and would jump up and bite at they i love to chase bird and rabbit and even now when the pigeon come near I i tremble all over and have to turn away lest i should seize they i use often to be in the wood from morning till night i like to have a hard search after a bird after it have be shoot and to be praise for bring it out without bite or injure it i never get lose for i be one of those dog that can always tell where human being be i do not smell they i would be too far away for that but if my master be stand in some place and i take a long round through the wood i know exactly where he be and could make a short cut back to he without return in my track but i must tell you about my trouble one Saturday afternoon a party of young man come to get I they have a dog with they a cocker spaniel call bob but they want another for some reason or other my master be very unwilling to have I go however he at last consent and they put I in the back of the wagon with bob and the lunch basket and we drive off into the country this bob be a happy merry-looking dog and as we go along he tell I of the fine time we should have next day the young man would shoot a little then they would get out they basket and have something to eat and drink and would play card and go to sleep under the tree and we would be able to help ourselves to leg and wing of chicken and anything we like from the basket i do not like this at all i be use to work hard through the week and i like to spend my sunday quietly at home however i say nothing that night we sleep at a country hotel and drive the next morning to the bank of a small lake where the young man be tell there would be plenty of wild duck they be in no hurry to begin they sport they sit down in the sun on some flat rock at the water 's edge and say they would have something to drink before set to work they get out some of the bottle from the wagon and begin to take long drink from they then they get quarrelsome and mischievous and seem to forget all about they shooting one of they propose to have some fun with the dog they tie we both to a tree and throw a stick in the water tell we to get it of course we struggle and try to get free and chafe we neck with the rope after a time one of they begin to swear at I and say that he believe i be gun-shy he stagger to the wagon and get out he fowling piece and say he be go to try I he load it go to a little distance and be go to fire when the young man who own bob say he be not go to have he dog 's leg shoot off and come up he unfasten he and take he away you can imagine my feeling as i stand there tie to the tree with that stranger point he gun directly at I he fire close to I a number of time -- over my head and under my body the earth be cut up all around I i be terribly frightened and howl and beg to be free the other young man who be sit laugh at I think it such good fun that they get they gun too i never wish to spend such a terrible hour again i be sure they would kill I i dare say they would have do so for they be all quite drunk by this time if something have not happen poor bob who be almost as frightened as i be and who lay shiver under the wagon be kill by a shoot by he own master whose hand be the most unsteady of all he give one loud howl kick convulsively then turn over on he side and lay quite still it sober they all they run up to he but he be quite dead they sit for a while quite silent then they throw the rest of the bottle into the lake dig a shallow grave for bob and put I in the wagon drive slowly back to town they be not bad young man i do not think they mean to hurt I or to kill bob it be the nasty stuff in the bottle that take away they reason i be never the same dog again i be quite deaf in my right ear and though i strove against it i be so terribly afraid of even the sight of a gun that i would run and hide myself whenever one be show to I my master be very angry with those young man and it seem as if he could not bear the sight of I one day he take I very kindly and bring I here and ask mr morris if he do not want a good-natured dog to play with the child i have a happy home here and i love the morri boy but i often wish that i could keep from put my tail between my leg and run home every time i hear the sound of a gun never mind that jim i say you should not fret over a thing for which you be not to blame i be sure you must be glad for one reason that you have leave you old life what be that he say on account of the bird you know miss laura think it be wrong to kill the pretty creature that fly about the wood so it be he say unless one kill they at once i have often feel angry with man for only-half kill a bird i hate to pick up the little warm body and see the bright eye look so reproachfully at I and feel the flutter of life we animal or rather the most of we kill mercifully it be only human being who butcher they prey and seem some of they to rejoice in they agony i use to be eager to kill bird and rabbit but i do not want to keep they before I long after they be dead i often stop in the street and look up at fine lady ' bonnet and wonder how they can wear little dead bird in such dreadful position some of they have they head twist under they wing and over they shoulder and look toward they tail and they eye be so horrible that i wish i could take those lady into the wood and let they see how easy and pretty a live bird be and how unlike the stuff creature

soothe she tell she to go find davy and he would play with she bellum and the rat be great friend it be very funny to see they go about the house together from the very first she have like he and coax

so timid that when she go into the room they be uneasy till she leave it she tell he that pet bird or animal be sociable and like company unless they be keep by themselves when they become shy she advise he to let the other boy go into the room and occasionally to bring some of he pretty singer downstairs where all the family could enjoy see and hear they and where they would get use to other people besides himself carl look thoughtful and he mother go on to say that there be no one in the house not even the cat that would harm he bird you might even charge admission for a day or two say jack gravely and introduce we to they and make a little money carl be rather annoy at this but he mother calm he by show he a letter she have just get from one of she brother ask she to let one of she boy spend he christmas holiday in the country with he i want you to go carl she say he be very much pleased but look sober when he think of he pet laura and i will take care of they say he mother and start the new management of they very well say carl i will go then i have no young one now so you will not find they much trouble i think it be a great deal of trouble to take care of they the first morning after carl leave billy and bellum and davy and i follow miss laura upstairs she make we sit in a row by the door lest we should startle the canary she have a great many thing to do first the canary have they bath they have to get they at the same time every morning miss laura fill the little white dish with water and put they in the cage and then come and sit on a stool by the door bellum and billy and davy climb into she lap and i stand close by she it be so funny to watch those canary they put they head on one side and look first at they little bath and then at we they know we be stranger finally as we be all very quiet they get into the water and what a good time they have flutter they wing and splashing and cleaning themselves so nicely then they get up on they perch and sit in the sun shake themselves and pick at they feather miss laura clean each cage and give each bird some mixed rape and canary seed i hear carl tell she before he leave not to give they much hemp seed for that be too fattening he be very careful about they food during the summer i have often see he take up nice green thing to they : celery chickweed tender cabbage peach apple pear banana and now at christmas time he have green stuff grow in pot on the window ledge besides that he give they crumb of coarse bread cracker lump of sugar cuttle-fish to peck at and a number of other thing miss laura do everything just as he tell she but i think she talk to the bird more than he do she be very particular about they drinking water and wash out the little glass cup that hold it most carefully after the canary be clean and comfortable miss laura set they cage in the sun and turn to the goldfish they be in large glass globe on the window-seat she take a long-handled tin cup and dip out the fish from one into a basin of water then she wash the globe thoroughly and put the fish back and scatter wafer of fish food on the top the fish come up and snap at it and act as if they be glad to get it she do each globe and then she work be over for one morning she go away for a while but every few hour through the day she run up to carl 's room to see how the fish and canary be get on if the room be too chilly she turn on more heat but she do not keep it too warm for that would make the bird tender after a time the canary get to know she and hop gayly around they cage and chirp and sing whenever they see she coming then she begin to take some of they downstairs and to let they out of they cage for a hour or two every day they be very happy little creature and chase each other about the room and fly on miss laura 's head and peck saucily at she face as she sit sewing and watch they they be not at all afraid of I nor of billy and it be quite a sight to see they hop up to bella she look so large beside they one little bird become ill while carl be away and miss laura have to give it a great deal of attention she give it plenty of hemp seed to make it fat and very often the yolk of a hard-boiled egg and keep a nail in its drinking water and give it a few drop of alcohol in its bath every morning to keep it from take cold the moment the bird finish take its bath miss laura take the dish from the cage for the alcohol make the water poisonous then vermin come on it and she have to write to carl to ask he what to do he tell she to hang a muslin bag full of sulphur over the swing so that the bird would dust it down on she feather that cure the little thing and when carl come home he find it quite well again one day just after he get back mrs montague drive up to the house with a canary cage carefully do up in a shawl she say that a bad-tempered housemaid in clean the cage that morning have get angry with the bird and strike it break its leg she be very much annoyed with the girl for she cruelty and have dismiss she and now she want carl to take she bird and nurse it as she know nothing about canary carl have just come in from school he throw down he book

get mr montague to help he and together they split match tear up strip of muslin and bandage the broken leg he put the little bird back in the cage and it seem more comfortable i think he will do now he say to mr montague but have not you better leave he with I for a few day she gladly agree to this and go away after tell he that the bird 's name be dick the next morning at the breakfast table i hear carl tell he mother that as soon as he wake up he spring out of bed and go to see how he canary be during the night poor foolish dick have pick off the splint from he leg and now it be as bad as ever i shall have to perform a surgical operation he say i do not know what he mean so i watch he when after breakfast he bring the bird down to he mother 's room she hold it while he take a pair of sharp scissors and cut its leg right off a little way above the broken place then he put some vaseline on the tiny stump bind it up and leave dick in he mother 's care all the morning as she sit sew she watch he to see that he do not pick the bandage away when carl come home dick be so much better that he have manage to fly up on he perch and be eat seed quite gayly poor dick say carl leg and a stump dick imitate he in a few little chirp a leg and a stump why he be say it too exclaim carl and burst out laugh dick seem cheerful enough but it be very pitiful to see he drag he poor little stump around the cage and rest it against the perch to keep he from fall when mr montague come the next day she could not bear to look at he oh dear she exclaim i can not take that disfigured bird home i could not help think how different she be from miss laura who love any creature all the more for have some blemish about it what shall i do say mr montague i miss my little bird so much i shall have

that i go over the wall with he and leave jim on the other side jenkin fall on he face in the earth then he get up and with a look of deadly hatred on he face pounce upon I if help have not come i

piece come out in the paper about he he find that no one would take milk from he he wife die and some kind people put he child in a asylum and he be oblige to sell toby and the cow instead of learn a lesson from all this and lead a better life he keep sink lower he be therefore ready for any kind of mischief that turn up and when he see the drury go away in the train he think he would steal a bag of silver from they sideboard then set fire to the house and run away and hide the silver after a time he would take it to some city and sell it he be make to confess all this then for he wickedness he be send to prison for ten year and i hope he will get to be a better man there and be one after he come out i be sore and stiff for a long time and one day mr drury come over to see I she do not love dog as the morrise do she try to but she could not dog can see fun in thing as well as people can and i bury my muzzle in the hearth-rug so that she would not see how i be curl up my lip and

go to the station to see we off they put a chain on my collar and take I to the baggage office and get two ticket for I one be tie to my collar and the other miss laura put in she purse then i be put in a baggage car and chained in a corner i hear mr morri say that as we be only go a short distance it be not worth while to get a express ticket for I there be a dreadful noise and bustle at the station whistle be blow and people be rush up and down the platform some man be tumble baggage so fast into the car where i be that i be afraid some of it would fall on I for a few minute miss laura stand by the door and look in but soon the man have pile up so many box and trunk that she could not see I then she go away mr morri ask one of the man to see that i do not get hurt and i hear some

train start the door of the baggage car be close and it become quite dark inside the darkness and the heat and the close smell and the noise as we go rush along make I feel sick and frightened i do not dare to lie down but sit up tremble and wish that we might soon come to riverdale station but we do not get there for some time and i be to have a great fright i be think of all the story that i know of animal travel in February the drury ' newfoundland watch-dog pluto have arrive from new york and he tell jim and I that he have a miserable journey a gentleman friend of mr drury 's have bring he from new york he see he chained up in he car and he go into he pullman first tip the baggage-master handsomely to look after he pluto say that the baggage-master have a very red nose and he be always get drink for himself when they stop at a station but he never once give he a drink or anything to eat from the time they leave new york till they get to fairport when the train stop there and pluto 's chain be unfastened he spring out on the platform and nearly knock mr drury down he see some snow that have sift through the station roof and he be so thirsty that he begin to lick it up when the snow be all go he jump up and lick the frost on the window mr drury 's friend be so angry he find the baggage-master and say to he : what do you mean by come into my car every few hour to tell I that the dog be feed and water and comfortable i shall report you he go into the office at the station and complain of the man and be tell that he be a drinking man and be go to be dismiss i be not afraid of suffer like pluto because it be only go to take we a few hour to get to riverdale i find that we always go slowly before we come in to a station and one time when we begin to slacken speed i think that surely we must be at we journey 's end however it be not riverdale the car give a kind of jump then there be a crash sound ahead and we stop i hear man shout and run up and down and i wonder what have happen it be all dark and still in the car and nobody come in but the noise keep up outside and i know something have go wrong with the train perhaps miss laura have get hurt something must have happen to she or she would come to I i barked and pull at my chain till my neck be sore but for a long long time i be there alone the man run about outside must have hear I if ever i hear a man in trouble and cry for help i go to he and see what he want after such a long time that it seem to I it must be the middle of the night the door at the end of the car open and a man look in this be all through baggage for new york miss i hear he say they would not put you dog in here yes they do -- i be sure this be the car i hear in the voice i know so well and will not you get he out please he must be terribly frighten the man stoop down and unfasten my chain grumble to himself because i have not be put in another car some folk tumble a dog round as if he be a junk of coal he say patting I kindly i be nearly wild with delight to get with miss laura again but i have bark so much and press my neck so hard with my collar that my voice be all go i fawn on she and wag myself about and open and shut my mouth but no sound come out of it it make miss laura nervous she try to laugh and cry at the same time and then bite she lip hard and say : oh joe do not he be lose he bark have not he say the man look at I curiously it be a wicked thing to confine a animal in a dark and closed car say miss laura try to see she way down the step through she tear the man put out he hand and help she he be not suffer much miss he say do not you distress yourself now if you would be a brakeman on a chicago train as i be a few year ago and see the animal run in for the stock yard you might talk about cruelty car that ought to hold a certain number of pig or sheep or cattle jam full with twice as many and half of 'em throw out choke and smother to death i have see a man run up and down rage and swearing because the railway people have not let he get in to tend to he pig on the road miss laura turn and look at the man with a very white face be it like that now she ask no no he say hastily it be better now they have get new regulation about take care of the stock but mind you miss the cruelty to animal be not all do on the railway there be a great lot of dumb creature suffer all round everywhere and if they could speak ` twould be a hard show for some other people besides the railway man he lift he cap and hurry down the platform and miss laura she face very much troubled pick she way among the bit of coal and wood scatter about the platform and go into the wait room of the little station she take I up to the filter and let some water run in she hand and give it to I to lap then she sit down and i lean my head against she knee and she stroke my throat gently there be some people sit about the room and from they talk i find out what have take place there have be a freight train on a side track at this station wait for we to get by the switchman have carelessly leave the switch open after this train go by and when we come along afterward we train instead of run in by the platform go crash into the freight train if we have be go fast great damage might have be do as it be we engine be smash so badly that it could not take we on the passenger be frightened and we be have a tedious time wait for another engine to come and take we to riverdale after the accident the trainman be so busy that miss laura could get no one to release I while i sit by she i notice a old gentleman stare at we he be such a queer-looking old gentleman he look like a poodle he have bright brown eye and a pointed face and a shock of white hair that he shake every few minute he sit with he hand clasp on the top of he cane and he scarcely take he eye from miss laura 's face suddenly he jump up and come and sit down beside she a ugly dog that he say point to I most young lady

look as if he be annoy that the older man should have make miss laura cry do not you think sir he say as the old gentleman pass near he in walk up and down the floor that there be a great deal of mock sentiment about this business of take care of the dumb creation they be make for we they have get to suffer and be kill to supply we want the cattle and sheep and other animal would over-run the earth if we do not kill they grant say the old man stop right in front of he grant young man if you take out that word suffer the lord make the sheep and the cattle and the pig they be he creature just as much as we be we can kill they but we have no right to make they suffer but we can not help it sir yes we can my young man it be a possible thing to raise healthy stock treat it kindly kill it mercifully eat it decently when man do that i for one will cease to be a vegetarian you be only a boy you have not travel as i have i have be from one end of this country to the other up north down south and out west i have see sight that make I shudder and i tell you the lord will punish this great american nation if it do not change its treatment of the dumb animal commit to its care the young man look thoughtful and do not reply a very sweet face old lady sit near he answer the old gentleman i do not think i have ever see such a fine-looking old lady as she be she hair be snowy white and she face be deeply wrinkled yet she be tall and stately and she expression be as pleasing as my dear miss laura 's i do not think we be a wicked nation she say softly we be a younger nation than many of the nation of the earth and i think that many of we sin arise from ignorance and thoughtlessness yes madame yes madame say the fiery old gentleman stare hard at she i agree with you there she smile very pleasantly at he and go on i too have be a traveler and i have talk to a great many wise and good people on the subject of the cruel treatment of animal and i find that many of they have never think about it they themselves never knowingly ill-treat a dumb creature and when they be tell story of inhuman conduct they say in surprise ` why these thing surely can not exist ' you see they have never be bring in contact with they as soon as they learn about they they begin to agitate and say ` we must have this thing stop where be the remedy ' and what be it what be it madame in you opinion say the old gentleman paw the floor with impatience just the remedy that i would propose for the great evil of intemperance say the old lady smile at he legislation and education legislation for the old and hardened and education for the young and tender i would tell the schoolboy and schoolgirl that alcohol will destroy the framework of they beautiful body and that cruelty to any of god 's living creature will blight and destroy they innocent young soul the young man speak again do not you think he say that you temperance and humane people lay too much stress upon the education of we youth in all lofty and noble sentiment the human heart will always be wicked you bible tell you that do not it you can not educate all the badness out of child we do not expect to do that say the old lady turn she pleasant face toward he but even if the human heart be desperately wicked should not that make we much more eager to try to educate to ennoble and restrain however as far as my experience go and i have live in this wicked world for seventy-five year i find that the human heart though wicked and cruel as you say have yet some soft and tender spot and the impression make upon it in youth be never never efface do you not remember better than anything else stand at you mother 's knee -- the pressure of she hand she kiss on you forehead by this time we engine have arrive a whistle be blow and nearly every one be rush from the room the impatient old gentleman among the first miss laura be hurriedly try to do up she shawl strap and i be stand by wish that i could help she the old lady and the young man be the only other people in the room and we could not help hear what they say yes i do he say in a thick voice and he face get very red she be dead now -- i have no mother poor boy and the old lady lay she hand on he shoulder they be stand up and she be taller than he be may god bless you i know you have a kind heart i have four stalwart boy and you remind I of the youngest if you be ever in washington come to see I she give he some name and he lift he hat and look as if he be astonish to find out who she be then he too go away and she turn to miss laura shall i help you my dear if you please say my young mistress i can not fasten this strap in a few seconds the bundle be do up and we be joyfully hasten to the train it be only a few mile to riverdale so the conductor let I stay in the car with miss laura she spread she coat out on the seat in front of she and i sit on it and look out of the car window as we speed along through a lovely country all green and fresh in the June sunlight how light and pleasant this car be -- so different from the baggage car what frighten a animal most of all thing be not to see where it be go not to know what be go to happen to it i think that they be very like human being in this respect the lady have take a seat beside miss laura and as we go along she too look out of the window and say in a low voice : what be so rare as a day in June then if ever come perfect day that be very true say miss laura how sad that the autumn must come and the cold winter no my dear not sad it be but a preparation for another summer yes i suppose it be say miss laura then she continue a little shyly as she companion lean over to stroke my crop ear you seem very fond of animal i be my dear i have four horse two cow a tame squirrel three dog and a cat you should be a happy woman say miss laura with a smile i think i be i must not forget my horn toad diego that i get in californium i keep he in the green-house and he be very happy catch fly and hold he horny head to be scratch whenever any one come near i do not see how any one can be unkind to animal say miss laura thoughtfully nor i my dear child it have always cause I intense pain to witness the torture of dumb animal nearly seventy year ago when i be a little girl walk the street of boston i would tremble and grow faint at the cruelty of driver to over-loaded horse i be timid and do not dare speak to they very often i run home and fling myself in my mother 's arm with a burst of tear and ask she if nothing could be do to help the poor animal with mistaken motherly kindness she try to put the subject out of my thought i be carefully guard from see or hearing of any instance of cruelty but the animal go on suffer just the same and when i become a woman i see my cowardice i agitate the matter among my friend and tell they that we whole dumb creation be groan together in pain and would continue to groan unless merciful human being be willing to help they i be able to assist in the formation of several society for the prevention of cruelty to animal and they have do good service good service not only to the horse and cow but to the nobler animal man i believe that in say to a cruel man ` you shall not overwork torture mutilate nor kill you animal or neglect to provide it with proper food and shelter ' we be make he a little nearer the kingdom of heaven than he be before for ` whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap ' if he sow seed of unkindness and cruelty to man and beast no one know what the blackness of the harvest will be he poor horse quiver under a blow be not the worst sufferer oh if people would only understand that they unkind deed will recoil upon they own head with tenfold force -- but my dear child i be fancy that i be address a drawing-room meeting -- and here we be at you station good-bye keep you happy face and gentle way i hope that we may meet again some day she press miss laura 's hand give I a farewell pat and the next minute we be outside on the platform and she be smile through the window at we \* \* \* \* \* chapter xvi dingley farm my dear niece and a stout middle-aged woman with a red lively face throw both she arm around miss laura how glad i be to see you and this be the dog good joe i have a bone wait for you here be uncle john a tall good-looking man step up and put out a big hand in which my mistress ' little finger be quite swallow up i be glad to see you laura well joe how d'ye do old boy i have hear about you it make I feel very welcome to have they both notice I and i be so glad to be out of the train that i frisk for joy around they foot as we go to the wagon it be a big double one with a awning over it to shelter it from the sun 's ray and the horse be draw up in the shade of a spreading tree they be two powerful black horse and as they have no blinders on they could see we come they face light up and they move they ear and paw the ground and whinny when mr wood go up to they they try to rub they head against he and i see plainly that they love he steady there cleve and pacer he say now back back up by this time mr wood miss laura and i be in the wagon then mr wood jump in take up the rein and off we go how the two black horse do spin along i sit on the seat beside mr wood and sniff in the delicious air and the lovely smell of flower and grass how glad i be to be in the country what long race i should have in the green field i wish that i have another dog to run with I and wonder very much whether mr wood keep one i know i should soon find out for whenever miss laura go to a place she want to know what animal there be about we drive a little more than a mile along a country road where there be scatter house miss laura answer question about she family and ask question about mr harry who be away at college and have not get home i do not think i have say before that mr harry be mrs wood 's son she be a widow with one son when she marry mr wood so that mr harry though the morrise call he cousin be not really they cousin i be very glad to hear they say that he be soon come home for i have never forget that but for he i should never have know miss laura and get into my pleasant home by-and-by i hear miss laura say : uncle john have you a dog yes laura he say i have one to-day but i sha 'n' t have one to-morrow oh uncle what do you mean she ask well laura he reply you know animal be pretty much like people there be some good one and some bad one now this dog be a snarl cross-grained cantankerous beast and when i hear joe be come i say : ` now we 'll have a good dog about the place and here be a end to the bad one ' so i tie bruno up and to-morrow i shall shoot he something 's get to be do or he 'll be bite some one uncle say miss laura people do not always die when they be bite by dog do they no certainly not reply mr wood in my humble opinion there be a great lot of nonsense talk about the poison of a dog 's bite and people die of hydrophobia ever since i be bear i have have dog snap at I and stick they tooth in my flesh and i have never have a symptom of hydrophobia and never intend to have i believe half the people that be bite by dog frighten themselves into think they be fatally poison i be read the other day about the policeman in a big city in england that have to catch stray dog and dog suppose to be mad and all kind of dog and they get bite over and over again and never think anything about it but let a lady or a gentleman walk along the street have a dog bite they and they worry themselves till they blood be in a fever and they have to hurry across to france to get pasteur to cure they they imagine they have get hydrophobia and they have get it because they imagine it i believe if i fix my attention on that right thumb of mine and think i have a sore there and pick at it and worry it in a short time a sore would come and i would be off to the doctor to have it cure at the same time dog have no business to bite and i do not recommend any one to get bite but uncle say miss laura be not there such a thing as hydrophobia oh yes i dare say there be i believe that a careful examination of the record of death report in boston from hydrophobia for the space of thirty-two year show that two people actually die from it dog be like all other animal they be liable to sickness and they have get to be watch i think my horse would go mad if i starve they or over-fed they or over-worked they or let they stand in laziness or keep they dirty or do not give they water enough they would get some disease anyway if a person own a animal let he take care of it and it be all right if it show sign of sickness shut it up and watch it if the sickness be incurable kill it here be a sure way to prevent hydrophobia kill off all ownerless and vicious dog if you can not do that have plenty of water where they can get at it a dog that have all the water he want will never go mad this dog of mine have not one single thing the matter with he but pure ugliness yet if i let he loose and he run through the village with he tongue out i 'll warrant you there would be a cry of ` mad dog ' however i be go to kill he i have no use for a bad dog have plenty of animal i say and treat they kindly but if there be a vicious one among they put it out of the way for it be a constant danger to man and beast it be queer how ugly some people be about they dog they 'll keep they no matter how they worry other people and even when they be snatch the bread out of they neighbor ' mouth but i say that be not the fault of the four-legged dog a human dog be the worst of all there be a band of sheep-killing dog here in riverdale that they owner can not or will not keep out of mischief meek-looking fellow some of they be the owner go to bed at night and the dog pretend to go too but when the house be quiet and the family asleep off go rover or fido to worry poor defenseless creature that can not defend themselves they taste for sheep 's blood be like the taste for liquor in man and the dog will travel as far to get they fun as the man will travel for theirs they have get it in they and you can not get it out mr windham cure he dog say mr wood mr wood burst into a hearty laugh so he do so he do i must tell laura about that windham be a neighbor of ours and last summer i keep tell he that he collie be worry my shropshire he would not believe I but i know i be right and one night when harry be home he lay in wait for the dog and lasso he i tie he up and send for windham you should have see he face and the dog 's face he say two word ` you scoundrel ' and the dog cower at he foot as if he have be shoot he be a fine dog but he would get corrupt by evil companion then windham ask I where my sheep be i tell he in the pasture he ask I if i still have my old ram bolton i say yes and then he want eight or ten foot of rope i give it to he and wonder what on earth he be go to do with it he tie one end of it to the dog 's collar and hold the other in he hand set out for the pasture he ask we to go with he and when he get there he tell harry he would like to see he catch bolton there be not any need to catch he he would come to we like a dog harry whistle and when bolton come up windham fasten the rope 's end to he horn and let he go the ram be frightened and run drag the dog with he we let they out of the pasture into a open field and for a few minute there be such a racing and chasing over that field as i never see before harry lean up against the bar and laugh till the tear roll down he cheek then bolton get mad and begin to make battle with the dog pitch into he with he horn we soon stop that for the spirit have all go out of dash windham unfasten the rope and tell he to get home and if ever i see a dog run that one do mrs windham set great store by he and she husband do not want to kill he but he say dash have get to give up he sheep-killing if he want to live that cure he he be never worry a sheep from that day to this and if you offer he a bit of sheep 's wool now he tuck he tail between he leg and run for home now i must stop my talk for we be in sight of the farm yonder 's we boundary line and there be the house you 'll see a difference in the tree since you be here before we have come to a turn in the road where the ground slope gently upward we turn in at the gate and drive between row of tree up to a long low red house with a veranda all round it there be a wide lawn in front and away on we right be the farm building they too be paint red and there be some tree by they that mr wood call he windbreak because they keep the snow from drift in the winter time i think it be a beautiful place miss laura have be here before but not for some year so she too be look about quite eagerly welcome to dingley farm joe say mr wood with she jolly laugh as she watch I jump from the carriage seat to the ground come in and i 'll introduce you to pussy aunt hattie why be the farm call dingley farm say miss laura as we go into the house it ought to be wood farm dingley be make out of ` dingle ' laura you know that pretty hollow back of the pasture it be what they call a ` dingle ' so this farm be call dingle farm till the people around about get say ` dingley ' instead i suppose they find it easier why here be lolo come to see joe walk along the wide hall that run through the house be a large tortoise-shell cat she have a prettily marked face and she be wave she large tail like a flag and mewing kindly to greet she mistress but when she see I what a face she make she fly on the hall table and put up she back till it almost lift she foot from the ground begin to spit at I and bristle with rage poor lolo say mr wood go up to she joe be a good dog and not like bruno he will not hurt you i wagged myself about a little and look kindly at she but she do nothing but say bad word to I it be week and week before i make friend with that cat she be a young thing and have know only one dog and he be a bad one so she suppose all dog be like he there be a number of room open off the hall and one of they be the dining room where they have tea i lay on a rug outside the door and watch they there be a small table spread with a white cloth and it have pretty dish and glassware on it and a good many different kind of thing to eat a little french girl call adele keep come and go from the kitchen to give they hot cake and fry egg and hot coffee as soon as they finish they tea mrs wood give I one of the best meal that i ever have in my life \* \* \* \* \* chapter xvii mr wood and he horse the morning after we arrive in riverdale i be up very early and walk around the house i sleep in the woodsh and could run outdoors whenever i like the woodshed be at the back of the house and near it be the tool shed then there be a carriage house and a plank walk lead to the barnyard i run up this walk and look into the first building i come to it be the horse stable a door stand open and the morning sun be glance in there be several horse there some with they head toward I and some with they tail i see that instead of be tie up there be gate outside they stall and they could stand in any way they like there be a man move about at the other end of the stable and long before he see I i know that it be mr wood what a nice clean stable he have there be always a foul smell come out of jenkin 's stable but here the air seem as pure inside as outside there be a number of little grating in the wall to let in the fresh air and they be so place that draft would not blow on the horse mr wood be go from one horse to another give they hay and talk to they in a cheerful voice at last he spy I and cry out the top of the morning to you joe you be up early do not come too near the horse good dog as i walk in beside he they might think you be another bruno and give you a sly bite or kick i should have shoot he long ago ` tis hard to make a good dog suffer for a bad one but that be the way of the world well old fellow what do you think of my horse stable pretty fair be not it and mr wood go on talk to I as he feed and groom he horse till i soon find out that he chief pride be in they i like to have human being talk to I mr morri often read he sermon to I and miss laura tell I secret that i do not think she would tell to any one else i watch mr wood carefully while he groom a huge gray cart-horse that he call dutchman he take a brush in he right hand and a curry-comb in he left and he curry and brush every part of the horse 's skin and afterward wipe he with a cloth a good grooming be equal to two quart of oats joe he say to I then he stoop down and examine the horse 's hoof you shoe be too heavy dutchman he say but that pig-headed blacksmith think he know more about horse than i do ` do not cut the sole nor the frog ' i say to he ` do not pare the hoof so much and do not rasp it and fit you shoe to the foot and not the foot to the shoe ' and he look as if he want to say ` mind you own business ' we 'll not go to he again '' tis hard to teach a old dog new trick ' i get you to work for I not to wear out you strength in lift about he weighty shoe mr wood stop talk for a few minute and whistle a tune then he begin again i have make a study of horse joe over forty year i have study they and it be my opinion that the average horse know more than the average man that drive he when i think of the stupid fool that be goad patient horse about beat they and misunderstand they and think they be only clod of earth with a little life in they i would like to take they horse out of the shaft and harness they in and i would trot they off at a pace and slash they and jerk they till i guess they would come out with a little less patience than the animal do look at this dutchman -- see the size of he you would think he have not any more nerve than a bit of granite yet he be get a skin as sensitive as a girl 's see how he quiver if i run the curry-comb too harshly over he the idiot i get he from do not know what be the matter with he he would buy he for a reliable horse and there he be kick and stamp whenever the boy go near he ` you boy 's get too heavy a hand deacon jone ' say i when he describe the horse 's action to I ` you may depend upon it a four-legged creature unlike a two-legged one have a reason for everything he do ' ` but he be only a draught horse ' say deacon jone ` draught horse or no draught horse ' say i ` you be describe a horse with a tender skin to I and i do not care if he be as big as a elephant ' well the old man grumble and say he do not want any thoroughbred air in he stable so i buy you do not i dutchman and mr wood stroke he kindly and go to the next stall in each stall be a small tank of water with a slide cover and i find out afterward that these cover be put on when a horse come in too heat to have a drink at any other time he could drink all he like mr wood believe in have plenty of pure water for all he animal and they all have they own place to get a drink even i have a little bowl of water in the woodsh though i could easily have run up to the barnyard when i want a drink as soon as i come mr wood ask adele to keep it there for I and when i look up gratefully at she she say : every animal should have

of the skull if you 'll remind I i 'll show you a circular i have in the house it tell the proper way to kill animal : the american humane education society in boston put it out and it be a merciful thing you do not know anything about the slaughtering of animal laura and it be well you do not there be a awful amount of cruelty practice and practice by some people that think themselves pretty good i would not have my lamb kill the way my father have he for a kingdom i 'll never forget the first one i see butcher i would not feel worse at a hang now and that white ox hattie -- you remember my tell you about he he have to be kill and father send for the butcher i be only a lad and i be all of a shudder to have the life of the creature i have know take from he the butcher stupid clown give he eight blow before he strike the right place the ox bellow and turn he great black eye on my father and i fall in a faint miss laura turn away and mrs wood follow she saying : if ever you want to kill a cat laura give it cyanide of potassium i kill a poor old sick cat for mr windham the other day we put half a teaspoonful of pure cyanide of potassium in a long-handled wooden spoon and drop it on the cat 's tongue as near the throat as we could poor pussy -- she die in a few seconds do you know i be read such a funny thing the other day about give cat medicine they hate it and one can scarcely force it into they mouth on account of they sharp tooth the way be to smear it on they side and they lick it off a good idea be not it here we be at the hen house or rather one of the hen house do not you keep you hen all together ask miss laura only in the winter time say mr wood i divide my flock in the spring part of they stay here and part go to the orchard to live in little movable house that we put about in different place i feed each flock morning and evening at they own little house they know they 'll get no food even if they come to my house so they stay at home and they know they 'll get no food between time so all day long they pick and scratch in the orchard and destroy so many bug and insect that it more than pay for the trouble of keep they there do not this flock want to mix up with the other asked miss laura as she step into the little wooden house no they seem to understand i keep my eye on they for a while at first and they soon find out that they be not to fly either over the garden fence or the orchard fence they roam over the farm and pick up what they can get there be a good deal of sense in hen if one manage they properly i love they because they be such good mother we be in the little wooden house by this time and i look around it with surprise it be better than some of the poor people 's house in fairport the wall be white and clean so be the little ladder that lead up to different kind of roost where the fowl sit at night some roost be thin and round and some be broad and flat mr wood say that the broad one be for a heavy fowl call the brahma every part of the little house be almost as light as it be out door on account of the large window miss laura speak of it why auntie i never see such a light hen house mr wood be diving into a partly shut-in place where it be not so light and where the nest be she straighten herself up she face redder than ever and look at the window with a pleased smile yes there be not a hen house in new hampshire with such big window whenever i look at they i think of my mother 's hen and wish that they could have have a place like this they would have think themselves in a hen 's paradise when i be a girl we do not know that hen love light and heat and all winter they use to sit in a dark hencoop and the cold be so bad that they comb would freeze stiff and the top of they would drop off we never think about it if we would have any sense we might have watch they on a fine day go and sit on the compost heap and sun themselves and then have conclude that if they like light and heat outside they would like it inside poor biddy they be so cold that they would not lay we any egg in winter you take a great interest in you poultry do not you auntie say miss laura yes indeed and well i may i 'll show you my brown leghorn jenny that lay egg enough in a year to pay for the newspaper i take to keep myself post in poultry matter i buy all my own clothes with my hen money and lately i have start a bank account for i want to save up enough to start a few stand of bee even if i do not want to be kind to my hen it would pay I to be so for sake of the profit they yield of course they be quite a lot of trouble sometimes they get vermin on they and i have to grease they and dust carbolic acid on they and try some of my numerous cure then i must keep ash and dust wallow for they and be very particular about my egg when hen be sit and see that the hen come off regularly for food and exercise oh there be a hundred thing i have to think of but i always say to any one that think of raise poultry : ` if you be go into the business for the purpose of make money it pay to take care of they ' there be one thing i notice say miss laura and that be that you drinking fountain must be a great deal better than the shallow pan that i have see some people give they hen water in dirty thing they be say mr wood i would not use one of they i do not think there be anything worse for hen than drinking dirty water my hen must have as clean water as i drink myself and in winter i heat it for they if it be pour boil into the fountain in the morning it keep warm till night speaking of shallow drinking dish i would not use they even before i ever hear of a drinking fountain john make I something that we read about he use to take a powder keg and bear a little hole in the side about a inch from the top then fill it with water and cover with a pan a little larger round than the keg then he turn the keg upside down without take away the pan the water run into the pan only as far as the hole in the keg and it would have to be use before more would flow in now let we go and see my beautiful bronze turkey they do not need any house for they roost in the tree the year round we find the flock of turkey and miss laura admire they changeable color very much some of they be very large and i do not like they for the gobbler run at I and make a dreadful noise in they throat afterward mr wood show we some duck that she have shut up in a yard she say that she be feed they on vegetable food to give they flesh a pure flavor and by-and-by she would send they to market and get a high price for they every place she take we to be as clean as possible no one can be successful in raise poultry in large number she say unless they keep they quarter clean and comfortable as yet we have see no hen except a few on the nest and miss laura say where be they i should like to see they they be come say mr wood it be just they breakfast time and they be as punctual as clockwork they go off early in the morning to scratch about a little for themselves first as she speak she step off the plank walk and look off towards the field miss laura burst out laugh away beyond the barn the hen be come see mr wood standing there they think they be late and begin to run and fly jump over each other 's back and stretch out they neck in a state of great excitement some of they leg seem stick straight out behind it be very funny to see they they be a fine-looking lot of poultry mostly white with glossy feather and bright eye they greedily eat the food scatter to they and mr wood say they think i have change they breakfast time and to-morrow they 'll come a good bit earlier and yet some people say hen have no sense \* \* \* \* \* chapter xix a band of mercy a few evening after we come to dingley farm mr wood and miss laura be sit out on the veranda and i be lie at they foot auntie say miss laura what do those letter mean on that silver pin that you wear with that piece of ribbon you know what the white ribbon mean do not you ask mrs wood yes that you be a temperance woman do not it it do and the star pin mean that i be a member of a band of mercy do you know what a band of mercy be no say miss laura how strange i should think that you would have several in fairport a cripple boy the son of a boston artist start this one here it have do a great deal of good there be a meeting to-morrow and i will take you to it if you like it be on Monday that mr wood have this talk with miss laura and the next afternoon after all the work be do they get ready to go to the village may joe go ask miss laura certainly say mr wood he be such a good dog that he will not be any trouble i be very glad to hear this and trot along by they down the lane to the road the lane be a very cool and pleasant place there be tall tree grow on each side and under they among the grass pretty wild flower be peep out to look at we as we go by mr wood and miss laura talk all the way about the band of mercy miss laura be much interested and say that she would like to start one in fairport it be a very simple thing say mr wood all you have to do be to write the pledge at the top of a piece of paper : ' i will try to be kind to all harmless living creature and try to protect they from cruel usage ' and get thirty people to sign it that make a band i have form two or three band by keep slip of paper ready and get people that come to visit I to sign they i call they ` corresponding band ' for they be too far apart to meet i send the member ` band of mercy ' papers and i get such nice letter from they tell I of kind thing they do for animal a band of mercy in a place be a splendid thing there be the greatest difference in riverdale since this one be start a few year ago when a man beat or race he horse and any one interfere he say : ` this horse be mine i 'll do what i like with he ' most people think he be right but now they be all for the poor horse and there be not a man anywhere around who would dare to abuse any animal it be all the child they be do a grand work and i say it be a good thing for they since we have study this subject it be enough to frighten one to read what be send we about we american boy and girl do you know laura that with all we brag about we school and college that really be wonderful we be turn out more criminal than any other civilized country in the world except spain and italy the cause of it be say to be lack of proper training for the youth of we land immigration have something to do with it too we be think too much about educate the mind and forget about the heart and soul so i say now while we have get all we future population in we school saint and sinner good people and bad people let we try to slip in something between the geography and history and grammar that will go a little deeper and touch they so much that when they be grow up and go out in the world they will carry with they lesson of love and good-will to man a little child be such a tender thing you can bend it anyway you like speaking of this heart education of child as set over against mind education i see that many school-teacher say that there be nothing better than to give they lesson on kindness to animal child who be teach to love and protect dumb creature will be kind to they fellow-men when they grow up i be very much pleased with this talk between mr wood and miss laura and keep close to they so that i would not miss a word as we go along house begin to appear here and there set back from the road among the tree

bonnet just think of it girl be not it dreadful five million innocent hardworking beautiful bird kill that thoughtless girl and woman may ornament themselves with they little dead body one million bobolink have be kill in one month near philadelphium seventy song-bird be send from one long island village to new york milliner in florida cruel man shoot the mother bird on they nest while they be rear they young because they plumage be prettiest at that time the little one cry pitifully and starve to death every bird of the rarer kind that be kill such as hum bird oriole and kingfisher mean the death of several other -- that be the young that starve to death the wound that fly away to die and those whose plumage be so tear that it be not fit to put in a fine lady 's bonnet in some case where bird have gay wing and the hunter do not wish the rest of the body they tear off the wing from the living bird and throw it away to die i be sorry to tell you such painful thing but i think you ought to know they you will soon be man and woman do what you can to stop this horrid trade we beautiful bird be be take from we and the insect pest be increase the state of massachusett have lose over one hundred thousand dollar because it do not protect its bird the gypsy moth strip the tree near boston and the state have to pay out all this money and even then could not get rid of the moth the bird could have do it better than the state but they be all go my last word to you be ` protect the bird ' mr wood go to she seat and though the boy and girl have listen very attentively none of they cheer she they face look sad and they keep very quiet for a few minute i see one or two little girl wipe they eye i think they feel sorry for the bird have any boy do anything about blinders and check-rein ask the president after a time a brown-faced boy stand up i have a picnic last Monday he say father let I cut all the blinders off we head-stall with my penknife how do you get he to consent to that ask the president i tell he say the boy that i could not get to sleep for thinking of he you know he drive a good deal late at night i tell he that every dark night he come from sudbury i thought of the deep ditch alongside the road and wish he horse have not blinders on and every night he come from the junction and have to drive along the river bank where the water have wash away the earth till the wheel of the wagon be within a foot or two of the edge i wish again that he horse could see each side of they for i know they would have sense enough to keep out of danger if they could see it father say that might be very true and yet he horse have be break in with blinders and do not i think they would be incline to shy if he take they off and would not they be frighten to look around and see the wagon wheel so near i tell he that for every accident that happen to a horse without blinders several happen to a horse with they and then i give he mr wood 's opinion -- mr wood out at dingley farm he say that the worst thing against blinders be that a frightened horse never know when he have pass the thing that scare he he always think it be behind he the blinders be there and he can not see that he have pass it and he can not turn he head to have a good look at it so often he go tear madly on and sometimes life be lose all on account of a little bit of leather fasten over a beautiful eye that ought to look out full and free at the world that finish father he say he would take off he blinders and if he have a accident he would send the bill for damages to mr wood but we have have no accident the horse do act rather queerly at first and start a little but they soon get over it and now they go as steady without blinders as they ever do with they the boy sit down and the president say : i think it be time that the whole nation throw off this foolishness of half cover they horse ' eye just put you hand up to you eye member of the band half cover they and see how shut in you will feel and how curious you will be to know what be go on beside you suppose a girl see a mouse with she eye half cover would not she run everybody laugh and the president ask some one to tell he who invent blinders a english nobleman shout a boy who have a wall-eyed horse he want to cover up the defect and i think it be a great shame that all the american horse have to suffer because that english one have a ugly eye so do i say the president three groan for blinders boy all the child in the room make three dreadful noise away down in they throat then they have another good laugh and the president become sober again seven more minute he say this meeting have get to be let out at five sharp a tall girl at the back of the room rise and say my little cousin

before every one and what a stamp the boy make the larger girl blush and hurry back to she seat with the child cling to she hand there be one more story about a brave newfoundland dog that save eight life by swim out to a wreck sailing vessel and get a rope by which the man come ashore and then a lad get up whom they all greet with cheer and cry of the poet the poet i do not know what they mean till mr wood whisper to miss laura that he be a boy who make rhyme and the child have rather hear he speak than any one else in the room he have a snub nose and freckle and i think he be the plainest boy there but that do not matter if the other child love he he saunter up to the front with he hand behind he back and a very grand manner the beautiful poetry recite here to-day he drawl put some verse in my mind that i never have till i come here to-day everyone present cheer wildly and he begin in a singsong voice : i be a band of mercy boy i would not hurt a fly i always speak to dog and cat when ` er i pass they by i always let the birdie sing i never throw a stone i always give a hungry dog a nice fat meaty bone i would not drive a bob-tailed horse nor hurry up a cow i -- then he forget the rest the boy and girl be so sorry they call out pig goat calf sheep hen duck and all the other animal ' name they could think of but none of they be right and as the boy have just make up the poetry no one know what the next could be he stand for a long time stare at the ceiling then he say i guess i 'll have to give it up the child look dreadfully disappointed perhaps you will remember it by we next meeting say the president anxiously possibly say the boy but probably not i think it be go forever and he go to he seat the next thing be to call for new member miss laura get up and say she would like to join they band of mercy i follow she up to the platform while they pin a little badge on she and every one laugh at I then they sing god bless we native land and the president tell we that we might all go home it seem to I a lovely thing for those child to meet together to talk about kindness to animal they all have bright and good face and many of they stop to pat I as i come out one little girl give I a biscuit from she school bag mr wood wait at the door till mr maxwell come limp out on he crutch she introduce he to miss laura and ask he if he would not go and take tea with they he say he would be very happy to do so and then mr wood laugh and ask he if he have not better empty he pocket first she do not want a little toad jump over she tea table as one do the last time he be there \* \* \* \* \* chapter xxi mr maxwell and mr harry mr maxwell wear a coat with loose pocket and while she be speak he rest on he crutch and begin to slap they with he hand no there be nothing here to-day he say i think i empty my pocket before i go to the meeting just as he say that there be a loud squeal : oh my guinea pig he exclaim i forget he and he pull out a little spotted creature a few inch long poor derry do i hurt you and he soothe it very tenderly i stand and look at mr maxwell for i have never see any one like he he have thick curly hair and a white face and he look just like a girl while i be stare at he something peep up out of one of he pocket and run out its tongue at I so fast that i could scarcely see it and then draw back again i be thunderstruck i have never see such a creature before it be long and thin like a boy 's cane and of a bright green color like grass and it have queer shiny eye but its tongue be the strangest part of it it come and go like lightning i be uneasy about it and begin to bark what be the matter joe say mr wood the pig will not hurt you but it be not the pig i be afraid of and i keep on bark and all the time that strange live thing keep stick up its head and put out its tongue at I and neither of they notice it its get on toward six say mr wood we must be go home come mr maxwell the young man put the guinea pig in he pocket pick up he crutch and we start down the sunny village street he leave he guinea pig at he board house as he go by but he say nothing about the other creature so i know he do not know it be there i be very much take with mr maxwell he seem so bright and happy in spite of he lameness which keep he from run about like other young man he look a little older than miss laura and one day a week or two later when they be sit on the veranda i hear he tell she that he be just nineteen he tell she too that he lameness make he love animal they never laugh at he or slight he or get impatient because he could not walk quickly they be always good to he and he say he love all animal while he like very few people on this day as he be limp along he say to mr wood : i be get more absent-minded every day have you hear of my latest escapade no she say i be glad he reply i be afraid that it would be all over the village by this time i go to church last Sunday with my poor guinea pig in my pocket he have not be well and i be attend to he before church and put he in there to get warm and forget about he unfortunately i be late and the back seat be all full so i have to sit farther up than i usually do during the first hymn i happen to strike piggy against the side of the seat such a ear-splitting squeal as he set up it sound as if i be murder he the people stare and stare and i have to leave the church overwhelm with confusion mr wood and miss laura laugh and then they get talk about other matter that be not interesting to I so i do not listen but i keep close to miss laura for i be afraid that green thing might hurt she i wonder very much what its name be i do not think i should have fear it so much if i have know what it be there be something the matter with joe say miss laura when we get into the lane what be it dear old fellow she put down she little hand and i lick it and wish so much that i could speak sometimes i wish very much that i have the gift of speech and then at other time i see how little it would profit I and how many foolish thing i should often say and i do not believe human being would love animal as well if they could speak when we reach the house we get a joyful surprise there be a trunk standing on the veranda and as soon as mr wood see it she give a little shriek : my dear boy mr harry be there sure enough and step out through the open door he take he mother in he arm and kiss she then he shake hand with miss laura and mr maxwell who seem to be a old friend of he they all sit down on the veranda and talk and i lay at miss laura 's foot and look at mr harry he be such a handsome young man and have such a noble face he be older and graver look than when i see he last and he have a light brown moustache that he do not have when he be in fairport he seem very fond of he mother and of miss laura and however grave he face might be when he be look at mr maxwell it always light up when he turn to they what dog be that he say at last with a puzzle face and point to I why harry exclaimed miss laura do not you know beautiful joe that you rescue from that wretched milkman be it possible he say that this well-conditioned creature be the bundle of dirty skin and bone that we nurse in fairport come here sir do you remember I indeed i do remember he and i lick he hand and look up gratefully into he face you be almost handsome now he say caress I with a firm kind hand and of a solid build too you look like a fighter -- but i suppose you would not let he fight even if he want to laura and he smile and glance at she no she say i do not think i should but he can fight when the occasion require it and she tell he about we night with jenkin all the time she be speak mr harry hold I by the paw and stroke my body over and over again when she finish he put he head down to I and murmur good dog and i see that he eye be red and shine that be a capital story we must have it at the band of mercy say mr maxwell mr wood have go to help prepare the tea so the two young man be alone with miss laura when they have do talk about I she ask mr harry a number of question about he college life and he trip to new york for he have not be study all the time that he be away what be you go to do with yourself gray when you college course be end ask mr maxwell i be go to settle right down here say mr harry what be a farmer ask he friend yes why not nothing only i imagine that you would take a profession the profession be overstock and we have not farmer enough for the good of the country there be nothing like farm to my mind in no other employment have you a surer living i do not like the city the heat and dust and crowd of people and building overtop one another and the rush of live take my breath away suppose i do go to a city i would sell out my share of the farm and have a few thousand dollar you know i be not a intellectual giant i would never distinguish myself in any profession i would be a poor lawyer or doctor living in a back street all the day of my life and never watch a tree or flower grow or tend a animal or have a drive unless i pay for it no thank you i agree with president eliot of harvard he say scarcely one person in ten thousand betters himself permanently by leave he rural home and settle in a city if one be a millionaire city life be agreeable enough for one can always get away from it but i be begin to think that it be a dangerous thing in more way than one to be a millionaire i believe the safety of the country lie in the hand of the farmer for they be seldom very poor or very rich we stand between the two dangerous class -- the wealthy and the pauper but most farmer lead such a dog 's life say mr maxwell so they do farm be not make one-half as attractive as it should be say mr harry mr maxwell smile attractive farm just sketch a outline of that will you gray in the first place say mr harry i would like to tear out of the heart of the farmer the thing that be as firmly implant in he as it be in the heart of he city brother -- the thing that be do more to harm we nation than anything else under the sun what be that ask mr maxwell curiously the thirst for gold the farmer want to get rich and he work so hard to do it that he wear himself out soul and body and the young people around he get so disgusted with that way of get rich that they go off to the city to find out some other way or at least to enjoy themselves for i do not think many young people be animated by a desire to heap up money mr maxwell look amuse there be certainly a great exodus from country place cityward he say what would be you plan for check it i would make the farm so pleasant that you could not hire the boy and girl to leave it i would have they work and work hard too but when they work be over i would let they have some fun that be what they go to the city for they want amusement and society and to get into some kind of a crowd when they work be do the young man and young woman want to get together as be only natural now that could be do in the country if farmer would be contented with smaller profit and smaller farm they house could be nearer together they child would have opportunity of social intercourse there could be society and club and that would tend to a distribution of literature a farmer ought to take five or six papers and two or three magazine he would find it would pay he in the long run and there ought to be a law make compelling he to go to the post office once a day mr maxwell burst out laughing and another to make he mend he road as well as mend he way i tell you gray the bad road would put a end to all these fine scheme of yours imagine farmer call on each other on a dark evening after a spring freshet i can see they mire and bog and the house a mile ahead of they that be true say mr harry the road question be a serious one do you know how father and i settle it no say mr maxwell we get so tired of the whole business and the farmer around here spend so much time in discuss the art of roadmaking as to whether it should be view from the engineering point of view or the farmer ' practical point of view and whether we would require this number of stump extractor or that number and how many shovel and crusher and ditcher would be necessary to keep we road in order and so on that we simply withdraw we keep we own road in order once a year father get a gang of man and tackle every section of the road that border upon we land and we road be the best around here i wish the government would take up this matter of make road and settle it if we have good smooth country road such as they have in some part of europe we would be able to travel comfortably over they all through the year and we draught animal would last longer for they would not have to expend so much energy in draw they load \* \* \* \* \* chapter xxii what happen at the tea table from my station under miss laura 's chair i could see that all the time mr harry be speak mr maxwell although he speak rather as if he be laugh at he be yet glance at he admiringly when mr harry be silent he exclaim you be right you be right gray with you smooth highway and plenty of school and church and library and meeting for young people you would make country life a paradise and i tell you what you would do too you would empty the slum of the city it be the slowness and dullness of country life and not they poverty alone that keep the poor in dirty lane and tenement house they want stir and amusement too poor soul when they day 's work be over i believe they would come to the country if it be make more pleasant for they that be another question say mr harry a burning question in my mind -- the labor and capital one when i be in new york maxwell i be in a hospital and see a number of man who have be day laborer some of they be old and feeble and other be young man break down in the prime of life they limb be shrunken and draw they have be digging in the earth and work on high building and confine in dingy basement and have do all kind of hard labor for other man they have give they life and strength for other and this be the end of it -- to die poor and forsake i look at they and they remind I of the martyr of old ground down live from hand to mouth separate from they family in many case -- they have have a bitter lot they have never have a chance to get away from they fate and have to work till they drop i tell you there be something wrong we do not do enough for the people that slave and toil for we we should take better care of they we should not herd they together like cattle and when we get rich we should carry they along with we and give they a part of we gain for without they we would be as poor as they be good harry -- i be with you there say a voice behind he and look around we see mr wood standing in the doorway gaze down proudly at he step-son mr harry smile and get up say will not you have my chair sir no thank you you mother wish we to come to tea there be muffin and you know they will not improve with keep they all go to the dining-room and i follow they on the way mr wood say right on top of that talk of yours harry i have get to tell you of another person who be go to boston to live who be it say mr harry lazy dan wilson i have be to see he this afternoon you know he wife be sick and they be half starve he say he be go to the city for he hate to chop wood and work and he think maybe he 'll get some light job there mr harry look grave and mr maxwell say he will starve that be what he will do precisely say mr wood spread out he hard brown hand as he sit down at the table i do not know why it be but the present generation have a marvelous way of skim around any kind of work with they hand they 'll work they brain till they have not get any more backbone than a caterpillar but as for manual labor it be old-timey and out of fashion i wonder how these farm would ever have be carve out of the backwoods if the old puritan have sit down on the rock with they nose in a lot of book and try to figure out just how little work they could do and yet exist now father say mr wood you be try to insinuate that the present generation be lazy and i be sure it be not look at harry he work as hard as you do be not that like a woman say mr wood with a good-natured laugh the present generation consist of she son and the past of she husband i do not think all we young people be lazy hattie but how in creation unless the lord rain down a few farmer be we go to support all we young lawyer and doctor they say the world be get healthier and better but we have get to fight a little more and raise some more criminal and we have get to take to eat pie and doughnut for breakfast again or some of we young sprout from the college will go a beg you do not mean to undervalue the advantage of a good education do you mr wood say mr maxwell no no look at harry there be not he peg away at he study with my hearty approval and he be go to be nothing but a plain common farmer but he 'll be a better one than i have be though because he be get a trained mind i find that out when he be a lad go to the village school he have lay out he little garden by geometry and dig he ditch by algebra education 's a help to any man what i be try to get at be this that in some way or other we be run more to brain and less to hard work than we forefather do mr wood be beat on the table with he forefinger while he talk and every one be laugh at he when you have quite finish speechifying john say mr wood perhaps you 'll serve the berry and pass the cream and sugar do you get yellow cream like this in the village mr maxwell no mr wood he say ours be a much paler yellow and then there be a great tinkling of china and passing of dish and talk and laugh and no one notice that i be not in my usual place in the hall i could not get over my dread of the green creature and i have creep under the table so that if it come out and frightened miss laura i could jump up and catch it when tea be half over she give a little cry i spring up on she lap and there glide over the table toward she be the wicked-looking green thing i step on the table and have it by the middle before it could get to she my hind leg be in a dish of jelly and my front one be in a plate of cake and i be very uncomfortable the tail of the green thing hang in a milk pitcher and its tongue be still go at I but i hold it firmly and stand quite still drop it drop it cry miss laura in tone of distress and mr maxwell strike I on the back so i let the thing go and stand sheepishly look about I mr wood be lean back in he chair laugh with all he might and mr wood be stare at she untidy table with rather a long face miss laura tell I to jump on the floor and then she help she aunt to take the spoil thing off the table i feel that i have do wrong so i slunk out into the hall mr maxwell be sit on the lounge tear he handkerchief in strip and tie they around the creature where my tooth have stick in i have be careful not to hurt it much for i know it be a pet of he but he do not know that and scowl at I say : you rascal you have hurt my poor snake terribly i feel so badly to hear this that i go and stand with my head in a corner i have almost rather be whip than scold after a while mr maxwell go back into the room and they all go on with they tea i could hear mr wood 's loud cheery voice the dog do quite right a snake be mostly a poisonous creature and he instinct tell he to protect he mistress where be he joe joe i would not move till miss laura come and speak to I dear old dog she whisper you know the snake be there all the time do not you she word make I feel better and i follow she to the dining room where mr wood make I sit beside he and eat scrap from he hand all through the meal mr maxwell have get over he ill humor and be chat in a lively way good joe he say i be cross to you and i beg you pardon it always rile I to have any of my pet injure you do not know my poor snake be only after something to eat mr wood have pin he in my pocket so he will not come out again do you know where i get that snake mr wood no she say you never tell I it be across the river by blue ridge he say one day last summer i be out rowing and get very hot tie my boat in the shade of a big tree some village boy be in the wood and hear a great noise i go to see what it be all about they be band of mercy boy and find a country boy beat a snake to death they be remonstrate with he for he cruelty tell he that some kind of snake be a help to the farmer and destroy large number of field mouse and other vermin the boy be obstinate he have find the snake and he insist upon he right to kill it and they be have rather a lively time when i appear i persuade they to make the snake over to I apparently it be already dead thinking it might revive i put it on some grass in the bow of the boat it lay there motionless for a long time and i pick up my oar and start for home i have get half way across the river when i turn around and see that the snake be go it have just drop into the water and be swim toward the bank we have leave i turn and follow it it swim slowly and with evident pain lift its head every few seconds high above the water to see which way it be go on reach the bank it coil itself up throw up blood and water i take it up carefully carry it home and nurse it it soon get better and have be a pet of mine ever since after tea be over and mr wood and miss laura have help adele finish the work they all gather in the parlor the day have be quite warm but now a cool wind have spring up and mr wood say that it be blow up rain mr wood say that she think a fire would be pleasant so they light the stick of wood in the open grate and all sit round the blaze fire mr maxwell try to get I to make friend with the little snake that he hold in he hand toward the blaze and now that i know that it be harmless i be not afraid of it but it do not like I and put out its funny little tongue whenever i look at it by-and-by the rain begin to strike against the window and mr maxwell say this be just the night for a story tell we something out of you experience will not you mr wood what shall i tell you he say good-humoredly he be sit between he wife and mr harry and have he hand on mr harry 's knee something about animal say mr maxwell we seem to be on that subject to-day well say mr wood i 'll talk about something that have be run in my head for many a day there be a good deal of talk nowadays about kindness to domestic animal but i do not hear much about kindness to wild one the same creator form they both i do not see why you should not protect one as well as the other i have no more right to torture a bear than a cow we wild animal around here be get pretty well kill off but there be lot in other place i use to be fond of hunting when i be a boy but i have get rather disgust with kill these late year and unless the wild creature run in we street i would lift no hand to they shall i tell you some of the sport we have when i be a youngster yes yes they all exclaim \* \* \* \* \* chapter xxiii trapping wild animal well mr wood begin i be bring up as you all know in the eastern part of maine and we often use to go over into new brunswick for we sport moose be we best game do you ever see one laura no uncle she say well when i be a boy there be no more beautiful sight to I in the world than a moose with he dusky hide and long leg and branch antler and shoulder stand higher than a horse 's they leg be so long that they can not eat close to the ground they browse on the top of plant and the tender shoot and leave of tree they walk among the thick underbrush carry they horn adroitly to prevent they catch in the branch and they step so well and aim so true that you 'll scarcely hear a twig fall as they go they be a timid creature except at time then they 'll attack with hoof and antler whatever come in they way they hate mosquito and when they be torment by they it be just as well to be careful about approach they like all other creature the lord have put into they a wonderful amount of sense and when a female moose have she one or two fawn she go into the deepest part of the forest or swim to island in large lake till they be able to look out for themselves well we use to like to catch a moose and we have different way of do it one way be to snare they we ' d make a loop in a rope and hide it on the ground under the dead leaf in one of they path this be connect with a young sapling whose top be bent down when the moose step on the loop it would release the sapling and up it would bind catch he by the leg these snare be always set deep in the wood and we could not visit they very often sometimes the moose would be there for day rage and tear around and scratch the skin off he leg that be cruel i would not catch a moose in that way now for a hundred dollar another way be to hunt they on snow shoe with dog in February and march the snow be deep and would carry man and dog moose do not go together in herd in the summer they wander about over the forest and in the autumn they come together in small group and select a hundred or two of acre where there be plenty of heavy undergrowth and to which they usually confine themselves they do this so that they track will not tell they enemy where they be any of these place where there be several moose we call a moose yard we go through the wood till we get on to the track of some of the animal belong to it then the dog smell they and go ahead to start they if i shut my eye now i can see one of we moose hunt the moose run and plunge through the snow crust and occasionally rise up and striking at the dog that hang on to he bleed flank and leg the hunter ' rifle go crack crack crack sometimes kill or wound dog as well as moose that too be cruel two other way we have of hunting moose : call and stalk the calling be do in this way : we take a bit of birch bark and roll it up in the shape of a horn we take this horn and start out either on a bright moonlight night or just at evening or early in the morning the man who carry the horn hide himself and then begin to make a low sound like a female moose he have to do it pretty well to deceive they away in the distance some moose would hear it and with answer grunt would start off to come to it if a young male moose be come he would mind he step i can assure you on account of fear of the old one but if it be a old fellow you would hear he step out bravely and rap he horn against the tree and plunge into any water that come in he way when he get pretty near he would stop to listen and then the caller have to be very careful and put he trumpet down close to the ground so as to make a lower sound if the moose feel doubtful he would turn if not he would come on and unlucky for he if he do for he get a warm reception either from the rifle in we hand as we lay hide near the caller or from some of the party station at a distance in stalk we creep on they the way a cat creep on a mouse in the daytime a moose be usually lie down we would find they track and place where they would be nip off the end of branch and twig and follow they up they easily take the scent of man and we would have to keep well to the leeward sometimes we would come upon they lie down but if in walk along we would break a twig or make the slightest noise they would think it be one of they mortal enemy a bear -- creep on they and they would be up and away they sense of hearing be very keen but they be not so quick to see a fox be like that too he eye be not equal to he nose stalk be the most merciful way to kill a moose then they have not the fright and suffering of the chase i do not see why they need to be kill at all say mr wood if i know that forest back of the mountain be full of wild creature i think i would be glad of it and not want to hunt they that be if they be harmless and beautiful creature like the deer you be a woman say mr wood and woman be more merciful than man man want to kill and slay they be like the englishman who say : ` what a fine day it be let 's go out and kill something ' please tell we some more about the dog that help you catch the moose uncle say miss laura i be sit up very straight beside she listen to every word mr wood say and she be fondle my head well laura when we camp out on the snow and sleep on spruce bough while we be after the moose the dog use to be a great comfort to we they sleep at we foot and keep we warm poor brute they mostly have a rough time of it they enjoy the run and chase as much as we do but when it come to broken rib and sore head it be another matter then the porcupine bother they we dog would never learn to let they alone if they be go through the wood where there be no sign of moose and find a porcupine they would kill it the quill would get in they mouth and neck and chest and we would have to gag they and take bullet mold or nipper or whatever we have sometimes we jack-knife and pull out the nasty thing if we get hold of the dog at once we could pull out the quill with we finger sometimes the quill have work in and the dog would go home and lie by the fire with run sore till they work out i have see quill work right through dog go in on one side and come out on the other poor brute say mr wood i wonder you take they we once lose a valuable hound while moose hunting say mr wood the moose strike he with he hoof and the dog be terribly injure and lay in the wood for day till a neighbor of ours who be look for timber find he and bring he home on he shoulder be not there rejoice among we boy to see old lion come back we take care of he and he get well again it be good sport to see the dog when we be hunting a bear with they bear be good runner and when dog get after they there be great skirmishing they nip the bear behind and when they turn the dog run like mad for a hug from a bear mean sure death to a dog if they get a slap from he paw over they would go dog new to the business be often kill by the bear be there many bear near you home mr wood ask mr maxwell lot of they more than we want they use to bother we fearfully about we sheep and cattle i have often have to get up in the night and run out to the cattle the bear would come out of the wood and jump on to the young heifer and cow and strike they and beat they down and the cattle would roar as if the evil one have they if the cattle be too far away from the house for we to hear they the bear would worry they till they be dead as for the sheep they never make any resistance they would meekly run in a corner when they see a bear come and huddle together and he would strike at they and scratch they with he claw and perhaps wind a dozen before he get one firmly then he would seize it in he paw and walk off on he hind leg over fence and anything else that come in he way till he come to a nice retired spot and there he ' d sit down and skin that sheep just like a butcher he would gorge himself with the meat and in the morning we would find the other sheep that he would tear and we would vow vengeance against that bear he would be almost sure to come back for more so for a while after that we always put the sheep in the barn at night and set a trap by the remains of the one he have eat everybody hate bear and have not much pity for they still they be only get they meat as other wild animal do and we would no right to set such cruel trap for they as the steel one they have a clog attach to they and have long sharp tooth we put they on the ground and strew leave over they and hang up some of the carcass leave by the bear near by when he attempt to get this meat he would tread on the trap and the tooth would spring together and catch he by the leg they always fight to get free i once see a bear that have be make a desperate effort to get away he leg be break the skin and flesh be all tear away and he be hold by the tendon it be a foreleg that be catch and he would put he hind foot against the jaw of the trap and then draw by press with he foot till he would stretch those tendon to they utmost extent i have know they to work away till they really pull these tendon out of the foot and get off it be a great event in we neighborhood when a bear be catch whoever catch he blow a horn and the man and boy come troop together to see the sight i have know they to blow that horn on a Sunday morning and i have see the man turn they back on the meeting house to go and see the bear be there no more merciful way of catch they than by this trap ask miss laura oh yes by the deadfall -- that be by drive heavy stick into the ground and make a box-like place open on one side where two log be so arrange with other heavy log upon they that when the bear seize the bait the upper log fall down and crush he to death another way be to fix a bait in a certain place with cord tie to it which cord be fasten to trigger of gun place at a little distance when the bear take the bait the gun go off and he shoot himself sometimes it take a good many bullet to kill they i remember one old fellow that we put eleven into before he keel over it be one fall over on pike 's hill the snow have come earlier than usual and this old bear have not get into he den for he winter 's sleep a lot of we start out after he the hill be cover with beech tree and he would be live all the fall on the nut till he would get as fat as butter we take dog and worried he and run he from one place to another and shoot at he till at last he drop we take he meat home and have he skin tan for a sleigh robe one day i be in the wood and look through the tree espy a bear he be stand up on he hind leg snuff in every direction and just about the time i espy he he espy I i have no dog and no gun so i think i have better be get home to my dinner i be a small boy then and the bear probably think i would be a mouthful for he anyway begin to come after I in a leisurely way i can see myself now go through those wood -- hat go jacket fly arm out eye roll over my shoulder every little while to see if the bear be gain on I he be a benevolent-looking old fellow and he face seem to say ` do not hurry little boy ' he be not do he prettiest and i soon get away from he but i make up my mind then that it be more fun to be the chaser than the chase another time i be out in we cornfield and hear a rustling look through the stalk and see a brown bear with two cub she be slash down the corn with she paw to get at the ear she smell I and get frightened begin to run i have a dog with I this time and shout and rap on the fence and set he on she he jump up and snap at she flank and every few instant she would turn and give he a cuff that would send he yard away i follow she up and just back of the farm she and she cub take into a tree i send my dog home and my father and some of the neighbor come it have get dark by this time so we build a fire under the tree and watch all night and tell story to keep each other awake toward morning we get sleepy and the fire burnt low and do not that old bear and one cub drop right down among we and start off to the wood that wake we up we build up the fire and keep watch so that the one cub still in the tree could not get away until daylight the mother bear hang around call to the cub to come down do you let it go uncle ask miss laura no my dear we shoot it how cruel cry mr wood yes be not we brute say she husband but there be some excuse for we hattie the bear ruin we farm this kind of hunting that hunt and kill for the mere sake of slaughter be very different from that i 'll tell you what i have no patience with and that be with these english folk that dress themselves up and take fine horse and pack of dog and tear over the country after one little fox or rabbit bah it be contemptible now if they be hunting cruel man-eating tiger or animal that destroy property it would be a different thing \* \* \* \* \* chapter xxiv the rabbit and the hen you have fox up in maine i suppose mr wood have not you ask mr maxwell heap of they i always want to laugh when i think of we fox for they be so cute never a fox do i catch in a trap though i would set many a one i would take the carcass of some creature that have die a sheep for instance and put it in a field near the wood and the fox would come and eat it after they get accustom to come and eat and no harm befall they they would be unsuspecting so just before a snowstorm i would take a trap and put it in this spot i would handle it with glove and i would smoke it and rub fir bough on it to take away the human smell and then the snow would come and cover it up and yet those fox would know it be a trap and walk all around it it be a wonderful thing that sense of smell in animal if it be a sense of smell joe here have get a good bit of it what kind of trap be they father ask mr harry cruel one -- steel one they would catch a animal by the leg and sometimes break the bone the leg would bleed and below the jaw of he trap it would freeze there be no circulation of the blood those steel trap be a abomination the people around here use one make on the same principle for catch rat i would not have they on my place for any money i believe we have get to give a account for all the unnecessary suffering we put on animal you 'll have some to answer for john accord to you own story say mr wood i have suffer already he say many a night i have lie on my bed and groan when i thought of needless cruelty i would put upon animal when i be a young unthinking boy -- and i be pretty carefully bring up too accord to we light in those day i often think that if i be cruel with all the instruction i have to be merciful what can be expect of the child that get no good teaching at all when they be young tell we some more about the fox mr wood say mr maxwell well we use to have rare sport hunting they with fox-hound i would often go off for the day with my hound sometimes in the early morning they would find a track in the snow the leader for scent would go back and forth to find out which way the fox be go i can see he now all the time that he run now one way and now another on the track of the fox he be silent but keep he tail aloft wag it as a signal to the hound behind he be leader in scent but he do not like bloody dangerous fight by-and-by he would decide which way the fox have go then he tail still keep high in the air would wag more violently the rest follow he in single file go pretty slow so as to enable we to keep up to they by-and-by they would come to a place where the fox be sleep for the day as soon as he be disturb he would leave he bed under some thick fir or spruce branch near the ground this fling he fresh scent into the air as soon as the hound sniff it they give tongue in good earnest it be a mixed deep bay that make the blood quicken in my vein while in the excitement of he first fright the fox would run fast for a mile or two till he find it a easy matter to keep out of the way of the hound then he cunning creature would begin to bother they he would mount to the top pole of the worm fence divide the field from the wood he could trot along here quite a distance and then make a long jump into the wood the hound would come up but could not walk the fence and they would have difficulty in find where the fox have leave it then we see generalship the hound scatter in all direction and make long detour into the wood and field as soon as the track be lose they cease to bay but the instant a hound find it again he bay to give the signal to the other all would hurry to the spot and off they would go bay as they go then mr fox would try a new trick he would climb a lean tree and then jump to the ground this trick would soon be find out then he would try another he would make a circle of a quarter of a mile in circumference by make a loop in he course he would come in behind the hound and puzzle they between the scent of he first and following track if the snow be deep the hound have make a good track for he over this he could run easily and they would have to feel they way along for after he have go around the circle a few time he would jump from the beaten path as far as he could and make off to other cover in a straight line before this be do it be my plan to get near the circle take care to approach it on the leeward side if the fox get a sniff of human scent he would leave he circle very quickly and make track fast to be out of danger by the baying of the hound the circle in which the race be keep up could be easily know the last run to get near enough to shoot have to be do when the hound ' baying come from the side of the circle nearest to I for then the fox would be on the opposite side farthest away as soon as i get near enough to see the hound when they pass i stop when they get on the opposite side i then keep a bright lookout for the fox sometimes when the brush be thick the sight of he would be indistinct the shooting have to be quick as soon as the report of the gun be hear the hound cease to bay and make for the spot if the fox be dead they enjoy the scent of he blood if only wound they go after he with all speed sometimes he be overtake and kill and sometimes he get into he burrow in the earth or in a hollow log or among the rock one day i remember when i be stand on the outside of the circle the fox come in sight i fire he give a shrill bark and come toward I then he stop in the snow and fall dead in he track i be a pretty good shot in those day poor little fox say miss laura i wish you have let he get away here be one that nearly get away say mr wood one winter 's day i be chase he with the hound there be a crust on the snow and the fox be light while the dog be heavy they run along the fox trot nimbly on the top of the crust and the dog break through and every few minute that fox would stop and sit down to look at the dog they be in a fury and the wickedness of the fox in tease they make I laugh so much that i be very unwilling to shoot he you say you steel trap be cruel thing uncle say miss laura why do not you have a deadfall for the fox as you have for the bear they be too cunning to go into deadfall there be a better way to catch they though fox hate water and never go into it unless they be oblige to so we use to find a place where a tree have fall across a river and make a bridge for they to go back and forth on here we set snare with spring pole that would throw they into the river when they make struggle to get free and drown they do you ever hear of the fox laura that want to cross a river and lay down on the bank pretend that he be dead and a countryman come along and think he have a prize throw he in he boat and row across when the fox get up and run away now uncle say miss laura you be laugh at I that could not be true no no say mr wood chuckle but they be mighty cute at pretend they be dead i once shoot one in the morning carry he a long way on my shoulder and start to skin he in the afternoon when he turn around and bit I enough to draw blood at another time i dig one out of a hole in the ground he feign death i take he up and throw he down at some distance and he jump up and run into the wood what other animal do you catch when you be a boy ask mr maxwell oh a number otter and beaver -- we catch they in deadfall and in steel trap the mink we usually take in deadfall smaller of course than the one we use for the bear the musk-rat we catch in box trap like a mouse trap the wild-cat we run down like the ` loup cervier ' -- what kind of a animal be that ask mr maxwell it be a lynx belong to the cat species they use to prowl about the country kill hen goose and sometimes sheep they would fix they tush in the sheep 's neck and suck the blood they do not think much of the sheep 's flesh we run they down with dog they would often run up tree and we would shoot they then there be rabbit that we catch mostly in snare for musk-rat we would put a parsnip or a apple on the spindle of a box trap when we snare a rabbit i always want to find it catch around the neck and strangle to death if they get half through the snare and be catch around the body or by the hind leg they would live for some time and they would cry just like a child i like shoot they better just because i hate to hear they pitiful cry it be a bad business this of kill dumb creature and the older i get the more chicken-hearted i be about it chicken-hearted -- i should think you be say mr wood do you know laura he will not even kill a fowl for dinner he give it to one of the man to do bless be the merciful say miss laura throw she arm over she uncle 's shoulder i love you dear uncle john because you be so kind to every living thing i be go to be kind to you now say she uncle and send you to bed you look tired very well she say with a smile then bid they all good-night she go upstairs mr wood turn to mr maxwell you be go to stay all night with we be not you so mr wood say reply the young man with a smile of course she say i could not think of let you go back to the village such a night as this it be rain cat and dog -- but i must not say that or there 'll be no get you to stay i 'll go and prepare you old room next to harry 's and she bustle away the two young man go to the pantry for doughnut and milk and mr wood stand gaze down at I good dog he say you look as if you sense that talk to-night come get a bone and then away to bed he give I a very large mutton bone and i hold it in my mouth and watch he open the woodsh door i love human being and the saddest time of day for I be when i have to be separate from they while they sleep now go to bed and rest well beautiful joe say mr wood and if you hear any stranger round the house run out and bark do not be chase wild animal in you sleep though they say a dog be the only animal that dream i wonder whether it be true then he go into the house and shut the door i have a sheepskin to lie on and a very good bed it make i sleep soundly for a long time then i wake up and find that instead of rain pattering against the roof and darkness everywhere it be quite light the rain be over and the moon be shine beautifully i run to the door and look out it be almost as light as day the moon make it very bright all around the house and farm building and i could look all about and see that there be no one stir i take a turn around the yard and walk around to the side of the house to glance up at miss laura 's window i always do this several time through the night just to see if she be quite safe i be on my way back to my bed when i see two small white thing move away down the lane i stand on the veranda and watch they when they get nearer i see that there be a white rabbit hop up the road follow by a white hen it seem to I a very strange thing for these creature to be out this time of night and why be they come to dingley farm this be not they home i run down on the road and stand in front of they just as soon as the hen see I she flutter in front of the rabbit and spread out she wing cluck angrily and act as if she would peck my eye out if i come nearer i see that they be harmless creature and remember my adventure with the snake i step aside besides that i know by they smell that they have be near mr maxwell so perhaps they be after he they understand quite well that i would not hurt they and pass by I the rabbit go ahead again and the hen fall behind it seem to I that the hen be sleepy and do not like to be out so late at night and be only follow the rabbit because she think it be she duty he be go along in a very queer fashion put he nose to the ground and rise up on he hind leg and sniff the air first on this side and then on the other and he nose go go all the time he smell all around the house till he come to mr maxwell 's room at the back it open on the veranda by a glass door and the door stand ajar the rabbit squeeze himself in and the hen stay out she watch for a while and when he do not come back she fly upon the back of a chair that stand near the door and put she head under she wing i go back to my bed for i know they would do no harm early in the morning when i be walk around the house i hear a great shouting and laugh from mr maxwell 's room he and mr harry have just discover the hen and the rabbit and mr harry be call he mother to come and look at they the rabbit have sleep on the foot of the bed mr harry be chaff mr maxwell very much and be tell he that any one who entertain he be in for a travel menagerie they have a great deal of fun over it and mr maxwell say that he have have that pretty white hen as a pet for a long time in boston once when she ha $ some little chicken a frightened rabbit that be be chase by a dog run into the yard in he terror he get right under the hen 's wing and she sheltered he and peck at the dog 's eye and keep he off till help come the rabbit belong to a neighbor 's boy and mr maxwell buy it from he from the day the hen protect he she become he friend and follow he everywhere i do not wonder that the rabbit want to see he master there be something about that young man that make dumb animal just delight in he when mr wood mention this to he he say i do not know why they should -- i do not do anything to fascinate they you love they she say and they know it that be the reason \* \* \* \* \* chapter xxv a happy horse for a good while after i go to dingley farm i be very shy of the horse for i be afraid they might kick I think that i be a bad dog like bruno however they all have such good face and look at I so kindly that i be begin to get over my fear of they fleetfoot mr harry 's colt be my favorite and one afternoon when mr harry and miss laura be go out to see he i follow they fleetfoot be amusing himself by roll over and over on the grass under a tree but when he see mr harry he give a shrill whinny and run to he begin nose about he pocket wait a bit say mr harry hold he by the forelock let I introduce you to this young lady miss laura morris i want you to make she a bow he give the colt some sign and immediately he begin to paw the ground and shake he head mr harry laugh and go on : here be she dog joe i want you to like he too come here joe i be not at all afraid for i know mr harry would not let he hurt I so i stand in front of he and for the first time have a good look at he they call he the colt but he be really a full-grown horse and have already be put to work he be of a dark chestnut color and have a well-shaped body and a long handsome head and i never see in the head of a man or beast a more beautiful pair of eye than that colt have -- large full brown eye they be that he turn on I almost as a person would he look I all over as if to say : be you a good dog and will you treat I kindly or be you a bad one like bruno and will you chase I and snap at my heel and worry I so that i shall want to kick you i look at he very earnestly and wag my body and lift myself on my hind leg toward he he seem pleased and put down he nose to sniff at I and then we be friend friend and such good friend for next to jim and billy i have love fleetfoot mr harry pull some lump of sugar out of he pocket and give they to miss laura tell she to put they on the palm of she hand and hold it out flat toward fleetfoot the colt eat the sugar and all the time eye she with he quiet observe glance that make she exclaim : what a wise-looking colt he be like a old horse say mr harry when he hear a sudden noise he stop and look all about he to find a explanation he have be well train say miss laura i have bring he up carefully say mr harry really he have be treat more like a dog than a colt he follow I about the farm and smell everything i handle and seem to want to know the reason of thing you mother say reply miss laura that she find you both asleep on the lawn one day last summer and the colt 's head be on you arm mr harry smile and throw he arm over the colt 's neck we have be comrade have not we fleetfoot i have be almost ashamed of he devotion he have follow I to the village and he always want to go fishing with I he be four year old now so he ought to get over those coltish way i have drive he a good deal we be go out in the buggy this afternoon will you come where be you go ask miss laura just for a short drive back of the river to collect some money for father i 'll be home long before tea time yes i should like to go say miss laura i will go to the house and get my other hat come on fleetfoot say mr harry and he lead the way from the pasture the colt follow behind with I i wait about the veranda and in a short time mr harry drive up to the front door the buggy be black and shine and fleetfoot have on a silver-mounted harness that make he look very fine he stand gently switch he long tail to keep the fly away and with he head turn to see who be go to get into the buggy i stand by he and as soon as he see that miss laura and mr harry have seat themselves he act as if he want to be off mr harry speak to he and away he go i race down the lane by he side so happy to think he be my friend he like have I beside he and every few seconds put down he head toward I animal can tell each other thing without say a word when fleetfoot give he head a little toss in a certain way i know that he want to have a race he have a beautiful even gait and go very swiftly mr harry keep speak to he to check he you do not like he to go too fast do you say miss laura no he return i think we could make a racer of he if we like but father and i do not go in for fast horse there be too much say about fast trotter and race horse on some of the farm around here the people have go mad on breed fast horse a old farmer out in the country have a common cart-horse that he suddenly find out have great power of speed and endurance he sell he to a speculator for a big price and it have set everybody wild if the people who give all they time to it can not raise fast horse i do not see how the farmer can a fast horse on a farm be ruination to the boy for it start they racing and bet father say he be go to offer a prize for the fastest walker that can be breed in new hampshire that dutchman of ours heavy as he be be a fair walker and cleve and pacer can each walk four and a half mile a hour why do you lay such stress on they walk fast ask miss laura because so much of the farm work must be do at a walk plough team and draw produce to market and go up and down hill even for the city it be good to have fast walker trot on city pavement be very hard on the dray horse if they be allow to go at a quick walk they leg will keep strong much longer it be shameful the way horse be use up in big city we pavement be so bad that cab horse be use up in three year in many way we be a great deal better off in this new country than the people in europe but we be not in respect of cab horse for in london and paris they last for five year i have see horse drop down dead in new york just from hard usage poor brute there be a better time come for they though when electricity be more fully develop we 'll see some wonderful change as it be last year in different place about thirty thousand horse be release from those abominable horse car by have electricity introduce on the road well fleetfoot do you want another spin all right my boy go ahead away we go again along a bit of level road fleetfoot have no check-rein on he beautiful neck and when he trot he could hold he head in a easy natural position with he wonderful eye and flow mane and tail and he glossy reddish-brown body i think that he be the handsomest horse i have ever see he love to go fast and when mr harry speak to he to slow up again he toss he head with impatience but he be too sweet-tempered to disobey in all the year that i have know fleetfoot i have never once see he refuse to do as he master tell he you have forget you whip have not you harry i hear miss laura say as we jog slowly along and i run by the buggy panting and with my tongue hang out i never use one say mr harry if i see any man lay one on fleetfoot i would knock he down he voice be so severe that i glance up into the buggy he look just as he do the day that he stretch jenkin on the ground and give he a beating i be so glad you do not say miss laura you be like the russian many of they control they horse by they voice and call they such pretty name but you have to use a whip for some horse do not you cousin harry yes laura there be many vicious horse that can not be control otherwise and then with many horse one require a whip in case of necessity for urge they forward i suppose fleetfoot never balk say miss laura no reply mr harry dutchman sometimes do and we have two cure for he both equally good we take up a forefoot and strike he shoe two or three time with a stone the operation always interest he greatly and he usually start if he do not go for that we pass a line round he foreleg at the knee joint then go in front of he and draw on the line father will not let the man use a whip unless they be drive to it fleetfoot have have a happy life have not he say miss laura look admiringly at he how do he get to like you so much harry i break he in after a fashion of my own father give he to I and the first time i see he on he foot i go up carefully and put my hand on he he mother be rather shy of I for we have not have she long and it make he shy too so i soon leave he the next time i stroke he the next time i put my arm around he soon he act like a big dog i could lead he about by a strap and i make a little halter and a bridle for he i do not see why i should not train he a little while he be young and manageable i think it be cruel to let colt run till one have to employ severity in master they of course i do not let he do much work colt be like boy -- a boy should not do a man 's work but he have exercise every day and i train he to draw a light cart behind he i use to do all kind of thing to accustom he to unusual sound father talk a good deal to I about rarey the great horse-tamer and it put idea into my head he say he once see rarey come on a stage in boston with a timid horse that he be go to accustom to a loud noise first a bugle be blow then some louder instrument and so on till there be a whole brass band go rarey reassure the animal and it be not afraid you like horse better than any other animal do not you harry ask miss laura i believe i do though i be very fond of that dog of yours i think i know more about horse than dog have you notice scamp very much oh yes i often watch she she be such a amusing little creature she be the most interesting one we have get that be after fleetfoot father get she from a man who could not manage she and she come to we with a legion of bad trick father have take solid comfort though in break she of they she be he pet among we stock i suppose you know that horse more than any other animal be creature of habit if they do a thing once they will do it again when she come to we she have a trick of bite at a person who give she oats she would do it without fail so father put a little stick under he arm and every time she would bite he would give she a rap over the nose she soon get tire of bite and give it up sometimes now you 'll see she make a snap at father as if she be go to bite and then look under he arm to see if the stick be there he cure some of she trick in one way and some in another one bad one she have be to start for the stable the minute one of the trace be unfasten when we be unharness she pull father over once and another time she run the shaft of the sulky clean through the barn door the next time father bring she in he get ready for she he twist the line around he hand and the minute she begin to bolt he give a tremendous jerk that pull she back upon she haunch and shout ` whoa ' it cure she and she never start again till he give she the word often now you 'll see she throw she head back when she be be unhitch he only do it once yet she remember if we would have the training of scamp she would be a very different animal it be nearly all in the bring up of a colt whether it will turn out vicious or gentle if any one be to strike fleetfoot he would not know what it mean he have be bring up differently from scamp she be probably train by some brutal man who inspire she with distrust of the human species she never bite a animal and seem attach to all the other horse she love fleetfoot and cleve and pacer those three be she favorite i love to go for drive with cleve and pacer say miss laura they be so steady and good uncle say they be the most trusty horse he have he have tell I about the man you have who say that those two horse know more than most ` human ' that be old david say mr harry when we have he he be court a widow who live over in hoytville about once a fortnight he would ask father for one of the horse to go over to see she he always stay pretty late and on the way home he would tie the rein to the whip-stock and go to sleep and never wake up till cleve or pacer whichever one he happen to have would draw up in the barnyard they would pass any rig they happen to meet and turn out a little for a man if david be not asleep he could always tell by the difference in they gait which they be pass they would go quickly past a man and much slower with more of a turn out if it be a team but i dare say father tell you this he have a great stock of horse story and i be almost as bad you will have to cry ` halt ' when we bear you you never do reply miss laura i love to talk about animal i think the best story about cleve and pacer be the one that uncle tell I last evening i do not think you be there it be about steal the oats cleve and pacer never steal say mr harry do not you mean scamp she be the thief no it be pacer that steal he get out of he box uncle say and find two bag of oats and he take one in he tooth and drop it before cleve and eat the other himself and uncle be so amuse that he let they eat a long time and stand and watch they that _ be _ a clever trick say mr harry father must have forget to tell I those two horse have be mate ever since i can remember and i believe if they be separate they would pine away and die you have notice how low the partition be between the box in the horse stable father say you would not put a lot of people in separate box in a room where they could not see each other and horse be just as fond of company as we be cleve and pacer be always nose each other a horse have a long memory father have have horse recognize he that he have be part from for twenty year speak of they memory remind I of another good story about pacer that i never hear till yesterday and that i would not talk about to any one but you and mother father would not write I about it for he never will put a line on paper where any one 's reputation be concerned \* \* \* \* \* chapter xxvi the box of money this story say mr harry be about one of the hire man we have last winter whose name be jacob he be a cunning fellow with a hangdog look and a great cleverness at steal farm produce from father on the sly and sell it father know perfectly well what he be do and be wonder what would be the best way to deal with he when one day something happen that bring matter to a climax father have to go to sudbury for farming tool and take pacer and the cutter there be two way of go there -- one the sudbury road and the other the old post road which be longer and seldom use on this occasion father take the post road the snow be not deep and he want to inquire after a old man who have be rob and half frightened to death a few day before he be a miserable old creature know as miser jerrold and he live alone with he daughter he have save a little money that he keep in a box under he bed when father get near the place he be astonish to see by pacer 's action that he have be on this road before and recently too father be so sharp about horse that they never do a thing that he do not attach a meaning to so he let the rein hang a little loose and keep he eye on pacer the horse go along the road and see father do not direct he turn into the lane lead to the house there be a old red gate at the end of it and he stop in front of it and wait for father to get out then he pass through and instead of go up to the house turn around and stand with he head toward the road father never say a word but he be do a lot of think he go into the house and find the old man sit over the fire rub he hand and half-crying about ` the few poor dollar ' that he say he have have steal from he father have never see he before but he know he have the name of be half silly and question he as much as he like he could make nothing of he the daughter say that they have go to bed at dark the night she father be rob she sleep up stair and he down below about ten o'clock she hear he scream and run down stair she find he sit up in bed and the window wide open he say a man have spring in upon he stuff the bedclothes into he mouth and drag he box from under the bed have make off with it she run to the door and look out but there be no one to be see it be dark and snow a little so no trace of footstep be to be perceive in the morning father find that the neighbor be drop in to bear the old man company so he drive on to sudbury and then return home when he get back he say jacob be hang about the stable in a nervous kind of a way and say he want to speak to he father say very good but put the horse in first jacob unhitch and father sit on one of the stable bench and watch he till he come lounge along with a straw in he mouth and say he would make up he mind to go west and he would like to set off at once father say again very good but first he have a little account to settle with he and he take out of he pocket a paper where he have jot down as far as he could every quart of oats and every bag of grain and every quarter of a dollar of market money that jacob have defraud he of father say the fellow turn all the color of the rainbow for he think he have cover up he track so cleverly that he would never be find out then father say ` sit down jacob for i have get to have a long talk with you ' he have he there about a hour and when he finish the fellow be completely break down father tell he that there be just two course in life for a young man to take and he have get on the wrong one he be a young smart fellow and if he turn right around now there be a chance for he if he do not there be nothing but the state 's prison ahead of he for he need not think he be go to gull and cheat all the world and never be find out father say he would give he all the help in he power if he have he word that he would try to be a honest man then he tear up the paper and say there be a end of he indebtedness to he jacob be only a young fellow twenty-three or thereabout and father say he sob like a baby then without look at he father give a account of he afternoon 's drive just as if he be talk to himself he say that pacer never to he knowledge have be on that road before and yet he seem perfectly familiar with it and that he stop and turn already to leave again quickly instead of go up to the door and how he look over he shoulder and start on a run down the lane the minute father 's foot be in the cutter again in the course of he remark father mention the fact that on Monday the evening that the robbery be commit jacob have borrow pacer to go to the junction but have come in with the horse steam and look as if he have be drive a much longer distance than that father say that when he get do jacob have sink down all in a heap on the stable floor with he hand over he face father leave he to have it out with himself and go to the house the next morning jacob look just the same as usual and go about with the other man do he work but say nothing about go west late in the afternoon a farmer go by hail father and ask if he would hear the news old miser jerrold 's box have be leave on he doorstep some time through the night and he would find it in the morning the money be all there but the old fellow be so cute that he would not tell any one how much it be the neighbor have persuade he to bank it and he be come to town the next morning with it and that night some of they be go to help he mount guard over it father tell the man at milk time and he say jacob look as unconscious as possible however from that day there be a change in he he never tell father in so many word that he ' d resolve to be a honest man but he action speak for he he have be a kind of sullen unwilling fellow but now he turn handy and oblige and it be a real trial to father to part with he miss laura be intensely interested in this story where be he now cousin harry she ask eagerly what become of he mr harry laugh in such amusement that i stare up at he and even fleetfoot turn he head around to see what the joke be we be go very slowly up a long steep hill and in the clear still air we could hear every word speak in the buggy the last part of the story be the best to my mind say mr harry and as romantic as even a girl could desire the affair of the steal box be much talk about along sudbury way and miss jerrold get to be consider quite a desirable young person among some of the youth near there though she be a frowsy-headed creature and not as neat in she personal attire as a young girl should be among she suitor be jacob he cut out a blacksmith and a painter and several young farmer and father say he never in he life have such a time to keep a straight face as when jacob come to he this spring and say he be go to marry old miser jerrold 's daughter he want to quit father 's employ and he thank he in a real manly way for the manner in which he have always treat he well jacob left and mother say that father would sit and speculate about he as to whether he have fall in love with eliza jerrold or whether he be determine to regain possession of the box and be go to do it honestly or whether he be sorry for have frighten the old man into a greater degree of imbecility and be marry the girl so that he could take care of he or whether it be something else and so on and so on he have a dozen theory and then mother say he would burst out laughing and say it be one of the cutest trick that he have ever hear of in the end jacob get marry and father and mother go to the wedding father give the bridegroom a yoke of ox and mother give the bride a lot of household linen and i believe they be as happy as the day be long jacob make he wife comb she hair and he wait on the old man as if he be he son and he be improve the farm that be go to rack and ruin and i hear he be go to build a new house harry exclaimed miss laura can not you take I to see they yes indeed mother often drive over to take they little thing and we 'll go too sometime i would like to see jacob myself now that he be a decent fellow strange to say though he have not the best of character no one have ever suspect he of the robbery and he be be cunning enough never to say a word about it father say jacob be like all the rest of we there be mixture of good and evil in he and sometimes one predominate and sometimes the other but we must get on and not talk here all day get up fleetfoot where do you say we be go asked miss laura as we cross the bridge over the river a little way back here in the wood he reply there be a englishman on a small clearing that he call penhollow father loan he some money three year ago and he will not pay either interest or principal i think i have hear of he say miss laura be not he the man whom the boy call lord chesterfield the same one he be a queer specimen of a man father have always stand up for he he have a great liking for the english he say we ought to be as ready to help a englishman as a american for we spring from common stock oh not englishmen only say miss laura warmly chinamen and negro and everybody there ought to be a brotherhood of nation harry yes miss enthusiasm i suppose there ought to be and look up i could see that mr harry be gaze admiringly into he cousin 's face please tell I some more about the englishman say miss laura there be not much to tell he live alone only come occasionally to the village for supplies and though he be poorer than poverty he despise every soul within a ten-mile radius of he and look upon we as no better than a order of thrifty well-trained lower animal why be that ask miss laura in surprise he be a gentleman laura and we be only common people my father can not hand a lady in and out of a carriage as lord chesterfield can nor can he make so grand a bow nor do he put on evening dress for a late dinner and we never go to the opera nor to the theater and know nothing of polite society nor can we tell exactly whom we great-great-grandfather spring from i tell you there be a gulf between we and that englishman wider than the one young curtius leap into miss laura be laugh merrily how funny that sound harry so he despise you and she glance at she good-looking cousin and he handsome buggy and well-kept horse and then burst into another merry peal of laughter mr harry laugh too it do seem absurd sometimes when i pass he jogging along to town in he rickety old cart and look at he pale cruel face and know that he be a broken-down gambler and man of the world and yet consider himself infinitely superior to I -- a young man in the prime of life with a good constitution and happy prospects it make I turn away to hide a smile by this time we have leave the river and the meadow far behind we and be pass through a thick wood the road be narrow and very broken and fleetfoot be oblige to pick he way carefully why do the englishman live in this out-of-the-way place if he be so fond of city life say miss laura i do not know say mr harry father be afraid that he have commit some misdeed and be in hide but we say nothing about it we have not see he for some week and to tell the truth this trip be as much to see what have become of he as to make a demand upon he for the money as he live alone he might lie there ill and no one would know anything about it the last time that we know of he come to the village be to draw quite a sum of money from the bank it annoy father for he say he might take some of it to pay he debt i think he relative in england supply he with fund here we be at the entrance to the mansion of penhollow i must get out and open the gate that will admit we to the wind avenue we have arrive in front of some bar which be lay across a opening in the snake fence that run along one side of the road i sit down and look about it be a strange lonely place the tree almost meet overhead and it be very dim and quiet the sun could only send little straggle beam through the branch there be a muddy pool of water before the bar that mr harry be let down and he get he foot wet in it confound that englishman he say back out of the water and wipe he boot on the grass he have not even gumption enough to throw down a load of stone there drive in laura and i 'll put up the bar fleetfoot take we through the opening and then mr harry jump into the buggy and take up the rein again we have to go very slowly up a narrow rough road the bush scratch and scrape against the buggy and mr harry look very much annoyed no man liveth to himself say miss laura softly this man 's carelessness be give you trouble why do not he cut these branch that overhang the road he can not do it because he abominable laziness will not let he say mr harry i would like to be behind he for a week and i would make he step a little faster we have arrive at last thank goodness there be a small grass clearing in the midst of the wood chip and bit of wood be litter about and across the clearing be a roughly-built house of unpainted board the front door be prop open by a stick some of the pane of glass in the window be break and the whole house have a melancholy dilapidated look i think that i have never see such a sad-looking place it seem as if there be no one about say mr harry with a puzzle face barron must be away will you hold fleetfoot laura while i go and see he draw the buggy up near a small log building that have evidently be use for a stable and i lay down beside it and watch miss laura \* \* \* \* \* chapter xxvii a neglect stable i have not be on the ground more than a few seconds before i turn my eye from miss laura to the log hut it be deathly quiet there be not a sound come from it but the air be full of queer smell and i be so uneasy that i could not lie still there be something the matter with fleetfoot too he be paw the ground and whinnying and look not after mr harry but toward the log building joe say miss laura what be the matter with you and fleetfoot why do not you stand still be there any stranger about and she peer out of the buggy i know there be something wrong somewhere but i do not know what it be so i stretch myself up on the step of the buggy and lick she hand and bark to ask she to excuse I i run off to the other side of the log hut there be a door there but it be close and prop firmly up by a plank that i could not move scratch as hard as i like i be determine to get in so i jump against the door and tear and bit at the plank till miss laura come to help I you will not find anything but rat in that ramshackle old place beautiful joe she say as she pull the plank away and as you do not hurt they i do not see what you want to get in for however you be a sensible dog and usually have a reason for have you own way so i be go to let you have it the plank fall down as she speak and she pull open the rough door and look in there be no window inside only the light that stream through the door so that for a instant she could see nothing be any one here she ask in she clear sweet voice there be no answer except a low moan sound why some poor creature be in trouble joe say miss laura cheerfully let we see what it be and she step inside i shall never forget see my dear miss laura go into that wet and filthy log house hold up she white dress in she hand she face a picture of pain and horror there be two rough stall in it and in the first one be tie a cow with a calf lie beside she i could never have believe if i have not see it with my own eye that a animal could get so thin as that cow be she backbone rise up high and sharp she hip bone stick away out and all she body seem shrunken in there be sore on she side and the smell from she stall be terrible miss laura give one cry of pity then with a very pale face she drop she dress and seize a little penknife from she pocket she hack at the rope that tie the cow to the manger and cut it so that the cow could lie down the first thing the poor cow do be to lick she calf but it be quite dead i use to think jenkin 's cow be thin enough but he never have one that look like this she head be like the head of a skeleton and she eye have such a famished look that i turn away sick at heart to think that she have suffer so when the cow lay down the moan noise stop for she have be make it miss laura run outdoors snatch a handful of grass and take it in to she the cow eat it gratefully but slowly for she strength seem all go miss laura then go into the other stall to see if there be any creature there there have be a horse there be now a lean gaunt-looking animal lie on the ground that seem as if he be dead there be a heavy rope knot round he neck and fasten to he empty rack miss laura step carefully between he foot cut the rope and go outside the stall speak kindly to he he move he ear slightly raise he head try to get up fall back again try again and succeed in staggering outdoors after miss laura who keep encouraging he and then he fall down on the grass fleetfoot stare at the miserable-looking creature as if he do not know what it be the horse have no sore on he body as the cow have nor be he quite so lean but he be the weakest most distressed-looking animal that i ever see the fly settle on he and miss laura have to keep drive they away he be a white horse with some kind of pale-colored eye and whenever he turn they on miss laura she would look away she do not cry as she often do over the sick and suffer animal this seem too bad for tear she just hover over that poor horse with she face as white as she dress and a expression of fright in she eye oh how dirty he be i would never have imagine that a horse could get in such a condition all this have only take a few minute and just after she get the horse out mr harry appear he come out of the house with a slow step that quicken to a run when he see miss

be think of everything even the salt bring those thing into the house harry and we 'll make a bran mash for more than a hour they be fuss over the animal then they come in and sit down the inside of the englishman 's house be as untidy as the outside there be no upstairs to it -- only one large room with a dirty curtain stretch across it on one side be a low bed with a heap of clothes on it a chair and a wash-stand on the other be a stove a table a shaky rocking-chair that miss laura be sit in a few hang shelf with some dish and book on they and two or three small box that have evidently be use for seat on the wall be tack some picture of grand house and lady and gentleman in fine clothes and miss laura say that some of they be noble people well i be glad this particular nobleman have

like to hear it again miss laura read : j wood esq dear sir : -- it be a matter of great regret to I that i be suddenly call away from my place at penhollow and will therefore not be able to do myself the pleasure of call on you and settle my little account i sincerely hope that the possession of my live stock which i make entirely over to you will more than reimburse you for any trifling expense which you may have incur on my account if it be any gratification to you to know that you have render a slight assistance to the son of one of england 's noblest nobleman you have it with expression of the deepest respect and hope that my stock may be in good condition when you take possession i be dear sir ever devotedly yours howard algernon leduc barron miss laura drop the paper uncle do he leave those animal to starve do not you notice say mr wood grimly that there be not a wisp of hay inside that shanty and that where the poor beast be tie up the wood be knaw and bite by they in they torture for food would not he have send I that note instead of leave it here on the table if he would want I to know the note be not date but i judge he be be go five or six day he have have a spite against I ever since i lend he that hundred dollar i do not know why for i have stand up for he when other would have run he out of the place he intend I to come here and find every animal lie dead he even have a rope around the pig 's neck harry my boy let we go and look after they again i love a dumb brute too well to let it suffer but in this case i would give two hundred dollar more if i could make they live and have barron know it they leave the room and miss laura sit turn the sheet of paper over and over with a kind of horror in she face it be a very dirty piece of paper but by-and-by she make a discovery she take it in she hand and go out-doors i be sure that the poor horse lie on the grass know she he lift he head and what a different expression he have now that he hunger have be partly satisfied miss laura stroked and pat he then she call to she cousin harry will you look at this he take the paper from she and say : that be a crest shine through the different stratum of dust and grime probably that of he own family we 'll have it clean and it will enable we to track the villain you want he punish do not you he say with a little sly laugh at miss laura she make a gesture in the direction of the suffering horse and say frankly yes i do well my dear girl he say father and i be with you if we can hunt barron down we 'll do it then he mutter to himself as she turn away she be a real puritan gentle and sweet and good and yet severe reward for the virtuous punishment for the vicious and he repeat some poetry : she be so charitable and so piteous she would weep if that she see a mouse catch in a trap if it be dead or bleed miss laura see that mr wood and mr harry be do all that could be do for the cow and horse so she wander down to a hollow at the back of the house where the englishman have keep he pig just now he look more like a greyhound than a pig he leg be so long he nose so sharp and hunger instead of make he stupid like the horse and cow have make he more lively i think he have probably not suffer so much as they have or perhaps he have have a greater store of fat to nourish he mr harry say that if he have be a girl he would have laugh and cry at the same time when he discover that pig he must have be asleep or exhaust when we arrive for there be not a sound out of he but shortly afterward he have set up a yell that attract mr harry 's attention and make he run down to he mr harry say he be rage around he pen digging the ground with he snout fall down and get up again and by a miracle escape death by choke from the rope that be tie around he neck now that he hunger have be satisfy he be gaze contentedly at he little trough that be half full of good sweet milk mr harry say that a starve animal like a starve person should only be feed a little at a time but the englishman 's animal have always be feed poorly and they stomach have contract so that they could not eat much at one time miss laura get a stick and scratch poor piggy 's back a little and then she go back to the house in a short time we go home with mr wood mr harry be go to stay all night with the sick animal and he mother would send he thing to make he comfortable she be better by the time we get home and be horrify to hear the tale of mr barron 's neglect later in the evening she send one of the man over with a whole box full of thing for she darling boy and a nice hot tea do up for he in a covered dish when the man come home he say that mr harry would not sleep in the englishman 's dirty house but have sling a hammock out under the tree however he would not be able to sleep much for he have he lantern by he side all ready to jump up and attend to the horse and cow it be a very lonely place for he out there in the wood and he mother say that she would be glad when the sick animal could be drive to they own farm \* \* \* \* \* chapter xxviii the end of the englishman in a few day thanks to mr harry 's constant care the horse and cow be able to walk it be a mournful procession that come into the yard at dingley farm the hollow-eyed horse and lean cow and funny little thin pig stagger along in such a shaky fashion they hoof be diseased and have partly rot away so that they could not walk straight though it be only a mile or two from penhollow to dingley farm they be tire out and drop down exhaust on they comfortable bed miss laura be so delighted to think that they have all live that she do not know what to do she eye be bright and shine and she go from one to another with such a happy face the queer little pig that mr harry have christen daddy longleg have be wash and he lay on he heap of straw in the corner of he neat little pen and survey he clean trough and abundance of food with the air of a prince why he would be clean and dry here and all he life he have be use to dirty damp penhollow with the tree hang over he and he little foot in a mass of filth and dead leaf happy little pig he ugly eye seem to blink and gleam with gratitude and he know miss laura and mr harry as well as i do he tiny tail be curl so tight that it be almost in a knot mr wood say that be a sign that he be healthy and happy and that when poor daddy be at penhollow he have notice that he tail hang as limp and as loose as the tail of a rat he come and lean over the pen with miss laura and have a little talk with she about pig he say they be by no mean the stupid animal that some people consider they he have have pig that be as clever as dog one little black pig that he have once sell to a man away back in the country have find he way home through the wood across the river up hill and down dale and he would be take to the place with a bag over he head mr wood say that he keep that pig because he know so much he say the most know pig he ever see be canadian pig one time he be have a trip on a sailing vessel and it anchor in a long narrow harbor in canada where the tide come in with a front four or five foot high call the bear there be a village opposite the place where the ship be anchor and every day at low tide a number of pig come down to look for shell-fish sometimes they go out for half a mile over the mud flat but always a few minute before the tide come rush in they turn and hurry to the shore they instinct warn they that if they stay any longer they would be drown mr wood have a number of pig and after a while daddy be put in with they and a fine time he have of it make friend with the other little grunter they be often let out in the pasture or orchard and when they be there i could always single out daddy from among they because he be the smartest though he have be bring up in such a miserable way he soon learn to take very good care of himself at dingley farm and it be amusing to see he when a storm be come on run about in a state of great excitement carry little bundle of straw in he mouth to make himself a bed he be a white pig and be always keep very clean mr wood say that it be wrong to keep pig dirty they like to be clean as well as other animal and if they be keep so human being would not get so many disease from eat they flesh the cow poor unhappy creature never as long as she live on dingley farm lose a strange melancholy look from she eye i have hear it say that animal forget past unhappiness and perhaps some of they do i know that i have never forget my one miserable year with jenkin and i have be a sober thoughtful dog in consequence of it and not playful like some dog who have never know what it be to be really unhappy it always seem to I that the englishman 's cow be think of she poor dead calf starve to death by she cruel master she get well herself and come and go with the other cow seemingly as happy as they but often when i watch she standing chew she cud and look away in the distance i could see a difference between she face and the face of the cow that have always be happy on dingley farm even the farm hand call she old melancholy and soon she get to be know by that name or mel for short until she get well she be put into the cow stable where mr wood 's cow all stand at night upon raise platform of earth cover over with straw litter and she be tie with a dutch halter so that she could lie down and go to sleep when she want to when she get well she be put out to pasture with the other cow the horse they name scrub because he could never be under any circumstance anything but a broken-down plain-looking animal he be put into the horse stable in a stall next fleetfoot and as the partition be low they could look over at each other in time by dint of much doctoring scrub 's hoof become clean and sound and he be able to do some work miss laura pet he a great deal she often take out apple to the stable and fleetfoot would throw up he beautiful head and look reproachfully over the partition at she for she always stay longer with scrub than with he and scrub always get the larger share of whatever good thing be go poor old scrub i think he love miss laura he be a stupid sort of a horse and always act as if he be blind he would run he nose up and down the front of she dress nip at the button and be very happy if he could get a bit of she watch-chain between he strong tooth if he be in the field he never seem to know she till she be right under he pale-colored eye then he would be delighted to see she he be not blind though for mr wood say he be not he say he have probably not be a over-bright horse to start with and have be make more dull by cruel usage as for the englishman the master of these animal a very strange thing happen to he he come to a terrible end but for a long time no one know anything about it mr wood and mr harry be so very angry with he that they say they would leave no stone unturn to have he punish or at least to have it know what a villain he be they send the paper with the crest on it to boston some people there write to england and find out that it be the crest of a noble and highly esteemed family and some earl be at the head of it they be all honorable people in this family except one man a nephew not a son of the late earl he be the black sheep of they all as a young man he have lead a wild and wicked life and have end by forge the name of one of he friend so that he be oblige to leave england and take refuge in america by the description of this man mr wood know that he must be mr barron so he write to these english people and tell they what a wicked thing they relative have do in leave he animal to starve in a short time he get a answer from they which be at the same time very proud and very touch it come from mr barron 's cousin and he say quite frankly that he know he relative be a man of evil habit but it seem as if nothing could be do to reform he he family be accustom to send a quarterly allowance to he on condition that he lead a quiet life in some retired place but they last remittance to he be lie unclaimed in boston and they think he must be dead could mr wood tell they anything about he mr wood look very thoughtful when he get this letter then he say harry how long be it since barron run away about eight week say mr harry that be strange say mr wood the money these english people send he would get to boston just a few day after he leave here he be not the man to leave it long unclaimed something must have happen to he where do you suppose he would go from penhollow i have no idea sir say mr harry and how would he go say mr wood he do not leave riverdale station because he would have be spot by some of he creditor perhaps he would cut through the wood to the junction say mr harry just what he would do say mr wood slapping he knee i 'll be drive over there to-morrow to see thompson and i 'll make inquiry mr harry speak to he father the next night when he come home and ask he if he have find out anything only this say mr wood there be no one answer to barron 's description who have leave riverdale junction within a twelvemonth he must have strike some other station we 'll let he go the lord look out for fellow like that we will look out for he if he ever come back to riverdale say mr harry quietly all through the village and in the country it be know what a dastardly trick the englishman have play and he would have be roughly handle if he have dare return month pass away and nothing be hear of he late in the autumn after miss laura and i have go back to fairport mr wood write she about the end of the englishman some riverdale lad be beat about the wood look for lose cattle and in they wanderings come to a old stone quarry that have be disuse for year on one side there be a smooth wall of rock many foot deep on the other the ground and rock be break away and it be quite easy to get into it they find that by some means or other one of they cow have fall into this deep pit over the steep side of the quarry of course the poor creature be dead but the boy out of curiosity resolve to go down and look at she they clamber down find the cow and to they horror and amazement discover near-by the skeleton of a man there be a heavy walking-stick by he side which they recognize as one that the englishman have carry he be a drinking man and perhaps he have take something that he think would strengthen he for he morning 's walk but which have on the contrary bewildered he and make he lose he way and fall into the quarry or he might have start before daybreak and in the darkness have slip and fall down this steep wall of rock one leg be double under he and if he have not be instantly kill by the fall he must have be so disabled that he could not move in that lonely place he would call for help in vain so he may have perish by the terrible death of starvation -- the death he have think to mete out to he suffer animal mr wood say that there be never a sermon preach in riverdale that have the effect that the death of this wicked man have and it remind she of a verse in the bible : he make a pit and he dig it and be fall into the ditch which he make mr wood say that she husband have write about the finding of mr barron 's body to he english relative and have receive a letter from they in which they seem relieved to hear that he be dead they thank mr wood for he plain speaking in tell they of they relative 's misdeed and say that from all they know of mr barron 's past conduct he influence would be for evil and not for good in any place that he choose to live in they be have they money send from boston to mr wood and they wish he to expend it in the way he think best fit to counteract the evil effect of they namesake 's doings in riverdale when this money come it amount to some hundred of dollar mr wood would have nothing to do with it he hand it over to the band of mercy and they form what they call the barron fund which they draw upon when they want money for buying and circulate humane literature mr wood say that the fund be be add to and the child be send all over the state leaflet and little book which preach the gospel of kindness to god 's lower creation a stranger pick one of they up and see the name of the wicked englishman print on the title-page would think that he be a friend and benefactor to the riverdale people -- the very opposite of what he glory in be \* \* \* \* \* chapter xxix a talk about sheep miss laura be very much interested in the sheep on dingley farm there be a flock in the orchard near the house that she often go to see she always carry root and vegetable to they turnip particularly for they be very fond of they but they would not come to she to get they for they do not know she voice they only lift they head and stare at she when she call they but when they hear mr wood 's voice they run to the fence bleat with pleasure and try to push they nose through to get the carrot or turnip or whatever he be hand to they he call they he little southdown and he say he love he sheep for they be the most gentle and inoffensive creature that he have on he farm one day when he come into the kitchen inquire for salt miss laura say : be it for the sheep yes he reply i be go up to the wood pasture to examine my shropshire you would like to go too laura say mr wood take you hand right away from that cake i 'll finish frost it for you run along and get you broad-brimmed hat it be very hot miss laura dance out into the hall and back again and soon we be walk up back of the house along a path that lead we through the field to the pasture what be you go to do uncle she say and what be those funny thing in you hand toe-clipper he reply and i be go to examine the sheep ' hoof you know we have have warm moist weather all through July and i be afraid of foot-rot then they be sometimes trouble with overgrown hoof what do you do if they get foot-rot ask miss laura i have various cure he say pare and clipping and dip the hoof in blue vitriol and vinegar or rub it on as the english shepherd do it destroy the diseased part but do not affect the sound do sheep have many disease ask miss laura i know one of they myself -- that be the scab a nasty thing that say mr wood vigorously and a man that build up a flock from a stockyard often find it out to he cost what be it like ask miss laura the sheep get scabby from a microbe under the skin which cause they to itch fearfully and they lose they wool and can not it be cure oh yes with time and attention there be different remedy i believe petroleum be the best by this time we have get to a wide gate that open into the pasture as mr wood let miss laura go through and then close it behind she he say you be look at that gate you want to know why it be so long do not you yes uncle she say but i can not bear to ask so many question ask as many as you like he say good-naturedly i do not mind answer they have you ever see sheep pass through a gate or door oh yes often and how do they act oh so silly uncle they hang back and one wait for another and finally they all try to go at once precisely when one go they all want to go if it be to jump into a bottomless pit many sheep be injure by overcrowding so i have my gate and door very wide now let we call they up there be not one in sight but when mr wood lift up he voice and cry : can nan nan nan black face begin to peer out from among the bush and little black leg carry white body come hurry up the stony path from the cooler part of the pasture oh how glad they be to get the salt mr wood let miss laura spread it on some flat rock then they sit down on a log under a tree and watch they eat it and lick the rock when it be all go miss laura sit fan herself with she hat and smile at they you funny woolly thing she say you be not so stupid as some people think you be lie still joe if you show yourself they may run away i crouch behind the log and only lift my head occasionally to see what the sheep be do some of they go back into the wood for it be very hot in this bare part of the pasture but the most of they would not leave mr wood and stand stare at he that be a fine sheep be not it say miss laura point to one with the blackest face and the blackest leg and largest body of those near we yes that be old jessica do you notice how she be hold she head close to the ground yes be there any reason for it there be she be afraid of the grub fly you often see sheep hold they nose in that way in the summer time it be to prevent the fly from go into they nostril and deposit a egg which will turn into a grub and annoy and worry they when the fly come near they give a sniff and run as if they be crazy still hold they nose close to the ground when i be a boy and the sheep do that we think that they have cold in they head and use to rub tar on they nose we know nothing about the fly then but the tar cure they and be just what i use now two or three time a month during hot weather we put a few drop of it on the nose of every sheep in the flock i suppose farmer be like other people and be always find out better way of do they work be not they uncle say miss laura yes my child the older i grow the more i find out and the better care i take of my stock my grandfather would open he eye in amazement and ask I if i be a old woman pet she cat if he be alive and could know the care i give my sheep he use to let he flock run till the field be cover with snow and bite as close as they like till there be not a scrap of feed leave then he would give they a open shed to run under and throw down they hay outside grain they scarcely know the taste of that they would fall off in flesh and half of they lose they lamb in the spring be a expected thing he would say i have they kennel if he could see my big closed shed with the sunny window that my flock spend the winter in i even house they during the bad fall storm they can run out again indeed i like to get they in and have a snack of dry food to break they in to it they be in and out of those shed all winter you must go in laura and see the self-feeding rack on bright winter day they get a run in the cornfield cold do not hurt sheep it be the heavy rain that soak they fleece with my way i seldom lose a sheep and they be the most profitable stock i have if i could not keep they i think i would give up farm last year my lamb net I eight dollar each the fleece of the ewe average eight pound and sell for two dollar each that be something to brag of in these day when so many be give up the sheep industry how many sheep have you uncle ask miss laura only fifty now twenty-five here and twenty-five down below in the orchard i have be sell a good many this spring these sheep be larger than those in the orchard be not they say miss laura yes i keep those few southdown for they fine quality i do not make as much on they as i do on these shropshire for a all-around sheep i like the shropshire it be good for mutton for wool and for rear lamb there be a great demand for mutton nowadays all through we eastern city people want more and more of it and it have to be tender and juicy and finely flavor so a person have to be particular about the feed the sheep get do not you hate to have these creature kill that you have raise and tend so carefully say miss laura with a little shudder i do say she uncle but never a animal go off my place that i do not know just how it be go to be put to death none of you send sheep to market with they leg tie together and jam in a cart and sweating and suffer for I they have get to go stand comfortably on they leg or go not at all and i be go to know the butcher that kill my animal that have be pet like child i say to davidson over there in hoytville ` if i think you would herd my sheep and lamb and calf together and take they one by one in sight of the rest and stick you knife into they or stun they and have the other low and bleat and cry in they misery this be the last consignment you would ever get from I ' he say ` wood i do not like my business but on the word of a honest man my butchering be do as well as it can be come and see for yourself ' he take I to he slaughter-house and though i do not stay long i see enough to convince I that he speak the truth he have different pen and shed and the killing be do as quietly as possible the animal be take in one by one and though the other suspect what be go on they can not see it these sheep be a long way from the house say miss laura do not the dog that you be tell I about attack they no for since i have that brush with windham 's dog i have train they to go and come with the cow it be a queer thing but cow that will run from a dog when they be alone will fight he if he meddle with they calf or the sheep there be not a dog around that would dare to come into this pasture for he know the cow would be after he with lowered horn and a business look in they eye the sheep in the orchard be safe enough for they be near the house and if a strange dog come around joe would settle he would not you joe and mr wood look behind the log at I i get up and put my head on he arm and he go on : by and by the southdown will be change up here and the shropshire will go down to the orchard i like to keep one flock under my fruit tree you know there be a old proverb ` the sheep have a golden hoof ' they save I the trouble of plough i have not plough my orchard for ten year and do not expect to plough it for ten year more then you aunt hattie 's hen be so oblige that they keep I from the worry of find tick at shear time all the year round i let they run among the sheep and they nab every tick they see how closely sheep bite exclaimed miss laura point to one that be nibble almost at he master 's foot very close and they eat a good many thing that cow do not relish -- bitter weed and briar and shrub and the young fern that come up in the spring i wish i could get hold of one of those dear little lamb say miss laura see that sweet little blackie back in the alder could you not coax he up he would not come here say she uncle kindly but i 'll try and get he for you he rise and after several effort succeed in capture the black-faced creature and bring he up to the log he be very shy of miss laura but mr wood hold he firmly and let she stroke he head as much as she like you call he little say mr wood if you put you arm around he you 'll find he be a pretty substantial lamb he be bear in march this be the last of July he 'll be shear the middle of next month and think he be quite grow up poor little animal he have quite a struggle for life the sheep be turn out to pasture in April they can not bear confinement as well as the cow and as they bite closer they can be turn out earlier and get on well by have good ration of corn in addition to the grass which be thin and poor so early in the spring this young creature be run by he mother 's side rather a weak-legged poor specimen of a lamb every night the flock be put under shelter for the ground be cold and though the sheep might not suffer from lie out-door the lamb would get chill one night this fellow 's mother get astray and as ben neglect to make the count she be not miss i be always anxious about my lamb in the spring and often get up in the night to look after they that night i go out about two o'clock i take it into my head for some reason or other to count they i find a sheep and lamb miss take my lantern and bruno who be some good at track sheep and start out bruno bark and i call and the foolish creature come to I the little lamb stagger after she i wrap the lamb in my coat take it to the house make a fire and heat some milk you aunt hattie hear I and get up she will not let I give brandy even to a dumb beast so i put some ground ginger which be just as good in the milk and force it down the lamb 's throat then we wrap a old blanket round he and put he near the stove and the next evening he be ready to go back to he mother i pet he all through April and give he extra -- different kind of meal till i find what suit he best now he do I credit dear little lamb say miss laura patting he how can you tell he from the other uncle i know all they face laura a flock of sheep be just like a crowd of people they all have different expression and have different disposition they all look alike to I say miss laura i dare say you be not accustom to they do you know how to tell a sheep 's age no uncle here open you mouth cosset he say to the lamb that he still hold at one year they have two tooth in the center of the jaw they get two tooth more every year up to five year then we say they have ' a full mouth ' after that you can not tell they age exactly by the tooth now run back to you mother and he let the lamb go do they always know they own mother ask miss laura usually sometimes a ewe will not own she lamb in that case we tie they up in a separate stall till she recognize it do you see that sheep over there by the blueberry bush -- the one with the very pointed ear yes uncle say miss laura that lamb by she side be not she own hers die and we take its fleece and wrap it around a twin lamb that we take from another ewe and give to she she soon adopt it now come this way and i 'll show you we movable feeding trough he get up from the log and miss laura follow he to the fence these big trough be for the sheep sad mr wood and those shallow one in the enclosure be for the lamb see there be just room enough for they to get under the fence you should see the small creature rush to they whenever we appear with they oats and wheat or bran or whatever we be go to give they if they be go to the butcher they get corn meal and oil meal whatever it be they eat it up clean i do not believe in cram animal i feed they as much as be good for they and not any more now you go sit down over there behind those bush with joe and i 'll attend to business miss laura find a shady place and i curl myself up beside she we sit there a long time but we do not get tire for it be amusing to watch the sheep and lamb after a while mr wood come and sit down beside we he talk some more about sheep-raising then he say you may stay here longer if you like but i must get down to the house the work must be do if the weather be hot what be you go to do now ask miss laura jump up oh more sheep business i have set out some young tree in the orchard and unless i get chicken wire around they my sheep will be bark they for I i have see they say miss laura stand up on they hind leg and nibble at the tree take off every shoot they can reach they do not hurt the old tree say mr wood but the young one have to be protect it pay I to take care of my fruit tree for i get a splendid crop from they thanks to the sheep good-bye little lamb and dear old sheep say miss laura as she uncle open the gate for she to leave the pasture i 'll come and see you again some time now you have better go down to the brook in the dingle and have a drink you look hot in you warm coat you have master one detail of sheep-keeping say mr wood as he slowly walk along beside he niece to raise healthy sheep one must have pure water where they can get to it whenever they like give they good water good food and a variety of it good quarter -- cool in summer comfortable in winter and keep they quiet and you 'll make they happy and make money on they i think i would like sheep-raising say miss laura will not you have I for you flock mistress uncle he laugh and say he think not for she would cry every time any of she charge be send to the butcher after this miss laura and i often go up to the pasture to see the sheep and the lamb we use to get into a shady place where they could not see we and watch they one day i get a great surprise about the sheep i have hear so much about they meekness that i never dream that they would fight but it turn out that they do and they go about it in such a business-like way that i could not help smile at they i suppose that like most other animal they have a spice of wickedness in they on this day a quarrel arise between two sheep but instead of run at each other like two dog they go a long distance apart and then come rush at each other with lowered head they object seem to be to break each other 's skull but miss laura soon stop they by call out and frightening they apart i think that the lamb be more interesting than the sheep sometimes they feed quietly by they mother ' side and at other time they all huddle together on the top of some flat rock or in a bare place and seem to be talk to each other with they head close together suddenly one would jump down and start for the bush or the other side of the pasture they would all follow pell-mell then in a few minute they would come rush back again it be pretty to see they play together and have a good time before the sorrowful day of they death come \* \* \* \* \* chapter xxx a jealous ox mr wood have a dozen calf that he be raise and miss laura sometimes go up to the stable to see they each calf be in a crib and it be feed with milk they have gentle patient face and beautiful eye and look very meek as they stand quietly gaze about they or suck away at they milk they remind I of big gentle dog i never get a very good look at they in they crib but one day when they be old enough to be let out i go up with miss laura to the yard where they be keep such queer ungainly large-boned creature they be and such a good time they be have run and jump and throw up they heel mr wood be with we and she say that it be not good for calf to be closely pen after they get to be a few week old they be better for get out and have a frolic she stand beside miss laura for a long time watch the calf and laugh a great deal at they awkward gambol they want to play but they do not seem to know how to use they limb they be lean calf and miss laura ask she aunt why all the nice milk they have take have not make they fat the fat will come all in good time say mr wood a fat calf make a poor cow and a fat small calf be not profitable to fit for send to the butcher it be better to have a bony one and fatten it if you come here next summer you 'll see a fine show of young cattle with fat side and big open horn and a good coat of hair can you imagine she go on indignantly that any one could be cruel enough to torture such a harmless creature as a calf no indeed reply miss laura who have be do it who have be do it repeat mr wood bitterly they be do it all the time do you know what make the nice white veal one get in big city the calf be bleed to death they linger for hour and moan they life away the first time i hear it i be so angry that i cry for a day and make john promise that he would never send another animal of he to a big city to be kill that be why all of we stock go to hoytville and small country place oh those big city be awful place laura it seem to I that it make people wicked to huddle they together i would rather live in a desert than a city there be ch -- o every night since i have be there i pray to the lord either to change the heart of some of the wicked people in it or to destroy they off the face of the earth you know three year ago i get run down and you uncle say i would get to have a change so he send I off to my brother 's in ch -- o i stay and enjoy myself pretty well for it be a wonderful city till one day some western man come in who have be visit the slaughter house outside the city i sit and listen to they talk and it seem to I that i be hear the description of a great battle these man be cattle dealer and have be send stock to ch -- o and they be furious that man in they rage for wealth would so utterly ignore and trample on all decent and humane feeling as to torture animal as the ch -- o man be do it be too dreadful to repeat the sight they see i listen till they be describe texan steer kick in agony under the torture that be practice and then i give a loud scream and faint dead away they have to send for you uncle and he bring I home and for day and day i hear nothing but shout and swearing and see animal drip with blood and cry and moan in they anguish and now laura if you would lay down a bit of ch ------ o meat and cover it with gold i would spurn it from I but what be i say you be as white as a sheet come and see the cow stable john 's just have it whitewashed miss laura take she aunt 's arm and i walk slowly behind they the cow stable be a long building well-built and with no chink in the wall as jenkin 's stable have there be large window where the afternoon sun come streaming in and a number of ventilator and a great many stall a pipe of water run through the stall from one end of the stable to the other the floor be cover with sawdust and leave and the ceiling and top of the wall be whitewashed mr wood say that she husband would not have the wall a glare of white right down to the floor because he think it injure the animal ' eye so the lower part of the wall be stain a dark brown color there be door at each end of the stable and just now they stand open and a gentle breeze be blow through but mr wood say that when the cattle stand in the stall both door be never allow to be open at the same time mr wood be most particular to have no draft blow upon he cattle he would not have they chill and he would not have they overheate one thing be as bad as the other and during the winter they be never allow to drink icy water he take the chill off the water for he cow just as mr wood do for she hen you know laura mrs wood go on that when cow be keep dry and warm they eat less than when they be cold and wet they be so warm-blooded that if they be cold they have to eat a great deal to keep up the heat of they body so it pay better to house and feed they well they like quiet too i never know that till i marry you uncle on we farm the boy always shout and scream at the cow when they be drive they and sometimes they make they run they be never allow to do that here i have notice how quiet this farm seem say miss laura you have so many man about and yet there be so little noise you uncle whistle a great deal say mr wood have you notice that he whistle when he be about he work and then he have a call whistle that nearly all of the animal know and the man run when they hear it you would see every cow in this stable turn its head if he whistle in a certain way outside he say that he get into the way of do it when he be a boy and go for he father 's cow he train they so that he would just stand in the pasture and whistle and they would come to he i believe the first thing that incline I to he be he clear happy whistle i would hear he from we house away down on the road jogging along with he cart or drive in he buggy he say there be no need of scream at any animal it only frighten and anger they they will mind much better if you speak clearly and distinctly he say there be only one thing a animal hate more than to be shout at and that be to be creep on -- to have a person sneak up to it and startle it john say many a man be kick because he come up to he horse like a thief a startled animal 's first instinct be to defend itself a dog will spring at you and a horse will let he heel fly john always speak or whistle to let the stock know when he be approach where be uncle this afternoon ask miss laura oh up to he eye in hay he be even get one of the ox harness to a hay cart i wonder whether it be duke say miss laura yes it be i see the star on he forehead reply mr wood i do not know when i have laugh at anything as much as i do at he the other day say miss laura uncle ask I if i have ever hear of such a thing as a jealous ox and i say no he say ` come to the barnyard and i 'll show you one ' the ox be both there duke with he broad face and bright so much sharper and more intelligent look duke be drink at the trough there and uncle say : ` just look at he be not he a great fat self-satisfied creature and do not he look as if he think the world owe he a living and he ought to get it ' then he get the card and go up to bright and begin scratch he duke lift he head from the trough and stare at uncle who pay no attention to he but go on card bright and stroke and pet he duke look so angry he leave the trough and with the water drip from he lip go up to uncle and give he a push with he horn still uncle take no notice and duke almost push he over then uncle leave off petting bright and turn to he he say duke would have treat he roughly if he have not i never see a creature look as satisfied as duke do when uncle begin to card he bright do not seem to care and only gaze calmly at they i have see duke do that again and again say mr wood he be the most jealous animal that we have and it make he perfectly miserable to have you uncle pay attention to any animal but he what queer creature these dumb brute be they be pretty much like we in most way they be jealous and resentful and they can love or hate equally well -- and forgive too for that matter and suffer -- how they can suffer and so patiently too where be the human be that would put up with the torture that animal endure and yet come out so patient nowhere say miss laura in a low voice we could not do it and there do not seem to be a animal mr wood go on no matter how ugly and repulsive it be but what have some lovable quality i have just be read about some sewer rat louise michel 's rat -- who be she ask miss laura a celebrated frenchwoman my dear child ` the priestess of pity and vengeance ' mr stead call she you be too young to know about she but i remember reading of she in 1872 during the commune trouble in france she be a anarchist and she use to wear a uniform and shoulder a rifle and help to build barricade she be arrest and send as a convict to one of the french penal colony she have a most wonderful love for animal in she heart and when she go home she take four cat with she she be put into prison again in france and take the cat with she rat come about she cell and she pet they and teach she cat to be kind to they before she get the cat thoroughly drill one of they bit a rat 's paw louise nurse the rat till it get well then let it down by a string from she window it go back to its sewer and i suppose tell the other rat how kind louise have be to it for after that they come to she cell without fear mother rat bring they young one and place they at she foot as if to ask she protection for they the most remarkable thing about they be they affection for each other young rat would chew the crust throw to old toothless rat so that they might more easily eat they and if a young rat dare help itself before a old one the other punish it that sound very interesting auntie say miss laura where do you read it i have just get the magazine say mr wood you shall have it as soon as you come into the house i love to be with you dear auntie say miss laura put she arm affectionately around she as they stand in the doorway because you understand I when i talk about animal i can not explain it go on my dear young mistress lay she hand on she heart the feeling i have here for they i just love a dumb creature and i want to stop and talk to every one i see sometimes i worry poor bessie drury and i be so sorry but i can not help it she say ` what make you so silly laura ' miss laura be stand just where the sunlight shone through she light-brown hair and make she face all in a glow i think she look more beautiful than i have ever see she before and i think mr wood think the same she turn around and put both hand on miss laura 's shoulder laura she say earnestly there be enough cold heart in the world do not you ever stifle a warm or tender feeling toward a dumb creature that be you chief attraction my child : you love for everything that breathe and move tear out the selfishness from you heart if there be any there but let the love and pity stay and now let I talk a little more to you about the cow i want to interest you in dairy matter this stable be new since you be here and we have make a number of improvement do you see those bit of rock salt in each stall they be for the cow to lick whenever they want to now come here and i 'll show you what we call ` the black hole ' it be a tiny stable off the main one and it be very dark and cool be this a place of punishment ask miss laura in surprise mr wood laugh heartily no no a place of pleasure sometimes when the fly be very bad and the cow be bring into the yard to be milk and a fresh swarm settle on they they be nearly frantic and though they be the best cow in new hampshire they will kick a little when they do those that be the worst be bring in here to be milk where there be no fly the other have big strip of cotton lay over they back and tie under they and the man brush they leg with tansy tea or water with a little carbolic acid in it that keep the fly away and the cow know just as well that it be do for they comfort and stand quietly till the milking be over i must ask john to have they nightdress put on sometimes for you to see harry call they ` sheet ghost ' and they do look queer enough standing all round the barnyard robe in white \* \* \* \* \* chapter xxxi in the cow stable be not it a strange thing say miss laura that a little thing like a fly can cause so much annoyance to animal as well as to people sometimes when i be try to get more sleep in the morning they little foot tickle I so that i be nearly frantic and have to fly out of bed you shall have some net to put over you bed say mr wood but suppose laura you have no hand to brush away the fly suppose you whole body be cover with they and you be tie up somewhere and could not get loose i can not imagine more exquisite torture myself last summer the fly here be dreadful it seem to I that they be get worse and worse every year and worry the animal more i believe it be because the bird be get thin out all over the country there be not enough of they to catch the fly john say that the next improvement we make on the farm be to be wire gauze at all the stable window and screen door to keep the little pest from the horse and cattle one afternoon last summer mr maxwell 's mother come for I to go for a drive with she the heat be intense and when we get down by the river she propose get out of the phaeton and sit under the tree to see if it would be any cooler she be drive a horse that she have get from the hotel in the village a roan horse that be clip and check-rein and have he tail dock i would not drive behind a tailless horse now then i be not so particular however i make she unfasten the check-rein before i would set foot in the carriage well i think that horse would go mad he would tremble and shiver and look so pitifully at we the fly be nearly eat he up then he would start a little mr maxwell have a weight at he head to hold he but he could easily have drag that he be a good dispositioned horse and he do not want to run away but he could not stand still i soon jump up and slap he and rub he till my hand be drip wet the poor brute be so grateful and would keep touch my arm with he nose mr maxwell sit under the tree fan herself and laugh at I but i do not care how could i enjoy myself with a dumb creature writhe in pain before I a docked horse can neither eat nor sleep comfortably in the fly season in one of we new england village they have a sign up ` horse take in to grass long tail one dollar and fifty cent short tail one dollar ' and it just mean that the short-tailed one be take cheaper because they be so bother by the fly that they can not eat much while the long-tailed one be able to brush they away and eat in peace i read the other day of a buffalo coal dealer 's horse that be in such a agony through fly that he commit suicide you know animal will do that i have read of horse and dog drown themselves this horse have be clip and he tail be dock and he be turn out to graze the fly sting he till he be nearly crazy he run up to a picket fence and spring up on the sharp spike there he hang make no effort to get down some man see he and they say it be a clear case of suicide i would like to have the power to take every man who cut off a horse 's tail and tie he hand and turn he out in a field in the hot sun with little clothing on and plenty of fly about then we would see if he would not sympathize with the poor dumb beast it be the most senseless thing in the world this docking fashion they have a few flimsy argument about a horse with a docked tail be stronger-backed like a short-tailed sheep but i do not believe a word of it the horse be make strong enough to do the work he be get to do and man can not improve on he docking be a cruel wicked thing now there be a ghost of a argument in favor of check-rein on certain occasion a fiery young horse can not run away with a overdrawn check and in speed horse a tight check-rein will make they hold they head up and keep they from choke but i do not believe in raise colt in a way to make they fiery and i wish there be not a race horse on the face of the earth so if it depend on I every kind of check-rein would go it be a pity we woman can not vote laura we would do away with a good many abuse miss laura smile but it be a very faint almost a unhappy smile and mr wood say hastily let we talk about something else do you ever hear that cow will give less milk on a dark day than on a bright one no i never do say miss laura well they do they be most sensitive animal one find out all manners of curious thing about animal if he make a study of they cow be wonderful creature i think and so grateful for good usage that they return every scrap of care give they with interest have you ever hear anything about dehorn laura not much auntie do uncle approve of it no indeed he would just as soon think of cut they tail off as of dehorn they he say he guess the creator know how to make a cow better than he do sometimes i tell john that he argument do not hold good for a man in some way can improve on nature in the natural course of thing a cow would be feed she calf for half a year but we take it away from she and raise it as well as she could and get a extra quantity of milk from she in addition i do not know what to think myself about dehorn mr windham 's cattle be all poll and he have a open space in he barn for they instead of keep they in stall and he say they be more comfortable and not so confine i suppose in send cattle to sea it be necessary to take they horn off but when they be go to be turn out to grass it seem like mutilate they we cow could not keep the dog away from the sheep if they do not have they horn they horn be they means of defense do you cattle stand in these stall all winter ask miss laura oh yes except when they be turn out in the barnyard and then john usually have to send a man to keep they move or they would take cold sometimes on very fine day they get out all day you know cow be not like horse john say they be like great milk machine you have get to keep they quiet only exercise enough to keep they in health if a cow be hurry or worry or chill or heat it stop she milk yield and bad usage poison it john say you can not take a stick and strike a cow across the back without she milk be that much worse and as for drink the milk that come from a cow that be not keep clean you would better throw it away and drink water when i be in chicago my sister-in-law keep complain to she milkman about what she call the ` cowy ' smell to she milk ` it be the animal odor ma'am ' he say ` and it can not be help all milk smell like that ' ` it be dirt ' i say when she ask my opinion about it ` i 'll wager my best bonnet that that man 's cow be keep dirty they skin be plaster up with filth and as the poison in they can not escape that way it be come out through the milk and you be help to dispose of it ' she be astonish to hear this and she get she milkman 's address and one day drop in upon he she say that he cow be stand in a stable that be comparatively clean but that they body be in just the state that i describe they as live in she advise the man to card and brush he cow every day and say that he need bring she no more milk that show how you city people be impose upon with regard to you milk i should think you would be poison with the treatment you cow receive and even when you milk be examine you can not tell whether it be pure or not in new york the law only require thirteen per cent of solid in milk that be absurd for you can feed a cow on swill and still get fourteen per cent of solid in it oh you city people be queer miss laura laugh heartily what a prejudice you have against large town auntie yes i have say mr wood honestly i often wish we could break up a few of we city and scatter the people through the country look at the lovely farm all about here some of they with only a old man and woman on they the boy be off to the city slave in store and office and grow pale and sickly it would have break my heart if harry have take to city way i have a plain talk with you uncle when i marry he and say ` now my boy 's only a baby and i want he to be bring up so that he will love country life how be we go to manage it ' you uncle look at I with a sly twinkle in he eye and say i be a pretty fair specimen of a country girl suppose we bring up harry the way i would be bring up i know he be only joking yet i get quite excited ` yes ' i say ` do as my father and mother do have a farm about twice as large as you can manage do not keep a hire man get up at daylight and slave till dark never take a holiday have the girl do the housework and take care of the hen and help pick the fruit and make the boy tend the colt and the calf and put all the money they make in the bank do not take any papers for they would waste they time read they and it be too far to go the postoffice oftener than once a week and ' -- but i do not remember the rest of what i say anyway you uncle burst into a roar of laughter ` hattie ' he say ` my farm 's too big i be go to sell some of it and enjoy myself a little more ' that very week he sell fifty acre and he hire a extra man and get I a good girl and twice a week he leave he work in the afternoon and take I for a drive harry hold the rein in he tiny finger and john tell he that dolly the old mare we be drive should be call he and the very next horse he buy should be call he too and he should name it and have it for he own and he would give he five sheep and he should have he own bank book and keep he account and harry understand mere baby though he be and from that day he love john as he own father if my father have have the wisdom that john have he boy would not be the one a poor lawyer and the other a poor doctor in two different city and we farm would not be in the hand of stranger it make I sick to go there i think of my poor mother lie with she tired hand cross out in the churchyard and the boy so far away and my father always hurry and drive we -- i can tell you laura the thing cut both way it be not all the fault of the boy that they leave the country mr wood be silent for a little while after she make this long speech and miss laura say nothing i take a turn or two up and down the stable thinking of many thing no matter how happy human being seem to be they always have something to worry they i be sorry for mr wood for she face have lose the happy look it usually wear however she soon forget she trouble and say : now i must go and get the tea this be adele 's afternoon out i 'll come too say miss laura for i promise she i would make the biscuit for tea this evening and let you rest they both saunter slowly down the plank walk to the house and i follow they \* \* \* \* \* chapter xxxii we return home in October the most beautiful of all the month we be oblige to go back to fairport miss laura could not bear to leave the farm and she face get very sorrowful when any one speak of she go away still she have get well and strong and be as brown as a berry and she say that she know she ought to go home and get back to she lesson mr wood call October the golden month everything be quiet and still and at night and in the morning the sun have a yellow misty look the tree in the orchard be load with fruit and some of the leaf be float down make a soft cover on the ground in the garden there be a great many flower in bloom in flame red and yellow color miss laura gather bunch of they every day to put in the parlor one day when she be arrange they she say regretfully they will soon be go i wish it could always be summer you would get tired of it say mr harry who have come up softly behind she there be only one place where we could stand perpetual summer and that be in heaven do you suppose that it will always be summer there say miss laura turn around and look at he i do not know i imagine it will be but i do not think anybody know much about it we have get to wait miss laura 's eye fall on I harry she say do you think that dumb animal will go to heaven i shall have to say again i do not know he reply some people hold that they do in a michigan paper the other day i come across one writer 's opinion on the subject he say that among the best people of all age have be some who believe in the future life of animal homer and the later greek some of the roman and early christian hold this view -- the last believe that god send angel in the shape of bird to comfort sufferer for the faith st franci call the bird and beast he brother dr johnson believe in a future life for animal as also do wordsworth shelley coleridge jeremy taylor agassiz lamartine and many christian scholar it seem as if they ought to have some compensation for they terrible suffering in this world then to go to heaven animal would only have to take up the thread of they life here man be a god to the lower creation joe worship you much as you worship you maker dumb animal live in and for they master they hang on we word and look and be dependent on we in almost every way for my own part and look at it from a earthly point of view i wish with all my heart that we may find we dumb friend in paradise and in the bible say miss laura animal be often speak of the dive and the raven the wolf and the lamb and the leopard and the cattle that god say be he and the little sparrow that can not fall to the ground without we father 's know it still there be nothing definite about they immortality say mr harry however we have get nothing to do with that if it be right for they to be in heaven we 'll find they there all we have to do now be to deal with the present and the bible plainly tell we that ' a righteous man regardeth the life of he beast ' i think i would be happier in heaven if dear old joe be there say miss laura look wistfully at I he have be such a good dog just think how he have love and protect I i think i should be lonely without he that remind I of some poetry or rather doggerel say mr harry that i cutout of a newspaper for you yesterday and he draw from he pocket a little slip of paper and read this : do doggie gang to heaven dad will oor auld donald gang for noo to tak ' he faither wus ' we wad be maist awfu ' wrang there be a number of other verse tell how many kind thing old donald the dog have do for he master 's family and then it close with these line : withoot be dog eh faither man ` twould be a awfu ' sin to leave oor faithfu ' doggie _ there _ he be _ certain _ to win in oor donald 's no like ither dog he 'll _ no _ be lockit oot if donald 's no let into heaven i 'll no gang there one foot my sentiment exactly say a merry voice behind miss laura and mr harry and look up they see mr maxwell he be hold out one hand to they and in the other keep back a basket of large pear that mr harry promptly take from he and offer to miss laura i have be dependent upon animal for the most part of my comfort in this life say mr maxwell and i sha 'n' t be happy without they in heaven i do not see how you would get on without joe miss morri and i want my bird and my snake and my horse -- how can i live without they they be almost all my life here if some animal go to heaven and not other i think that the dog have the first claim say miss laura he be the friend of man -- the oldest and best have you ever hear the legend about he and adam no say mr maxwell well when adam be turn out of paradise all the animal shun he and he sit bitterly weep with he head between he hand when he feel the soft tongue of some creature gently touch he he take he hand from he face and there be a dog that have separate himself from all the other animal and be try to comfort he he become the choose friend and companion of adam afterward of all man there be another legend say mr harry about we savior and a dog have you ever hear it we 'll tell you that later say mr maxwell when we know what it be mr harry show he white tooth in a amuse smile and begin : once upon a time we lord be go through a town with he disciple a dead dog lay by the wayside and every one that pass along fling some offensive epithet at he eastern dog be not like we dog and seemingly there be nothing good about this loathsome creature but as we savior go by he say gently ` pearl can not equal the whiteness of he tooth ' what be the name of that old fellow say mr maxwell abruptly who have a beautiful swan that come every day for fifteen year to bury its head in he bosom and feed from he hand and would go near no other human be saint hugh of lincoln we hear about he at the band of mercy the other day say miss laura i should think that he would have want to have that swan in heaven with he say mr maxwell what a beautiful creature it must have be speak about animal go to heaven i dare say some of they would object to go on account of the company that they would meet there think of the dog kick to death by he master the horse drive into he grave the thousand of cattle starve to death on the plain -- will they want to meet they owner in heaven accord to my reckon they owner will not be there say mr harry i firmly believe that the lord will punish every man or woman who ill-treat a dumb creature just as surely as he will punish those who ill-treat they fellow-creature if a man 's life have be a long series of cruelty to dumb animal do you suppose that he would enjoy himself in heaven which will be full of kindness to every one not he he would rather be in the other place and there he 'll go i fully believe when you have quite disposed of all you fellow-creature and the dumb creation harry perhaps you will condescend to go out into the orchard and see how you father be get on with pick the apple say mr wood join miss laura and the two young man she eye twinkle and sparkling with amusement the apple will keep mother say mr harry put he arm around she i just come in for a moment to get laura come maxwell we 'll all go and not another word about animal mr wood call after they laura will go crazy some day through thinking of they suffering if some one do not do something to stop she miss laura turn around suddenly dear aunt hattie she say you must not say that i be a coward i know about hearing of animal ' pain but i must get over it i want to know how they suffer i _ ought _ to know for when i get to be a woman i be go to do all i can to help they and i 'll join you say mr maxwell stretch out he hand to miss laura she do not smile but look very earnestly at he she hold it clasp in she own you will help I to care for they will you she say yes i promise he say gravely i 'll give myself to the service of dumb animal if you will and i too say mr harry in he deep voice lay he hand across theirs mr wood stand look at they three fresh eager young face with tear in she eye just as they all stand silently for a instant the old village clergyman come into the room from the hall he must have hear what they say for before they could move he have lay he hand on they three brown head bless you my child he say god will lift up the light of he countenance upon you for you have give yourselve to a noble work in serve dumb creature you be ennoble the human race then he sit down in a chair and look at they he be a venerable old man and have long white hair and the wood think a great deal of he he have come to get mr wood to make some nourishing dish for a sick woman in the village and while he be talk to she miss laura and the two young man go out of the house they hurry across the veranda and over the lawn talking and laughing and enjoy themselves as only happy young people can and with not a trace of they seriousness of a few moment before on they face they be go so fast that they run right into a flock of goose that be come up the lane they be drive by a little boy call tommy the son of one of mr wood 's farm laborer and they be chatter and gabble and seem very angry what be all this about say mr harry stop and look at the boy what be the matter with you feathered charge tommy my lad if it be the goose you mean say the boy half cry and look very much put out it be all they nasty potato they will not keep away from they so the potato chase the goose do they say mr maxwell teasingly no no

switch they foot and i hate to do it 'cause i be a band of mercy boy tommy my son say mr maxwell solemnly you will go right to heaven when you die and you goose will go with you hush hush say miss laura do not tease he and put she arm on the child 's shoulder she say you be a good boy tommy not to want to hurt the goose let I see you switch dear he show she a little stick he have in he hand and she say i do not think you could hurt they much with that and if they will be naughty and steal the potato you have to drive they out take some of my pear and eat they and you will forget you trouble the child take the fruit and miss laura and the two young man go on they way smile and look over they shoulder at tommy who stand in the lane devour he pear and keep one eye on the goose that have gather a little in front of he and be gabble noisily and have a kind of indignation meeting because they have be drive out of the potato field tommy 's father and mother live in a little house down near the road mr wood never have he hire man live in he own house he have two small house for they to live in and they be require to keep they as neat as mr wood 's own house be keep he say that he do not see why he should keep a board house if he be a farmer nor why he wife should wear herself out wait on strong hearty man that have just as soon take care of themselves he wish to have he own family about he and it be better for he man to have some kind of family life for themselves if one of he man be unmarried he board with the married one but sleep in he own house on this October day we find mr wood hard at work under the fruit tree he have a good many different kind of apple enormous red one and long yellow one that they call pippin and little brown one and smooth-coated sweet one

have leave riverdale the day before to go back to he college mr wood say that she would be very lonely without she two young people and she kiss miss laura over and over again and make she promise to come back again the next summer i be put in a box in the express car and mr wood tell the agent that if he know what be good for he he would speak to I occasionally for i be a very know dog and if he do not treat I well i would be apt to write he up in the newspaper the agent laugh and quite often on the way to fairport he come to my box and speak kindly to I so i do not get so lonely and frightened as i do on my way to riverdale how glad the morrise be to see we come back the boy have all get home before we and such a fuss as they do make over they sister they love she dearly and never want she to be long away from they i be rub and stroke and have to run about offer my paw to every one jim and little billy lick my face and bellum croak out glad to see you joe have a good time

mother often look at she fondly and say the white-faced child she send away have come home a nut-brown maid \* \* \* \* \* chapter xxxiii perform animal a week or two after we get home i hear the morri boy talk about a italian who be come to fairport with a troupe of trained animal and i could see for myself whenever i go to town great flaming picture on the fence of monkey sit at table dog and pony and goat climb ladder and roll ball and do various trick i wonder very much whether they would be able to do all those extraordinary thing but it turn out that they do the italian 's name be bellini and one afternoon the whole morri family go to see he and he animal and when they come home i hear they talk about it i wish you could have be there joe say jack pull up my paw to rest on he knee now listen old fellow and i 'll tell you all about it first of all there be a perfect jam in the town hall i sit up in front with a lot of fellow and have a splendid view the old italian come out dress in he best suit of clothes -- black broadcloth flower in he buttonhole and so on he make a fine bow and he say he be ` pleased too see ze fine audience and he be go to show zem ze fine animal ze finest animal in ze world ' then he shake a little whip that he carry in he hand and he say ` zat zat whip do not mean zat he be cruel he crack it to show he animal when to begin end or change they trick ' some boy yell ` rat you do whip they sometimes ' and the old man make another bow and say ` sairteenly he whip zem just as ze mamma whip ze naughty boy to make zem keep still when zey be noisy or stubborn ' then everybody laugh at the boy and the italian say the performance would begin by a grand procession of all the animal if some lady would kindly step up to the piano and play a march nina smith -- you know nina joe the girl that have black eye and wear blue ribbon and life around the corner -- step up to the piano and bang out a fine loud march the door at the side of the platform open and out come the animal two by two just like noah 's ark there be a pony with a monkey walk beside it and hold on to its mane another monkey on a pony 's back two monkey hand in hand a dog with a parrot on he back a goat harness to a little carriage another goat carry a birdcage in its mouth with two canary inside different kind of cat some dove and pigeon half a dozen white rat with red harness and drag a little chariot with a monkey in it and a common white gander that come in last of all and do nothing but follow one of the pony about the italian speak of the gander and say it be a stupid creature and could learn no trick and he only keep it on account of its affection for the pony he have get they both on a vermont farm when he be look for show animal the pony 's master have make a pet of he and have teach he to come whenever he whistle for he though the pony be only a scrub of a creature he have a gentle disposition and every other animal on the farm like he a gander in particular have such a admiration for he that he follow he wherever he go and if he lose he for a instant he would mount one of the knoll on the farm and stretch out he neck look for he when he catch sight of he he gabble with delight and run to he waddle up and down beside he every little while the pony put he nose down and seem to be have a conversation with the goose if the farmer whistle for the pony and he start to run to he the gander know he could not keep up would seize the pony 's tail in he beak and flap he wing would get along as fast as the pony do and the pony never kick he the italian saw that this pony would be a good one to train for the stage so he offer the farmer a large price for he and take he away oh joe i forget to say that by this time all the animal have be send off the stage except the pony and the gander and they stand look at the italian while he talk i never see anything as human in dumb animal as that pony 's face he look as if he understand every word that he master be say after this story be over the italian make another bow and then tell the pony to bow he nod he head at the people and they all laugh then the italian ask he to favor we with a waltz and the pony get up on he hind leg and dance you should have see that gander skirmish around so as to be near the pony and yet keep out of the way of he heel we fellow just roar and we would have keep he dance all the afternoon if the italian have not beg ` ze young gentleman not to make ze noise but let ze pony do ze rest of he trick ' pony number two come on the stage and it be too queer for anything to see the thing the two of they do they help the italian on with he coat they pull off he rubber they take he coat away and bring he a chair and drag a table up to it they bring he letter and papers and ring bell and roll barrel and swing the italian in a big swing and jump a rope and walk up and down step -- they just go around that stage as handy with they tooth as two boy would be with they hand and they seem to understand every word they master say to they the best trick of all be tell the time and do question in arithmetic the italian pull he watch out of he pocket and show it to the first pony whose name be diamond and say ` what time be it ' the pony look at it then scratch four time with he forefoot on the platform the italian say ` zat 's good -- four o'clock but it be a few minute after four -- how many ' the pony scratch again five time the italian show he watch to the audience and say that it be just five minute past four then he ask the pony how old he be he scratch four time that mean four year he ask he how many day in a week there be how many month in a year and he give he some question in addition and subtraction and the pony answer they all correctly of course the italian be give he some sign but though we watch he closely we could not make out what it be at last he tell the pony that he have be very good and have do he lesson well if it would rest he he might be naughty a little while all of a sudden a wicked look come into the creature 's eye he turn around and kick up he heel at he master he push over the table and chair and knock down a blackboard where he have be rub out figure with a sponge hold in he mouth the italian pretend to be cross and say ` come come this will not do ' and he call the other pony to he and tell he to take that troublesome fellow off the stage the second one nosed diamond and push he about finally bit he by the ear and lead he squeal off the stage the gander follow gabbling as fast as he could and there be a regular roar of applause after that there be ladder bring in joe and dog come on not thoroughbred but cur something like you the italian say he can not teach trick to pedigree animal as well as to scrub those dog jump the ladder and climb they and go through they and do all kind of thing the man crack he whip once and they begin twice and they do backward what they have do forward three time and they stop and every animal dog goat pony and monkey after they have finish they trick run up to they master and he give they a lump of sugar they seem fond of he and often when they be not perform go up to he and lick he hand or he sleeve there be one boss dog joe with a head like yours bob they call he and he do all he trick alone the italian go off the stage and the dog come on and make he bow and climb he ladder and jump he hurdle and go off again the audience howl for a encore and do not he come out alone make another bow and retire i see old judge brown wipe the tear from he eye he would laugh so much one of the last trick be with a goat and the italian say it be the best of all because the goat be such a hard animal to teach he have a big ball and the goat get on it and roll it across the stage without get off he look as nervous as a cat shake he old beard and try to keep he four hoof close enough together to keep he on the ball we have a funny little play at the end of the performance a monkey dress as a lady in a white satin suit and a bonnet with a white veil come on the stage she be miss green and the dog bob be go to elope with she he be all rig out as mr smith and have on a light suit of clothes and a tall hat on the side of he head high collar long cuff and he carry a cane he be a regular dude he step up to miss green on he hind leg and help she on to a pony 's back the pony gallop off the stage then a crowd of monkey chatter and wring they hand come on mr smith have run away with they child they be all dress up too there be the father and mother with gray wig and black clothes and the young green in bib and tucker they be a queer-looking crowd while they be go on in this way the pony trot back on the stage and they all fly at he and pull off they daughter from have back and laugh and chatter and box she ear and take off she white veil and she satin dress and put on a old brown thing and some of they seize the dog and kick he hat and break he cane and strip he clothes off and throw they in a corner and bind he leg with cord a goat come on harness to a little cart and they throw the dog in it and wheel he around the stage a few time then they take he out and tie he to a hook in the wall and the goat run off the stage and the monkey run to one side and one of they pull out a little revolver point it at the dog fire and he drop down as if he be dead the monkey stand look at he and then there be the most awful hullabaloo you ever hear such a bark and yelp and half a dozen dog rush on the stage and do not they trundle those monkey about they nose they and push they and shake they till they all run away all but miss green who sit shiver in a corner after a while she creep up to the dead dog paw he a little and do not he jump up as much alive as any of they everybody in the room clap and shout and then the curtain drop and the thing be over i wish he would give another performance early in the morning he have to go to boston jack push my paw from he knee and go outdoors and i begin to think that i would very much like to see those perform animal it be not yet tea time and i would have plenty of time to take a run down to the hotel where they be stay so i set out it be a lovely autumn evening the sun be go down in a haze and it be quite warm earlier in the day i have hear mr morri say that this be we indian summer and that we should soon have cold weather fairport be a pretty little town and from the principal street one could look out upon the blue water of the bay and see the island opposite which be quite desert now for all the summer visitor have go home and the island house be shut op i be run down one of the steep side street that lead to the water when i meet a heavily-laden cart come up it must have be come from one of the vessel for it be full of strange-looking box and package a fine-looking nervous horse be draw it and he be strain every nerve to get it up the steep hill he driver be a burly hard-faced man and instead of let he horse stop a minute to rest he keep urge he forward the poor horse keep look at he master he eye almost start from he head in terror he know that the whip be about to descend on he quiver body and so it do and there be no one by to interfere no one but a woman in a ragged shawl who would have no influence with the driver there be a very good humane society in fairport and none of the teamster dare ill-use they horse if any of the member be near this be a quiet out-of-the-way street with only poor house on it and the man probably know that none of the member of the society would be likely to be live in they he whip he horse and whip he till every lash make my heart ache and if i have dare i would have bite he severely suddenly there be a dull thud in the street the horse have fall down the driver run to he head but he be quite dead thank god say the poorly-dressed woman bitterly one more out of this world of misery then she turn and go down the street i be glad for the horse he would never be frighten or miserable again and i go slowly on think that death be the best thing that can happen to tortured animal the fairport hotel be build right in the center of the town and the shop and house crowd quite close about it it be a high brick building and it be call the fairport house as i be run along the sidewalk i hear some one speak to I and look up i see charlie montague i have hear the morrise say that he parent be stay at the hotel for a few week while they house be be repair he have he irish setter brisk with he and a handsome dog he be as he stand wave he silky tail in the sunlight charlie pat I and then he and he dog go into the hotel i turn into the stable yard it be a small choked-up place and as i pick my way under the cab and wagon stand in the yard i wonder why the hotel people do not buy some of the old house near by and tear they down and make a stable yard worthy of such a nice hotel the hotel horse be just get rub down after they day 's work and other be come in the man be talk and laugh and there be no sign of strange animal so i go around to the back of the yard here they be in a empty cow stable under a hay loft there be two little pony tie up in a stall two goat beyond they and dog and monkey in strong travel cage i stand in the doorway and stare at they i be sorry for the dog to be shut up on such a lovely evening but i suppose they master be afraid of they get lose or be steal if he let they loose they all seem very friendly the pony turn around and look at I with they gentle eye and then go on munch they hay i wonder very much where the gander be and go a little farther into the stable something white raise itself up out of the brownest pony 's crib and there be the gander close up beside the open mouth of he friend the monkey make a jabber noise and hold on to the bar of they cage with they little black hand while they look out at I the dog sniff the air and wag they tail and try to put they muzzle through the bar of they cage i like the dog best and i want to see the one they call bob so i go up quite close to they there be two little white dog something like billy two mongrel spaniel a irish terrier and a brown dog asleep in the corner that i know must be bob he do look a little like I but he be not quite so ugly for he have he ear and he tail while i be peer through the bar at he a man come in the stable he notice I the first thing but instead of drive I out he speak kindly to I in a language that i do not understand so i know that he be the italian how glad the animal be to see he the gander flutter out of he nest the pony pull at they halter the dog whine and try to reach he hand to lick they and the monkey chatter with delight he laugh and talk back to they in queer soft-sounding word then he take out of a bag on he arm bone for the dog nut and cake for the monkey nice juicy carrot for the pony some green stuff for the goat and corn for the gander it be a pretty sight to see the old man feed he pet and it make I feel quite hungry so i trot home i have a run down town again that evening with mr morri who go to get something from a shop for he wife he never let he boy go to town after tea so if there be errand to be do he or mr morris go the town be bright and lively that evening and a great many people be walk about and look into the shop window when we come home i go into the kennel with jim and there i sleep till the middle of the night then i start up and run outside there be a distant bell ringing which we often hear in fairport and which always mean fire \* \* \* \* \* chapter xxxiv a fire in fairport i have several time run to a fire with the boy and know that there be always a great noise and excitement there be a light in the house so i know that somebody be get up i do not think -- indeed i know for they be good boy -- that they ever want anybody to lose property but they do enjoy see a blaze and one of they greatest delight when there have not be a fire for some time be to build a bonfire in the garden jim and i run around to the front of the house and wait in a few minute some one come rattle at the front door and i be sure it be jack but it be mr morri and without a word to we he set off almost run toward the town we follow after he and as we hurry along other man run out from the house along the street and either join he or dash ahead they seem to have dress in a hurry and be thrust they arm in they coat and button themselves up as they go some of they have hat and some of they have none and they all have they face toward the great red light that get brighter and brighter ahead of we where 's the fire they shout to each other do not know -- afraid it be the hotel or the town hall it be such a blaze hope not how 's the water supply now bad time for a fire it be the hotel we see that as soon as we get on to the main street there be people all about and a great noise and confusion and smoke and blackness and up above bright tongue of flame be leap against the sky jim and i keep close to mr morri 's heel as he push he way among the crowd when we get nearer the burning building we see man carry ladder and axis and other be shout direction and rush out of the hotel carry box and bundle and furniture in they arm from the window above come a steady stream of article throw among the crowd a mirror strike mr morri on the arm and a whole package of clothes fall on he head and almost smother he but he brush they aside and scarcely notice they there be something the matter with mr morri -- i know by the worried sound of he voice when he speak to any one i could not see he face though it be as light as day about we for we have get jam in the crowd and if i have not keep between he foot i should have be trodden to death jim be larger than i be have get separate from we presently mr morri raise he voice above the uproar and call be every one out of the hotel a voice shout back i be go up to see it be jim watson the fireman cry some one near he be risk he life to go into that pit of flame do not go watson i do not think that the brave fireman pay any attention to this warning for a instant later the same voice say he be plant he ladder against the third story he be bind to go he 'll not get any farther than the second anyway where be the montague shout mr morri have any one see the montague mr morris mr morris say a frightened voice and young charlie montague press through the people to we where 's papa i do not know where do you leave he say mr morri take he hand and draw he closer to he i be sleep in he room say the boy and a man knock at the door and say ` hotel on fire five minute to dress and get out ' and papa tell I to put on my clothes and go downstairs and he run up to mamma where be she ask mr morris quickly on the fourth flat she and she maid blanche be up there you know mamma have not be well and could not sleep and we room be so noisy that she move upstairs where it be quiet mr morri give a kind of groan oh i be so hot and there be such a dreadful noise say the little boy burst into tear and i want mamma mr morri soothe he as best he could and draw he a little to the edge of the crowd while he be do this there be a piercing cry i could not see the person make it but i know it be the italian 's voice he be scream in broken english that the fire be spread to the stable and he animal would be burn would no one help he to get he animal out there be a great deal of confused language some voice shout look after the people first let the animal go and other say for shame get the horse out but no one seem to do anything for the italian go on cry for help i hear a number of people who be stand near we say that it have just be find out that several person who have be sleep in the top of the hotel have not get out they say that at one of the top window a poor housemaid be shriek for help here in the street we could see no one at the upper window for smoke be pour from they the air be very hot and heavy and i do not wonder that charlie montague feel ill he would have fall on the ground if mr morri have not take he in he arm and carry he out of the crowd he put he down on the brick sidewalk and unfasten he little shirt and leave I to watch he while he hold he hand under a leak in a hose that be fasten to a hydrant near we he get enough water to dash on charlie 's face and breast and then see that the boy be revive he sit down on the curbstone and take he on he knee charlie lay in he arm and moan he be a delicate boy and he could not stand rough usage as the morri boy could mr morri be terribly uneasy he face be deathly white and he shudder whenever there be a cry from the burning building poor soul -- god help they oh this be awful he say and then he turn he eye from the great sheet of flame and strain the little boy to he breast at last there be wild shriek that i know come from no human throat the fire must have reach the horse mr morri spring up then sink back again he want to go yet he could be of no use there be hundred of man stand about but the fire have spread so rapidly and they have so little water to put on it that there be very little they could do i wonder whether i could do anything for the poor animal i be not afraid of fire as most dog for one of the trick that the morri boy have teach I be to put out a fire with my paw they would throw a piece of light paper on the floor and i would crush it with my forepaw and if the blaze be too large for that i would drag a bit of old carpet over it and jump on it i leave mr morri and run around the corner of the street to the back of the hotel it be not burn as much here as in the front and in the house all around people be out on they roof with wet blanket and some be stand at the window watch the fire or pack up they belongings ready to move if it should spread to they there be a narrow lane run up a short distance toward the hotel and i start to go up this when in front of I i hear such a wail pierce noise that it make I shudder and stand still the italian 's animal be go to be burn up and they be call to they master to come and let they out they voice sound like the voice of child in mortal pain i could not stand it i be seize with such a awful horror of the fire that i turn and run feeling so thankful that i be not in it as i get into the street i stumble over something it be a large bird -- a parrot and at first i think it be bellum then i remembered hearing jack say that the italian have a parrot it be not dead but seem stupid with the smoke i seize it in my mouth and run and lay it at mr morri 's foot he wrap it in he handkerchief and lay it beside he i sit and tremble and do not leave he again i shall never forget that dreadful night it seem as if we be there for hour but in reality it be only a short time the hotel soon get to be all red flame and there be very little smoke the inside of the building have burn away and nothing more could be get out the fireman and all the people draw back and there be no noise everybody stand gaze silently at the flame a man step quietly up to mr morri and look at he i see that it be mr montague he be usually a well-dressed man with a kind face and a head of thick grayish-brown hair now he face be black and grimy he hair be burn from the front of he head and he clothes be half tear from he back mr morri spring up when he see he and say where be you wife the gentleman do not say a word but point to the burning building

thou hast reason as the french say mr judge tibbett ` do not ' give she dog exercise enough they claw be as long as chinaman 's nail and the hair grow over they pad and they have red eye and be always sick and she have to dose they with medicine and call they she poor little ` weeny-teeny sicky-wicky doggie ' bah i get disgust with she when i leave she i run away to she niece 's miss ball 's she be a sensible young lady and she use to scold she aunt for the way in which she bring up she dog she be almost too sensible for she pug and i be rub and scrub within a inch of we life and have to go for such long walk that i get thoroughly sick of they a woman whom the servant call trotsey come every morning and take the pug and I by we chain and sometimes another dog or two and take we for long tramp in quiet street that be trotsey 's business to walk dog and miss ball get a great many fashionable young lady who could not exercise they dog to let trotsey have they and they say that it make a great difference in the health and appearance of they pet trotsey get fifteen cent a hour for a dog goodness what appetite those walk give we and do not we make the dog biscuit disappear but it be a slow life at miss ball 's we only see she for a little while every day she sleep till noon after lunch she play with we for a little while in the greenhouse then she be off drive or visit and in the evening she always have company or go to a dance or to the theater i soon make up my mind that i would run away i jump out of a window one fine morning and run home i stay there for a long time my mother have be run over by a cart and kill and i be not sorry my master never bother he head about I and i could do as i like one day when i be have a walk and meet a lot of dog that i know a little boy come behind I and before i could tell what he be do he have snatch I up and be run off with I i could not bite he for he have stuff some of he rag in my mouth he take I to a tenement house in a part of the city that i have never be in before he belong to a very poor family my faith be not they badly off -- six child and a mother and father all live in two tiny room scarcely a bit of meat do i smell while i be there i hate they bread and molasses and the place smell so badly that i think i should choke they keep I shut up in they dirty room for several day and the brat of a boy that catch I sleep with he arm around I at night the weather be hot and sometimes we could not sleep and they have to go up on the roof after a while they chained I up in a filthy yard at the back of the house and there i think i should go mad i would have like to bite they all to death if i have dare it be awful to be chained especially for a dog like I that love he freedom the fly worry I and the noise distract I and my flesh would fairly creep from get no exercise i be there nearly a month while they be wait for a reward to be offer but none come and one day the boy 's father who be a street peddler take I by my chain and lead I about the street till he sell I a gentleman get I for he little boy but i do not like the look of he so i spring up and bit he hand and he drop the chain and i dodge boy and policeman and finally get home more dead than alive and look like a skeleton i have a good time for several week and then i begin to get restless and be off again but i be get tired i want to go to sleep you be not very polite i say to offer to tell a story and then go to sleep before you finish it look out for number one my boy say dandy with a yawn for if you do not no one else will and he shut he eye and be fast asleep in a few minute i sit and look at he what a handsome good-natured worthless dog he be a few day later he tell I the rest of he history after a great many wanderings he happen home one day just as he master 's yacht be go to sail and they chained he up till they go on board so that he could be a amusement on the passage to fairport it be in November that dandy come to we and he stay all winter he make fun of the morrise all the time and say they have a dull poky old house and he only stay because miss laura be nurse he he have a little sore on he back that she soon find out be mange she father say it be a bad disease for dog to have and dandy have better be shoot but she beg so hard for he life and say she would cure he in a few week that she be allow to keep he dandy be not capable of get really angry but he be as disturbed about have this disease as he could be about anything he say that he have get it from a little mangy dog that he have play with a few week before he be only with the dog a little while and do not think he would take it but it seem he know what a easy thing it be to get until he get well he be separate from we miss laura keep he up in the loft with the rabbit where we could not go and the boy run he around the garden for exercise she try all kind of cure for he and i hear she say that though it be a skin disease he blood must be purify she give he some of the pill that she make out of sulphur and butter for jim and billy and I to keep we coat silky and smooth when they do not cure he she give he a few drop of arsenic every day and wash the sore and indeed he whole body with tobacco water or carbolic soap it be the tobacco water that cure he miss laura always put on glove when she go near he and use a brush to wash he for if a person take mange from a dog they may lose they hair and they eyelash but if they be careful no harm come from nurse a mangy dog and i have never know of any one take the disease after a time dandy 's sore heal and he be set free he be right glad he say for he have get heartily sick of the rabbit he use to bark at they and make they angry and they would run around the loft stamp they hind foot at he in the funny way that rabbit do i think they dislike he as much as he dislike they jim and i do not get the mange dandy be not a strong dog and i think he irregular way of living make he take disease readily he would stuff himself when he be hungry and he always want rich food if he could not get what he want at the morrise ' he go out and steal or visit the dump at the back of the town when he do get ill he be more stupid about doctoring himself than any dog that i have ever see he never seem to know when to eat grass or herb or a little earth that would have keep he in good condition a dog should never be without grass when dandy get ill he just suffer till he get well again and never try to cure himself of he small trouble some dog even know enough to amputate they limb jim tell I a very interesting story of a dog the morrise once have call gyp whose leg become paralyze by a kick from a horse he know the leg be dead and gnaw it off nearly to the shoulder and though he be very sick for a time yet in the end he get well to return to dandy i know he be only wait for the spring to leave we and i be not sorry the first fine day he be off and during the rest of the spring and summer we occasionally meet he run about the town with a set of fast dog one day i stop and ask he how he contented himself in such a quiet place as fairport and he say he be die to get back to new york and be hope that he master 's yacht would come and take he away poor dandy never leave fairport after all he be not such a bad dog there be nothing really vicious about he and i hate to speak of he end he master 's yacht do not come and soon the summer be over and the winter be come and no one want dandy for he have such a bad name he get hungry and cold and one day spring upon a little girl to take away a piece of bread and butter that she be eat he do not see the large house-dog on the door sill and before he could get away the dog have seize he and bitten and shake he till he be nearly dead when the dog throw he aside he crawl to the morrise and miss laura bandaged he wound and make he a bed in the stable one Sunday morning she wash and feed he very tenderly for she know he could not live much longer he be so weak that he could scarcely eat the food that she put in he mouth so she let he lick some milk from she finger as she be go to church i could not go with she but i run down the lane and watch she out of sight when i come back dandy be go i look till i find he he have crawl into the darkest corner of the stable to die and though he be suffer very much he never utter a sound i sit by he and thought of he master in new york if he have bring dandy up properly he might not now be here in he silent death agony a young pup should be train just as a child be and punish when he go wrong dandy begin badly and not be check in he evil way have come to this poor dandy poor handsome dog of a rich master he open he dull eye give I one last glance then with a convulsive shudder he torn limb be still he would never suffer any more when miss laura come home she cry bitterly to know that he be dead the boy take he away from she and make he a grave in the corner of the garden \* \* \* \* \* chapter xxxvii the end of my story i have come now to the last chapter of my story i think when i begin to write that i would put down the event of each year of my life but i fear that would make my story too long and neither miss laura nor any boy and girl would care to read it so i will stop just here though i would gladly go on for i have enjoy so much talk over old time that i be very sorry to leave off every year that i have be at the morrise ' something pleasant have happen to I but i can not put all these thing down nor can i tell how miss laura and the boy grow and change year by year till now they be quite grow up i will just bring my tale down to the present time and then i will stop talk and go lie down in my basket for i be a old dog now and get tired very easily i be a year old when i go to the morrise and i have be with they for twelve year i be not live in the same house with mr and mr morris now but i be

i be more selfish i could not go away from miss laura even to die when my last hour come i want to see she gentle face bend over I and then i shall not mind how much i suffer she be just as tender-hearted as ever but she try not to feel too badly about the sorrow and suffering in the world because she say that would weaken she and she want all she strength to try to put a stop to some of it she do a great deal of good in riverdale and i do not think that there be any one in all the country around who be as much beloved as she be she have never forget the resolve that she make some year ago that she would do all that she could to protect dumb creature mr harry and mr maxwell have help she nobly mr maxwell 's work be largely do in boston and miss laura and mr harry have to do the most of theirs by write for riverdale have get to be a model village in respect of the treatment of all kind of animal it be a model village not only in that respect but in other it have seem as if all other improvement go hand in hand with the humane treatment of animal thoughtfulness toward lower creature have make the people more and more thoughtful toward themselves and this little town be get to have quite a name through the state for its good school good society and good business and religious standing many people be move into it to educate they child the riverdale people be very particular about what sort of stranger come to live among they a man who come here two year ago and open a shop be see kick a small kitten out of he house the next day a committee of riverdale citizen wait on he and say they have have a great deal of trouble to root out cruelty from they village and they do not want any one to come there and introduce it again and they think he have better move on to some other place the man be utterly astonished and say he would never hear of such particular people he have have no thought of be cruel he do not think that the kitten care but now when he turn the thing over in he mind he do not suppose cat like be kick about any more than he would like it himself and he would promise to be kind to they in future he say too that if they have no objection he would just stay on for if the people there treat dumb animal with such consideration they would certainly treat human being better and he think it would be a good place to bring up he child in of course they let he stay and he be now a man who be celebrate for he kindness to every living thing and he never refuse to help miss laura when she go to he for money to carry out any of she humane scheme there be one most important say of miss laura 's that come out of she year of service for dumb animal that i must put in before i close and it be this she say that cruel and vicious owner of animal should be punish but to merely thoughtless people do not say do not so much do not go to they and say do not overfeed you animal and do not starve they and do not overwork they and do not beat they and so on through the long list of hardship that can be put upon suffer animal but say simply to they be kind make a study of you animal ' want and see that they be satisfied no one can tell you how to treat you animal as well as you should know yourself for you be with it all the time and know its disposition and just how much work it can stand and how much rest and food it need and just how it be different from every other animal if it be sick or unhappy you be the one to take care of it for nearly every animal love its own master better than a stranger and will get well quicker under he care miss laura say that if man and woman be kind in every respect to they dumb servant they will be astonish to find how much happiness they will bring into they life and how faithful and grateful they dumb animal will be to they now i must really close my story good-bye to the boy and girl who may read it and if it be not wrong for a dog to say it i should like to add god bless you all if in
