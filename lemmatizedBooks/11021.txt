day to take the solemn oath that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united state and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united state in enter upon this great office i must humbly invoke the god of we father for wisdom and firmness to execute its high and responsible duty in such a manner as to restore harmony and ancient friendship among the people of the several state and to preserve we free institution throughout many generation convince that i owe my election to the inherent love for the constitution and the union which still animate the heart of the american people let I earnestly ask they powerful support in sustain all just measure calculate to perpetuate these the richest political blessing which heaven have ever bestow upon any nation have determine not to become a candidate for reelection i shall have no motive to influence my conduct in administer the government except the desire ably and faithfully to serve my country and to live in the grateful memory of my countryman we have recently pass through a presidential contest in which the passion of we fellow-citizen be excite to the highest degree by question of deep and vital importance but when the people proclaim they will the tempest at once subside and all be calm the voice of the majority speaking in the manner prescribe by the constitution be hear and instant submission follow we own country could alone have exhibit so grand and striking a spectacle of the capacity of man for self-government what a happy conception then be it for congress to apply this simple rule that the will of the majority shall govern to the settlement of the question of domestic slavery in the territory congress be neither to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate they domestic institution in they own way subject only to the constitution of the united state as a natural consequence congress have also prescribe that when the territory of kansas shall be admit as a state it shall be receive into the union with or without slavery as they constitution may prescribe at the time of they admission a difference of opinion have arise in regard to the point of time when the people of a territory shall decide this question for themselves this be happily a matter of but little practical importance besides it be a judicial question which legitimately belong to the supreme court of the united state before whom it be now pend and will it be understand be speedily and finally settle to they decision in common with all good citizen i shall cheerfully submit whatever this may be though it have ever be my individual opinion that under the nebraska-kansas act the appropriate period will be when the number of actual resident in the territory shall justify the formation of a constitution with a view to its admission as a state into the union but be this as it may it be the imperative and indispensable duty of the government of the united state to secure to every resident inhabitant the free and independent expression of he opinion by he vote this sacred right of each individual must be preserve that be accomplish nothing can be fairer than to leave the people of a territory free from all foreign interference to decide they own destiny for themselves subject only to the constitution of the united state the whole territorial question be thus settle upon the principle of popular sovereignty -- a principle as ancient as free government itself -- everything of a practical nature have be decide no other question remain for adjustment because all agree that under the constitution slavery in the state be beyond the reach of any human power except that of the respective state themselves wherein it exist may we not then hope that the long agitation on this subject be approach its end and that the geographical party to which it have give birth so much dread by the father of he country will speedily become extinct most happy will it be for the country when the public mind shall be divert from this question to other of more press and practical importance throughout the whole progress of this agitation which have scarcely know any intermission for more than twenty year whilst it have be productive of no positive good to any human be it have be the prolific source of great evil to the master to the slave and to the whole country it have alienate and estrange the people of the sister state from each other and have even seriously endanger the very existence of the union nor have the danger yet entirely cease under we system there be a remedy for all mere political evil in the sound sense and sober judgment of the people time be a great corrective political subject which but a few year ago excited and exasperate the public mind have pass away and be now nearly forget but this question of domestic slavery be of far graver importance than any mere political question because should the agitation continue it may eventually endanger the personal safety of a large portion of we countryman where the institution exist in that event no form of government however admirable in itself and however productive of material benefit can compensate for the loss of peace and domestic security around the family altar let every union-loving man therefore exert he best influence to suppress this agitation which since the recent legislation of congress be without any legitimate object it be a evil omen of the time that man have undertake to calculate the mere material value of the union reason estimate have be present of the pecuniary profit and local advantage which would result to different state and section from its dissolution and of the comparative injury which such a event would inflict on other state and section even descend to this low and narrow view of the mighty question all such calculation be at fault the bare reference to a single consideration will be conclusive on this point we at present enjoy a free trade throughout we extensive and expand country such as the world have never witness this trade be conduct on railroad and canal on noble river and arm of the sea which bind together the north and the south the east and the west of we confederacy annihilate this trade arrest its free progress by the geographical line of jealous and hostile state and you destroy the prosperity and onward march of the whole and every part and involve all in one common ruin but such consideration important as they be in themselves sink into insignificance when we reflect on the terrific evil which would result from disunion to every portion of the confederacy -- to the north not more than to the south to the east not more than to the west these i shall not attempt to portray because i feel a humble confidence that the kind providence which inspire we father with wisdom to frame the most perfect form of government and union ever devise by man will not suffer it to perish until it shall have be peacefully instrumental by its example in the extension of civil and religious liberty throughout the world next in importance to the maintenance of the constitution and the union be the duty of preserve the government free from the taint or even the suspicion of corruption public virtue be the vital spirit of republic and history prove that when this have decay and the love of money have usurp its place although the form of free government may remain for a season the substance have depart forever we present financial condition be without a parallel in history no nation have ever before be embarrass from too large a surplus in its treasury this almost necessarily give birth to extravagant legislation it produce wild scheme of expenditure and beget a race of speculator and jobber whose ingenuity be exert in contrive and promote expedient to obtain public money the purity of official agent whether rightfully or wrongfully be suspect and the character of the government suffer in the estimation of the people this be in itself a very great evil the natural mode of relief from this embarrassment be to appropriate the surplus in the treasury to great national object for which a clear warrant can be find in the constitution among these i might mention the extinguishment of the public debt a reasonable increase of the navy which be at present inadequate to the protection of we vast tonnage afloat now greater than that of any other nation as well as to the defense of we extended seacoast it be beyond all question the true principle that no more revenue ought to be collect from the people than the amount necessary to defray the expense of a wise economical and efficient administration of the government to reach this point it be necessary to resort to a modification of the tariff and this have i trust be accomplish in such a manner as to do as little injury as may have be practicable to we domestic manufacture especially those necessary for the defense of the country any discrimination against a particular branch for the purpose of benefit favored corporation individual or interest would have be unjust to the rest of the community and inconsistent with that spirit of fairness and equality which ought to govern in the adjustment of a revenue tariff but the squander of the public money sink into comparative insignificance as a temptation to corruption when compare with the squander of the public land no nation in the tide of time have ever be bless with so rich and noble a inheritance as we enjoy in the public land in administer this important trust whilst it may be wise to grant portion of they for the improvement of the remainder yet we should never forget that it be we cardinal policy to reserve these land as much as may be for actual settler and this at moderate price we shall thus not only best promote the prosperity of the new state and territory by furnish they a hardy and independent race of honest and industrious citizen but shall secure home for we child and we child 's child as well as for those exile from foreign shore who may seek in this country to improve they condition and to enjoy the blessing of civil and religious liberty such emigrant have do much to promote the growth and prosperity of the country they have prove faithful both in peace and in war after become citizen they be entitle under the constitution and law to be place on a perfect equality with native-born citizen and in this character they should ever be kindly recognize the federal constitution be a grant from the state to congress of certain specific power and the question whether this grant should be liberally or strictly construe have more or less divide political party from the beginning without enter into the argument i desire to state at the commencement of my administration that long experience and observation have convince I that a strict construction of the power of the government be the only true as well as the only safe theory of the constitution whenever in we past history doubtful power have be exercise by congress these have never fail to produce injurious and unhappy consequence many such instance might be adduce if this be the proper occasion neither be it necessary for the public service to strain the language of the constitution because all the great and useful power require for a successful administration of the government both in peace and in war have be grant either in express term or by the plainest implication whilst deeply convinced of these truth i yet consider it clear that under the war-making power congress may appropriate money toward the construction of a military road when this be absolutely necessary for the defense of any state or territory of the union against foreign invasion under the constitution congress have power to declare war to raise and support army to provide and maintain a navy and to call forth the militia to repel invasion thus endowed in a ample manner with the war-making power the corresponding duty be require that the united state shall protect each of they -lrb- the state -rrb- against invasion now how be it possible to afford this protection to californium and we pacific possession except by means of a military road through the territory of the united state over which man and munitions of war may be speedily transport from the atlantic state to meet and to repel the invader in the event of a war with a naval power much stronger than we own we should then have no other available access to the pacific coast because such a power would instantly close the route across the isthmus of central america it be impossible to conceive that whilst the constitution have expressly require congress to defend all the state it should yet deny to they by any fair construction the only possible means by which one of these state can be defend besides the government ever since its origin have be in the constant practice of construct military road it might also be wise to consider whether the love for the union which now animate we fellow-citizen on the pacific coast may not be impair by we neglect or refusal to provide for they in they remote and isolate condition the only means by which the power of the state on this side of the rocky mountain can reach they in sufficient time to protect they against invasion i forbear for the present from express a opinion as to the wisest and most economical mode in which the government can lend its aid in accomplish this great and necessary work i believe that many of the difficulty in the way which now appear formidable will in a great degree vanish as soon as the nearest and best route shall have be satisfactorily ascertain it may be proper that on this occasion i should make some brief remark in regard to we rights and duty as a member of the great family of nation in we intercourse with they there be some plain principle approve by we own experience from which we should never depart we ought to cultivate peace commerce and friendship with all nation and this not merely as the best means of promote we own material interest but in a spirit of christian benevolence toward we fellow-men wherever they lot may be cast we diplomacy should be direct and frank neither seek to obtain more nor accept less than be we due we ought to cherish a sacred regard for the independence of all nation and never attempt to interfere in the domestic concern of any unless this shall be imperatively require by the great law of self-preservation to avoid entangle alliance have be a maxim of we policy ever since the day of washington and its wisdom no one will attempt to dispute in short we ought to do justice in a kindly spirit to all nation and require justice from they in return it be we glory that whilst other nation have extend they dominion by the sword we have never acquire any territory except by fair purchase or as in the case of texa by the voluntary determination of a brave kindred and independent people to blend they destiny with we own even we acquisition from mexico form no exception unwilling to take advantage of the fortune of war against a sister republic we purchase these possession under the treaty of peace for a sum which be consider at the time a fair equivalent we past history forbid that we shall in the future acquire territory unless this be sanction by the law of justice and honor act on this principle no nation will have a right to interfere or to complain if in the progress of event we shall still further extend we possession hitherto in all we acquisition the people under the protection of the american flag have enjoy civil and religious liberty as well as equal and just law and have be contented prosperous and happy they trade with the rest of the world have rapidly increase and thus every commercial nation have share largely in they successful progress i shall now proceed to take the oath prescribe by the constitution whilst humbly invoke the blessing of divine providence on this great people march 4 1857 first annual message washington _ December 8 1857 _ _ fellow-citizen of the senate and house of representative _ : in obedience to the command of the constitution it have now become my duty to give to congress information of the state of the union and recommend to they consideration such measure as i judge to be necessary and expedient but first and above all we thanks be due to almighty god for the numerous benefit which he have bestow upon this people and we unite prayer ought to ascend to he that he would continue to bless we great republic in time to come as he have bless it in time past since the adjournment of the last congress we constituent have enjoy a unusual degree of health the earth have yield she fruit abundantly and have bountifully reward the toil of the husbandman we great staple have command high price and up till within a brief period we manufacturing mineral and mechanical occupation have largely partake of the general prosperity we have possess all the element of material wealth in rich abundance and yet notwithstanding all these advantage we country in its monetary interest be at the present moment in a deplorable condition in the midst of unsurpassed plenty in all the production of agriculture and in all the element of national wealth we find we manufacture suspend we public work retard we private enterprise of different kind abandon and thousand of useful laborer throw out of employment and reduce to want the revenue of the government which be chiefly derive from duty on import from abroad have be greatly reduce whilst the appropriation make by congress at its last session for the current fiscal year be very large in amount under these circumstance a loan may be require before the close of you present session but this although deeply to be regret would prove to be only a slight misfortune when compare with the suffering and distress prevail among the people with this the government can not fail deeply to sympathize though it may be without the power to extend relief it be we duty to inquire what have produce such unfortunate result and whether they recurrence can be prevent in all former revulsion the blame might have be fairly attribute to a variety of cooperate cause but not so upon the present occasion it be apparent that we exist misfortune have proceed solely from we extravagant and vicious system of paper currency and bank credit exciting the people to wild speculation and gamble in stock these revulsion must continue to recur at successive interval so long as the amount of the paper currency and bank loan and discount of the country shall be leave to the discretion of 1400 irresponsible banking institution which from the very law of they nature will consult the interest of they stockholder rather than the public welfare the framer of the constitution when they give to congress the power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof and prohibit the state from coin money emit bill of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debt suppose they have protect the people against the evil of a excessive and irredeemable paper currency they be not responsible for the exist anomaly that a government endowed with the sovereign attribute of coin money and regulate the value thereof should have no power to prevent other from drive this coin out of the country and fill up the channel of circulation with paper which do not represent gold and silver it be one of the highest and most responsible duty of government to insure to the people a sound circulate medium the amount of which ought to be adapt with the utmost possible wisdom and skill to the want of internal trade and foreign exchange if this be either greatly above or greatly below the proper standard the marketable value of every man 's property be increase or diminish in the same proportion and injustice to individual as well as incalculable evil to the community be the consequence unfortunately under the construction of the federal constitution which have now prevail too long to be change this important and delicate duty have be dissever from the coin power and virtually transfer to more than 1400 state bank act independently of each other and regulate they paper issue almost exclusively by a regard to the present interest of they stockholder exercise the sovereign power of provide a paper currency instead of coin for the country the first duty which these bank owe to the public be to keep in they vault a sufficient amount of gold and silver to insure the convertibility of they note into coin at all time and under all circumstance no bank ought ever to be charter without such restriction on its business as to secure this result all other restriction be comparatively vain this be the only true touchstone the only efficient regulator of a paper currency -- the only one which can guard the public against overissue and bank suspension as a collateral and eventual security it be doubtless wise and in all case ought to be require that bank shall hold a amount of united state or state security equal to they note in circulation and pledge for they redemption this however furnish no adequate security against overissue on the contrary it may be pervert to inflate the currency indeed it be possible by this mean to convert all the debt of the united state and state government into bank note without reference to the specie require to redeem they however valuable these security may be in themselves they can not be convert into gold and silver at the moment of pressure as we experience teach in sufficient time to prevent bank suspension and the depreciation of bank note in england which be to a considerable extent a paper-money country though vastly behind we own in this respect it be deem advisable anterior to the act of parliament of 1844 which wisely separate the issue of note from the banking department for the bank of england always to keep on hand gold and silver equal to one-third of its combined circulation and deposit if this proportion be no more than sufficient to secure the convertibility of its note with the whole of great britain and to some extent the continent of europe as a field for its circulation render it almost impossible that a sudden and immediate run to a dangerous amount should be make upon it the same proportion would certainly be insufficient under we banking system each of we 1400 bank have but a limited circumference for its circulation and in the course of a very few day the depositor and note holder might demand from such a bank a sufficient amount in specie to compel it to suspend even although it have coin in its vault equal to one-third of its immediate liability and yet i be not aware with the exception of the bank of louisiana that any state bank throughout the union have be require by its charter to keep this or any other proportion of gold and silver compare with the amount of its combined circulation and deposit what have be the consequence in a recent report make by the treasury department on the condition of the bank throughout the different state accord to return date nearest to January 1857 the aggregate amount of actual specie in they vault be $ 58349838 of they circulation $ 214778822 and of they deposit $ 230351352 thus it appear that these bank in the aggregate have considerably less than one dollar in seven of gold and silver compare with they circulation and deposit it be palpable therefore that the very first pressure must drive they to suspension and deprive the people of a convertible currency with all its disastrous consequence it be truly wonderful that they should have so long continue to preserve they credit when a demand for the payment of one-seventh of they immediate liability would have drive they into insolvency and this be the condition of the bank notwithstanding that four hundred million of gold from californium have flow in upon we within the last eight year and the tide still continue to flow indeed such have be the extravagance of bank credit that the bank now hold a considerably less amount of specie either in proportion to they capital or to they circulation and deposit combine than they do before the discovery of gold in californium whilst in the year 1848 they specie in proportion to they capital be more than equal to one dollar for four and a half in 1857 it do not amount to one dollar for every six dollar and thirty-three cent of they capital in the year 1848 the specie be equal within a very small fraction to one dollar in five of they circulation and deposit in 1857 it be not equal to one dollar in seven and a half of they circulation and deposit from this statement it be easy to account for we financial history for the last forty year it have be a history of extravagant expansion in the business of the country follow by ruinous contraction at successive interval the best and most enterprising man have be tempt to they ruin by excessive bank loan of mere paper credit exciting they to extravagant importation of foreign goods wild speculation and ruinous and demoralizing stock gambling when the crisis arrive as arrive it must the bank can extend no relief to the people in a vain struggle to redeem they liability in specie they be compel to contract they loan and they issue and at last in the hour of distress when they assistance be most need they and they debtor together sink into insolvency it be this paper system of extravagant expansion raise the nominal price of every article far beyond its real value when compare with the cost of similar article in country whose circulation be wisely regulate which have prevent we from compete in we own market with foreign manufacturer have produce extravagant importation and have counteract the effect of the large incidental protection afford to we domestic manufacture by the present revenue tariff but for this the branch of we manufacture compose of raw material the production of we own country -- such as cotton iron and woolen fabric -- would not only have acquire almost exclusive possession of the home market but would have create for themselves a foreign market throughout the world deplorable however as may be we present financial condition we may yet indulge in bright hope for the future no other nation have ever exist which could have endure such violent expansion and contraction of paper credit without last injury yet the buoyancy of youth the energy of we population and the spirit which never quail before difficulty will enable we soon to recover from we present financial embarrassment and may even occasion we speedily to forget the lesson which they have teach in the meantime it be the duty of the government by all proper means within its power to aid in alleviate the suffering of the people occasion by the suspension of the bank and to provide against a recurrence of the same calamity unfortunately in either aspect of the case it can do but little thanks to the independent treasury the government have not suspend payment as it be compel to do by the failure of the bank in 1837 it will continue to discharge its liability to the people in gold and silver its disbursement in coin will pass into circulation and materially assist in restore a sound currency from its high credit should we be compel to make a temporary loan it can be effect on advantageous term this however shall if possible be avoid but if not then the amount shall be limit to the lowest practicable sum i have therefore determine that whilst no useful government work already in progress shall be suspend new work not already commence will be postpone if this can be do without injury to the country those necessary for its defense shall proceed as though there have be no crisis in we monetary affair but the federal government can not do much to provide against a recurrence of exist evil even if insurmountable constitutional objection do not exist against the creation of a national bank this would furnish no adequate preventive security the history of the last bank of the united state abundantly prove the truth of this assertion such a bank could not if it would regulate the issue and credit of 1400 state bank in such a manner as to prevent the ruinous expansion and contraction in we currency which afflict the country throughout the existence of the late bank or secure we against future suspension in 1825 a effort be make by the bank of england to curtail the issue of the country bank under the most favorable circumstance the paper currency have be expand to a ruinous extent and the bank put forth all its power to contract it in order to reduce price and restore the equilibrium of the foreign exchange it accordingly commence a system of curtailment of its loan and issue in the vain hope that the joint stock and private bank of the kingdom would be compel to follow its example it find however that as it contract they expand and at the end of the process to employ the language of a very high official authority whatever reduction of the paper circulation be effect by the bank of england -lrb- in 1825 -rrb- be more than make up by the issue of the country bank but a bank of the united state would not if it could restrain the issue and loan of the state bank because its duty as a regulator of the currency must often be in direct conflict with the immediate interest of its stockholder if we expect one agent to restrain or control another they interest must at least in some degree be antagonistic but the director of a bank of the united state would feel the same interest and the same inclination with the director of the state bank to expand the currency to accommodate they favorite and friend with loan and to declare large dividend such have be we experience in regard to the last bank after all we must mainly rely upon the patriotism and wisdom of the state for the prevention and redress of the evil if they will afford we a real specie basis for we paper circulation by increase the denomination of bank note first to twenty and afterwards to fifty dollar if they will require that the bank shall at all time keep on hand at least one dollar of gold and silver for every three dollar of they circulation and deposit and if they will provide by a self-executing enactment which nothing can arrest that the moment they suspend they shall go into liquidation i believe that such provision with a weekly publication by each bank of a statement of its condition would go far to secure we against future suspension of specie payment congress in my opinion possess the power to pass a uniform bankrupt law applicable to all banking institution throughout the united state and i strongly recommend its exercise this would make it the irreversible organic law of each bank 's existence that a suspension of specie payment shall produce its civil death the instinct of self-preservation would then compel it to perform its duty in such a manner as to escape the penalty and preserve its life the existence of bank and the circulation of bank paper be so identify with the habit of we people that they can not at this day be suddenly abolish without much immediate injury to the country if we could confine they to they appropriate sphere and prevent they from administer to the spirit of wild and reckless speculation by extravagant loan and issue they might be continue with advantage to the public but this i say after long and much reflection : if experience shall prove it to be impossible to enjoy the facility which well-regulated bank might afford without at the same time suffer the calamity which the excess of the bank have hitherto inflict upon the country it would then be far the lesser evil to deprive they altogether of the power to issue a paper currency and confine they to the function of bank of deposit and discount we relation with foreign government be upon the whole in a satisfactory condition the diplomatic difficulty which exist between the government of the united state and that of great britain at the adjournment of the last congress have be happily terminate by the appointment of a british minister to this country who have be cordially receive whilst it be greatly to the interest as i be convinced it be the sincere desire of the government and people of the two country to be on term of intimate friendship with each other it have be we misfortune almost always to have have some irritating if not dangerous outstanding question with great britain since the origin of the government we have be employ in negotiate treaty with that power and afterwards in discuss they true intent and meaning in this respect the convention of April 19 1850 commonly call the clayton and bulwer treaty have be the most unfortunate of all because the two government place directly opposite and contradictory construction upon its first and most important article whilst in the united state we believe that this treaty would place both power upon a exact equality by the stipulation that neither will ever occupy or fortify or colonize or assume or exercise any dominion over any part of central america it be contend by the british government that the true construction of this language have leave they in the rightful possession of all that portion of central america which be in they occupancy at the date of the treaty in fact that the treaty be a virtual recognition on the part of the united state of the right of great britain either as owner or protector to the whole extensive coast of central america sweeping round from the rio hondo to the port and harbor of san juan de nicaragua together with the adjacent bay island except the comparatively small portion of this between the sarstoon and cape hondura accord to they construction the treaty do no more than simply prohibit they from extend they possession in central america beyond the present limit it be not too much to assert that if in the united state the treaty have be consider susceptible of such a construction it never would have be negotiate under the authority of the president nor would it have receive the approbation of the senate the universal conviction in the united state be that when we government consent to violate its traditional and time-honored policy and to stipulate with a foreign government never to occupy or acquire territory in the central american portion of we own continent the consideration for this sacrifice be that great britain should in this respect at least be place in the same position with ourselves whilst we have no right to doubt the sincerity of the british government in they construction of the treaty it be at the same time my deliberate conviction that this construction be in opposition both to its letter and its spirit under the late administration negotiation be institute between the two government for the purpose if possible of remove these difficulty and a treaty have this laudable object in view be sign at london on the 17th October 1856 and be submit by the president to the senate on the follow 10th of December whether this treaty either in its original or amend form would have accomplish the object intend without give birth to new and embarrassing complication between the two government may perhaps be well question certain it be however it be render much less objectionable by the different amendment make to it by the senate the treaty as amend be ratify by I on the 12th march 1857 and be transmit to london for ratification by the british government that government express its willingness to concur in all the amendment make by the senate with the single exception of the clause relate to ruatan and the other island in the bay of hondura the article in the original treaty as submit to the senate after recite that these island and they inhabitant have be by a convention bearing date the 27th day of August 1856 between she britannic majesty and the republic of hondura constitute and declare a free territory under the sovereignty of the say republic of hondura stipulate that the two contracting party do hereby mutually engage to recognize and respect in all future time the independence and rights of the say free territory as a part of the republic of hondura upon a examination of this convention between great britain and hondura of the 27th August 1856 it be find that whilst declare the bay island to be a free territory under the sovereignty of the republic of hondura it deprive that republic of rights without which its sovereignty over they could scarcely be say to exist it divide they from the remainder of hondura and give to they inhabitant a separate government of they own with legislative executive and judicial officer elect by themselves it deprive the government of hondura of the tax power in every form and exempt the people of the island from the performance of military duty except for they own exclusive defense it also prohibit that republic from erect fortification upon they for they protection thus leave they open to invasion from any quarter and finally it provide that slavery shall not at any time hereafter be permit to exist therein have hondura ratify this convention she would have ratify the establishment of a state substantially independent within she own limit and a state at all time subject to british influence and control moreover have the united state ratify the treaty with great britain in its original form we should have be bind to recognize and respect in all future time these stipulation to the prejudice of hondura be in direct opposition to the spirit and meaning of the clayton and bulwer treaty as understand in the united state the senate reject the entire clause and substitute in its stead a simple recognition of the sovereign right of hondura to these island in the follow language : the two contracting party do hereby mutually engage to recognize and respect the island of ruatan bonaco utilum barbaretta helena and morat situate in the bay of hondura and off the coast of the republic of hondura as under the sovereignty and as part of the say republic of hondura great britain reject this amendment assign as the only reason that the ratification of the convention of the 27th August 1856 between she and hondura have not be exchange owe to the hesitation of that government have this be do it be state that she majesty 's government would have have little difficulty in agree to the modification propose by the senate which then would have have in effect the same signification as the original wording whether this would have be the effect whether the mere circumstance of the exchange of the ratification of the british convention with hondura prior in point of time to the ratification of we treaty with great britain would in effect have have the same signification as the original wording and thus have nullify the amendment of the senate may well be doubt it be perhaps fortunate that the question have never arise the british government immediately after reject the treaty as amend propose to enter into a new treaty with the united state similar in all respects to the treaty which they have just refuse to ratify if the united state would consent to add to the senate 's clear and unqualified recognition of the sovereignty of hondura over the bay island the follow conditional stipulation : whenever and so soon as the republic of hondura shall have conclude and ratify a treaty with great britain by which great britain shall have cede and the republic of hondura shall have accept the say island subject to the provision and condition contain in such treaty this proposition be of course reject after the senate have refuse to recognize the british convention with hondura of the 27th August 1856 with full knowledge of its contents it be impossible for I necessarily ignorant of the provision and condition which might be contain in a future convention between the same party to sanction they in advance the fact be that when two nation like great britain and the united state mutually desirous as they be and i trust ever may be of maintain the most friendly relation with each other have unfortunately conclude a treaty which they understand in sens directly opposite the wisest course be to abrogate such a treaty by mutual consent and to commence anew have this be do promptly all difficulty in central america would most probably ere this have be adjust to the satisfaction of both party the time spend in discuss the meaning of the clayton and bulwer treaty would have be devote to this praiseworthy purpose and the task would have be the more easily accomplish because the interest of the two country in central america be identical be confine to secure safe transit over all the route across the isthmus whilst entertaining these sentiment i shall nevertheless not refuse to contribute to any reasonable adjustment of the central american question which be not practically inconsistent with the american interpretation of the treaty overture for this purpose have be recently make by the british government in a friendly spirit which i cordially reciprocate but whether this renew effort will result in success i be not yet prepare to express a opinion a brief period will determine with france we ancient relation of friendship still continue to exist the french government have in several recent instance which need not be enumerate evince a spirit of good will and kindness toward we country which i heartily reciprocate it be notwithstanding much to be regret that two nation whose production be of such a character as to invite the most extensive exchange and freest commercial intercourse should continue to enforce ancient and obsolete restriction of trade against each other we commercial treaty with france be in this respect a exception from we treaty with all other commercial nation it jealously levy discriminate duty both on tonnage and on article the growth produce or manufacture of the one country when arrive in vessel belong to the other more than forty year ago on the 3d march 1815 congress pass a act offering to all nation to admit they vessel laden with they national production into the port of the united state upon the same term with we own vessel provide they would reciprocate to we similar advantage this act confine the reciprocity to the production of the respective foreign nation who might enter into the propose arrangement with the united state the act of may 24 1828 remove this restriction and offer a similar reciprocity to all such vessel without reference to the origin of they cargo upon these principle we commercial treaty and arrangement have be found except with france and let we hope that this exception may not long exist we relation with russium remain as they have ever be on the most friendly foot the present emperor as well as he predecessor have never fail when the occasion offer to manifest they good will to we country and they friendship have always be highly appreciate by the government and people of the united state with all other european government except that of spain we relation be as peaceful as we could desire i regret to say that no progress whatever have be make since the adjournment of congress toward the settlement of any of the numerous claim of we citizen against the spanish government besides the outrage commit on we flag by the spanish war frigate _ ferrolana _ on the high sea off the coast of cuba in march 1855 by firing into the american mail steamer _ el dorado _ and detain and search she remains unacknowledged and unredressed the general tone and temper of the spanish government toward that of the united state be much to be regret we present envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to madrid have ask to be recall and it be my purpose to send out a new minister to spain with special instruction on all question pend between the two government and with a determination to have they speedily and amicably adjust if this be possible in the meantime whenever we minister urge the just claim of we citizen on the notice of the spanish government he be meet with the objection that congress have never make the appropriation recommend by president polk in he annual message of December 1847 to be pay to the spanish government for the purpose of distribution among the claimant in the _ amistad _ case a similar recommendation be make by my immediate predecessor in he message of December 1853 and entirely concur with both in the opinion that this indemnity be justly due under the treaty with spain of the 27th of October 1795 i earnestly recommend such a appropriation to the favorable consideration of congress a treaty of friendship and commerce be conclude at constantinople on the 13th December 1856 between the united state and persia the ratification of which be exchange at constantinople on the 13th June 1857 and the treaty be proclaim by the president on the 18th August 1857 this treaty it be believe will prove beneficial to american commerce the shah have manifest a earnest disposition to cultivate friendly relation with we country and have express a strong wish that we should be represent at teheran by a minister plenipotentiary and i recommend that a appropriation be make for this purpose recent occurrence in china have be unfavorable to a revision of the treaty with that empire of the 3d July 1844 with a view to the security and extension of we commerce the twenty-fourth article of this treaty stipulate for a revision of it in case experience should prove this to be requisite in which case the two government will at the expiration of twelve year from the date of say convention treat amicably concern the same by means of suitable person appoint to conduct such negotiation these twelve year expire on the 3d July 1856 but long before that period it be ascertain that important change in the treaty be necessary and several fruitless attempt be make by the commissioner of the united state to effect these change another effort be about to be make for the same purpose by we commissioner in conjunction with the minister of england and france but this be suspend by the occurrence of hostility in the canton river between great britain and the chinese empire these hostility have necessarily interrupt the trade of all nation with canton which be now in a state of blockade and have occasion a serious loss of life and property meanwhile the insurrection within the empire against the exist imperial dynasty still continue and it be difficult to anticipate what will be the result under these circumstance i have deem it advisable to appoint a distinguished citizen of pennsylvanium envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to proceed to china and to avail himself of any opportunity which may offer to effect change in the exist treaty favorable to american commerce he leave the united state for the place of he destination in July last in the war steamer _ minnesota _ special minister to china have also be appoint by the government of great britain and france whilst we minister have be instruct to occupy a neutral position in reference to the exist hostility at canton he will cordially cooperate with the british and french minister in all peaceful measure to secure by treaty stipulation those just concession to commerce which the nation of the world have a right to expect and which china can not long be permit to withhold from assurance receive i entertain no doubt that the three minister will act in harmonious concert to obtain similar commercial treaty for each of the power they represent we can not fail to feel a deep interest in all that concern the welfare of the independent republic on we own continent as well as of the empire of brazil we difficulty with new granada which a short time since bear so threaten a aspect be it be to be hope in a fair train of settlement in a manner just and honorable to both party the isthmus of central america include that of panama be the great highway between the atlantic and pacific over which a large portion of the commerce of the world be destine to pass the united state be more deeply interested than any other nation in preserve the freedom and security of all the communication across this isthmus it be we duty therefore to take care that they shall not be interrupted either by invasion from we own country or by war between the independent state of central america under we treaty with new granada of the 12th December 1846 we be bind to guarantee the neutrality of the isthmus of panama through which the panama railroad pass as well as the rights of sovereignty and property which new granada have and possess over the say territory this obligation be found upon equivalent grant by the treaty to the government and people of the united state under these circumstance i recommend to congress the passage of a act authorize the president in case of necessity to employ the land and naval force of the united state to carry into effect this guaranty of neutrality and protection i also recommend similar legislation for the security of any other route across the isthmus in which we may acquire a interest by treaty with the independent republic on this continent it be both we duty and we interest to cultivate the most friendly relation we can never feel indifferent to they fate and must always rejoice in they prosperity unfortunately both for they and for we we example and advice have lose much of they influence in consequence of the lawless expedition which have be fit out against some of they within the limit of we country nothing be better calculate to retard we steady material progress or impair we character as a nation than the toleration of such enterprise in violation of the law of nation it be one of the first and highest duty of any independent state in its relation with the member of the great family of nation to restrain its people from act of hostile aggression against they citizen or subject the most eminent writer on public law do not hesitate to denounce such hostile act as robbery and murder weak and feeble state like those of central america may not feel themselves able to assert and vindicate they rights the case would be far different if expedition be set on foot within we own territory to make private war against a powerful nation if such expedition be fit out from abroad against any portion of we own country to burn down we city murder and plunder we people and usurp we government we should call any power on earth to the strictest account for not prevent such enormity ever since the administration of general washington act of congress have be enforce to punish severely the crime of set on foot a military expedition within the limit of the united state to proceed from thence against a nation or state with whom we be at peace the present neutrality act of April 20 1818 be but little more than a collection of preexist law under this act the president be empower to employ the land and naval force and the militia for the purpose of prevent the carry on of any such expedition or enterprise from the territory and jurisdiction of the united state and the collector of custom be authorize and require to detain any vessel in port when there be reason to believe she be about to take part in such lawless enterprise when it be first render probable that a attempt would be make to get up another unlawful expedition against nicaragua the secretary of state issue instruction to the marshal and district attorney which be direct by the secretary of war and the navy to the appropriate army and navy officer require they to be vigilant and to use they best exertion in carry into effect the provision of the act of 1818 notwithstanding these precaution the expedition have escape from we shore such enterprise can do no possible good to the country but have already inflict much injury both on its interest and its character they have prevent peaceful emigration from the united state to the state of central america which could not fail to prove highly beneficial to all the party concern in a pecuniary point of view alone we citizen have sustain heavy loss from the seizure and closing of the transit route by the san juan between the two ocean the leader of the recent expedition be arrest at new orlean but be discharge on give bail for he appearance in the insufficient sum of $ 2000 i commend the whole subject to the serious attention of congress believe that we duty and we interest as well as we national character require that we should adopt such measure as will be effectual in restrain we citizen from commit such outrage i regret to inform you that the president of paraguay have refuse to ratify the treaty between the united state and that state as amend by the senate the signature of which be mention in the message of my predecessor to congress at the opening of its session in December 1853 the reason assign for this refusal will appear in the correspondence herewith submit it be desirable to ascertain the fitness of the river la plata and its tributary for navigation by steam the united state steamer _ water witch _ be send thither for that purpose in 1853 this enterprise be successfully carry on until February 1855 when whilst in the peaceful prosecution of she voyage up the parana river the steamer be fire upon by a paraguayan fort the fire be return but as the _ water witch _ be of small force and not design for offensive operation she retire from the conflict the pretext upon which the attack be make be a decree of the president of paraguay of October 1854 prohibit foreign vessel of war from navigate the river of that state as paraguay however be the owner of but one bank of the river of that name the other belong to coriente a state of the argentine confederation the right of its government to expect that such a decree would be obey can not be acknowledge but the _ water witch _ be not properly speak a vessel of war she be a small steamer engage in a scientific enterprise intend for the advantage of commercial state generally under these circumstance i be constrain to consider the attack upon she as unjustifiable and as call for satisfaction from the paraguayan government citizen of the united state also who be establish in business in paraguay have have they property seize and take from they and have otherwise be treat by the authority in a insulting and arbitrary manner which require redress a demand for these purpose will be make in a firm but conciliatory spirit this will the more probably be grant if the executive shall have authority to use other means in the event of a refusal this be accordingly recommend it be unnecessary to state in detail the alarming condition of the territory of kansa at the time of my inauguration the oppose party then stand in hostile array against each other and any accident might have relight the flame of civil war besides at this critical moment kansa be leave without a governor by the resignation of governor geary on the 19th of February previous the territorial legislature have pass a law provide for the election of delegate on the third Monday of June to a convention to meet on the first Monday of September for the purpose of frame a constitution preparatory to admission into the union this law be in the main fair and just and it be to be regret that all the qualify elector have not register themselves and vote under its provision at the time of the election for delegate a extensive organization exist in the territory whose avowed object it be if need be to put down the lawful government by force and to establish a government of they own under the so-called topeka constitution the person attach to this revolutionary organization abstain from take any part in the election the act of the territorial legislature have omit to provide for submit to the people the constitution which might be frame by the convention and in the excited state of public feeling throughout kansas a apprehension extensively prevail that a design exist to force upon they a constitution in relation to slavery against they will in this emergency it become my duty as it be my unquestionable right have in view the union of all good citizen in support of the territorial law to express a opinion on the true construction of the provision concern slavery contain in the organic act of congress of the 30th may 1854 congress declare it to be the true intent and meaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate they domestic institution in they own way under it kansa when admit as a state be to be receive into the union with or without slavery as they constitution may prescribe at the time of they admission do congress mean by this language that the delegate elect to frame a constitution should have authority finally to decide the question of slavery or do they intend by leave it to the people that the people of kansas themselves should decide this question by a direct vote on this subject i confess i have never entertain a serious doubt and therefore in my instruction to governor walker of the 28th march last i merely say that when a constitution shall be submit to the people of the territory they must be protect in the exercise of they right of vote for or against that instrument and the fair expression of the popular will must not be interrupt by fraud or violence in express this opinion it be far from my intention to interfere with the decision of the people of kansas either for or against slavery from this i have always carefully abstain intrust with the duty of take care that the law be faithfully execute my only desire be that the people of kansa should furnish to congress the evidence require by the organic act whether for or against slavery and in this manner smooth they passage into the union in emerge from the condition of territorial dependence into that of a sovereign state it be they duty in my opinion to make know they will by the vote of the majority on the direct question whether this important domestic institution should or should not continue to exist indeed this be the only possible mode in which they will could be authentically ascertain the election of delegate to a convention must necessarily take place in separate district from this cause it may readily happen as have often be the case that a majority of the people of a state or territory be on one side of a question whilst a majority of the representative from the several district into which it be divide may be upon the other side this arise from the fact that in some district delegate may be elect by small majority whilst in other those of different sentiment may receive majority sufficiently great not only to overcome the vote give for the former but to leave a large majority of the whole people in direct opposition to a majority of the delegate besides we history prove that influence may be bring to bear on the representative sufficiently powerful to induce he to disregard the will of he constituent the truth be that no other authentic and satisfactory mode exist of ascertain the will of a majority of the people of any state or territory on a important and exciting question like that of slavery in kansas except by leave it to a direct vote how wise then be it for congress to pass over all subordinate and intermediate agency and proceed directly to the source of all legitimate power under we institution how vain would any other principle prove in practice this may be illustrate by the case of kansa should she be admit into the union with a constitution either maintain or abolish slavery against the sentiment of the people this could have no other effect than to continue and to exasperate the exist agitation during the brief period require to make the constitution conform to the irresistible will of the majority the friend and supporter of the nebraska and kansa act when struggle on a recent occasion to sustain its wise provision before the great tribunal of the american people never differ about its true meaning on this subject everywhere throughout the union they publicly pledge they faith and they honor that they would cheerfully submit the question of slavery to the decision of the _ bona fide _ people of kansa without any restriction or qualification whatever all be cordially unite upon the great doctrine of popular sovereignty which be the vital principle of we free institution have it then be insinuate from any quarter that it would be a sufficient compliance with the requisition of the organic law for the member of a convention thereafter to be elect to withhold the question of slavery from the people and to substitute they own will for that of a legally ascertain majority of all they constituent this would have be instantly reject everywhere they remain true to the resolution adopt on a celebrated occasion recognize the right of the people of all the territory include kansa and nebraska act through the legally and fairly express will of a majority of actual resident and whenever the number of they inhabitant justify it to form a constitution with or without slavery and be admit into the union upon term of perfect equality with the other state the convention to frame a constitution for kansa meet on the first Monday of September last they be call together by virtue of a act of the territorial legislature whose lawful existence have be recognize by congress in different form and by different enactment a large proportion of the citizen of kansa do not think proper to register they name and to vote at the election for delegate but a opportunity to do this have be fairly afford they refusal to avail themselves of they right could in no manner affect the legality of the convention this convention proceed to frame a constitution for kansa and finally adjourn on the 7th day of November but little difficulty occur in the convention except on the subject of slavery the truth be that the general provision of we recent state constitution be so similar and i may add so excellent that the difference between they be not essential under the earlier practice of the government no constitution frame by the convention of a territory preparatory to its admission into the union as a state have be submit to the people i trust however the example set by the last congress require that the constitution of minnesota should be subject to the approval and ratification of the people of the proposed state may be follow on future occasion i take it for grant that the convention of kansa would act in accordance with this example found as it be on correct principle and hence my instruction to governor walker in favor of submit the constitution to the people be express in general and unqualified term in the kansas-nebraska act however this requirement as applicable to the whole constitution have not be insert and the convention be not bind by its term to submit any other portion of the instrument to a election except that which relate to the domestic institution of slavery this will be render clear by a simple reference to its language it be not to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate they domestic institution in they own way accord to the plain construction of the sentence the word domestic institution have a direct as they have a appropriate reference to slavery domestic institution be limit to the family the relation between master and slave and a few other be domestic institution and be entirely distinct from institution of a political character besides there be no question then before congress nor indeed have there since be any serious question before the people of kansa or the country except that which relate to the domestic institution of slavery the convention after a angry and excited debate finally determine by a majority of only two to submit the question of slavery to the people though at the last forty-three of the fifty delegate present affix they signature to the constitution a large majority of the convention be in favor of establish slavery in kansas they accordingly insert a article in the constitution for this purpose similar in form to those which have be adopt by other territorial convention in the schedule however provide for the transition from a territorial to a state government the question have be fairly and explicitly refer to the people whether they will have a constitution with or without slavery it declare that before the constitution adopt by the convention shall be send to congress for admission into the union as a state a election shall be hold to decide this question at which all the white male inhabitant of the territory above the age of 21 be entitle to vote they be to vote by ballot and the ballot cast at say election shall be indorse ` constitution with slavery ' and ` constitution with no slavery ' if there be a majority in favor of the constitution with slavery then it be to be transmit to congress by the president of the convention in its original form if on the contrary there shall be a majority in favor of the constitution with no slavery then the article provide for slavery shall be stricken from the constitution by the president of this convention and it be expressly declare that no slavery shall exist in the state of kansas except that the right of property in slave now in the territory shall in no manner be interfere with and in that event it be make he duty to have the constitution thus ratify transmit to the congress of the united state for the admission of the state into the union at this election every citizen will have a opportunity of express he opinion by he vote whether kansa shall be receive into the union with or without slavery and thus this exciting question may be peacefully settle in the very mode require by the organic law the election will be hold under legitimate authority and if any portion of the inhabitant shall refuse to vote a fair opportunity to do so have be present this will be they own voluntary act and they alone will be responsible for the consequence whether kansa shall be a free or a slave state must eventually under some authority be decide by a election and the question can never be more clearly or distinctly present to the people than it be at the present moment should this opportunity be reject she may be involve for year in domestic discord and possibly in civil war before she can again make up the issue now so fortunately tender and again reach the point she have already attain kansa have for some year occupy too much of the public attention it be high time this should be direct to far more important object when once admit into the union whether with or without slavery the excitement beyond she own limit will speedily pass away and she will then for the first time be leave as she ought to have be long since to manage she own affair in she own way if she constitution on the subject of slavery or on any other subject be displease to a majority of the people no human power can prevent they from change it within a brief period under these circumstance it may well be question whether the peace and quiet of the whole country be not of greater importance than the mere temporary triumph of either of the political party in kansa should the constitution without slavery be adopt by the vote of the majority the rights of property in slave now in the territory be reserve the number of these be very small but if it be greater the provision would be equally just and reasonable the slave be bring into the territory under the constitution of the united state and be now the property of they master this point have at length be finally decide by the highest judicial tribunal of the country and this upon the plain principle that when a confederacy of sovereign state acquire a new territory at they joint expense both equality and justice demand that the citizen of one and all of they shall have the right to take into it whatsoever be recognize as property by the common constitution to have summarily confiscate the property in slave already in the territory would have be a act of gross injustice and contrary to the practice of the older state of the union which have abolish slavery a territorial government be establish for utah by act of congress approve the 9th September 1850 and the constitution and law of the united state be thereby extend over it so far as the same or any provision thereof may be applicable this act provide for the appointment by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate of a governor -lrb- who be to be _ ex officio _ superintendent of indian affair -rrb- a secretary three judge of the supreme court a marshal and a district attorney subsequent act provide for the appointment of the officer necessary to extend we land and we indian system over the territory brigham young be appoint the first governor on the 20th September 1850 and have hold the office ever since whilst governor young have be both governor and superintendent of indian affair throughout this period he have be at the same time the head of the church call the latter-day saint and profess to govern its member and dispose of they property by direct inspiration and authority from the almighty he power have be therefore absolute over both church and state the people of utah almost exclusively belong to this church and believe with a fanatical spirit that he be governor of the territory by divine appointment they obey he command as if these be direct revelation from heaven if therefore he choose that he government shall come into collision with the government of the united state the member of the mormon church will yield implicit obedience to he will unfortunately exist fact leave but little doubt that such be he determination without enter upon a minute history of occurrence it be sufficient to say that all the officer of the united state judicial and executive with the single exception of two indian agent have find it necessary for they own personal safety to withdraw from the territory and there no longer remain any government in utah but the despotism of brigham young this be the condition of affair in the territory i could not mistake the path of duty as chief executive magistrate i be bind to restore the supremacy of the constitution and law within its limit in order to effect this purpose i appoint a new governor and other federal officer for utah and send with they a military force for they protection and to aid as a _ posse comitatus _ in case of need in the execution of the law with the religious opinion of the mormon as long as they remain mere opinion however deplorable in themselves and revolt to the moral and religious sentiment of all christendom i have no right to interfere action alone when in violation of the constitution and law of the united state become the legitimate subject for the jurisdiction of the civil magistrate my instruction to governor cumming have therefore be frame in strict accordance with these principle at they date a hope be indulge that no necessity might exist for employ the military in restore and maintain the authority of the law but this hope have now vanish governor young have by proclamation declare he determination to maintain he power by force and have already commit act of hostility against the united state unless he should retrace he step the territory of utah will be in a state of open rebellion he have commit these act of hostility notwithstanding major van vliet a officer of the army send to utah by the commanding general to purchase provision for the troops have give he the strongest assurance of the peaceful intention of the government and that the troops would only be employ as a _ posse comitatus _ when call on by the civil authority to aid in the execution of the law there be reason to believe that governor young have long contemplate this result he know that the continuance of he despotic power depend upon the exclusion of all settler from the territory except those who will acknowledge he divine mission and implicitly obey he will and that a enlighten public opinion there would soon prostrate institution at war with the law both of god and man he have therefore for several year in order to maintain he independence be industriously employ in collect and fabricate arm and munitions of war and in discipline the mormon for military service as superintendent of indian affair he have have a opportunity of tamper with the indian tribe and exciting they hostile feeling against the united state this accord to we information he have accomplish in regard to some of these tribe while other have remain true to they allegiance and have communicate he intrigue to we indian agent he have lay in a store of provision for three year which in case of necessity as he inform major van vliet he will conceal and then take to the mountain and bid defiance to all the power of the government a great part of all this may be idle boasting but yet no wise government will lightly estimate the effort which may be inspire by such frenzied fanaticism as exist among the mormon in utah this be the first rebellion which have exist in we territory and humanity itself require that we should put it down in such a manner that it shall be the last to trifle with it would be to encourage it and to render it formidable we ought to go there with such a impose force as to convince these deluded people that resistance would be vain and thus spare the effusion of blood we can in this manner best convince they that we be they friend not they enemy in order to accomplish this object it will be necessary accord to the estimate of the war department to raise four additional regiment and this i earnestly recommend to congress at the present moment of depression in the revenue of the country i be sorry to be oblige to recommend such a measure but i feel confident of the support of congress cost what it may in suppress the insurrection and in restore and maintain the sovereignty of the constitution and law over the territory of utah i recommend to congress the establishment of a territorial government over arizona incorporate with it such portion of new mexico as they may deem expedient i need scarcely adduce argument in support of this recommendation we be bind to protect the life and the property of we citizen inhabit arizona and these be now without any efficient protection they present number be already considerable and be rapidly increase notwithstanding the disadvantage under which they labor besides the propose territory be believe to be rich in mineral and agricultural resource especially in silver and copper the mail of the united state to californium be now carry over it throughout its whole extent and this route be know to be the nearest and believe to be the best to the pacific long experience have deeply convinced I that a strict construction of the power grant to congress be the only true as well as the only safe theory of the constitution whilst this principle shall guide my public conduct i consider it clear that under the war-making power congress may appropriate money for the construction of a military road through the territory of the united state when this be absolutely necessary for the defense of any of the state against foreign invasion the constitution have confer upon congress power to declare war to raise and support army to provide and maintain a navy and to call forth the militia to repel invasion these high sovereign power necessarily involve important and responsible public duty and among they there be none so sacred and so imperative as that of preserve we soil from the invasion of a foreign enemy the constitution have therefore leave nothing on this point to construction but expressly require that the united state shall protect each of they -lrb- the state -rrb- against invasion now if a military road over we own territory be indispensably necessary to enable we to meet and repel the invader it follow as a necessary consequence not only that we possess the power but it be we imperative duty to construct such a road it would be a absurdity to invest a government with the unlimited power to make and conduct war and at the same time deny to it the only means of reach and defeat the enemy at the frontier without such a road it be quite evident we can not protect californium and we pacific possession against invasion we can not by any other means transport man and munitions of war from the atlantic state in sufficient time successfully to defend these remote and distant portion of the republic experience have prove that the route across the isthmus of central america be at best but a very uncertain and unreliable mode of communication but even if this be not the case they would at once be close against we in the event of war with a naval power so much stronger than we own as to enable it to blockade the port at either end of these route after all therefore we can only rely upon a military road through we own territory and ever since the origin of the government congress have be in the practice of appropriate money from the public treasury for the construction of such road the difficulty and the expense of construct a military railroad to connect we atlantic and pacific state have be greatly exaggerate the distance on the arizona route near the thirty-second parallel of north latitude between the western boundary of texa on the rio grande and the eastern boundary of californium on the colorado from the best exploration now within we knowledge do not exceed 470 mile and the face of the country be in the main favorable for obvious reason the government ought not to undertake the work itself by means of its own agent this ought to be commit to other agency which congress might assist either by grant of land or money or by both upon such term and condition as they may deem most beneficial for the country provision might thus be make not only for the safe rapid and economical transportation of troops and munitions of war but also of the public mail the commercial interest of the whole country both east and west would be greatly promote by such a road and above all it would be a powerful additional bond of union and although advantage of this kind whether postal commercial or political can not confer constitutional power yet they may furnish auxiliary argument in favor of expedite a work which in my judgment be clearly embrace within the war-making power for these reason i commend to the friendly consideration of congress the subject of the pacific railroad without finally commit myself to any particular route the report of the secretary of the treasury will furnish a detailed statement of the condition of the public finances and of the respective branch of the public service devolve upon that department of the government by this report it appear that the amount of revenue receive from all source into the treasury during the fiscal year end the 30th June 1857 be $ 6863151367 which amount with the balance of $ 1990132545

expenditure for the remain three quarter of the present fiscal year will in all probability be increase from the cause set forth in the report of the secretary he suggestion therefore that authority should be give to supply any temporary deficiency by the issue of a limited amount of treasury note be approve and i accordingly recommend the passage of such a law as state in the report of the secretary the tariff of march 3 1857 have be in operation for so short a period of time and under circumstance so unfavorable to a just development of its result as a revenue measure that i should regard it as inexpedient at least for the present to undertake its revision i transmit herewith the report make to I by the secretary of war and of the navy of the interior and of the postmaster-general they all contain valuable and important information and suggestion which i commend to the favorable consideration of congress i have already recommend the raising of four additional regiment and the report of the secretary of war present strong reason prove this increase of the army under exist circumstance to be indispensable i would call the special attention of congress to the recommendation of the secretary of the navy in favor of the construction of ten small war steamer of light draft for some year the government have be oblige on many occasion to hire such steamer from individual to supply its press want at the present moment we have no armed vessel in the navy which can penetrate the river of china we have but few which can enter any of the harbor south of norfolk although many million of foreign and domestic commerce annually pass in and out of these harbor some of we most valuable interest and most vulnerable point be thus leave expose this class of vessel of light draft great speed and heavy gun would be formidable in coast defense the cost of they construction will not be great and they will require but a comparatively small expenditure to keep they in commission in time of peace they will prove as effective as much larger vessel and more useful one of they should be at every station where we maintain a squadron and three or four should be constantly employ on we atlantic and pacific coast economy utility and efficiency combine to recommend they as almost indispensable ten of these small vessel would be of incalculable advantage to the naval service and the whole cost of they construction would not exceed $ 2300000 or $ 230000 each the report of the secretary of the interior be worthy of grave consideration it treat of the numerous important and diversified branch of domestic administration intrust to he by law among these the most prominent be the public land and we relation with the indian we system for the disposal of the public land originate with the father of the republic have be improve as experience point the way and gradually adapt to the growth and settlement of we western state and territory it have work well in practice already thirteen state and seven territory have be carve out of these land and still more than a thousand million of acre remain unsold what a boundless prospect this present to we country of future prosperity and power we have heretofore dispose of 363862464 acre of the public land whilst the public land as a source of revenue be of great importance they importance be far greater as furnish home for a hardy and independent race of honest and industrious citizen who desire to subdue and cultivate the soil they ought to be administer mainly with a view of promote this wise and benevolent policy in appropriate they for any other purpose we ought to use even greater economy than if they have be convert into money and the proceeds be already in the public treasury to squander away this richest and noblest inheritance which any people have ever enjoy upon object of doubtful constitutionality or expediency would be to violate one of the most important trust ever commit to any people whilst i do not deny to congress the power when act _ bona fide _ as a proprietor to give away portion of they for the purpose of increase the value of the remainder yet consider the great temptation to abuse this power we can not be too cautious in its exercise actual settler under exist law be protect against other purchaser at the public sale in they right of preemption to the extent of a quarter section or 160 acre of land the remainder may then be dispose of at public or enter at private sale in unlimited quantity speculation have of late year prevail to a great extent in the public land the consequence have be that large portion of they have become the property of individual and company and thus the price be greatly enhance to those who desire to purchase for actual settlement in order to limit the area of speculation as much as possible the extinction of the indian title and the extension of the public survey ought only to keep pace with the tide of emigration if congress should hereafter grant alternate section to state or company as they have do heretofore i recommend that the intermediate section retain by the government should be subject to preemption by actual settler it ought ever to be we cardinal policy to reserve the public land as much as may be for actual settler and this at moderate price we shall thus not only best promote the prosperity of the new state and territory and the power of the union but shall secure home for we posterity for many generation the extension of we limit have bring within we jurisdiction many additional and populous tribe of indian a large proportion of which be wild untractable and difficult to control predatory and warlike in they disposition and habit it be impossible altogether to restrain they from commit aggression on each other as well as upon we frontier citizen and those emigrate to we distant state and territory hence expensive military expedition be frequently necessary to overawe and chastise the more lawless and hostile the present system of make they valuable present to influence they to remain at peace have prove ineffectual it be believe to be the better policy to colonize they in suitable locality where they can receive the rudiment of education and be gradually induce to adopt habit of industry so far as the experiment have be try it have work well in practice and it will doubtless prove to be less expensive than the present system the whole number of indian within we territorial limit be believe to be from the best datum in the interior department about 325000 the tribe of cherokee choctaw chickasaw and creek settle in the territory set apart for they west of arkansa be rapidly advance in education and in all the art of civilization and self-government and we may indulge the agreeable anticipation that at no very distant day they will be incorporate into the union as one of the sovereign state it will be see from the report of the postmaster-general that the post-office department still continue to depend on the treasury as it have be compel to do for several year past for a important portion of the means of sustain and extend its operation they rapid growth and expansion be show by a decennial statement of the number of post-office and the length of post-roads commence with the year 1827 in that year there be 7000 post-office in 1837 11177 in 1847 15146 and in 1857 they number 26586 in this year 1725 post-office have be establish and 704 discontinue leave a net increase of 1021 the postmaster of 368 office be appoint by the president the length of post-road in 1827 be 105336 mile in 1837141242 mile in 1847153818 mile and in the year 1857 there be 242601 mile of post-road include 22530 mile of railroad on which the mail be transport the expenditure of the department for the fiscal year end on the 30th June 1857 as adjust by the auditor amount to $ 11507670 to defray these expenditure there be to the credit of the department on the 1st July 1856 the sum of $ 789599 the gross revenue of the year include the annual allowance for the transportation of free mail matter produce $ 8053951 and the remainder be supply by the appropriation from the treasury of $ 2250000 grant by the act of congress approve August 18 1856 and by the appropriation of $ 666883 make by the act of march 3 1857 leave $ 252763 to be carry to the credit of the department in the account of the current year i commend to you consideration the report of the department in relation to the establishment of the overland mail route from the mississippus river to san francisco cal the route be select with my full concurrence as the one in my judgment best calculate to attain the important object contemplate by congress the late disastrous monetary revulsion may have one good effect should it cause both the government and the people to return to the practice of a wise and judicious economy both in public and private expenditure a overflow treasury have lead to habit of prodigality and extravagance in we legislation it have induce congress to make large appropriation to object for which they never would have provide have it be necessary to raise the amount of revenue require to meet they by increase taxation or by loan we be now compel to pause in we career and to scrutinize we expenditure with the utmost vigilance and in perform this duty i pledge my cooperation to the extent of my constitutional competency it ought to be observe at the same time that true public economy do not consist in withhold the means necessary to accomplish important national object intrust to we by the constitution and especially such as may be necessary for the common defense in the present crisis of the country it be we duty to confine we appropriation to object of this character unless in case where justice to individual may demand a different course in all case care ought to be take that the money grant by congress shall be faithfully and economically apply under the federal constitution every bill which shall have pass the house of representative and the senate shall before it become a law be approve and sign by the president and if not approve he shall return it with he objection to that house in which it shall have originate in order to perform this high and responsible duty sufficient time must be allow the president to read and examine every bill present to he for approval unless this be afford the constitution become a dead letter in this particular and even worse it become a means of deception we constituent see the president 's approval and signature attach to each act of congress be induce to believe that he have actually perform he duty when in truth nothing be in many case more unfounded from the practice of congress such a examination of each bill as the constitution require have be render impossible the most important business of each session be generally crowd into its last hour and the alternative present to the president be either to violate the constitutional duty which he owe to the people and approve bill which for want of time it be impossible he should have examine or by he refusal to do this subject the country and individual to great loss and inconvenience besides a practice have grow up of late year to legislate in appropriation bill at the last hour of the session on new and important subject this practice constrain the president either to suffer measure to become law which he do not approve or to incur the risk of stop the wheel of the government by veto a appropriation bill formerly such bill be confine to specific appropriation for carry into effect exist law and the well-established policy of the country and little time be then require by the president for they examination for my own part i have deliberately determine that i shall approve no bill which i have not examine and it will be a case of extreme and most urgent necessity which shall ever induce I to depart from this rule i therefore respectfully but earnestly recommend that the two house would allow the president at least two day previous to the adjournment of each session within which no new bill shall be present to he for approval under the exist joint rule one day be allow but this rule have be hitherto so constantly suspend in practice that important bill continue to be present to he up till the very last moment of the session in a large majority of case no great public inconvenience can arise from the want of time to examine they provision because the constitution have declare that if a bill be present to the president within the last ten day of the session he be not require to return it either with a approval or with a veto in which case it shall not be a law it may then lie over and be take up and pass at the next session great inconvenience would only be experience in regard to appropriation bill but fortunately under the late excellent law allow a salary instead of a per diem to member of congress the expense and inconvenience of a call session will be greatly reduce i can not conclude without commend to you favorable consideration the interest of the people of this district without a representative on the floor of congress they have for this very reason peculiar claim upon we just regard to this i know from my long acquaintance

recent arrest of william walker and he follower by captain paulding within the territory of that republic jame buchanan washington city _ January 7 1858 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : i

communicate to the senate the correspondence instruction and order to the united state naval force on the coast of central america connect with the arrest of william walker and he associate etc in submit to the senate the papers for which they have call i deem it proper to make a few observation in capture general walker and he command after they have land on the soil of nicaragua commodore paulding have in my opinion commit a grave error it be quite evident however from the communication herewith transmit that this be do from pure and patriotic motive and in the sincere conviction that he be promote the interest and vindicate the honor of he country in regard to nicaragua she have sustain no injury by the act of commodore paulding this have inure to she benefit and relieved she from a dreaded invasion she alone would have any right to complain of the violation of she territory and it be quite certain she will never exercise this right it unquestionably do not lie in the mouth of she invader to complain in she name that she have be rescue by commodore paulding from they assault the error of this gallant officer consist in exceed he instruction and land he sailor and marine in nicaragua whether with or without she consent for the purpose of make war upon any military force whatever which he might find in the country no matter from whence they come this power certainly do not belong to he obedience to law and conformity to instruction be the best and safest guide for all officer civil and military and when they transcend these limit and act upon they own personal responsibility evil consequence almost inevitably follow under these circumstance when marshal rynder present himself at the state department on the 29th ultimo with general walker in custody the secretary inform he that the executive department of the government do not recognize general walker as a prisoner that it have no direction to give concern he and that it be only through the action of the judiciary that he could be lawfully hold in custody to answer any charge that might be bring against he in thus far disapprove the conduct of commodore paulding no inference must be draw that i be less determine than i have ever be to execute the neutrality law of the united state this be my imperative duty and i shall continue to perform it by all the means which the constitution and the law have place in my power my opinion of the value and importance of these law correspond entirely with that express by mr monroe in he message to congress of December 7 1819 that wise prudent and patriotic statesman say : it be of the highest importance to we national character and indispensable to the morality of we citizen that all violation of we neutrality should be prevent no door should be leave open for the evasion of we law no opportunity afford to any who may be dispose to take advantage of it to compromit the interest or the honor of the nation the crime of set on foot or provide the means for a military expedition within the united state to make war against a foreign state with which we be at peace be one of a aggravate and dangerous character and early engage the attention of congress whether the executive government possess any or what power under the constitution independently of congress to prevent or punish this and similar offens against the law of nation be a subject which engage the attention of we most eminent statesman in the time of the administration of general washington and on the occasion of the french revolution the act of congress of the 5th of June 1794 fortunately remove all the difficulty on this question which have theretofore exist the fifth and seventh section of this act which relate to the present question be the same in substance with the sixth and eighth section of the act of April 20 1818 and have now be in force for a period more than sixty year the military expedition render criminal by the act must have its origin must begin or be set on foot in the united state but the great object of the law be to save foreign state with whom we be at peace from the ravages of these lawless expedition proceed from we shore the seventh section alone therefore which simply define the crime and its punishment would have be inadequate to accomplish this purpose and enforce we international duty in order to render the law effectual it be necessary to prevent the carry on of such expedition to they consummation after they have succeed in leave we shore this have be do effectually and in clear and explicit language by the authority give to the president under the eighth section of the act to employ the land and naval force of the united state for the purpose of prevent the carry on of any such expedition or enterprise from the territory or jurisdiction of the united state against the territory or dominion of any foreign prince or state or of any colony district or people with whom the united state be at peace for these reason have commodore paulding intercept the steamer _ fashion _ with general walker and he command on board at any period before they enter the port of san juan de nicaragua and conduct they back to mobile this would have prevent they from carry on the expedition and have be not only a justifiable but a praiseworthy act the crime well deserve the punishment inflict upon it by we law it violate the principle of christianity morality and humanity hold sacred by all civilized nation and by none more than by the people of the united state disguise it as we may such a military expedition be a invitation to reckless and lawless man to enlist under the banner of any adventurer to rob plunder and murder the unoffending citizen of neighbor state who have never do they harm it be a usurpation of the war-making power which belong alone to congress and the government itself at least in the estimation of the world become a accomplice in the commission of this crime unless it adopt all the means necessary to prevent and to punish it it would be far better and more in accordance with the bold and manly character of we countryman for the government itself to get up such expedition than to allow they to proceed under the command of irresponsible adventurer we could then at least exercise some control over we own agent and prevent they from burn down city and commit other act of enormity of which we have read the avowed principle which lie at the foundation of the law of nation be contain in the divine command that all thing whatsoever ye would that man should do to you do ye even so to they try by this unerring rule we should be severely condemn if we shall not use we best exertion to arrest such expedition against we feeble sister republic of nicaragua one thing be very certain that a people never exist who would call any other nation to a stricter account than we should ourselves for tolerate lawless expedition from they shore to make war upon any portion of we territory by tolerate such expedition we shall soon lose the high character which we have enjoy ever since the day of washington for the faithful performance of we international obligation and duty and inspire distrust against we among the member of the great family of civilized nation but if motive of duty be not sufficient to restrain we from engage in such lawless enterprise we evident interest ought to dictate this policy these expedition be the most effectual mode of retard american progress although to promote this be the avowed object of the leader and contributor in such undertaking it be beyond question the destiny of we race to spread themselves over the continent of north america and this at no distant day should event be permit to take they natural course the tide of emigrant will flow to the south and nothing can eventually arrest its progress if permit to go there peacefully central america will soon contain a american population which will confer blessing and benefit as well upon the native as they respective government liberty under the restraint of law will preserve domestic peace whilst the different transit route across the isthmus in which we be so deeply interested will have assure protection nothing have retard this happy condition of affair so much as the unlawful expedition which have be fit out in the united state to make war upon the central american state have one-half the number of american citizen who have miserably perish in the first disastrous expedition of general walker settle in nicaragua as peaceful emigrant the object which we all desire would ere this have be in a great degree accomplish these expedition have cause the people of the central american state to regard we with dread and suspicion it be we true policy to remove this apprehension and to convince they that we intend to do they good and not evil we desire as the lead power on this continent to open and if need be to protect every transit route across the isthmus not only for we own benefit but that of the world and thus open a free access to central america and through it to we pacific possession this policy be commence under favorable auspices when the expedition under the command of general walker escape from we territory and proceed to punta arena should another expedition of a similar character again evade the vigilance of we officer and proceed to nicaragua this would be fatal at least for a season to the peaceful settlement of these country and to the policy of american progress the truth be that no administration can successfully conduct the foreign affair of the country in central america or anywhere else if it be to be interfere with at every step by lawless military expedition set on foot in

kansa this arise from the difficulty of induce the american people to realize the fact that any portion of they should be in a state of rebellion against the government under which they live when we speak of the affair of kansas we be apt to refer merely to the existence of two violent political party in that territory divide on the question of slavery just as we speak of such party in the state

against its authority they have all the time be endeavor to subvert it and to establish a revolutionary government under the so-called topeka constitution in its stead even at this very moment the topeka legislature be in session whoever have read the correspondence of governor walker with the state department recently communicate to the senate will be convince that this picture be not overdrawn he always protest against the withdrawal of any portion of the military force of the united state from the territory deem its presence absolutely necessary for the preservation of the regular government and the execution of the law in he very first dispatch to the secretary of state date June 2 1857 he say : the most alarming movement however proceed from the assemble on the 9th June of the so-called topeka legislature with a view to the enactment of a entire code of law of course it will be my endeavor to prevent such a result as it would lead to inevitable and disastrous collision and in fact renew the civil war in kansa this be with difficulty prevent by the effort of governor walker but soon thereafter on the 14th of July we find he request general harney to furnish he a regiment of dragoon to proceed to the city of lawrence and this for the reason that he have receive authentic intelligence verify by he own actual observation that a dangerous rebellion have occur involve a open defiance of the law and the establishment of a insurgent government in that city in the governor 's dispatch of July 15 he inform the secretary of state that -- this movement at lawrence be the beginning of a plan originate in that city to organize insurrection throughout the territory and especially in all town city or county where the republican party have a majority lawrence be the hotb of all the abolition movement in this territory it be the town establish by the abolition society of the east and whilst there be respectable people there it be fill by a considerable number of mercenary who be pay by abolition society to perpetuate and diffuse agitation throughout kansa and prevent a peaceful settlement of this question have fail in induce they own so-called topeka state legislature to organize this insurrection lawrence have commence it herself and if not arrest the rebellion will extend throughout the territory and again : in order to send this communication immediately by mail i must close by assure you that the spirit of rebellion pervade the great mass of the republican party of this territory instigate as i entertain no doubt they be by eastern society have in view result most disastrous to the government and to the union and that the continue presence of general harney here be indispensable as originally stipulate by I with a large body of dragoon and several battery on the 20th July 1857 general lane under the authority of the topeka convention undertake as governor walker inform we -- to organize the whole so-called free-state party into volunteer and to take the name of all who refuse enrollment the profess object be to protect the poll at the election in August of the new insurgent topeka state legislature \* \* \* \* \* the object of take the name of all who refuse enrollment be to terrify the free-state conservative into submission this be prove by recent atrocity commit on such man by topekaite the speedy location of large body of regular troops here with two battery be necessary the lawrence insurgent await the development of this new revolutionary military organization in the governor 's dispatch of July 27 he say that general lane and he staff everywhere deny the authority of the territorial law and counsel a total disregard of these enactment without make further quotation of a similar character from other dispatch of governor walker it appear by a reference to mr stanton 's communication to general cass of the 9th of December last that the important step of call the legislature together be take after i -lrb- he -rrb- have become satisfied that the election order by the convention on the 21st instant could not be conduct without collision and bloodsh so intense be the disloyal feeling among the enemy of the government establish by congress that a election which afford they a opportunity if in the majority of make kansa a free state accord to they own profess desire could not be conduct without collision and bloodsh the truth be that up till the present moment the enemy of the exist government still adhere to they topeka revolutionary constitution and government the very first paragraph of the message of governor robinson date on the 7th of December to the topeka legislature now assemble at lawrence contain a open defiance of the constitution and law of the united state the governor say : the convention which frame the constitution at topeka originate with the people of kansas territory they have adopt and ratify the same twice by a direct vote and also indirectly through two election of state officer and member of the state legislature yet it have please the administration to regard the whole proceeding revolutionary this topeka government adhere to with such treasonable pertinacity be a government in direct opposition to the existing government prescribe and recognize by congress it be a usurpation of the same character as it would be for a portion of the people of any state of the union to undertake to establish a separate government within its limit for the purpose of redress any grievance real or imaginary of which they might complain against the legitimate state government such a principle if carry into execution would destroy all lawful authority and produce universal anarchy from this statement of fact the reason become palpable why the enemy of the government authorize by congress have refuse to vote for delegate to the kansas constitutional convention and also afterwards on the question of slavery submit by it to the people it be because they have ever refuse to sanction or recognize any other constitution than that frame at topeka have the whole lecompton constitution be submit to the people the adherent of this organization would doubtless have vote against it because if successful they would thus have remove a obstacle out of the way of they own revolutionary constitution they would have do this not upon a consideration of the merit of the whole or any part of the lecompton constitution but simply because they have ever resist the authority of the government authorize by congress from which it emanate such be the unfortunate condition of affair in the territory what be the right as well as the duty of the law-abiding people be they silently and patiently to submit to the topeka usurpation or adopt the necessary measure to establish a constitution under the authority of the organic law of congress that this law recognize the right of the people of the territory without any enable act from congress to form a state constitution be too clear for argument for congress to leave the people of the territory perfectly free in frame they constitution to form and regulate they domestic institution in they own way subject only to the constitution of the united state and then to say that they shall not be permit to proceed and frame a constitution in they own way without a express authority from congress appear to be almost a contradiction in term it would be much more plausible to contend that congress have no power to pass such a enable act than to argue that the people of a territory might be keep out of the union for a indefinite period and until it might please congress to permit they to exercise the right of self-government this would be to adopt not they own way but the way which congress might prescribe it be impossible that any people could have proceed with more regularity in the formation of a constitution than the people of kansa have do it be necessary first to ascertain whether it be the desire of the people to be relieve from they territorial dependence and establish a state government for this purpose the territorial legislature in 1855 pass a law for take the sense of the people of this territory upon the expediency of call a convention to form a state constitution at the general election to be hold in October 1856 the sense of the people be accordingly take and they decide in favor of a convention it be true that at this election the enemy of the territorial government do not vote because they be then engage at topeka without the slightest pretext of lawful authority in frame a constitution of they own for the purpose of subvert the territorial government in pursuance of this decision of the people in favor of a convention the territorial legislature on the 27th day of February 1857 pass a act for the election of delegate on the third Monday of June 1857 to frame a state constitution this law be as fair in its provision as any that ever pass a legislative body for a similar purpose the right of suffrage at this election be clearly and justly define every _ bona fide _ inhabitant of the territory of kansa on the third Monday of June the day of the election who be a citizen of the united state above the age of 21 and have reside therein for three month previous to that date be entitle to vote in order to avoid all interference from neighbor state or territory with the freedom and fairness of the election provision be make for the registry of the qualify voter and in pursuance thereof 9251 voter be register governor walker do he whole duty in urge all the qualify citizen of kansa to vote at this election in he inaugural address on the 27th may last he inform they that -- under we practice the preliminary act of frame a state constitution be uniformly perform through the instrumentality of a convention of delegate choose by the people themselves that convention be now about to be elect by you under the call of the territorial legislature create and still recognize by the authority of congress and clothe by it in the comprehensive language of the organic law with full power to make such a enactment the territorial legislature then in assemble this convention be fully sustain by the act of congress and the authority of the convention be distinctly recognize in my instruction from the president of the united state the governor also clearly and distinctly warn they what would be the consequence if they should not participate in the election the people of kansas then -lrb- he say -rrb- be invite by the highest authority know to the constitution to participate freely and fairly in the election of delegate to frame a constitution and state government the law have perform its entire appropriate function when it extend to the people the right of suffrage but it can not compel the performance of that duty throughout we whole union however and wherever free government prevail those who abstain from the exercise of the right of suffrage authorize those who do vote to act for they in that contingency and the absentee be as much bind under the law and constitution where there be no fraud or violence by the act of the majority of those who do vote as if all have participate in the election otherwise as voting must be voluntary self-government would be impracticable and monarchy or despotism would remain as the only alternative it may also be observe that at this period any hope if such have exist that the topeka constitution would ever be recognize by congress must have be abandon congress have adjourn on the 3d march previous have recognize the legal existence of the territorial legislature in a variety of form which i need not enumerate indeed the delegate elect to the house of representative under a territorial law have be admit to he seat and have just complete he term of service on the day previous to my inauguration this be the propitious moment for settle all difficulty in kansa this be the time for abandon the revolutionary topeka organization and for the enemy of the exist government to conform to the law and to unite with its friend in frame a state constitution but this they refuse to do and the consequence of they refusal to submit to lawful authority and vote at the election of delegate may yet prove to be of a most deplorable character would that the respect for the law of the land which so eminently distinguish the man of the past generation could be revive it be a disregard and violation of law which have for year keep the territory of kansa in a state of almost open rebellion against its government it be the same spirit which have produce actual rebellion in utah we only safety consist in obedience and conformity to law should a general spirit against its enforcement prevail this will prove fatal to we as a nation we acknowledge no master but the law and should we cut loose from its restraint and everyone do what seemeth good in he own eye we case will indeed be hopeless the enemy of the territorial government determine still to resist the authority of congress they refuse to vote for delegate to the convention not because from circumstance which i need not detail there be a omission to register the comparatively few voter who be inhabitant of certain county of kansa in the early spring of 1857 but because they have predetermine at all hazard to adhere to they revolutionary organization and defeat the establishment of any other constitution than that which they have frame at topeka the election be therefore suffer to pass by default but of this result the qualify elector who refuse to vote can never justly complain from this review it be manifest that the lecompton convention accord to every principle of constitutional law be legally constitute and be invest with power to frame a constitution the sacred principle of popular sovereignty have be invoke in favor of the enemy of law and order in kansa but in what manner be popular sovereignty to be exercise in this country if not through the instrumentality of established law in certain small republic of ancient time the people do assemble in primary meeting pass law and direct public affair in we country this be manifestly impossible popular sovereignty can be exercise here only through the ballot box and if the people will refuse to exercise it in this manner as they have do in kansa at the election of delegate it be not for they to complain that they rights have be violate the kansa convention thus lawfully constitute proceed to frame a constitution and have complete they work finally adjourn on the 7th day of November last they do not think proper to submit the whole of this constitution to a popular vote but they do submit the question whether kansa should be a free or a slave state to the people this be the question which have convulse the union and shake it to its very center this be the question which have light up the flame of civil war in kansa and have produce dangerous sectional party throughout the confederacy it be of a character so paramount in respect to the condition of kansas as to rivet the anxious attention of the people of the whole country upon it and it alone no person thought of any other question for my own part when i instruct governor walker in general term in favor of submit the constitution to the people i have no object in view except the all-absorbing question of slavery in what manner the people of kansa might regulate they other concern be not a subject which attract any attention in fact the general provision of we recent state constitution after a experience of eight year be so similar and so excellent that it would be difficult to go far wrong at the present day in frame a new constitution i then believe and still believe that under the organic act the kansa convention be bind to submit this all-important question of slavery to the people it be never however my opinion that independently of this act they would have be bind to submit any portion of the constitution to a popular vote in order to give it validity have i entertain such a opinion this would have be in opposition to many precedent in we history commence in the very best age of the republic it would have be in opposition to the principle which pervade we institution and which be every day carry out into practice that the people have the right to delegate to representative choose by themselves they sovereign power to frame constitution enact law and perform many other important act without require that these should be subject to they subsequent approbation it would be a most inconvenient limitation of they own power impose by the people upon themselves to exclude they from exercise they sovereignty in any lawful manner they think proper it be true that the people of kansa might if they have please have require the convention to submit the constitution to a popular vote but this they have not do the only remedy therefore in this case be that which exist in all other similar case if the delegate who frame the kansa constitution have in any manner violate the will of they constituent the people always possess the power to change they constitution or they law accord to they own pleasure the question of slavery be submit to a election of the people of kansa on the 21st December last in obedience to the mandate of the constitution here again a fair opportunity be present to the adherent of the topeka constitution if they be the majority to decide this exciting question in they own way and thus restore peace to the distract territory but they again refuse to exercise they right of popular sovereignty and again suffer the election to pass by default i heartily rejoice that a wiser and better spirit prevail among a large majority of these people on the first Monday of January and that they do on that day vote under the lecompton constitution for a governor and other state officer a member of congress and for member of the legislature this election be warmly contest by the party and a larger vote be poll than at any previous election in the territory we may now reasonably hope that the revolutionary topeka organization will be speedily and finally abandon and this will go far toward the final settlement of the unhappy difference in kansas if fraud have be commit at this election either by one or both party the legislature and the people of kansas under they constitution will know how to redress themselves and punish these detestable but too common crime without any outside interference the people of kansa have then in they own way and in strict accordance with the organic act frame a constitution and state government have submit the all-important question of slavery to the people and have elect a governor a member to represent they in congress member of the state legislature and other state officer they now ask admission into the union under this constitution which be republican in its form it be for congress to decide whether they will admit or reject the state which have thus be create for my own part i be decidedly in favor of its admission and thus terminate the kansa question this will carry out the great principle of nonintervention recognize and sanction by the organic act which declare in express language in favor of nonintervention by congress with slavery in the state or territory leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate they domestic institution in they own way subject only to the constitution of the united state in this manner by localize the question of slavery and confine it to the people whom it immediately concern every patriot anxiously expect that this question would be banish from the hall of congress where it have always exert a baneful influence throughout the whole country it be proper that i should briefly refer to the election hold under a act of the territorial legislature on the first Monday of January last on the lecompton constitution this election be hold after the territory have be prepare for admission into the union as a sovereign state and when no authority exist in the territorial legislature which could possibly destroy its existence or change its character the election which be peaceably conduct under my instruction involve a strange inconsistency a large majority of the person who vote against the lecompton constitution be at the very same time and place recognize its valid existence in the most solemn and authentic manner by vote under its provision i have yet receive no official information of the result of this election as a question of expediency after the right have be maintain it may be wise to reflect upon the benefit to kansa and to the whole country which would result from its immediate admission into the union as well as the disaster which may follow its rejection domestic peace will be the happy consequence of its admission and that fine territory which have hitherto be tear by dissension will rapidly increase in population and wealth and speedily realize the blessing and the comfort which follow in the train of agricultural and mechanical industry the people will then be sovereign and can regulate they own affair in they own way if a majority of they desire to abolish domestic slavery within the state there be no other possible mode by which this can be effect so speedily as by prompt admission the will of the majority be supreme and irresistible when express in a orderly and lawful manner they can make and unmake constitution at pleasure it would be absurd to say that they can impose fetter upon they own power which they can not afterwards remove if they could do this they might tie they own hand for a hundred as well as for ten year these be fundamental principle of american freedom and be recognize i believe in some form or other by every state constitution and if congress in the act of admission should think proper to recognize they i can perceive no objection to such a course this have be do emphatically in the constitution of kansas it declare in the bill of rights that all political power be inherent in the people and all free government be found on they authority and institute for they benefit and therefore they have at all time a inalienable and indefeasible right to alter reform or abolish they form of government in such manner as they may think proper the great state of new york be at this moment govern under a constitution frame and establish in direct opposition to the mode prescribe by the previous constitution if therefore the provision change the kansa constitution after the year 1864 could by possibility be construe into a prohibition to make such a change previous to that period this prohibition would be wholly unavailing the legislature already elect may at its very first session submit the question to a vote of the people whether they will or will not have a convention to amend they constitution and adopt all necessary means for give effect to the popular will it have be solemnly adjudge by the highest judicial tribunal know to we law that slavery exist in kansa by virtue of the constitution of the united state kansa be therefore at this moment as much a slave state as georgium or south carolina without this the equality of the sovereign state compose the union would be violate and the use and enjoyment of a territory acquire by the common treasure of all the state would be close against the people and the property of nearly half the member of the confederacy slavery can therefore never be prohibit in kansas except by means of a constitutional provision and in no other manner can this be obtain so promptly if a majority of the people desire it as by admit it into the union under its present constitution on the other hand should congress reject the constitution under the idea of afford the disaffected in kansas a third opportunity of prohibit slavery in the state which they might have do twice before if in the majority no man can foretell the consequence if congress for the sake of those man who refuse to vote for delegate to the convention when they might have exclude slavery from the constitution and who afterwards refuse to vote on the 21st December last when they might as they claim have stricken slavery from the constitution should now reject the state because slavery remain in the constitution it be manifest that the agitation upon this dangerous subject will be renew in a more alarming form than it have ever yet assume every patriot in the country have indulge the hope that the kansa and nebraska act would put a final end to the slavery agitation at least in congress which have for more than twenty year convulse the country and endanger the union this act involve great and fundamental principle and if fairly carry into effect will settle the question should the agitation be again revive should the people of the sister state be again estrange from each other with more than they former bitterness this will arise from a cause so far as the interest of kansa be concern more trifling and insignificant than have ever stir the element of a great people into commotion to the people of kansas the only practical difference between admission or rejection depend simply upon the fact whether they can themselves more speedily change the present constitution if it do not accord with the will of the majority or frame a second constitution to be submit to congress hereafter even if this be a question of mere expediency and not of right the small difference of time one way or the other be of not the least importance when contrast with the evil which must necessarily result to the whole country from a revival of the slavery agitation in consider this question it should never be forget that in proportion to its insignificance let the decision be what it may so far as it may affect the few thousand inhabitant of kansa who have from the beginning resist the constitution and the law for this very reason the rejection of the constitution will be so much the more keenly feel by the people of fourteen of the state of this union where slavery be recognize under the constitution of the united state again the speedy admission of kansas into the union would restore peace and quiet to the whole country already the affair of this territory have engross a undue proportion of public attention they have sadly affect the friendly relation of the people of the state with each other and alarm the fear of patriot for the safety of the union kansa once admit into the union the excitement become localized and will soon die away for want of outside aliment then every difficulty will be settle at the ballot box besides -- and this be no trifling consideration -- i shall then be enable to withdraw the troops of the united state from kansa and employ they on branch of service where they be much need they have be keep there on the earnest importunity of governor walker to maintain the existence of the territorial government and secure the execution of the law he consider that at least 2000 regular troops under the command of general harney be necessary for this purpose act upon he reliable information i have be oblige in some degree to interfere with the expedition to utah in order to keep down rebellion in kansa this have involve a very heavy expense to the government kansa once admit it be believe there will no longer be any occasion there for troops of the united state i have thus perform my duty on this important question under a deep sense of responsibility to god and my country my public life will terminate within a brief period and i have no other object of earthly ambition than to leave my country in a peaceful and prosperous condition and to live in the affection and respect of my countryman the dark and ominous cloud which now appear to be impend over the union i conscientiously believe may be dissipate with honor to every portion of it by the admission of kansas during the present session of congress whereas if she should be reject i greatly fear these cloud will become darker and more ominous than any which have ever yet threaten the constitution and the union jame buchanan _ to the

on the frontier i be the more gratify at this satisfactory intelligence from utah because it will afford some relief to the treasury at a time demand from we the strictest economy and when the question which now arise upon every new appropriation be whether it be of a character so important and urgent as to brook no delay and to justify and require a loan and most probably a tax upon the

treasury on the 19th day of may last the secretary of the treasury submit a report to congress on the present condition of the finances of the government in this report he state that after a call upon the head of department he have receive official information that the sum of $ 37000000 would probably be require during the first two quarter of the next fiscal year from the 1st of July until the 1st of January this sum the secretary say do not include such amount as may be appropriate by congress over and above the estimate submit to they by the department and i have no datum on which to estimate for such expenditure upon this point congress be better able to form a correct opinion than i be the secretary then estimate that the receipt into the treasury from all source between the 1st of July and the 1st of January would amount to $ 25000000 leave a deficit of $ 15000000 inclusive of the sum of about $ 3000000 the least amount require to be in the treasury at all time to secure its successful operation for this amount he recommend a loan this loan it will be observe be require after a close calculation to meet the estimate from the different department and not such appropriation as might be make by congress over and above these estimate there be embrace in this sum of $ 15000000 estimate to the amount of about $ 1750000 for the three volunteer regiment authorize by the act of congress approve April 7 1858 for two of which if not for the third no appropriation will now be require to this extent a portion of the loan of $ 15000000 may be apply to pay the appropriation make by congress beyond the estimate from the different department refer to in the report of the secretary of the treasury to what extent a probable deficiency may exist in the treasury between the 1st July and the 1st January next can not be ascertain until the appropriation bill as well as the private bill contain appropriation shall have finally pass adversity teach useful lesson to nation as well as individual the habit of extravagant expenditure foster by a large surplus in the treasury must now be correct or the country will be involve in serious financial difficulty under any form of government extravagance in expenditure must be the natural consequence when those who authorize the expenditure feel no responsibility in provide the means of payment such have be for a number of year we condition previously to the late monetary revulsion in the country fortunately at least for the cause of public economy the case be now reverse and to the extent of the appropriation whatever these may be ingraft on the different appropriation bill as well as those make by private bill over and above the estimate of the different department it will be necessary for congress to provide the means of payment before they adjournment without this the treasury will be exhaust before the 1st of January and the public credit will be seriously impaired this disgrace must not fall upon the country it be impossible for I however now to ascertain this amount nor do there at present seem to be the least probability that this can be do and the necessary mean provide by congress to meet any deficiency which may exist in the treasury before Monday next at 12 o'clock the hour fix for adjournment it be now Saturday morning at half-past 11 o'clock to accomplish this object the appropriation bill as they shall have finally pass congress must be before I and time must be allow to ascertain the amount of the money appropriate and to enable congress to provide the necessary means at this write it be understand that several of these bill be yet before the committee of conference and the amendment to some of they have not even be print foresee that such a state of thing might exist at the close of the session i state in the annual message to congress of December last that -- from the practice of congress such a examination of each bill as the constitution require have be render impossible the most important business of each session be generally crowd into its last hour and the alternative present to the president be either to violate the constitutional duty which he owe to the people and approve bill which for want of time it be impossible he should have examine or by he refusal to do this subject the country and individual to great loss and inconvenience \* \* \* \* \* for my own part i have deliberately determine that i shall approve no bill which i have not examine and it will be a case of extreme and most urgent necessity which shall ever induce I to depart from this rule the present condition of the treasury absolutely require that i should adhere to this resolution on the present occasion for the reason which i have heretofore present in former time it be believe to be the true character of a appropriation bill simply to carry into effect exist law and the established policy of the country a practice have however grow up of late year to ingraft on such bill at the last hour of the session large appropriation for new and important object not provide for by preexist law and when no time be leave to the executive for they examination and investigation no alternative be thus leave to the president but either to approve measure without examination or by veto a appropriation bill seriously to embarrass the operation of the government this practice could never have prevail without a surplus in the treasury sufficiently large to cover a indefinite amount of appropriation necessity now compel we to arrest it at least so far as to afford time to ascertain the amount appropriate and to provide the means of its payment for all these reason i recommend to congress to postpone the day of adjournment for a brief period i promise that not a hour shall be lose in ascertain the amount of appropriation make by they for which it will be necessary to provide i know it will be inconvenient for the member to attend a call session and this above all thing i desire to avoid jame buchanan proclamation -lrb- from statute at large -lrb- little brown & co -rrb- vol xi p 794 -rrb- by the president of the united state of america a proclamation whereas

the other they hostility to the lawful government of the country have at length become so violent that no officer bear a commission from the chief magistrate of the union can enter the territory or remain there with safety and all those officer recently appoint have be unable to go to salt lake or anywhere else in utah beyond the immediate power of the army indeed such be believe to be the condition to which a strange system of terrorism have bring the inhabitant of that region that no one among they could express a opinion favorable to this government or even propose to obey its law without expose he life and property to peril after carefully consider this state of affair and maturely weigh the obligation i be under to see the law faithfully execute it seem to I right and proper that i should make such use of the military force at my disposal as might be necessary to protect the federal officer in go into the territory of utah and in perform they duty after arrive there i accordingly order a detachment of the army to march for the city of salt lake or within reach of that place and to act in case of need as a posse for the enforcement of the law but in the meantime the hatred of that misguided people for the just and legal authority of the government have become so intense that they resolve to measure they military strength with that of the union they have organize a armed force far from contemptible in point of number and train it if not with skill at least with great assiduity and perseverance while the troops of the united state be on they march a train of baggage wagon which happen to be unprotected be attack and destroy by a portion of the mormon force and the provision and store with which the train be laden be wantonly burn in short they present

express in word but manifest in overt act of the most unequivocal character fellow-citizen of utah this be rebellion against the government to which you owe allegiance it be levy war against the united state and involve you in the guilt of treason persistence in it will bring you to condign punishment to ruin and to shame for it be mere madness to suppose that with you limited resource you

fail to put forth its strength and bring you to submission you have fall into a grave mistake you have settle upon territory which lie geographically in the heart of the union the land you live upon be purchase by the united state and pay for out of they treasury the proprietary right and title to it be in they and not in you utah be bound on every side by state and territory whose people be true to the union it be absurd to believe that they will or can permit you to erect in they very midst a government of you own not only independent of the authority which they all acknowledge but hostile to they and they interest do not deceive yourselve nor try to mislead other by propagate the idea that this be a crusade against you religion the constitution and law of this country can take no notice of you creed whether it be true or false that be a question between you god and yourselve in which i disclaim all right to interfere if you obey the law keep the peace and respect the just

never directly or indirectly seek to molest you in you worship to control you in you ecclesiastical affair or even to influence you in you religious opinion this rebellion be not merely a violation of you legal duty it be without just cause without reason without excuse you never make a complaint that be not listen to with patience you never exhibit a real grievance that be not redress as promptly as it could be the law and regulation enact for you government by congress have be equal and just and they enforcement be manifestly necessary for you own welfare and happiness you have never ask they repeal they be similar in every material respect to the law which have be pass for the other territory of the union and which everywhere else -lrb- with one partial exception -rrb- have be cheerfully obey no people ever live who be freer from unnecessary legal restraint than you human wisdom never devise a political system which bestow more blessing or impose lighter burden than the government of the united state in its operation upon the territory but be anxious to save the effusion of blood and to avoid the indiscriminate punishment of a whole people for crime of which it be not probable that all be equally guilty i offer now a free and full pardon to all who will submit themselves to the just authority of the federal government if you refuse to accept it let the consequence fall upon

27th instant forbid the citizen or subject of any nation except passenger intend to proceed through nicaragua over the transit route from ocean to ocean to enter its territory without a regular passport sign by the proper minister or consul-general of the republic resident in the country from whence they shall have depart such person with this exception will be stop and compel to return by the same conveyance that take they to the country from these circumstance the inference be irresistible that person engage in this expedition will leave the united state with hostile purpose against nicaragua they can not under the guise which they have assume that they be peaceful emigrant conceal they real intention and especially when they know in advance that they landing will be resist and can only be accomplish by a overpowering force this expedient be successfully resort to previous to the last expedition and the vessel in which those compose it be convey to nicaragua obtain a

already be twice expel from nicaragua have invite through the public newspaper american citizen to emigrate to that republic and have designate mobile as the place of rendezvous and departure and san juan del norte as the port to which they be bind this person who have renounce he allegiance to the united state and claim to be president of nicaragua have give notice to the collector of the port of

secretary of state _ second annual message washington city _ December 6 1858 _ _ fellow-citizen of the senate and house of representative _ : when we compare the condition of the country at the present day with what it be one year ago at the meeting of congress we have much reason for gratitude to that almighty providence which have never fail to interpose for we relief at the most critical period of we history one year ago the sectional strife between the north and the south on the dangerous subject of slavery have again become so intense as to threaten the peace and perpetuity of the confederacy the application for the admission of kansas as a state into the union foster this unhappy agitation and bring the whole subject once more before congress it be the desire of every patriot that such measure of legislation might be adopt as would remove the excitement from the state and confine it to the territory where it legitimately belong much have be do i be happy to say toward the accomplishment of this object during the last session of congress the supreme court of the united state have previously decide that all american citizen have a equal right to take into the territory whatever be hold as property under the law of any of the state and to hold such property there under the guardianship of the federal constitution so long as the territorial condition shall remain this be now a well-established position and the proceedings of the last session be alone want to give it practical effect the principle have be recognize in some form or other by a almost unanimous vote of both house of congress that a territory have a right to come into the union either as a free or a slave state accord to the will of a majority of its people the just equality of all the state have thus be vindicate and a fruitful source of dangerous dissension among they have be remove whilst such have be the beneficial tendency of you legislative proceedings outside of kansas they influence have nowhere be so happy as within that territory itself leave to manage and control its own affair in its own way without the pressure of external influence the revolutionary topeka organization and all resistance to the territorial government establish by congress have be finally abandon as a natural consequence that fine territory now appear to be tranquil and prosperous and be attract increase thousand of immigrant to make it they happy home the past unfortunate experience of kansa have enforce the lesson so often already teach that resistance to lawful authority under we form of government can not fail in the end to prove disastrous to its author have the people of the territory yield obedience to the law enact by they legislature it would at the present moment have contain a large additional population of industrious and enterprising citizen who have be deter from enter its border by the existence of civil strife and organize rebellion it be the resistance to rightful authority and the persevere attempt to establish a revolutionary government under the topeka constitution which cause the people of kansa to commit the grave error of refuse to vote for delegate to the convention to frame a constitution under a law not deny to be fair and just in its provision this refusal to vote be the prolific source of all the evil which have follow in they hostility to the territorial government they disregard the principle absolutely essential to the working of we form of government that a majority of those who vote not the majority who may remain at home from whatever cause must decide the result of a election for this reason seek to take advantage of they own error they deny the authority of the convention thus elect to frame a constitution the convention notwithstanding proceed to adopt a constitution unexceptionable in its general feature and provide for the submission of the slavery question to a vote of the people which in my opinion they be bind to do under the kansa and nebraska act this be the all-important question which have alone convulse the territory and yet the opponent of the lawful government persist in they first error refrain from exercise they right to vote and prefer that slavery should continue rather than surrender they revolutionary topeka organization a wiser and better spirit seem to prevail before the first Monday of January last when a election be hold under the constitution a majority of the people then vote for a governor and other state officer for a member of congress and member of the state legislature this election be warmly contest by the two political party in kansa and a greater vote be poll than at any previous election a large majority of the member of the legislature elect belong to that party which have previously refuse to vote the antislavery party be thus place in the ascendant and the political power of the state be in they own hand have congress admit kansa into the union under the lecompton constitution the legislature might at its very first session have submit the question to a vote of the people whether they would or would not have a convention to amend they constitution either on the slavery or any other question and have adopt all necessary means for give speedy effect to the will of the majority thus the kansa question would have be immediately and finally settle under these circumstance i submit to congress the constitution thus frame with all the officer already elect necessary to put the state government into operation accompany by a strong recommendation in favor of the admission of kansas as a state in the course of my long public life i have never perform any official act which in the retrospect have afford I more heartfelt satisfaction its admission could have inflict no possible injury on any human be whilst it would within a brief period have restore peace to kansa and harmony to the union in that event the slavery question would ere this have be finally settle accord to the legally express will of a majority of the voter and popular sovereignty would thus have be vindicate in a constitutional manner with my deep conviction of duty i could have pursue no other course it be true that as a individual i have express a opinion both before and during the session of the convention in favor of submit the remain clause of the constitution as well as that concern slavery to the people but act in a official character neither myself nor any human authority have the power to rejudge the proceedings of the convention and declare the constitution which it have frame to be a nullity to have do this would have be a violation of the kansa and nebraska act which leave the people of the territory perfectly free to form and regulate they domestic institution in they own way subject only to the constitution of the united state it would equally have violate the great principle of popular sovereignty at the foundation of we institution to deprive the people of the power if they think proper to exercise it of confide to delegate elect by themselves the trust of frame a constitution without require they to subject they constituent to the trouble expense and delay of a second election it would have be in opposition to many precedent in we history commence in the very best age of the republic of the admission of territory as state into the union without a previous vote of the people approve they constitution it be to be lament that a question so insignificant when view in its practical effect on the people of kansas whether decide one way or the other should have kindle such a flame of excitement throughout the country this reflection may prove to be a lesson of wisdom and of warn for we future guidance practically consider the question be simply whether the people of that territory should first come into the union and then change any provision in they constitution not agreeable to themselves or accomplish the very same object by remain out of the union and frame another constitution in accordance with they will in either case the result would be precisely the same the only difference in point of fact be that the object would have be much sooner attain and the pacification of kansas more speedily effect have it be admit as a state during the last session of congress my recommendation however for the immediate admission of kansas fail to meet the approbation of congress they deem it wiser to adopt a different measure for the settlement of the question for my own part i should have be willing to yield my assent to almost any constitutional measure to accomplish this object i therefore cordially acquiesce in what have be call the english compromise and approve the act for the admission of the state of kansas into the union upon the term therein prescribe under the ordinance which accompany the lecompton constitution the people of kansa have claim double the quantity of public land for the support of common school which have ever be previously grant to any state upon enter the union and also the alternate section of land for 12 mile on each side of two railroad propose to be construct from the northern to the southern boundary and from the eastern to the western boundary of the state congress deem these claim unreasonable provide by the act of may 4 1858 to which i have just refer for the admission of the state on a equal footing with the original state but upon the fundamental condition precedent that a majority of the people thereof at a election to be hold for that purpose should in place of the very large grant of public land which they have demand under the ordinance accept such grant as have be make to minnesota and other new state under this act should a majority reject the proposition offer they it shall be deem and hold that the people of kansa do not desire admission into the union with say constitution under the condition set forth in say proposition in that event the act authorize the people of the territory to elect delegate to form a constitution and state government for themselves whenever and not before it be ascertain by a census duly and legally take that the population of say territory equal or exceed the ratio of representation require for a member of the house of representative of the congress of the united state the delegate thus assemble shall first determine by a vote whether it be the wish of the people of the proposed state to be admit into the union at that time and if so shall proceed to form a constitution and take all necessary step for the establishment of a state government in conformity with the federal constitution after this constitution shall have be form congress carry out the principle of popular sovereignty and nonintervention have leave the mode and manner of its approval or ratification by the people of the proposed state to be prescribe by law and they shall then be admit into the union as a state under such constitution thus fairly and legally make with or without slavery as say constitution may prescribe a election be hold throughout kansa in pursuance of the provision of this act on the 2d day of August last and it result in the rejection by a large majority of the proposition submit to the people by congress this be the case they be now authorize to form another constitution preparatory to admission into the union but not until they number as ascertain by a census shall equal or exceed the ratio require to elect a member to the house of representative it be not probable in the present state of the case that a third constitution can be lawfully frame and present to congress by kansa before its population shall have reach the designate number nor be it to be presume that after they sad experience in resist the territorial law they will attempt to adopt a constitution in express violation of the provision of a act of congress during the session of 1856 much of the time of congress be occupy on the question of admit kansa under the topeka constitution again nearly the whole of the last session be devote to the question of its admission under the lecompton constitution surely it be not unreasonable to require the people of kansa to wait before make a third attempt until the number of they inhabitant shall amount to 93420 during this brief period the harmony of the state as well as the great business interest of the country demand that the people of the union shall not for a third time be convulse by another agitation on the kansas question by wait for a short time and act in obedience to law kansa will glide into the union without the slightest impediment this excellent provision which congress have apply to kansas ought to be extend and render applicable to all territory which may hereafter seek admission into the union whilst congress possess the undoubted power of admit a new state into the union however small may be the number of its inhabitant yet this power ought not in my opinion to be exercise before the population shall amount to the ratio require by the act for the admission of kansa have this be previously the rule the country would have escape all the evil and misfortune to which it have be expose by the kansas question of course it would be unjust to give this rule a retrospective application and exclude a state which act upon the past practice of the government have already form its constitution elect its legislature and other officer and be now prepare to enter the union the rule ought to be adopt whether we consider its bearing on the people of the territory or upon the people of the exist state many of the serious dissension which have prevail in congress and throughout the country would have be avoid have this rule be establish at a earlier period of the government immediately upon the formation of a new territory people from different state and from foreign country rush into it for the laudable purpose of improve they condition they first duty to themselves be to open and cultivate farm to construct road to establish school to erect place of religious worship and to devote they energy generally to reclaim the wilderness and to lay the foundation of a flourish and prosperous commonwealth if in this incipient condition with a population of a few thousand they should prematurely enter the union they be oppress by the burden of state taxation and the means necessary for the improvement of the territory and the advancement of they own interest be thus divert to very different purpose the federal government have ever be a liberal parent to the territory and a generous contributor to the useful enterprise of the early settler it have pay the expense of they government and legislative assembly out of the common treasury and thus relieve they from a heavy charge under these circumstance nothing can be better calculate to retard they material progress than to divert they from they useful employment by prematurely exciting angry political contest among themselves for the benefit of aspire leader it be surely no hardship for embryo governor senator and member of congress to wait until the number of inhabitant shall equal those of a single congressional district they surely ought not to be permit to rush into the union with a population less than one-half of several of the large county in the interior of some of the state this be the condition of kansas when it make application to be admit under the topeka constitution besides it require some time to render the mass of a population collect in a new territory at all homogeneous and to unite they on anything like a fixed policy establish the rule and all will look forward to it and govern themselves accordingly but justice to the people of the several state require that this rule should be establish by congress each state be entitle to two senator and at least one representative in congress should the people of the state fail to elect a vice-president the power devolve upon the senate to select this officer from the two highest candidate on the list in case of the death of the president the vice-president thus elect by the senate become president of the united state on all question of legislation the senator from the smallest state of the union have a equal vote with those from the largest the same may be say in regard to the ratification of treaty and of executive appointment all this have work admirably in practice whilst it conform in principle with the character of a government institute by sovereign state i presume no american citizen would desire the slightest change in the arrangement still be it not unjust and unequal to the exist state to invest some 40000 or 50000 people collect in a territory with the attribute of sovereignty and place they on a equal footing with virginium and new york in the senate of the united state for these reason i earnestly recommend the passage of a general act which shall provide that upon the application of a territorial legislature declare they belief that the territory contain a number of inhabitant which if in a state would entitle they to elect a member of congress it shall be the duty of the president to cause a census of the inhabitant to be take and if find sufficient then by the term of this act to authorize they to proceed in they own way to frame a state constitution preparatory to admission into the union i also recommend that a appropriation may be make to enable the president to take a census of the people of kansas the present condition of the territory of utah when contrast with what it be one year ago be a subject for congratulation it be then in a state of open rebellion and cost what it might the character of the government require that this rebellion should be suppress and the mormon compel to yield obedience to the constitution and the law in order to accomplish this object as i inform you in my last annual message i appoint a new governor instead of brigham young and other federal officer to take the place of those who consult they personal safety have find it necessary to withdraw from the territory to protect these civil officer and to aid they as a _ posse comitatus _ in the execution of the law in case of need i order a detachment of the army to accompany they to utah the necessity for adopt these measure be now demonstrate on the 15th of September 1857 governor young issue he proclamation in the style of a independent sovereign announce he purpose to resist by force of arm the entry of the united state troops into we own territory of utah by this he require all the force in the territory to hold themselves in readiness to march at a moment 's notice to repel any and all such invasion and establish martial law from its date throughout the territory these prove to be no idle threat fort bridger and supply be vacate and burn down by the mormon to deprive we troops of a shelter after they long and fatiguing march order be issue by daniel h well style himself lieutenant-general nauvoo legion to stampede the animal of the united state troops on they march to set fire to they train to burn the grass and the whole country before they and on they flank to keep they from sleep by night surprise and to blockade the road by fell tree and destroy the ford of river etc these order be promptly and effectually obey on the 4th of October 1857 the mormon capture and burn on green river three of we supply train consist of seventy-five wagon load with provision and tent for the army and carry away several hundred animal this diminish the supply of provision so materially that general johnston be oblige to reduce the ration and even with this precaution there be only sufficient leave to subsist the troops until the 1st of June we little army behave admirably in they encampment at fort bridger under these try privation in the midst of the mountain in a dreary unsettled and inhospitable region more than a thousand mile from home they pass the severe and inclement winter without a murmur they look forward with confidence for relief from they country in due season and in this they be not disappoint the secretary of war employ all he energy to forward they the necessary supplies and to muster and send such a military force to utah as would render resistance on the part of the mormon hopeless and thus terminate the war without the effusion of blood in he effort he be efficiently sustain by congress they grant appropriation sufficient to cover the deficiency thus necessarily create and also provide for raise two regiment of volunteer for the purpose of quell disturbance in the territory of utah for the protection of supply and emigrant train and the suppression of indian hostility on the frontier happily there be no occasion to call these regiment into service if there have be i should have feel serious embarrassment in select they so great be the number of we brave and patriotic citizen anxious to serve they country in this distant and apparently dangerous expedition thus it have ever be and thus may it ever be the wisdom and economy of send sufficient reenforcement to utah be establish not only by the event but in the opinion of those who from they position and opportunity be the most capable of form a correct judgment general johnston the commander of the force in address the secretary of war from fort bridger under date of October 18 1857 express the opinion that unless a large force be send here from the nature of the country a protracted war on they -lrb- the mormon 's -rrb- part be inevitable this he consider necessary to terminate the war speedily and more economically than if attempt by insufficient means in the meantime it be my anxious desire that the mormon should yield obedience to the constitution and the law without render it necessary to resort to military force to aid in accomplish this object i deem it advisable in April last to dispatch two distinguished citizen of the united state messr powell and mcculloch to utah they bear with they a proclamation address by myself to the inhabitant of utah date on the 6th day of that month warn they of they true condition and how hopeless it be on they part to persist in rebellion against the united state and offer all those who should submit to the law a full pardon for they past sedition and treason at the same time i assure those who should persist in rebellion against the united state that they must expect no further lenity but look to be rigorously deal with accord to they desert the instruction to these agent as well as a copy of the proclamation and they report be herewith submit it will be see by they report of the 3d of July last that they have fully confirm the opinion express by general johnston in the previous October as to the necessity of send reenforcement to utah in this they state that they be firmly impress with the belief that the presence of the army here and the large additional force that have be order to this territory be the chief inducement that cause the mormon to abandon the idea of resist the authority of the united state a less decisive policy would probably have result in a long bloody and expensive war these gentleman conduct themselves to my entire satisfaction and render useful service in execute the humane intention of the government it also afford I great satisfaction to state that governor cumming have perform he duty in a able and conciliatory manner and with the happiest effect i can not in this connection refrain from mention the valuable service of colonel thoma l kane who from motive of pure benevolence and without any official character or pecuniary compensation visit utah during the last inclement winter for the purpose of contribute to the pacification of the territory i be happy to inform you that the governor and other civil officer of utah be now perform they appropriate function without resistance the authority of the constitution and the law have be fully restore and peace prevail throughout the territory a portion of the troops send to utah be now encamp in cedar valley 44 mile southwest of salt lake city and the remainder have be order to oregon to suppress indian hostility the march of the army to salt lake city through the indian territory have have a powerful effect in restrain the hostile feeling against the united state which exist among the indian in that region and in secure emigrant to the far west against they depredation this will also be the means of establish military post and promote settlement along the route i recommend that the benefit of we land law and preemption system be extend to the people of utah by the establishment of a land office in that territory i have occasion also to congratulate you on the result of we negotiation with china you be inform by my last annual message that we minister have be instruct to occupy a neutral position in the hostility conduct by great britain and france against canton he be however at the same time direct to cooperate cordially with the british and french minister in all peaceful measure to secure by treaty those just concession to foreign commerce which the nation of the world have a right to demand it be impossible for I to proceed further than this on my own authority without usurp the war-making power which under the constitution belong exclusively to congress besides after a careful examination of the nature and extent of we grievance i do not believe they be of such a press and aggravate character as would have justified congress in declare war against the chinese empire without first make another earnest attempt to adjust they by peaceful negotiation i be the more inclined to this opinion because of the severe chastisement which have then but recently be inflict upon the chinese by we squadron in the capture and destruction of the barrier fort to avenge a alleged insult to we flag the event have prove the wisdom of we neutrality we minister have execute he instruction with eminent skill and ability in conjunction with the russian plenipotentiary he have peacefully but effectually cooperate with the english and french plenipotentiary and each of the four power have conclude a separate treaty with china of a highly satisfactory character the treaty conclude by we own plenipotentiary will immediately be submit to the senate i be happy to announce that through the energetic yet conciliatory effort of we consul-general in japan a new treaty have be conclude with that empire which may be expect materially to augment we trade and intercourse in that quarter and remove from we countryman the disability which have heretofore be impose upon the exercise of they religion the treaty shall be submit to the senate for approval without delay it be my earnest desire that every misunderstand with the government of great britain should be amicably and speedily adjust it have be the misfortune of both country almost ever since the period of the revolution to have be annoy by a succession of irritating and dangerous question threaten they friendly relation this have partially prevent the full development of those feeling of mutual friendship between the people of the two country so natural in themselves and so conducive to they common interest any serious interruption of the commerce between the united state and great britain would be equally injurious to both in fact no two nation have ever exist on the face of the earth which could do each other so much good or so much harm entertaining these sentiment i be gratify to inform you that the long-pending controversy between the two government in relation to the question of visitation and search have be amicably adjust the claim on the part of great britain forcibly to visit american vessel on the high sea in time of peace could not be sustain under the law of nation and it have be overrule by she own most eminent jurist this question be recently bring to a issue by the repeat act of british cruiser in board and search we merchant vessel in the gulf of mexico and the adjacent sea these act be the more injurious and annoying as these water be traverse by a large portion of the commerce and navigation of the united state and they free and unrestricted use be essential to the security of the coastwise trade between the different state of the union such vexatious interruption could not fail to excite the feeling of the country and to require the interposition of the government remonstrance be address to the british government against these violation of we rights of sovereignty and a naval force be at the same time order to the cuban water with direction to protect all vessel of the united state on the high sea from search or detention by the vessel of war of any other nation these measure receive the unqualified and even enthusiastic approbation of the american people most fortunately however no collision take place and the british government promptly avow its recognition of the principle of international law upon this subject as lay down by the government of the united state in the note of the secretary of state to the british minister at washington of April 10 1858 which secure the vessel of the united state upon the high sea from visitation or search in time of peace under any circumstance whatever the claim have be abandon in a manner reflect honor on the british government and evince a just regard for the law of nation and can not fail to strengthen the amicable relation between the two country the british government at the same time propose to the united state that some mode should be adopt by mutual arrangement between the two country of a character which may be find effective without be offensive for verify the nationality of vessel suspect on good grounds of carry false color they have also invite the united state to take the initiative and propose measure for this purpose whilst decline to assume so grave a responsibility the secretary of state have inform the british government that we be ready to receive any proposal which they may feel disposed to offer have this object in view and to consider they in a amicable spirit a strong opinion be however express that the occasional abuse of the flag of any nation be a evil far less to be deprecate than would be the establishment of any regulation which might be incompatible with the freedom of the sea this government have yet receive no communication specify the manner in which the british government would propose to carry out they suggestion and i be incline to believe that no plan which can be devise will be free from grave embarrassment still i shall form no decide opinion on the subject until i shall have carefully and in the best spirit examine any proposal which they may think proper to make i be truly sorry i can not also inform you that the complication between great britain and the united state arise out of the clayton and bulwer treaty of April 1850 have be finally adjust at the commencement of you last session i have reason to hope that emancipate themselves from further unavailing discussion the two government would proceed to settle the central american question in a practical manner alike honorable and satisfactory to both and this hope i have not yet abandon in my last annual message i state that overture have be make by the british government for this purpose in a friendly spirit which i cordially reciprocate they proposal be to withdraw these question from direct negotiation between the two government but to accomplish the same object by a negotiation between the british government and each of the central american republic whose territorial interest be immediately involve the settlement be to be make in accordance with the general tenor of the interpretation place upon the clayton and bulwer treaty by the united state with certain modification as negotiation be still pend upon this basis it would not be proper for I now to communicate they present condition a final settlement of these question be greatly to be desire as this would wipe out the last remain subject of dispute between the two country we relation with the great empire of france and russium as well as with all other government on the continent of europe except that of spain continue to be of the most friendly character with spain we relation remain in a unsatisfactory condition in my message of December last i inform you that we envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to madrid have ask for he recall and it be my purpose to send out a new minister to that court with special instruction on all question pend between the two government and with a determination to have they speedily and amicably adjust if that be possible this purpose have be hitherto defeat by cause which i need not enumerate the mission to spain have be intrust to a distinguished citizen of kentucky who will proceed to madrid without delay and make another and a final attempt to obtain justice from that government spanish official under the direct control of the captain-general of cuba have insult we national flag and in repeat instance have from time to time inflict injury on the person and property of we citizen these have give birth to numerous claim against the spanish government the merit of which have be ably discuss for a series of year by we successive diplomatic representative notwithstanding this we have not arrive at a practical result in any single instance unless we may except the case of the _ black warrior _ under the late administration and that present a outrage of such a character as would have justify a immediate resort to war all we attempt to obtain redress have be baffle and defeat the frequent and oft-recurring change in the spanish ministry have be employ as reason for delay we have be compel to wait again and again until the new minister shall have have time to investigate the justice of we demand even what have be denominate the cuban claim in which more than 100 of we citizen be directly interested have furnish no exception these claim be for the refunding of duty unjustly exact from american vessel at different custom-house in cuba so long ago as the year 1844 the principle upon which they rest be so manifestly equitable and just that after a period of nearly ten year in 1854 they be recognize by the spanish government proceedings be afterwards institute to ascertain they amount and this be finally fix accord to they own statement -lrb- with which we be satisfied -rrb- at the sum of $ 12863554 just at the moment after a delay of fourteen year when we have reason to expect that this sum would be repay with interest we have receive a proposal offer to refund one-third of that amount -lrb- $ 4287841 -rrb- but without interest if we would accept this in full satisfaction the offer be also accompany by a declaration that this indemnification be not found on any reason of strict justice but be make as a special favor one allege cause for procrastination in the examination and adjustment of we claim arise from a obstacle which it be the duty of the spanish government to remove whilst the captain-general of cuba be invest with general despotic authority in the government of that island the power be withhold from he to examine and redress wrong commit by official under he control on citizen of the united state instead of make we complaint directly to he at havana we be oblige to present they through we minister at madrid these be then refer back to the captain-general for information and much time be thus consume in preliminary investigation and correspondence between madrid and cuba before the spanish government will consent to proceed to negotiation many of the difficulty between the two government would be obviate and a long train of negotiation avoid if the captain-general be invest with authority to settle question of easy solution on the spot where all the fact be fresh and could be promptly and satisfactorily ascertain we have hitherto in vain urge upon the spanish government to confer this power upon the captain-general and we minister to spain will again be instruct to urge this subject on they notice in this respect we occupy a different position from the power of europe cuba be almost within sight of we shore we commerce with it be far greater than that of any other nation include spain itself and we citizen be in habit of daily and extended personal intercourse with every part of the island it be therefore a great grievance that when any difficulty occur no matter how unimportant which might be readily settle at the moment we should be oblige to resort to madrid especially when the very first step to be take there be to refer it back to cuba the truth be that cuba in its exist colonial condition be a constant source of injury and annoyance to the american people it be the only spot in the civilized world where the african slave trade be tolerate and we be bind by treaty with great britain to maintain a naval force on the coast of africa at much expense both of life and treasure solely for the purpose of arrest slaver bind to that island the late serious difficulty between the united state and great britain respect the right of search now so happily terminate could never have arise if cuba have not afford a market for slave as long as this market shall remain open there can be no hope for the civilization of benighted africa whilst the demand for slave continue in cuba war will be wage among the petty and barbarous chief in africa for the purpose of seize subject to supply this trade in such a condition of affair it be impossible that the light of civilization and religion can ever penetrate these dark abode it have be make know to the world by my predecessor that the united state have on several occasion endeavor to acquire cuba from spain by honorable negotiation if this be accomplish the last relic of the african slave trade would instantly disappear we would not if we could acquire cuba in any other manner this be due to we national character all the territory which we have acquire since the origin of the government have be by fair purchase from france spain and mexico or by the free and voluntary act of the independent state of texa in blend she destiny with we own this course we shall ever pursue unless circumstance should occur which we do not now anticipate render a departure from it clearly justifiable under the imperative and overrule law of self-preservation the island of cuba from its geographical position command the mouth of the mississippus and the immense and annually increase trade foreign and coastwise from the valley of that noble river now embrace half the sovereign state of the union with that island under the dominion of a distant foreign power this trade of vital importance to these state be expose to the danger of be destroy in time of war and it have hitherto be subject to perpetual injury and annoyance in time of peace we relation with spain which ought to be of the most friendly character must always be place in jeopardy whilst the exist colonial government over the island shall remain in its present condition whilst the possession of the island would be of vast importance to the united state its value to spain be comparatively unimportant such be the relative situation of the party when the great napoleon transfer louisiana to the united state jealous as he ever be of the national honor and interest of france no person throughout the world have imputed blame to he for accept a pecuniary equivalent for this cession the publicity which have be give to we former negotiation upon this subject and the large appropriation which may be require to effect the purpose render it expedient before make another attempt to renew the negotiation that i should lay the whole subject before congress this be especially necessary as it may become indispensable to success that i should be intrust with the means of make a advance to the spanish government immediately after the signing of the treaty without await the ratification of it by the senate i be encourage to make this suggestion by the example of mr jefferson previous to the purchase of louisiana from france and by that of mr polk in view of the acquisition of territory from mexico i refer the whole subject to congress and commend it to they careful consideration i repeat the recommendation make in my message of December last in favor of a appropriation to be pay to the spanish government for the purpose of distribution among the claimant in the _ amistad _ case president polk first make a similar recommendation in December 1847 and it be repeat by my immediate predecessor in December 1853 i entertain no doubt that indemnity be fairly due to these claimant under we treaty with spain of October 27 1795 and whilst demand justice we ought to do justice a appropriation promptly make for this purpose could not fail to exert a favorable influence on we negotiation with spain we position in relation to the independent state south of we on this continent and especially those within the limit of north america be of a peculiar character the northern boundary of mexico be coincident with we own southern boundary from ocean to ocean and we must necessarily feel a deep interest in all that concern the well-being and the fate of so near a neighbor we have always cherish the kindest wish for the success of that republic and have indulge the hope that it might at last after all its trial enjoy peace and prosperity under a free and stable government we have never hitherto interfere directly or indirectly with its internal affair and it be a duty which we owe to ourselves to protect the integrity of its territory against the hostile interference of any other power we geographical position we direct interest in all that concern mexico and we well-settled policy in regard to the north american continent render this a indispensable duty mexico have be in a state of constant revolution almost ever since it achieve its independence one military leader after another have usurp the government in rapid succession and the various constitution from time to time adopt have be set at naught almost as soon as they be proclaim the successive government have afford no adequate protection either to mexican citizen or foreign resident against lawless violence heretofore a seizure of the capital by a military chieftain have be generally follow by at least the nominal submission of the country to he rule for a brief period but not so at the present crisis of mexican affair a civil war have be rage for some time throughout the republic between the central government at the city of mexico which have endeavor to subvert the constitution last frame by military power and those who maintain the authority of that constitution the antagonist party each hold possession of different state of the republic and the fortune of the war be constantly change meanwhile the most reprehensible means have be employ by both party to extort money from foreigner as well as native to carry on this ruinous contest the truth be that this fine country bless with a productive soil and a benign climate have be reduce by civil dissension to a condition of almost hopeless anarchy and imbecility it would be vain for this government to attempt to enforce payment in money of the claim of american citizen now amount to more than $ 10000000 against mexico because she be destitute of all pecuniary means to satisfy these demand we late minister be furnish with ample power and instruction for the adjustment of all pend question with the central government of mexico and he perform he duty with zeal and ability the claim of we citizen some of they arise out of the violation of a express provision of the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo and other from gross injury to person as well as property have remain unredressed and even unnoticed remonstrance against these grievance have be address without effect to that government meantime in various part of the republic instance have be numerous of the murder imprisonment and plunder of we citizen by different party claim and exercise a local jurisdiction but the central government although repeatedly urge thereto have make no effort either to punish the author of these outrage or to prevent they recurrence no american citizen can now visit mexico on lawful business without imminent danger to he person and property there be no adequate protection to either and in this respect we treaty with that republic be almost a dead letter this state of affair be bring to a crisis in may last by the promulgation of a decree levy a contribution _ pro rata _ upon all the capital in the republic between certain specify amount whether hold by mexican or foreigner mr forsyth regard this decree in the light of a forced loan formally protest against its application to he countryman and advise they not to pay the contribution but to suffer it to be forcibly exact act upon this advice a american citizen refuse to pay the contribution and he property be seize by armed man to satisfy the amount not content with this the government proceed still further and issue a decree banish he from the country we minister immediately notify they that if this decree should be carry into execution he would feel it to be he duty to adopt the most decide measure that belong to the power and obligation of the representative office notwithstanding this warn the banishment be enforce and mr forsyth promptly announce to the government the suspension of the political relation of he legation with they until the pleasure of he own government should be ascertain this government do not regard the contribution impose by the decree of the 15th may last to be in strictness a forced loan and as such prohibit by the tenth article of the treaty of 1826 between great britain and mexico to the benefit of which american citizen be entitle by treaty yet the imposition of the contribution upon foreigner be consider a unjust and oppressive measure besides internal faction in other part of the republic be at the same time levy similar exaction upon the property of we citizen and interrupt they commerce there have be a entire failure on the part of we minister to secure redress for the wrong which we citizen have endure notwithstanding he persevere effort and from the temper manifest by the mexican government he have repeatedly assure we that no favorable change could be expect until the united state should give striking evidence of they will and power to protect they citizen and that severe chastening be the only earthly remedy for we grievance from this statement of fact it would have be worse than idle to direct mr forsyth to retrace he step and resume diplomatic relation with that government and it be therefore deem proper to sanction he withdrawal of the legation from the city of mexico abundant cause now undoubtedly exist for a resort to hostility against the government still hold possession of the capital should they succeed in subdue the constitutional force all reasonable hope will then have expire of a peaceful settlement of we difficulty on the other hand should the constitutional party prevail and they authority be establish over the republic there be reason to hope that they will be animated by a less unfriendly spirit and may grant that redress to american citizen which justice require so far as they may possess the means but for this expectation i should at once have recommend to congress to grant the necessary power to the president to take possession of a sufficient portion of the remote and unsettled territory of mexico to be hold in pledge until we injury shall be redress and we just demand be satisfy we have already exhaust every milder means of obtain justice in such a case this remedy of reprisal be recognize by the law of nation not only as just in itself but as a means of prevent actual war but there be another view of we relation with mexico arise from the unhappy condition of affair along we southwestern frontier which demand immediate action in that remote region where there be but few white inhabitant large band of hostile and predatory indian roam promiscuously over the mexican state of chihuahua and sonora and we adjoining territory the local government of these state be perfectly helpless and be keep in a state of constant alarm by the indian they have not the power if they possess the will even to restrain lawless mexican from pass the border and commit depredation on we remote settler a state of anarchy and violence prevail throughout that distant frontier the law be a dead letter and life and property wholly insecure for this reason the settlement of arizona be arrest whilst it be of great importance that a chain of inhabitant should extend all along its southern border sufficient for they own protection and that of the united state mail pass to and from california well-founded apprehension be now entertain that the indian and wander mexican equally lawless may break up the important stage and postal communication recently establish between we atlantic and pacific possession this pass very near to the mexican boundary throughout the whole length of arizona i can imagine no possible remedy for these evil and no mode of restore law and order on that remote and unsettled frontier but for the government of the united state to assume a temporary protectorate over the northern portion of chihuahua and sonora and to establish military post within the same and this i earnestly recommend to congress this protection may be withdraw as soon as local government shall be establish in these mexican state capable of perform they duty to the united state restrain the lawless and preserve peace along the border i do not doubt that this measure will be view in a friendly spirit by the government and people of chihuahua and sonora as it will prove equally effectual for the protection of they citizen on that remote and lawless frontier as for citizen of the united state and in this connection permit I to recall you attention to the condition of arizona the population of that territory numbering as be allege more than 10000 soul be practically without a government without law and without any regular administration of justice murder and other crime be commit with impunity this state of thing call loudly for redress and i therefore repeat my recommendation for the establishment of a territorial government over arizona the political condition of the narrow isthmus of central america through which transit route pass between the atlantic and pacific ocean present a subject of deep interest to all commercial nation it be over these transit that a large proportion of the trade and travel between the european and asiatic continent be destine to pass to the united state these route be of incalculable importance as a means of communication between they atlantic and pacific possession the latter now extend throughout seventeen degree of latitude on the pacific coast embrace the important state of californium and the flourishing territory of oregon and washington all commercial nation therefore have a deep and direct interest that these communication shall be render secure from interruption if a arm of the sea connect the two ocean penetrate through nicaragua and costa rica it could not be pretend that these state would have the right to arrest or retard its navigation to the injury of other nation the transit by land over this narrow isthmus occupy nearly the same position it be a highway in which they themselves have little interest when compare with the vast interest of the rest of the world whilst they rights of sovereignty ought to be respect it be the duty of other nation to require that this important passage shall not be interrupt by the civil war and revolutionary outbreak which have so frequently occur in that region the stake be too important to be leave at the mercy of rival company claim to hold conflict contract with nicaragua the commerce of other nation be not to stand still and await the adjustment of such petty controversy the government of the united state expect no more than this and they will not be satisfy with less they would not if they could derive any advantage from the nicaragua transit not common to the rest of the world its neutrality and protection for the common use of all nation be they only object they have no objection that nicaragua shall demand and receive a fair compensation from the company and individual who may traverse the route but they insist that it shall never hereafter be close by a arbitrary decree of that government if dispute arise between it and those with whom they may have enter into contract these must be adjust by some fair tribunal provide for the purpose and the route must not be close pend the controversy this be we whole policy and it can not fail to be acceptable to other nation all these difficulty might be avoid if consistently with the good faith of nicaragua the use of this transit could be throw open to general competition provide at the same time for the payment of a reasonable rate to the nicaraguan government on passenger and freight in August 1852 the accessory transit company make its first inter-oceanic trip over the nicaraguan route and continue in successful operation with great advantage to the public until the 18th February 1856 when it be close and the grant to this company as well as its charter be summarily and arbitrarily revoke by the government of president riva previous to this date however in 1854 serious dispute concern the settlement of they account have arise between the company and the government threaten the interruption of the route at any moment these the unite state in vain endeavor to compose it would be useless to narrate the various proceedings which take place between the party up till the time when the transit be discontinue suffice it to say that since February 1856 it have remain closed greatly to the prejudice of citizen of the united state since that time the competition have cease between the rival route of panama and nicaragua and in consequence thereof a unjust and unreasonable amount have be exact from we citizen for they passage to and from california a treaty be sign on the 16th day of November 1857 by the secretary of state and minister of nicaragua under the stipulation of which the use and protection of the transit route would have be secure not only to the united state but equally to all other nation how and on what pretext this treaty have fail to receive the ratification of the nicaraguan government will appear by the papers herewith communicate from the state department the principal objection seem to have be to the provision authorize the united state to employ force to keep the route open in case nicaragua should fail to perform she duty in this respect from the feebleness of that republic its frequent change of government and its constant internal dissension this have become a most important stipulation and one essentially necessary not only for the security of the route but for the safety of american citizen pass and repass to and from we pacific possession be such a stipulation embrace in a treaty between the united state and nicaragua the knowledge of this fact would of itself most probably prevent hostile party from commit aggression on the route and render we actual interference for its protection unnecessary the executive government of this country in its intercourse with foreign nation be limit to the employment of diplomacy alone when this fail it can proceed no further it can not legitimately resort to force without the direct authority of congress except in resist and repel hostile attack it would have no authority to enter the territory of nicaragua even to prevent the destruction of the transit and protect the life and property of we own citizen on they passage it be true that on a sudden emergency of this character the president would direct any armed force in the vicinity to march to they relief but in do this he would act upon he own responsibility under these circumstance i earnestly recommend to congress the passage of a act authorize the president under such restriction as they may deem proper to employ the land and naval force of the united state in prevent the transit from be obstruct or close by lawless violence and in protect the life and property of american citizen travel thereupon require at the same time that these force shall be withdraw the moment the danger shall have pass away without such a provision we citizen will be constantly expose to interruption in they progress and to lawless violence a similar necessity exist for the passage of such a act for the protection of the panama and tehuantepec route in reference to the panama route the united state by they exist treaty with new granada expressly guarantee the neutrality of the isthmus with the view that the free transit from the one to the other sea may not be interrupted or embarrassed in any future time while this treaty exist in regard to the tehuantepec route which have be recently open under the most favorable auspices we treaty with mexico of the 30th December 1853 secure to the citizen of the united state a right of transit over it for they person and merchandise and stipulate that neither government shall interpose any obstacle thereto it also concede to the united state the right to transport across the isthmus in closed bag the mail of the united state not intend for distribution along the line of the communication also the effect of the united state government and its citizen which may be intend for transit and not for distribution on the isthmus free of custom-house or other charge by the mexican government these treaty stipulation with new granada and mexico in addition to the consideration applicable to the nicaragua route seem to require legislation for the purpose of carry they into effect the injury which have be inflict upon we citizen in costa rica and nicaragua during the last two or three year have receive the prompt attention of this government some of these injury be of the most aggravate character the transaction at virgin bay in April 1856 when a company of unarmed american who be in no way connect with any belligerent conduct or party be fire upon by the troops of costa rica and number of they kill and wound be bring to the knowledge of congress by my predecessor soon after its occurrence and be also present to the government of costa rica for that immediate investigation and redress which the nature of the case demand a similar course be pursue with reference to other outrage in these country some of which be hardly less aggravate in they character than the transaction at virgin bay at the time however when we present minister to nicaragua be appoint in December 1857 no redress have be obtain for any of these wrong and no reply even have be receive to the demand which have be make by this government upon that of costa rica more than a year before we minister be instruct therefore to lose no time in express to those government the deep regret with which the president have witness this inattention to the just claim of the united state and in demand they prompt and satisfactory adjustment unless this demand shall be comply with at a early day it will only remain for this government to adopt such other measure as may be necessary in order to obtain for itself that justice which it have in vain attempt to secure by peaceful means from the government of nicaragua and costa rica while it have show and will continue to show the most sincere regard for the rights and honor of these republic it can not permit this regard to be meet by a utter neglect on they part of what be due to the government and citizen of the united state against new granada we have long-standing cause of complaint arise out of the unsatisfied claim of we citizen upon that republic and to these have be more recently add the outrage commit upon we citizen at panama in April 1856 a treaty for the adjustment of these difficulty be conclude by the secretary of state and the minister of new granada in September 1857 which contain just and acceptable provision for that purpose this treaty be transmit to bogota and be ratify by the government of new granada but with certain amendment it be not however return to this city until after the close of the last session of the senate it will be immediately transmit to that body for they advice and consent and should this be obtain it will remove all we exist cause of complaint against new granada on the subject of claim question have arise between the two government as to the right of new granada to levy a tonnage duty upon the vessel of the united state in its port of the isthmus and to levy a passenger tax upon we citizen arrive in that country whether with a design to remain there or to pass from ocean to ocean by the transit route and also a tax upon the mail of the united state transport over the panama railroad the government of new granada have be inform that the united state would consider the collection of either of these tax as a act in violation of the treaty between the two country and as such would be resist by the united state at the same time we be prepare to discuss these question in a spirit of amity and justice and with a sincere desire to adjust they in a satisfactory manner a negotiation for that purpose have already be commence no effort have recently be make to collect these tax nor be any anticipate under present circumstance with the empire of brazil we relation be of the most friendly character the production of the two country and especially those of a agricultural nature be such as to invite extensive mutual exchange a large quantity of american flour be consume in brazil whilst more than treble the amount in value of brazilian coffee be consume in the united state whilst this be the case a heavy duty have be levy until very recently upon the importation of american flour into brazil i be gratified however to be able to inform you that in September last this have be reduce from $ 132 to about 49 cent per barrel and the duty on other article of we production have be diminish in nearly the same proportion i regret to state that the government of brazil still continue to levy a export duty of about 11 per cent on coffee notwithstanding this article be admit free from duty in the united state this be a heavy charge upon the consumer of coffee in we country as we purchase half of the entire surplus crop of that article raise in brazil we minister under instruction will reiterate he effort to have this export duty remove and it be hope that the enlighten government of the emperor will adopt this wise just and equal policy in that event there be good reason to believe that the commerce between the two country will greatly increase much to the advantage of both the claim of we citizen against the government of brazil be not in the aggregate of very large amount but some of these rest upon plain principle of justice and they settlement ought not to be longer delay a renew and earnest and i trust a successful effort will be make by we minister to procure they final adjustment on the 2d of June last congress pass a joint resolution authorize the president to adopt such measure and use such force as in he judgment may be necessary and advisable for the purpose of adjust the difference between the united state and the republic of paraguay in connection with the attack on the united state steamer _ water witch _ and with other measure refer to in he annual message and on the 12th of July follow they make a appropriation to defray the expense and compensation of a commissioner to that republic should the president deem it proper to make such a appointment in compliance with these enactment i have appoint a commissioner who have proceed to paraguay with full power and instruction to settle these difference in a amicable and peaceful manner if this be practicable he experience and discretion justify the hope that he may prove successful in convince the paraguayan government that it be due both to honor and justice that they should voluntarily and promptly make atonement for the wrong which they have commit against the united state and indemnify we injured citizen whom they have forcibly despoil of they property should we commissioner prove unsuccessful after a sincere and earnest effort to accomplish the object of he mission then no alternative will remain but the employment of force to obtain just satisfaction from paraguay in view of this contingency the secretary of the navy under my direction have fit out and dispatch a naval force to rendezvous near bueno ayre which it be believe will prove sufficient for the occasion it be my earnest desire however that it may not be find necessary to resort to this last alternative when congress meet in December last the business of the country have just be crush by one of those periodical revulsion which be the inevitable consequence of we unsound and extravagant system of bank credit and inflated currency with all the element of national wealth in abundance we manufacture be suspend we useful public and private enterprise be arrest and thousand of laborer be deprive of employment and reduce to want universal distress prevail among the commercial manufacturing and mechanical class this revulsion be feel the more severely in the united state because similar cause have produce the like deplorable effect throughout the commercial nation of europe all be experience sad reverse at the same moment we manufacturer everywhere suffer severely not because of the recent reduction in the tariff of duty on import but because there be no demand at any price for they production the people be oblige to restrict themselves in they purchase to article of prime necessity in the general prostration of business the iron manufacturer in different state probably suffer more than any other class and much destitution be the inevitable consequence among the great number of workman who have be employ in this useful branch of industry there could be no supply where there be no demand to present a example there could be no demand for railroad iron after we magnificent system of railroad extend its benefit to every portion of the union have be bring to a dead pause the same consequence have result from similar cause to many other branch of useful manufacture it be self-evident that where there be no ability to purchase manufactured article these can not be sell and consequently must cease to be produce no government and especially a government of such limited power as that of the united state could have prevent the late revulsion the whole commercial world seem for year to have be rush to this catastrophe the same ruinous consequence would have follow in the united state whether the duty upon foreign import have remain as they be under the tariff of 1846 or have be raise to a much higher standard the tariff of 1857 have no agency in the result the general cause exist throughout the world could not have be control by the legislation of any particular country the periodical revulsion which have exist in we past history must continue to return at interval so long as we present unbounded system of bank credit shall prevail they will however probably be the less severe in future because it be not to be expect at least for many year to come that the commercial nation of europe with whose interest we own be so materially involve will expose themselves to similar calamity but this subject be treat so much at large in my last annual message that i shall not now pursue it further still i respectfully renew the recommendation in favor of the passage of a uniform bankrupt law applicable to banking institution this be all the direct power over the subject which i believe the federal government possess such a law would mitigate though it might not prevent the evil the instinct of self-preservation might produce a wholesome restraint upon they banking business if they know in advance that a suspension of specie payment would inevitably produce they civil death but the effect of the revulsion be now slowly but surely pass away the energy and enterprise of we citizen with we unbounded resource will within the period of another year restore a state of wholesome industry and trade capital have again accumulate in we large city the rate of interest be there very low confidence be gradually revive and so soon as it be discover that this capital can be profitably employ in commercial and manufacturing enterprise and in the construction of railroad and other work of public and private improvement prosperity will again smile throughout the land it be vain however to disguise the fact from ourselves that a speculative inflation of we currency without a corresponding inflation in other country whose manufacture come into competition with we own must ever produce disastrous result to we domestic manufacture no tariff short of absolute prohibition can prevent these evil consequence in connection with this subject it be proper to refer to we financial condition the same cause which have produce pecuniary distress throughout the country have so reduce the amount of import from foreign country that the revenue have prove inadequate to meet the necessary expense of the government to supply the deficiency congress by the act of December 23 1857 authorize the issue of $ 20000000 of treasury note and this prove inadequate they authorize by the act of June 14 1858 a loan of $ 20000000 to be apply to the payment of appropriation make by law no statesman would advise that we should go on increase the national debt to meet the ordinary expense of the government this would be a most ruinous policy in case of war we credit must be we chief resource at least for the first year and this would be greatly impair by have contract a large debt in time of peace it be we true policy to increase we revenue so as to equal we expenditure it would be ruinous to continue to borrow besides it may be proper to observe that the incidental protection thus afford by a revenue tariff would at the present moment to some extent increase the confidence of the manufacturing interest and give a fresh impulse to we revive business to this surely no person will object in regard to the mode of assess and collect duty under a strictly revenue tariff i have long entertain and often express the opinion that sound policy require this should be do by specific duty in case to which these can be properly apply they be well adapt to commodity which be usually sell by weight or by measure and which from they nature be of equal or of nearly equal value such for example be the article of iron of different class raw sugar and foreign wine and spirit in my deliberate judgment specific duty be the best if not the only means of secure the revenue against false and fraudulent invoice and such have be the practice adopt for this purpose by other commercial nation besides specific duty would afford to the american manufacturer the incidental advantage to which he be fairly entitle under a revenue tariff the present system be a slide scale to he disadvantage under it when price be high and business prosperous the duty rise in amount when he least require they aid on the contrary when price fall and he be struggle against adversity the duty be diminish in the same proportion greatly to he injury neither would there be danger that a higher rate of duty than that intend by congress could be levy in the form of specific duty it would be easy to ascertain the average value of any import article for a series of year and instead of subject it to a _ ad valorem _ duty at a certain rate _ per centum _ to substitute in its place a equivalent specific duty by such a arrangement the consumer would not be injure it be true he might have to pay a little more duty on a give article in one year but if so he would pay a little less in another and in a series of year these would counterbalance each other and amount to the same thing so far as he interest be concern this inconvenience would be trifling when contrast with the additional security thus afford against fraud upon the revenue in which every consumer be directly interested i have throw out these suggestion as the fruit of my own observation to which congress in they better judgment will give such weight as they may justly deserve the report of the secretary of the treasury will explain in detail the operation of that department of the government the receipt into the treasury from all source during the fiscal year end June 30 1858 include the treasury note authorize by the act of December 23 1857 be $ 7027386959 which amount with the balance of $ 1771011427 remain in the treasury at the commencement of the year make a aggregate for the service of the year of $ 8798398386 the public expenditure during the fiscal year end June 30 1858 amount to $ 8158566776 of which $ 968453799 be apply to the payment of the public debt and the redemption of treasury note with the interest thereon leave in the treasury on July 1 1858 be the commencement of the present fiscal year $ 639831610 the receipt into the treasury during the first quarter of the present fiscal year commence the 1st of July 1858 include one-half of the loan of $ 20000000 with the premium upon it authorize by the act of June 14 1858 be $ 2523087946 and the estimate receipt for the remain three quarter to the 30th of June 1859 from ordinary source be $ 38500000 make with the balance before state a aggregate of $ 7012919556 the expenditure during the first quarter of the present fiscal year be $ 2170819851 of which $ 101014237 be apply to the payment of the public debt and the redemption of treasury note and the interest thereon the estimate expenditure during the remain three quarter to June 30 1859 be $ 5235769848 make a aggregate of $ 7406589699 be a excess of expenditure beyond the estimate receipt into the treasury from ordinary source during the fiscal year to the 30th of June 1859 of $ 393670143 extraordinary means be place by law within the command of the secretary of the treasury by the reissue of treasury note redeem and by negotiate the balance of the loan authorize by the act of June 14 1858 to the extent of $ 11000000 which if realize during the present fiscal year will leave a balance in the treasury on the 1st day of July 1859 of $ 706329857 the estimate receipt during the next fiscal year end June 30 1860 be $ 62000000 which with the above-estimated balance of $ 706329857 make a aggregate for the service of the next fiscal year of $ 6906329857 the estimate expenditure during the next fiscal year end June 30 1860 be $ 7313914746 which leave a deficit of estimate means compare with the estimate expenditure for that year commence on July 1 1859 of $ 407584889 in addition to this sum the postmaster-general will require from the treasury for the service of the post-office department $ 3838728 as explain in the report of the secretary of the treasury which will increase the estimate deficit on June 30 1860 to $ 791457689 to provide for the payment of this estimate deficiency which will be increase by such appropriation as may be make by congress not estimate for in the report of the treasury department as well as to provide for the gradual redemption from year to year of the outstanding treasury note the secretary of the treasury recommend such a revision of the present tariff as will raise the require amount after what i have already say i need scarcely add that i concur in the opinion express in he report -- that the public debt should not be increase by a additional loan -- and would therefore strongly urge upon congress the duty of make at they present session the necessary provision for meet these liability the public debt on July 1 1858 the commencement of the present fiscal year be $ 2515597766 during the first quarter of the present year the sum of $ 10000000 have be negotiate of the loan authorize by the act of June 14 1858 make the present outstanding public debt exclusive of treasury note $ 3515597766 there be on the 1st of July 1858 of treasury note issue by authority of the act of December 23 1857 unredeem the sum of $ 19754800 make the amount of actual indebtedness at that date $ 5491077766 to this will be add $ 10000000 during the present fiscal year this be the remain half of the loan of $ 20000000 not yet negotiate the rapid increase of the public debt and the necessity which exist for a modification of the tariff to meet even the ordinary expense of the government ought to admonish we all in we respective sphere of duty to the practice of rigid economy the object of expenditure should be limit in number as far as this may be practicable and the appropriation necessary to carry they into effect ought to be disburse under the strictest accountability enlighten economy do not consist in the refusal to appropriate money for constitutional purpose essential to the defense progress and prosperity of the republic but in take care that none of this money shall be waste by mismanagement in its application to the object designate by law comparison between the annual expenditure at the present time and what it be ten or twenty year ago be altogether fallacious the rapid increase of we country in extent and population render a corresponding increase of expenditure to some extent unavoidable this be constantly create new object of expenditure and augment the amount require for the old the true question then be have these object be unnecessarily multiply or have the amount expend upon any or all of they be larger than comport with due economy in accordance with these principle the head of the different executive department of the government have be instruct to reduce they estimate for the next fiscal year to the lowest standard consistent with the efficiency of the service and this duty they have perform in a spirit of just economy the estimate of the treasury war navy and interior department have each be in some degree reduce and unless a sudden and unforeseen emergency should arise it be not anticipate that a deficiency will exist in either within the present or the next fiscal year the post-office department be place in a peculiar position different from the other department and to this i shall hereafter refer i invite congress to institute a rigid scrutiny to ascertain whether the expense in all the department can not be still further reduce and i promise they all the aid in my power in pursue the investigation i transmit herewith the report make to I by the secretary of war of the navy of the interior and of the postmaster-general they each contain valuable information and important recommendation to which i invite the attention of congress in my last annual message i take occasion to recommend the immediate construction of ten small steamer of light draft for the purpose of increase the efficiency of the navy congress respond to the recommendation by authorize the construction of eight of they the progress which have be make in execute this authority be state in the report of the secretary of the navy i concur with he in the opinion that a greater number of this class of vessel be necessary for the purpose of protect in a more efficient manner the person and property of american citizen on the high sea and in foreign country as well as in guard more effectually we own coast i accordingly recommend the passage of a act for this purpose the suggestion contain in the report of the secretary of the interior especially those in regard to the disposition of the public domain the pension and bounty-land system the policy toward the indian and the amendment of we patent law be worthy of the serious consideration of congress the post-office department occupy a position very different from that of the other department for many year it be the policy of the government to render this a self-sustaining department and if this can not now be accomplish in the present condition of the country we ought to make as near a approach to it as may be practicable the postmaster-general be place in a most embarrassing position by the exist law he be oblige to carry these into effect he have no other alternative he find however that this can not be do without heavy demand upon the treasury over and above what be receive for postage and these have be progressively increase from year to year until they amount for the last fiscal year end on the 30th of June 1858 to more than $ 4500000 whilst it be estimate that for the present fiscal year they will amount to $ 6290000 these sum be exclusive of the annual appropriation of $ 700000 for compensation for the mail service perform for the two house of congress and the other department and officer of the government in the transmission of free matter the cause of these large deficit be mainly attributable to the increase expense of transport the mail in 1852 the sum pay for this service be but a fraction above four million and a quarter since that year it have annually increase until in 1858 it have reach more than eight million and a quarter and for the service of 1859 it be estimate that it will amount to more than $ 10000000 the receipt of the post-office department can be make to approach or to equal its expenditure only by means of the legislation of congress in apply any remedy care should be take that the people shall not be deprive of the advantage which they be fairly entitle to enjoy from the post-office department the principal remedy recommend to the consideration of congress by the postmaster-general be to restore the former rate of postage upon single letter to 5 cent to substitute for the franking privilege the delivery to those now entitle to enjoy it of post-office stamp for they correspondence and to direct the department in make contract for the transportation of the mail to confine itself to the payment of the sum necessary for this single purpose without require it to be transport in post coach or carriage of any particular description under the present system the expense to the government be greatly increase by require that the mail shall be carry in such vehicle as will accommodate passenger this will be do without pay from the department over all road where the travel will remunerate the contractor these recommendation deserve the grave consideration of congress i would again call you attention to the construction of a pacific railroad time and reflection have but serve to confirm I in the truth and justice of the observation which i make on this subject in my last annual message to which i beg leave respectfully to refer it be freely admit that it would be inexpedient for this government to exercise the power of construct the pacific railroad by its own immediate agent such a policy would increase the patronage of the executive to a dangerous extent and introduce a system of jobbing and corruption which no vigilance on the part of federal official could either prevent or detect this can only be do by the keen eye and active and careful supervision of individual and private interest the construction of this road ought therefore to be commit to company incorporate by the state or other agency whose pecuniary interest would be directly involve congress might then assist they in the work by grant of land or of money or both under such condition and restriction as would secure the transportation of troops and munitions of war free from any charge and that of the united state mail at a fair and reasonable price the progress of event since the commencement of you last session have show how soon difficulty disappear before a firm and determine resolution at that time such a road be deem by wise and patriotic man to be a visionary project the great distance to be overcome and the intervene mountain and desert in the way be obstacle which in the opinion of many could not be surmount now after the lapse of but a single year these obstacle it have be discover be far less formidable than they be suppose to be and mail stage with passenger now pass and repass regularly twice in each week by a common wagon road between san francisco and st loui and memphi in less than twenty-five day the service have be as regularly perform as it be in former year between new york and this city whilst disclaim all authority to appropriate money for the construction of this road except that derive from the war-making power of the constitution there be important collateral consideration urge we to undertake the work as speedily as possible the first and most momentous of these be that such a road would be a powerful bond of union between the state east and west of the rocky mountain this be so self-evident as to require no illustration but again in a commercial point of view i consider this the great question of the day with the eastern front of we republic stretch along the atlantic and its western front along the pacific if all the part should be unite by a safe easy and rapid intercommunication we must necessarily command a very large proportion of the trade both of europe and asia we recent treaty with china and japan will open these rich and populous empire to we commerce and the history of the world prove that the nation which have gain possession of the trade with eastern asia have always become wealthy and powerful the peculiar geographical position of californium and we pacific possession invite american capital and enterprise into this fruitful field to reap the rich harvest however it be a indispensable prerequisite that we shall first have a railroad to convey and circulate its product throughout every portion of the union besides such a railroad through we temperate latitude which would not be impede by the frost and snow of winter nor by the tropical heat of summer would attract to itself much of the travel and the trade of all nation pass between europe and asia on the 21st of August last lieutenant jn maffit of the united state brig _ dolphin _ capture the slaver _ echo _ -lrb- formerly the _ putnam _ of new orlean -rrb- near kay verde on the coast of cuba with more than 300 african negro on board the prize under the command of lieutenant bradford of the united state navy arrive at charleston on the 27th August when the negro 306 in number be deliver into the custody of the united state marshal for the district of south carolina they be first place in castle pinckney and afterwards in fort sumter for safe-keeping and be detain there until the 19th September when the survivor 271 in number be deliver on board the united state steamer _ niagara _ to be transport to the coast of africa under the charge of the agent of the united state pursuant to the provision of the act of the 3d march 1819 in addition to the act prohibit the slave trade under the second section of this act the president be authorize to make such regulation and arrangement as he may deem expedient for the safe-keeping support and removal beyond the limit of the united state of all such negro mulatto or person of color capture by vessel of the united state as may be deliver to the marshal of the district into which they be bring and to appoint a proper person or person reside upon the coast of africa as agent or agent for receive the negro mulatto or person of color deliver from on board vessel seize in the prosecution of the slave trade by commander of united state arm vessel a doubt immediately arise as to the true construction of this act it be quite clear from its term that the president be authorize to provide for the safe-keeping support and removal of these negro up till the time of they delivery to the agent on the coast of africa but no express provision be make for they protection and support after they have reach the place of they destination still a agent be to be appoint to receive they in africa and it could not have be suppose that congress intend he should desert they at the moment they be receive and turn they loose on that inhospitable coast to perish for want of food or to become again the victim of the slave trade have this be the intention of congress the employment of a agent to receive they who be require to reside on the coast be unnecessary and they might have be land by we vessel anywhere in africa and leave expose to the suffering and the fate which would certainly await they mr monroe in he special message of December 17 1819 at the first session after the act be pass announce to congress what in he opinion be its true construction he believe it to be he duty under it to follow these unfortunate into africa and make provision for they there until they should be able to provide for themselves in communicate this interpretation of the act to congress he state that some doubt have be entertain as to its true intent and meaning and he submit the question to they so that they might should it be deem advisable amend the same before further proceedings be have under it nothing be do by congress to explain the act and mr monroe proceed to carry it into execution accord to he own interpretation this then become the practical construction when the african from on board the _ echo _ be deliver to the marshal at charleston it become my duty to consider what disposition ought to be make of they under the law for many reason it be expedient to remove they from that locality as speedily as possible although the conduct of the authority and citizen of charleston in give countenance to the execution of the law be just what might have be expect from they high character yet a prolonged continuance of 300 african in the immediate vicinity of that city could not have fail to become a source of inconvenience and anxiety to its inhabitant where to send they be the question there be no portion of the coast of africa to which they could be remove with any regard to humanity except to liberium under these circumstance a agreement be enter into with the colonization society on the 7th of September last a copy of which be herewith transmit under which the society engage for the consideration of $ 45000 to receive these african in liberium from the agent of the united state and furnish they during the period of one year thereafter with comfortable shelter clothing provision and medical attendance cause the child to receive schooling and all whether child or adult to be instruct in the art of civilized life suitable to they condition this aggregate of $ 45000 be base upon a allowance of $ 150 for each individual and as there have be considerable mortality among they and may be more before they reach africa the society have agree in a equitable spirit to make such a deduction from the amount as under the circumstance may appear just and reasonable this can not be fix until we shall ascertain the actual number which may become a charge to the society it be also distinctly agree that under no circumstance shall this government be call upon for any additional expense the agent of the society manifest a laudable desire to conform to the wish of the government throughout the transaction they assure I that after a careful calculation they would be require to expend the sum of $ 150 on each individual in comply with the agreement and they would have nothing leave to remunerate they for they care trouble and responsibility at all event i could make no better arrangement and there be no other alternative during the period when the government itself through its own agent undertake the task of provide for capture negro in africa the cost per head be very much greater there have be no outstanding appropriation applicable to this purpose i could not advance any money on the agreement i therefore recommend that a appropriation may be make of the amount necessary to carry it into effect other capture of a similar character may and probably will be make by we naval force and i earnestly recommend that congress may amend the second section of the act of march 3 1819 so as to free its construction from the ambiguity which have so long exist and render the duty of the president plain in execute its provision i recommend to you favorable regard the local interest of the district of columbium as the residence of congress and the executive department of the government we can not fail to

the united state and to prevent similar violation hereafter jame buchanan washington _ February 18 1859 _ _ to the senate and house of representative _ : the brief period which remain of you present session and the great urgency and importance of legislative action before its termination for the protection of american citizen and they property whilst in transit across the isthmus route between we atlantic and pacific possession render it my duty again to recall this subject to you notice i have heretofore present it in my annual message both in December 1857 and 1858 to which i beg leave to refer in the latter i state that -- the executive government of this country in its intercourse with foreign nation be limit to the employment of diplomacy alone when this fail it can proceed no further it can not legitimately resort to force without the direct authority of congress except in resist and repel hostile attack it would have no authority to enter the territory of nicaragua even to prevent the destruction of the transit and protect the life and property of we own citizen on they passage it be true that on a sudden emergency of this character the president would direct any armed force in the vicinity to march to they relief but in do this he would act upon he own responsibility under these circumstance i earnestly recommend to congress the passage of a act authorize the president under such restriction as they may deem proper to employ the land and naval force of the united state in prevent the transit from be obstruct or close by lawless violence and in protect the life and property of american citizen travel thereupon require at the same time that these force shall be withdraw the moment the danger shall have pass away without such a provision we citizen will be constantly expose to interruption in they progress and to lawless violence a similar necessity exist for the passage of such a act for the protection of the panama and tehuantepee route another subject equally important command the attention of the senate at the last session of congress the republic south of the united state on this continent have unfortunately be frequently in a state of revolution and civil war ever since they achieve they independence as one or the other party have prevail and obtain possession of the port open to foreign commerce they have seize and confiscate american vessel and they cargo in a arbitrary and lawless manner and exact money from american citizen by forced loan and other violent proceedings to enable they to carry on hostility the executive government of great britain france and other country possess the war-making power can promptly employ the necessary means to enforce immediate redress for similar outrage upon they subject not so the executive government of the united state if the president order a vessel of war to any of these port to demand prompt redress for outrage commit the offend party be well aware that in case of refusal the commander can do no more than remonstrate he can resort to no hostile act the question must then be refer to diplomacy and in many case adequate redress can never be obtain thus american citizen be deprive of the same protection under the flag of they country which the subject of other nation enjoy the remedy for this state of thing can only be supply by congress since the constitution have confide to that body alone the power to make war without the authority of congress the executive can not lawfully direct any force however near it may be to the scene of difficulty to enter the territory of mexico nicaragua or new granada for the purpose of defend the person and property of american citizen even though they may be violently assail whilst pass in peaceful transit over the tehuantepec nicaragua or panama route he can not without transcend he constitutional power direct a gun to be fire into a port or land a seaman or marine to protect the life of we countryman on shore or to obtain redress for a recent outrage on they property the bandit which infest we neighboring republic of mexico always claim to belong to one or other of the hostile party might make a sudden descent on vera cruz or on the tehuantepec route and he would have no power to employ the force on shipboard in the vicinity for they relief either to prevent the plunder of we merchant or the destruction of the transit in reference to country where the local authority be strong enough to enforce the law the difficulty here indicate can seldom happen but where this be not the case and the local authority do not possess the physical power even if they possess the will to protect we citizen within they limit recent experience have show that the american executive should itself be authorize to render this protection such a grant of authority thus limit in its extent could in no just sense be regard as a transfer of the war-making power to the executive but only as a appropriate exercise of that power by the body to whom it exclusively belong the riot at panama in 1856 in which a great number of we citizen lose they life furnish a pointed illustration of the necessity which may arise for the exertion of this authority i therefore earnestly recommend to congress on whom the responsibility exclusively rest to pass a law before they adjournment confer on the president the power to protect the life and property of american citizen in the case which i have indicate under such restriction and condition as they may deem advisable the knowledge that such a law exist would of itself go far to prevent the outrage which it be intend to redress and to render the employment of force unnecessary without this the president may be place in a painful position before the meeting of the next congress in the present disturbed condition of mexico and one or more of the other republic south of we no person can foresee what occurrence may take place before that period in case of emergency we citizen see that they do not enjoy the same protection with subject of european government will have just cause to complain on the other hand should the executive interpose and especially should the result prove disastrous and valuable life be lose he might subject himself to severe censure for have assume a power not confide to he by the constitution it be to guard against this contingency that i now appeal to congress have thus recommend to congress a measure which i deem necessary and expedient for the interest and honor of the country i leave the whole subject to they wisdom and discretion jame buchanan washington _ February 18 1859 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : i transmit to the senate for its consideration with a view to ratification two convention

the credit of the country this be the last day of the present congress and no provision have yet be make for the payment of appropriation and to meet the outstanding treasury note issue under the authority of law from the information which have already be communicate to congress by the secretary of the treasury it be manifest that the ordinary receipt into the treasury even under the most favorable circumstance will scarcely meet the ordinary expense of the government during the remainder of the present fiscal year end on the 30th of June at that time nearly eighteen million of treasury note will have become due and many of those not yet due be daily pay for duty at the different port and there will be no means in the treasury to meet they thus the country which be full of resource will be dishonor before the world and the american people who be a debt-paying people will be disgrace by the omission on we part to do we duty it be impossible to avoid this catastrophe unless we make provision this very day to meet the lawful demand on the public treasury if this be the first instead of the last session of a congress the case would be different you might then be convene by proclamation for to-morrow morning but there be now thirteen state of the union entitle to seventy-eight representative in which none have be elect it will therefore be impracticable for a large majority of these state to elect they member before the treasury shall be compel to stop payment under these circumstance i earnestly recommend to congress to make provision within the few remain hour of the session for the preservation of the public credit the urgency of the case not only justify but demand that if necessary this shall be do by a separate bill we ought to incur no risk when the good faith of the country be at stake jame buchanan veto message -lrb- 10 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 10 : the first be a pocket veto -rrb- washington _ January 7 1859 _ _ to the house of

joseph missouri to placerville californium be present to I for my approval this resolution authorize and direct the postmaster-general to order a increase of speed upon say route require the mail to be carry through in thirty day instead of thirty-eight day accord to the exist contract : _ provide _ the same can be do upon a _ pro rata _ increase of compensation to the contractor i do not approve this joint resolution : first because it be present to I at so late a period that i have not the time necessary on the day of the adjournment of the last session for a investigation of the subject besides no injury could result to the public as the postmaster-general already possess the discretionary power under exist law to increase the speed upon this as well as all other mail route second because the postmaster-general at the moment in the capitol inform I that the contractor themselves have offer to increase the speed on this route to thirty instead of thirty-eight day at a less cost than that authorize by the joint resolution upon subsequent examination it have be ascertain at the post-office department that they bid which be still depend propose to perform this service for a sum less by $ 49000 than that authorize by the resolution jame buchanan washington city _ February 24 1859 _ _ to the house of representative of the united state _ : i return with my objection to the house of representative in which it originate the bill entitle a act donate public land to the several state and territory which may provide college for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic art present to I on the 18th instant this bill make a donation to the several state of 20000 acre of the public land for each senator and representative in the present congress and also a additional donation of 20000 acre for each additional representative to which any state may be entitle under the census of 1860 accord to a report from the interior department base upon the present number of senator and representative the land give to the state amount to 6060000 acre and they value at the minimum government price of $ 125 per acre to $ 7575000 the object of this gift as state by the bill be the endowment support and maintenance of at least one college -lrb- in each state -rrb- where the lead object shall be without exclude other scientific or classical study to teach such branch of learn as be related to agriculture and the mechanic art as the legislature of the state may respectively prescribe in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial class in the several pursuit and profession in life as there do not appear from the bill to be any beneficiary in existence to which this endowment can be apply each state be require to provide within five year at least not less than one college or the grant to say state shall cease in that event the say state shall be bind to pay the united state the amount receive of any land previously sell and that the title to purchaser under the state shall be valid the grant in land itself be confine to such state as have public land within they limit worth $ 125 per acre in the opinion of the governor for the remain state the secretary of the interior be direct to issue land scrip to the amount of they distributive share in acre under the provision of this act say scrip to be sell by say state and the proceeds thereof apply to the use and purpose prescribe in this act and for no other use or purpose whatsoever the land be grant and the scrip be to be issue in section or subdivision of section of not less than one-quarter of a section accord to a estimate from the interior department the number of acre which will probably be accept by state have public land within they own limit will not exceed 580000 acre -lrb- and it may be much less -rrb- leave a balance of 5480000 acre to be provide for by scrip these grant of land and land scrip to each of the thirty-three state be make upon certain condition the principal of which be that if the fund shall be lose or diminish on account of unfortunate investment or otherwise the deficiency shall be replace and make good by the respective state i shall now proceed to state my objection to this bill i deem it to be both inexpedient and unconstitutional 1 this bill have be pass at a period when we can with great difficulty raise sufficient revenue to sustain the expense of the government should it become a law the treasury will be deprive of the whole or nearly the whole of we income from the sale of public land which for the next fiscal year have be estimate at $ 5000000 a bare statement of the case will make this evident the minimum price at which we dispose of we land be $ 125 per acre at the present moment however the price have be reduce to those who purchase the bounty-land warrant of the old soldier to 85 cent per acre and of these warrant there be still outstanding and unlocated as appear by a report -lrb- February 12 1859 -rrb- from the general land office the amount of 11990391 acre this have already greatly reduce the current sale by the government and diminish the revenue from this source if in addition thirty-three state shall enter the market with they land scrip the price must be greatly reduce below even 85 cent per acre as much to the prejudice of the old soldier who have not already part with they land warrant as to government it be easy to perceive that with this glut of the market government can sell little or no land at $ 125 per acre when the price of bounty-land warrant and scrip shall be reduce to half this sum this source of revenue will be almost entirely dry up under the bill the state may sell they land scrip at any price it may bring there be no limitation whatever in this respect indeed they must sell for what the scrip will bring for without this fund they can not proceed to establish they college within the five year to which they be limit it be manifest therefore that to the extent to which this bill will prevent the sale of public land at $ 125 per acre to that amount it will have precisely the same effect upon the treasury as if we should impose a tax to create a loan to endow these state college surely the present be the most unpropitious moment which could have be select for the passage of this bill 2 waive for the present the question of constitutional power what effect will this bill have on the relation establish between the federal and state government the constitution be a grant to congress of a few enumerated but most important power relate chiefly to war peace foreign and domestic commerce negotiation and other subject which can be best or alone exercise beneficially by the common government all other power be reserve to the state and to the people for the efficient and harmonious working of both it be necessary that they several sphere of action should be keep distinct from each other this alone can prevent conflict and mutual injury should the time ever arrive when the state government shall look to the federal treasury for the means of support themselves and maintain they system of education and internal policy the character of both government will be greatly deteriorate the representative of the state and of the people feel a more immediate interest in obtain money to lighten the burden of they constituent than for the promotion of the more distant object intrust to the federal government will naturally incline to obtain means from the federal government for state purpose if a question shall arise between a appropriation of land or money to carry into effect the object of the federal government and those of the state they feeling will be enlist in favor of the latter this be human nature and hence the necessity of keep the two government entirely distinct the preponderance of this home feeling have be manifest by the passage of the present bill the establishment of these college have prevail over the press want of the common treasury no nation ever have such a inheritance as we possess in the public land these ought to be manage with the utmost care but at the same time with a liberal spirit toward actual settler in the first year of a war with a powerful naval nation the revenue from custom must in a great degree cease a resort to loan will then become necessary and these can always be obtain as we father obtain they on advantageous term by pledge the public land as security in this view of the subject it would be wiser to grant money to the state for domestic purpose than to squander away the public land and transfer they in large body into the hand of speculator a successful struggle on the part of the state government with the general government for the public land would deprive the latter of the means of perform its high duty especially at critical and dangerous period besides it would operate with equal detriment to the best interest of the state it would remove the most wholesome of all restraint on legislative body -- that of be oblige to raise money by taxation from they constituent -- and would lead to extravagance if not to corruption what be obtain easily and without responsibility will be lavishly expend 3 this bill should it become a law will operate greatly to the injury of the new state the progress of settlement and the increase of a industrious population own a interest in the soil they cultivate be the cause which will build they up into great and flourishing commonwealth nothing could be more prejudicial to they interest than for wealthy individual to acquire large tract of the public land and hold they for speculative purpose the low price to which this land scrip will probably be reduce will tempt speculator to buy it in large amount and locate it on the best land belong to the government the eventual consequence must be that the man who desire to cultivate the soil will be compel to purchase these very land at rate much higher than the price at which they could be obtain from the government 4 it be extremely doubtful to say the least whether this bill would contribute to the advancement of agriculture and the mechanic art -- object the dignity and value of which can not be too highly appreciate the federal government which make the donation have confessedly no constitutional power to follow it into the state and enforce the application of the fund to the intended object as donor we shall possess no control over we own gift after it shall have pass from we hand it be true that the state legislature be require to stipulate that they will faithfully execute the trust in the manner prescribe by the bill but should they fail to do this what would be the consequence the federal government have no power and ought to have no power to compel the execution of the trust it would be in as helpless a condition as if even in this the time of great need we be to demand any portion of the many million of surplus revenue deposit with the state for safekeep under the act of 1836 5 this bill will injuriously interfere with exist college in the different state in many of which agriculture be teach as a science and in all of which it ought to be so teach these institution of learn have grow up with the growth of the country under the foster care of the state and the munificence of individual to meet the advance demand for education they have prove great blessing to the people many indeed most of they be poor and sustain themselves with difficulty what the effect will be on these institution of create a indefinite number of rival college sustain by the endowment of the federal government it be not difficult to determine under this bill it be provide that scientific and classical study shall not be exclude from they indeed it would be almost impossible to sustain they without such a provision for no father would incur the expense of send a son to one of these institution for the sole purpose of make he a scientific farmer or mechanic the bill itself negative this idea and declare that they object be to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial class in the several pursuit and profession of life this certainly ought to be the case in this view of the subject it would be far better if such a appropriation of land must be make to institution of learn in the several state to apply it directly to the establishment of professorship of agriculture and the mechanic art in exist college without the intervention of the state legislature it would be difficult to foresee how these legislature will manage this fund each representative in congress for whose district the proportion of 20000 acre have be grant will probably insist that the proceeds shall be expend within its limit there will undoubtedly be a struggle between different locality in each state concern the division of the gift which may end in disappointing the hope of the true friend of agriculture for this state of thing we be without remedy not so in regard to state college we might grant land to these corporation to establish agricultural and mechanical professorship and should they fail to comply with the condition on which they accept the grant we might enforce specific performance of these before the ordinary court of justice 6 but do congress possess the power under the constitution to make a donation of public land to the different state of the union to provide college for the purpose of educate they own people i presume the general proposition be undeniable that congress do not possess the power to appropriate money in the treasury raise by tax on the people of the united state for the purpose of educate the people of the respective state it will not be pretend that any such power be to be find among the specific power grant to congress nor that it be necessary and proper for carry into execution any one of these power should congress exercise such a power this would be to break down the barrier which have be so carefully construct in the constitution to separate federal from state authority we should then not only lay and collect tax duty impost and excise for federal purpose but for every state purpose which congress might deem expedient or useful this would be a actual consolidation of the federal and state government so far as the great taxing and money power be concerned and constitute a sort of partnership between the two in the treasury of the united state equally ruinous to both but it be contend that the public land be place upon a different footing from money raise by taxation and that the proceeds arise from they sale be not subject to the limitation of the constitution but may be appropriate or give away by congress at its own discretion to state corporation or individual for any purpose they may deem expedient the advocate of this bill attempt to sustain they position upon the language of the second clause of the third section of the fourth article of the constitution which declare that the congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rule and regulation respect the territory or other property belong to the united state they contend that by a fair interpretation of the word dispose of in this clause congress possess the power to make this gift of public land to the state for purpose of education it would require clear and strong evidence to induce the belief that the framer of the constitution after have limit the power of congress to certain precise and specific object intend by employ the word dispose of to give that body unlimited power over the vast public domain it would be a strange anomaly indeed to have create two fund -- the one by taxation confine to the execution of the enumerated power delegate to congress and the other from the public land applicable to all subject foreign and domestic which congress might designate that this fund should be dispose of not to pay the debt of the united state nor to raise and support army nor to provide and maintain a navy nor to accomplish any one of the other great object enumerate in the constitution but be divert from they to pay the debt of the state to educate they people and to carry into effect any other measure of they domestic policy this would be to confer upon congress a vast and irresponsible authority utterly at war with the well-known jealousy of federal power which prevail at the formation of the constitution the natural intendment would be that as the constitution confine congress to well-defined specific power the fund place at they command whether in land or money should be appropriate to the performance of the duty correspond with these power if not a government have be create with all its other power carefully limited but without any limitation in respect to the public land but i can not so read the word dispose of as to make they embrace the idea of give away the true meaning of word be always to be ascertain by the subject to which they be apply and the known general intent of the lawgiver congress be a trustee under the constitution for the people of the united state to dispose of they public land and i think i may venture to assert with confidence that no case can be find in which a trustee in the position of congress have be authorize to _ dispose of _ property by its owner where it have be hold that these word authorize such trustee to give away the fund intrust to he care no trustee when call upon to account for the disposition of the property place under he management before any judicial tribunal would venture to present such a plea in he defense the true meaning of these word be clearly state by chief justice taney in deliver the opinion of the court -lrb- 19 howard p 436 -rrb- he say in reference to this clause of the constitution : it begin its enumeration of power by that of dispose in other word make sale of the land or raise money from they which as we have already say be the main object of the cession -lrb- from the state -rrb- and which be the first thing provide for in the article it be unnecessary to refer to the history of the time to establish the known fact that this statement of the chief justice be perfectly well found that it never be intend by the framer of the constitution that these land should be give away by congress be manifest from the conclude portion of the same clause by it congress have power not only to dispose of the territory but of the other property of the united state in the language of the chief justice -lrb- p 437 -rrb- : and the same power of make needful rule respect the territory be in precisely the same language apply to the other property of the united state associate the power over the territory in this respect with the power over movable or personal property that be the ship arm or munitions of war which then belong in common to the state sovereignty the question be still clearer in regard to the public land in the state and territory within the louisiana and florida purchase these land be pay for out of the public treasury from money raise by taxation now if congress have no power to appropriate the money with which these land be purchase be it not clear that the power over the land be equally limit the mere conversion of this money into land could not confer upon congress new power over the disposition of land which they have not possess over money if it could then a trustee by change the character of the fund intrust to he care for special object from money into land might give the land away or devote it to any purpose he think proper however foreign from the trust the inference be irresistible that this land partake of the very same character with the money pay for it and can be devote to no object different from those to which the money could have be devote if this be not the case then by the purchase of a new territory from a foreign government out of the public treasury congress could enlarge they own power and appropriate the proceeds of the sale of the land thus purchase at they own discretion to other and far different object from what they could have apply the purchase money which have be raise by taxation it have be assert truly that congress in numerous instance have grant land for the purpose of education these grant have be chiefly if not exclusively make to the new state as they successively enter the union and consist at the first of one section and afterwards of two section of the public land in each township for the use of school as well as of additional section for a state university such grant be not in my opinion a violation of the constitution the united state be a great land proprietor and from the very nature of this relation it be both the right and the duty of congress as they trustee to manage these land as any other prudent proprietor would manage they for he own best advantage now no consideration could be present of a stronger character to induce the american people to brave the difficulty and hardship of frontier life and to settle upon these land and to purchase they at a fair price than to give to they and to they child a assurance of the means of education if any prudent individual have hold these land he could not have adopt a wiser course to bring they into market and enhance they value than to give a portion of they for purpose of education as a mere speculation he would pursue this course no person will contend that donation of land to all the state of the union for the erection of college within the limit of each can be embrace by this principle it can not be pretend that a agricultural college in new york or virginium would aid the settlement or facilitate the sale of public land in minnesota or californium this can not possibly be embrace within the authority which a prudent proprietor of land would exercise over he own possession i purposely avoid any attempt to define what portion of land may be grant and for what purpose to improve the value and promote the settlement and sale of the remainder without violate the constitution in this case i adopt the rule that sufficient unto the day be the evil thereof jame buchanan proclamation by the president of the united state of america a proclamation whereas a extraordinary occasion have occur render it necessary and proper that the senate of the united state shall be convene to receive and act upon such communication as have be or may be make to it on the

deep and heartfelt gratitude be due to that almighty power which have bestow upon we such varied and numerous blessing throughout the past year the general health of the country have be excellent we harvest have be unusually plentiful and prosperity smile throughout the land indeed notwithstanding we demerit we have much reason to believe from the past event in we history that we have enjoy the special protection of divine providence ever since we origin as a nation we have be expose to many threatening and alarming difficulty in we progress but on each successive occasion the impending cloud have be dissipate at the moment it appear ready to burst upon we head and the danger to we institution have pass away may we ever be under the divine guidance and protection whilst it be the duty of the president from time to time to give to congress information of the state of the union i shall not refer in detail to the recent sad and bloody occurrence at harper ferry still it be proper to observe that these event however bad and cruel in themselves derive they chief importance from the apprehension that they be but symptom of a incurable disease in the public mind which may break out in still more dangerous outrage and terminate at last in a open war by the north to abolish slavery in the south whilst for myself i entertain no such apprehension they ought to afford a solemn warning to we all to beware of the approach of danger we union be a stake of such inestimable value as to demand we constant and watchful vigilance for its preservation in this view let I implore my countryman north and south to cultivate the ancient feeling of mutual forbearance and good will toward each other and strive to allay the demon spirit of sectional hatred and strife now alive in the land this advice proceed from the heart of a old public functionary whose service commence in the last generation among the wise and conservative statesman of that day now nearly all pass away and whose first and dearest earthly wish be to leave he country tranquil prosperous unite and powerful we ought to reflect that in this age and especially in this country there be a incessant flux and reflux of public opinion question which in they day assume a most threatening aspect have now nearly go from the memory of man they be volcano burn out and on the lava and ash and squalid scorium of old eruption grow the peaceful olive the cheer vine and the sustain corn such in my opinion will prove to be the fate of the present sectional excitement should those who wisely seek to apply the remedy continue always to confine they effort within the pale of the constitution if this course be pursue the exist agitation on the subject of domestic slavery like everything human will have its day and give place to other and less threatening controversy public opinion in this country be all-powerful and when it reach a dangerous excess upon any question the good sense of the people will furnish the corrective and bring it back within safe limit still to hasten this auspicious result at the present crisis we ought to remember that every rational creature must be presume to intend the natural consequence of he own teaching those who announce abstract doctrine subversive of the constitution and the union must not be surprise should they heated partisan advance one step further and attempt by violence to carry these doctrine into practical effect in this view of the subject it ought never to be forget that however great may have be the political advantage result from the union to every portion of we common country these would all prove to be as nothing should the time ever arrive when they can not be enjoy without serious danger to the personal safety of the people of fifteen member of the confederacy if the peace of the domestic fireside throughout these state should ever be invade if the mother of family within this extensive region should not be able to retire to rest at night without suffer dreadful apprehension of what may be they own fate and that of they child before the morning it would be vain to recount to such a people the political benefit which result to they from the union self-preservation be the first instinct of nature and therefore any state of society in which the sword be all the time suspend over the head of the people must at last become intolerable but i indulge in no such gloomy foreboding on the contrary i firmly believe that the event at harper ferry by cause the people to pause and reflect upon the possible peril to they cherish institution will be the means under providence of allay the exist excitement and prevent further outbreak of a similar character they will resolve that the constitution and the union shall not be endanger by rash counsel know that should the silver cord be loose or the golden bowl be break at the fountain human power could never reunite the scatter and hostile fragment i cordially congratulate you upon the final settlement by the supreme court of the united state of the question of slavery in the territory which have present a aspect so truly formidable at the commencement of my administration the right have be establish of every citizen to take he property of any kind include slave into the common territory belong equally to all the state of the confederacy and to have it protect there under the federal constitution neither congress nor a territorial legislature nor any human power have any authority to annul or impair this vested right the supreme judicial tribunal of the country which be a coordinate branch of the government have sanction and affirm these principle of constitutional law so manifestly just in themselves and so well calculate to promote peace and harmony among the state it be a striking proof of the sense of justice which be inherent in we people that the property in slave have never be disturb to my knowledge in any of the territory even throughout the late trouble in kansas there have not be any attempt as i be credibly inform to interfere in a single instance with the right of the master have any such attempt be make the judiciary would doubtless have afford a adequate remedy should they fail to do this hereafter it will then be time enough to strengthen they hand by further legislation have it be decide that either congress or the territorial legislature possess the power to annul or impair the right to property in slave the evil would be intolerable in the latter event there would be a struggle for a majority of the member of the legislature at each successive election and the sacred rights of property hold under the federal constitution would depend for the time be on the result the agitation would thus be render incessant whilst the territorial condition remain and its baneful influence would keep alive a dangerous excitement among the people of the several state thus have the status of a territory during the intermediate period from its first settlement until it shall become a state be irrevocably fix by the final decision of the supreme court fortunate have this be for the prosperity of the territory as well as the tranquillity of the state now emigrant from the north and the south the east and the west will meet in the territory on a common platform have bring with they that species of property best adapt in they own opinion to promote they welfare from natural cause the slavery question will in each case soon virtually settle itself and before the territory be prepare for admission as a state into the union this decision one way or the other will have be a foregone conclusion meanwhile the settlement of the new territory will proceed without serious interruption and its progress and prosperity will not be endanger or retard by violent political struggle when in the progress of event the inhabitant of any territory shall have reach the number require to form a state they will then proceed in a regular manner and in the exercise of the rights of popular sovereignty to form a constitution preparatory to admission into the union after this have be do to employ the language of the kansa and nebraska act they shall be receive into the union with or without slavery as they constitution may prescribe at the time of they admission this sound principle have happily be recognize in some form or other by a almost unanimous vote of both house of the last congress all lawful means at my command have be employ and shall continue to be employ to execute the law against the african slave trade after a most careful and rigorous examination of we coast and a thorough investigation of the subject we have not be able to discover that any slave have be import into the united state except the cargo by the _ wanderer _ numbering between three and four hundred those engage in this unlawful enterprise have be rigorously prosecute but not with as much success as they crime have deserve a number of they be still under prosecution we history prove that the father of the republic in advance of all other nation condemn the african slave trade it be notwithstanding deem expedient by the framer of the constitution to deprive congress of the power to prohibit the migration or importation of such person as any of the state now exist shall think proper to admit prior to the year 1808 it will be see that this restriction on the power of congress be confine to such state only as might think proper to admit the importation of slave it do not extend to other state or to the trade carry on abroad accordingly we find that so early as the 22d march 1794 congress pass a act impose severe penalty and punishment upon citizen and resident of the united state who should engage in this trade between foreign nation the provision of this act be extend and enforce by the act of 10th may 1800 again the state themselves have a clear right to waive the constitutional privilege intend for they benefit and to prohibit by they own law this trade at any time they think proper previous to 1808 several of they exercise this right before that period and among they some contain the greatest number of slave this give to congress the immediate power to act in regard to all such state because they themselves have remove the constitutional barrier congress accordingly pass a act on 28th February 1803 to prevent the importation of certain person into certain state where by the law thereof they admission be prohibit in this manner the importation of african slave into the united state be to a great extent prohibit some year in advance of 1808 as the year 1808 approach congress determine not to suffer this trade to exist even for a single day after they have the power to abolish it on the 2d of march 1807 they pass a act to take effect from and after the 1st day of January 1808 prohibit the importation of african slave into the united state this be follow by subsequent act of a similar character to which i need not specially refer such be the principle and such the practice of we ancestor more than fifty year ago in regard to the african slave trade it do not occur to the revered patriot who have be delegate to the convention and afterwards become member of congress that in pass these law they have violate the constitution which they have frame with so much care and deliberation they suppose that to prohibit congress in express term from exercise a specify power before a appoint day necessarily involve the right to exercise this power after that day have arrive if this be not the case the framer of the constitution have expend much labor in vain have they imagine that congress would possess no power to prohibit the trade either before or after 1808 they would not have take so much care to protect the state against the exercise of this power before that period nay more they would not have attach such vast importance to this provision as to have exclude it from the possibility of future repeal or amendment to which other portion of the constitution be expose it would then have be wholly unnecessary to ingraft on the fifth article of the constitution prescribe the mode of its own future amendment the proviso that no amendment which may be make prior to the year 1808 shall in any manner affect the provision in the constitution secure to the state the right to admit the importation of african slave previous to that period accord to the adverse construction the clause itself on which so much care and discussion have be employ by the member of the convention be a absolute nullity from the beginning and all that have since be do under it a mere usurpation it be well and wise to confer this power on congress because have it be leave to the state its efficient exercise would have be impossible in that event any one state could have effectually continue the trade not only for itself but for all the other slave state though never so much against they will and why because african slave when once bring within the limit of any one state in accordance with its law can not practically be exclude from any state where slavery exist and even if all the state have separately pass law prohibit the importation of slave these law would have fail of effect for want of a naval force to capture the slaver and to guard the coast such a force no state can employ in time of peace without the consent of congress these act of congress it be believe have with very rare and insignificant exception accomplish they purpose for a period of more than half a century there have be no perceptible addition to the number of we domestic slave during this period they advancement in civilization have far surpass that of any other portion of the african race the light and the blessing of christianity have be extend to they and both they moral and physical condition have be greatly improve reopen the trade and it would be difficult to determine whether the effect would be more deleterious on the interest of the master or on those of the native-born slave of the evil to the master the one most to be dread would be the introduction of wild heathen and ignorant barbarian among the sober orderly and quiet slave whose ancestor have be on the soil for several generation this might tend to barbarize demoralize and exasperate the whole mass and produce most deplorable consequence the effect upon the exist slave would if possible be still more deplorable at present he be treat with kindness and humanity he be well feed well clothed and not overworked he condition be incomparably better than that of the coolie which modern nation of high civilization have employ as a substitute for african slave both the philanthropy and the self-interest of the master have combine to produce this humane result but let this trade be reopen and what will be the effect the same to a considerable extent as on a neighboring island the only spot now on earth where the african slave trade be openly tolerate and this in defiance of solemn treaty with a power abundantly able at any moment to enforce they execution there the master intent upon present gain extort from the slave as much labor as he physical power be capable of endure know that when death come to he relief he place can be supply at a price reduce to the lowest point by the competition of rival african slave trader should this ever be the case in we country which i do not deem possible the present useful character of the domestic institution wherein those too old and too young to work be provide for with care and humanity and those capable of labor be not overtask would undergo a unfortunate change the feeling of reciprocal dependence and attachment which now exist between master and slave would be convert into mutual distrust and hostility but we be oblige as a christian and moral nation to consider what would be the effect upon unhappy africa itself if we should reopen the slave trade this would give the trade a impulse and extension which it have never have even in its palmiest day the numerous victim require to supply it would convert the whole slave coast into a perfect pandemonium for which this country would be hold responsible in the eye both of god and man its petty tribe would then be constantly engage in predatory war against each other for the purpose of seize slave to supply the american market all hope of african civilization would thus be end on the other hand when a market for african slave shall no longer be furnish in cuba and thus all the world be close against this trade we may then indulge a reasonable hope for the gradual improvement of africa the chief motive of war among the tribe will cease whenever there be no longer any demand for slave the resource of that fertile but miserable country might then be develop by the hand of industry and afford subject for legitimate foreign and domestic commerce in this manner christianity and civilization may gradually penetrate the exist gloom the wisdom of the course pursue by this government toward china have be vindicate by the event whilst we sustain a neutral position in the war wage by great britain and france against the chinese empire we late minister in obedience to he instruction judiciously cooperate with the minister of these power in all peaceful measure to secure by treaty the just concession demand by the interest of foreign commerce the result be that satisfactory treaty have be conclude with china by the respective minister of the united state great britain france and russium we treaty or general convention of peace amity and commerce with that empire be conclude at tien-tsin on the 18th June 1858 and be ratify by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate on the 21st December follow on the 15th December 1858 john e ward a distinguished citizen of georgium be duly commission as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to china he leave the united state for the place of he destination on the 5th of February 1859 bearing with he the ratify copy of this treaty and arrive at shanghaus on the 28th may from thence he proceed to peke on the 16th June but do not arrive in that city until the 27th July accord to the term of the treaty the ratification be to be exchange on or before the 18th June 1859 this be render impossible by reason and event beyond he control not necessary to detail but still it be due to the chinese authority at shanghaus to state that they always assure he no advantage should be take of the delay and this pledge have be faithfully redeem on the arrival of mr ward at peke he request a audience of the emperor to present he letter of credence this he do not obtain in consequence of he very proper refusal to submit to the humiliating ceremony require by the etiquette of this strange people in approach they sovereign nevertheless the interview on this question be conduct in the most friendly spirit and with all due regard to he personal feeling and the honor of he country when a presentation to he majesty be find to be impossible the letter of credence from the president be receive with peculiar honor by kweiliang the emperor 's prime minister and the second man in the empire to the emperor himself the ratification of the treaty be afterwards on the 16th of August exchange in proper form at pei-tsang as the exchange do not take place until after the day prescribe by the treaty it be deem proper before its publication again to submit it to the senate it be but simple justice to the chinese authority to observe that throughout the whole transaction they appear to have act in good faith and in a friendly spirit toward the united state it be true this have be do after they own peculiar fashion but we ought to regard with a lenient eye the ancient custom of a empire date back for thousand of year so far as this may be consistent with we own national honor the conduct of we minister on the occasion have receive my entire approbation in order to carry out the spirit of this treaty and to give it full effect it become necessary to conclude two supplemental convention the one for the adjustment and satisfaction of the claim of we citizen and the other to fix the tariff on import and export and to regulate the transit duty and trade of we merchant with china this duty be satisfactorily perform by we late minister these convention bear date at shanghaus on the 8th November 1858 have be consider in the light of binding agreement subsidiary to the principal treaty and to be carry into execution without delay they do not provide for any formal ratification or exchange of ratification by the contracting party this be not deem necessary by the chinese who be already proceed in good faith to satisfy the claim of we citizen and it be hope to carry out the other provision of the convention still i think it be proper to submit they to the senate by which they be ratify on the 3d of march 1859 the ratify copy however do not reach shanghaus until after the departure of we minister to peking and these convention could not therefore be exchange at the same time with the principal treaty no doubt be entertain that they will be ratify and exchange by the chinese government should this be think advisable but under the circumstance present i shall consider they bind engagement from they date on both party and cause they to be publish as such for the information and guidance of we merchant trade with the chinese empire it afford I much satisfaction to inform you that all we difficulty with the republic of paraguay have be satisfactorily adjust it happily do not become necessary to employ the force for this purpose which congress have place at my command under the joint resolution of 2d June 1858 on the contrary the president of that republic in a friendly spirit accede promptly to the just and reasonable demand of the government of the united state we commissioner arrive at assumption the capital of the republic on the 25th of January 1859 and leave it on the 17th of February have in three week ably and successfully accomplish all the object of he mission the treaty which he have conclude will be immediately submit to the senate in the view that the employment of other than peaceful means might become necessary to obtain just satisfaction from paraguay a strong naval force be concentrate in the water of the la plata to await contingency whilst we commissioner ascend the river to assumption the navy department be entitle to great credit for the promptness efficiency and economy with which this expedition be fit out and conduct it consist of 19 armed vessel great and small carry 200 gun and 2500 man all under the command of the veteran and gallant shubrick the entire expense of the expedition have be defray out of the ordinary appropriation for the naval service except the sum of $ 289000 apply to the purchase of seven of the steamer constitute a part of it under the authority of the naval appropriation act of the 3d march last it be believe that these steamer be worth more than they cost and they be all now usefully and actively employ in the naval service the appearance of so large a force fit out in such a prompt manner in the far-distant water of the la plata and the admirable conduct of the officer and man employ in it have have a happy effect in favor of we country throughout all that remote portion of the world we relation with the great empire of france and russium as well as with all other government on the continent of europe unless we may except that of spain happily continue to be of the most friendly character in my last annual message i present a statement of the unsatisfactory condition of we relation with spain and i regret to say that this have not materially improve without special reference to other claim even the cuban claim the payment of which have be ably urge by we minister and in which more than a hundred of we citizen be directly interested remain unsatisfied notwithstanding both they justice and they amount -lrb- $ 12863554 -rrb- have be recognize and ascertain by the spanish government itself i again recommend that a appropriation be make to be pay to the spanish government for the purpose of distribution among the claimant in the _ amistad _ case in common with two of my predecessor i entertain no doubt that this be require by we treaty with spain of the 27th October 1795 the failure to discharge this obligation have be employ by the cabinet of madrid as a reason against the settlement of we claim i need not repeat the argument which i urge in my last annual message in favor of the acquisition of cuba by fair purchase my opinion on that measure remain unchanged i therefore again invite the serious attention of congress to this important subject without a recognition of this policy on they part it will be almost impossible to institute negotiation with any reasonable prospect of success until a recent period there be good reason to believe that i should be able to announce to you on the present occasion that we difficulty with great britain arise out of the clayton and bulwer treaty have be finally adjust in a manner alike honorable and satisfactory to both party from cause however which the british government have not anticipate they have not yet complete treaty arrangement with the republic of hondura and nicaragua in pursuance of the understanding between the two government it be nevertheless confidently expect that this good work will ere long be accomplish whilst indulge the hope that no other subject remain which could disturb the good understanding between the two country the question arise out of the adverse claim of the party to the island of san juan under the oregon treaty of the 15th June 1846 suddenly assume a threatening prominence in order to prevent unfortunate collision on that remote frontier the late secretary of state on the 17th July 1855 address a note to mr crampton then british minister at washington communicate to he a copy of the instruction which he -lrb- mr marcy -rrb- have give on the 14th July to governor steven of washington territory have a special reference to a apprehend conflict between we citizen and the british subject on the island of san juan to prevent this the governor be instruct that the officer of the territory should abstain from all act on the dispute grounds which be calculate to provoke any conflict so far as it can be do without imply the concession to the authority of great britain of a exclusive right over the premise the title ought to be settle before either party should attempt to exclude the other by force or exercise complete and exclusive sovereign rights within the fairly dispute limit in acknowledge the receipt on the next day of mr marcy 's note the british minister express he entire concurrence in the propriety of the course recommend to the governor of washington territory by you -lrb- mr marcy 's -rrb- instruction to that officer and state that he have lose no time in transmit a copy of that document to the governor-general of british north america and have earnestly recommend to he excellency to take such measure as to he may appear best calculate to secure on the part of the british local authority and the inhabitant of the neighborhood of the line in question the exercise of the same spirit of forbearance which be inculcate by you -lrb- mr marcy -rrb- on the authority and citizen of the united state thus matter remain upon the faith of this arrangement until the 9th July last when general harney pay a visit to the island he find upon it twenty-five american resident with they family and also a establishment of the hudson bay company for the purpose of raise sheep a short time before he arrival one of these resident have shoot a animal belong to the company whilst trespassing upon he premise for which however he offer to pay twice its value but that be refuse soon after the chief factor of the company at victorium mr dalle son-in-law of governor dougla come to the island in the british sloop of war _ satellite _ and threaten to take this american -lrb- mr cutler -rrb- by force to victorium to answer for the trespass he have commit the american seize he rifle and tell mr dalle if any such attempt be make he would kill he upon the spot the affair then end under these circumstance the american settler present a petition to the general through the united state inspector of custom mr hubb to place a force upon the island to protect they from the indian as well as the oppressive interference of the authority of the hudson bay company at victorium with they rights as american citizen the general immediately respond to this petition and order captain george e pickett ninth infantry to establish he company on bellevue or san juan island on some suitable position near the harbor at the southeastern extremity this order be promptly obey and a military post be establish at the place designate the force be afterwards increase so that by the last return the whole number of troops then on the island amount in the aggregate to 691 man whilst i do not deem it proper on the present occasion to go further into the subject and discuss the weight which ought to be attach to the statement of the british colonial authority contest the accuracy of the information on which the gallant general act it be due to he that i should thus present he own reason for issue the order to captain pickett from these it be quite clear he object be to prevent the british authority on vancouver island from exercise jurisdiction over american resident on the island of san juan as well as to protect they against the incursion of the indian much excitement prevail for some time throughout that region and serious danger of collision between the party be apprehend the british have a large naval force in the vicinity and it be but a act of simple justice to the admiral on that station to state that he wisely and discreetly forbore to commit any hostile act but determine to refer the whole affair to he government and await they instruction this aspect of the matter in my opinion demand serious attention it would have be a great calamity for both nation have they be precipitate into act of hostility not on the question of title to the island but merely concern what should be its condition during the intervene period whilst the two government might be employ in settle the question to which of they it belong for this reason lieutenant-general scott be dispatch on the 17th of September last to washington territory to take immediate command of the united state force on the pacific coast should he deem this necessary the main object of he mission be to carry out the spirit of the precautionary arrangement between the late secretary of state and the british minister and thus to preserve the peace and prevent collision between the british and american authority pend the negotiation between the two government entertaining no doubt of the validity of we title i need scarcely add that in any event american citizen be to be place on a footing at least as favorable as that of british subject it be understand that captain pickett 's company should remain on the island it be proper to observe that consider the distance from the scene of action and in ignorance of what might have transpire on the spot before the general 's arrival it be necessary to leave much to he discretion and i be happy to state the event have prove that this discretion could not have be intrust to more competent hand general scott have recently return from he mission have successfully accomplish its object and there be no longer any good reason to apprehend a collision between the force of the two country during the pendency of the exist negotiation i regret to inform you that there have be no improvement in the affair of mexico since my last annual message and i be again oblige to ask the earnest attention of congress to the unhappy condition of that republic the constituent congress of mexico which adjourn on the 17th February 1857 adopt a constitution and provide for a popular election this take place in the follow July -lrb- 1857 -rrb- and general comonfort be choose president almost without opposition at the same election a new congress be choose whose first session commence on the 16th of September -lrb- 1857 -rrb- by the constitution of 1857 the presidential term be to begin on the 1st of December -lrb- 1857 -rrb- and continue for four year on that day general comonfort appear before the assemble congress in the city of mexico take the oath to support the new constitution and be duly inaugurate as president within a month afterwards he have be drive from the capital and a military rebellion have assign the supreme power of the republic to general zuloaga the constitution provide that in the absence of the president he office should devolve upon the chief justice of the supreme court and general comonfort have leave the country this functionary general juarez proceed to form at guanajuato a constitutional government before this be officially know however at the capital the government of zuloaga have be recognize by the entire diplomatic corps include the minister of the united state as the _ de facto _ government of mexico the constitutional president nevertheless maintain he position with firmness and be soon establish with he cabinet at vera cruz meanwhile the government of zuloaga be earnestly resist in many part of the republic and even in the capital a portion of the army have pronounce against it its function be declare terminate and a assembly of citizen be invite for the choice of a new president this assembly elect general miramon but that officer repudiate the plan under which he be choose and zuloaga be thus restore to he previous position he assume it however only to withdraw from it and miramon have become by he appointment president substitute continue with that title at the head of the insurgent party in my last annual message i communicate to congress the circumstance under which the late minister of the united state suspend he official relation with the central government and withdraw from the country it be impossible to maintain friendly intercourse with a government like that at the capital under whose usurped authority wrong be constantly commit but never redress have this be a established government with its power extend by the consent of the people over the whole of mexico a resort to hostility against it would have be quite justifiable and indeed necessary but the country be a prey to civil war and it be hope that the success of the constitutional president might lead to a condition of thing less injurious to the united state this success become so probable that in January last i employ a reliable agent to visit mexico and report to I the actual condition and prospects of the contend party in consequence of he report and from information which reach I from other source favorable to the prospects of the constitutional cause i feel justified in appoint a new minister to mexico who might embrace the earliest suitable opportunity of restore we diplomatic relation with that republic for this purpose a distinguished citizen of maryland be select who proceed on he mission on the 8th of march last with discretionary authority to recognize the government of president juarez if on he arrival in mexico he should find it entitle to such recognition accord to the established practice of the united state on the 7th of April follow mr mclane present he credentials to president juarez have no hesitation in pronounce the government of juarez to be the only exist government of the republic he be cordially receive by the authority at vera cruz and they have ever since manifest the most friendly disposition toward the united state unhappily however the constitutional government have not be able to establish its power over the whole republic it be support by a large majority of the people and the state but there be important part of the country where it can enforce no obedience general miramon maintain himself at the capital and in some of the distant province there be military governor who pay little respect to the decree of either government in the meantime the excess which always attend upon civil war especially in mexico be constantly recur outrage of the worst description be commit both upon person and property there be scarcely any form of injury which have not be suffer by we citizen in mexico during the last few year we have be nominally at peace with that republic but so far as the interest of we commerce or of we citizen who have visit the country as merchant shipmaster or in other capacity be concern we might as well have be at war life have be insecure property unprotected and trade impossible except at a risk of loss which prudent man can not be expect to incur important contract involve large expenditure enter into by the central government have be set at defiance by the local government peaceful american resident occupy they rightful possession have be suddenly expel the country in defiance of treaty and by the mere force of arbitrary power even the course of justice have not be safe from control and a recent decree of miramon permit the intervention of government in all suit where either party be a foreigner vessel of the united state have be seize without law and a consular officer who protest against such seizure have be fine and imprison for disrespect to the authority military contribution have be levy in violation of every principle of right and the american who resist the lawless demand have have he property forcibly take away and have be himself banish from a conflict of authority in different part of the country tariff duty which have be pay in one place have be exact over again in another place large number of we citizen have be arrest and imprison without any form of examination or any opportunity for a hearing and even when release have only obtain they liberty after much suffering and injury and without any hope of redress the wholesale massacre of crabbe and he associate without trial in sonora as well as the seizure and murder of four sick american who have take shelter in the house of a american upon the soil of the united state be communicate to congress at its last session murder of a still more atrocious character have be commit in the very heart of mexico under the authority of miramon 's government during the present year some of these be only worthy of a barbarous age and if they have not be clearly prove would have seem impossible in a country which claim to be civilized of this description be the brutal massacre in April last by order of general marquez of three american physician who be seize in the hospital at tacubaya while attend upon the sick and the die of both party and without trial as without crime be hurry away to speedy execution little less shocking be the recent fate of ormond chase who be shoot in tepic on the 7th of August by order of the same mexican general not only without a trial but without any conjecture by he friend of the cause of he arrest he be represent as a young man of good character and intelligence who have make numerous friend in tepic by the courage and humanity which he have display on several try occasion and he death be as unexpected as it be shocking to the whole community other outrage might be enumerate but these be sufficient to illustrate the wretched state of the country and the unprotected condition of the person and property of we citizen in mexico in all these case we minister have be constant and faithful in they demand for redress but both they and this government which they have successively represent have be wholly powerless to make they demand effective they testimony in this respect and in reference to the only remedy which in they judgment would meet the exigency have be both uniform and emphatic nothing but a manifestation of the power of the government of the united state write we late minister in 1856 and of its purpose to punish these wrong will avail i assure you that the universal belief here be that there be nothing to be apprehend from the government of the united state and that local mexican official can commit these outrage upon american citizen with absolute impunity i hope the president write we present minister in August last will feel authorize to ask from congress the power to enter mexico with the military force of the united state at the call of the constitutional authority in order to protect the citizen and the treaty rights of the united state unless such a power be confer upon he neither the one nor the other will be respect in the exist state of anarchy and disorder and the outrage already perpetrate will never be chastise and as i assure you in my no 23 all these evil must increase until every vestige of order and government disappear from the country i have be reluctantly lead to the same opinion and in justice to my countryman who have suffer wrong from mexico and who may still suffer they i feel bind to announce this conclusion to congress the case present however be not merely a case of individual claim although we just claim against mexico have reach a very large amount nor be it merely the case of protection to the life and property of the few american who may still remain in mexico although the life and property of every american citizen ought to be sacredly protect in every quarter of the world but it be a question which relate to the future as well as to the present and the past and which involve indirectly at least the whole subject of we duty to mexico as a neighboring state the exercise of the power of the united state in that country to redress the wrong and protect the rights of we own citizen be none the less to be desire because efficient and necessary aid may thus be render at the same time to restore peace and order to mexico itself in the accomplishment of this result the people of the united state must necessarily feel a deep and earnest interest mexico ought to be a rich and prosperous and powerful republic she possess a extensive territory a fertile soil and a incalculable store of mineral wealth she occupy a important position between the gulf and the ocean for transit route and for commerce be it possible that such a country as this can be give up to anarchy and ruin without a effort from any quarter for its rescue and its safety will the commercial nation of the world which have so many interest connect with it remain wholly indifferent to such a result can the united state especially which ought to share most largely in its commercial intercourse allow they immediate neighbor thus to destroy itself and injure they yet without support from some quarter it be impossible to perceive how mexico can resume she position among nation and enter upon a career which promise any good result the aid which she require and which the interest of all commercial country require that she should have it belong to this government to render not only by virtue of we neighborhood to mexico along whose territory we have a continuous frontier of nearly a thousand mile but by virtue also of we established policy which be inconsistent with the intervention of any european power in the domestic concern of that republic the wrong which we have suffer from mexico be before the world and must deeply impress every american citizen a government which be either unable or unwilling to redress such wrong be derelict to its highest duty the difficulty consist in select and enforce the remedy we may in vain apply to the constitutional government at vera cruz although it be well disposed to do we justice for adequate redress whilst its authority be acknowledge in all the important port and throughout the seacoast of the republic its power do not extend to the city of mexico and the state in its vicinity where nearly all the recent outrage have be commit on american citizen we must penetrate into the interior before we can reach the offender and this can only be do by pass through the territory in the occupation of the constitutional government the most acceptable and least difficult mode of accomplish the object will be to act in concert with that government they consent and they aid might i believe be obtain but if not we obligation to protect we own citizen in they just rights secure by treaty would not be the less imperative for these reason i recommend to congress to pass a law authorize the president under such condition as they may deem expedient to employ a sufficient military force to enter mexico for the purpose of obtain indemnity for the past and security for the future i purposely refrain from any suggestion as to whether this force shall consist of regular troops or volunteer or both this question may be most appropriately leave to the decision of congress i would merely observe that should volunteer be select such a force could be easily raise in this country among those who sympathize with the suffering of we unfortunate fellow-citizen in mexico and with the unhappy condition of that republic such a accession to the force of the constitutional government would enable it soon to reach the city of mexico and extend its power over the whole republic in that event there be no reason to doubt that the just claim of we citizen would be satisfied and adequate redress obtain for the injury inflict upon they the constitutional government have ever evince a strong desire to do justice and this might be secure in advance by a preliminary treaty it may be say that these measure will at least indirectly be inconsistent with we wise and settle policy not to interfere in the domestic concern of foreign nation but do not the present case fairly constitute a exception a adjoining republic be in a state of anarchy and confusion from which she have prove wholly unable to extricate herself she be entirely destitute of the power to maintain peace upon she border or to prevent the incursion of bandit into we territory in she fate and in she fortune in she power to establish and maintain a settled government we have a far deeper interest socially commercially and politically than any other nation she be now a wreck upon the ocean drift about as she be impel by different faction as a good neighbor shall we not extend to she a help hand to save she if we do not it would not be surprising should some other nation undertake the task and thus force we to interfere at last under circumstance of increase difficulty for the maintenance of we established policy i repeat the recommendation contain in my last annual message that authority may be give to the president to establish one or more temporary military post across the mexican line in sonora and chihuahua where these may be necessary to protect the life and property of american and mexican citizen against the incursion and depredation of the indian as well as of lawless rover on that remote region the establishment of one such post at a point call arispe in sonora in a country now almost depopulate by the hostile inroad of the indian from we side of the line would it be believe have prevent much injury and many cruelty during the past season a state of lawlessness and violence prevail on that distant frontier life and property be there wholly insecure the population of arizona now numbering more than 10000 soul be practically destitute of government of law or of any regular administration of justice murder rapine and other crime be commit with impunity i therefore again call the attention of congress to the necessity for establish a territorial government over arizona the treaty with nicaragua of the 16th of February 1857 to which i refer in my last annual message fail to receive the ratification of the government of that republic for reason which i need not enumerate a similar treaty have be since conclude between the party bear date on the 16th march 1859 which have already be ratify by the nicaraguan congress this will be immediately submit to the senate for they ratification its provision can not i think fail to be acceptable to the people of both country we claim against the government of costa rica and nicaragua remain unredressed though they be press in a earnest manner and not without hope of success i deem it to be my duty once more earnestly to recommend to congress the passage of a law authorize the president to employ the naval force at he command for the purpose of protect the life and property of american citizen pass in transit across the panama nicaragua and tehuantepec route against sudden and lawless outbreak and depredation i shall not repeat the argument employ in former message in support of this measure suffice it to say that the life of many of we people and the security of vast amount of treasure passing and repassing over one or more of these route between the atlantic and pacific may be deeply involve in the action of congress on this subject i would also again recommend to congress that authority be give to the president to employ the naval force to protect american merchant vessel they crew and cargo against violent and lawless seizure and confiscation in the port of mexico and the spanish american state when these country may be in a disturbed and revolutionary condition the mere knowledge that such a authority have be confer as i have already state would of itself in a great degree prevent the evil neither would this require any additional appropriation for the naval service the chief objection urge against the grant of this authority be that congress by confer it would violate the constitution that it would be a transfer of the war-making or strictly speak the war-declaring power to the executive if this be well found it would of course be conclusive a very brief examination however will place this objection at rest congress possess the sole and exclusive power under the constitution to declare war they alone can raise and support army and provide and maintain a navy but after congress shall have declare war and provide the force necessary to carry it on the president as commander in chief of the army and navy can alone employ this force in make war against the enemy this be the plain language and history prove that it be the well-known intention of the framer of the constitution it will not be deny that the general power to declare war be without limitation and embrace within itself not only what writer on the law of nation term a public or perfect war but also a imperfect war and in short every species of hostility however confine or limit without the authority of congress the president can not fire a hostile gun in any case except to repel the attack of a enemy it will not be doubt that under this power congress could if they think proper authorize the president to employ the force at he command to seize a vessel belong to a american citizen which have be illegally and unjustly capture in a foreign port and restore it to its owner but can congress only act after the fact after the mischief have be do have they no power to confer upon the president the authority in advance to furnish instant redress should such a case afterwards occur must they wait until the mischief have be do and can they apply the remedy only when it be too late to confer this authority to meet future case under circumstance strictly specify be as clearly within the war-declaring power as such a authority confer upon the president by act of congress after the deed have be do in the progress of a great nation many exigency must arise imperatively require that congress should authorize the president to act promptly on certain condition which may or may not afterwards arise we history have already present a number of such case i shall refer only to the latest under the resolution of June 2 1858 for the adjustment of difficulty with the republic of paraguay the president be authorize to adopt such measure and use such force as in he judgment may be necessary and advisable in the event of a refusal of just satisfaction by the government of paraguay just satisfaction for what for the attack on the united state steamer _ water witch _ and other matter refer to in the annual message of the president here the power be expressly grant upon the condition that the government of paraguay shall refuse to render this just satisfaction in this and other similar case congress have confer upon the president power in advance to employ the army and navy upon the happen of contingent future event and this most certainly be embrace within the power to declare war now if this conditional and contingent power could be constitutionally confer upon the president in the case of paraguay why may it not be confer for the purpose of protect the life and property of american citizen in the event that they may be violently and unlawfully attack in pass over the transit route to and from californium or assail by the seizure of they vessel in a foreign port to deny this power be to render the navy in a great degree useless for the protection of the life and property of american citizen in country where neither protection nor redress can be otherwise obtain the thirty-fifth congress terminate on the 3d of march 1859 without have pass the act make appropriation for the service of the post-office department during the fiscal year end the 30th of June 1860 this act also contain a appropriation to supply deficiency in the revenue of the post-office department for the year end 30th June 1859 i believe this be the first instance since the origin of the federal government now more than seventy year ago when any congress go out of existence without have pass all the general appropriation bill necessary to carry on the government until the regular period for the meeting of a new congress this event impose on the executive a grave responsibility it present a choice of evil have this omission of duty occur at the first session of the last congress the remedy would have be plain i might then have instantly recall they to complete they work and this without expense to the government but on the 4th of march last there be fifteen of the thirty-three state which have not elect any representative to the present congress have congress be call together immediately these state would have be virtually disfranchise if a intermediate period have be select several of the state would have be compel to hold extra session of they legislature at great inconvenience and expense to provide for election at a earlier day than that previously fix by law in the regular course ten of these state would not elect until after the beginning of August and five of these ten not until October and November on the other hand when i come to examine carefully the condition of the post-office department i do not meet as many or as great difficulty as i have apprehend have the bill which fail be confine to appropriation for the fiscal year end on the 30th June next there would have be no reason of press importance for the call of a extra session nothing would become due on contract -lrb- those with railroad company only except -rrb- for carry the mail for the first quarter of the present fiscal year commence on the 1st of July until the 1st of December -- less than one week before the meeting of the present congress the reason be that the mail contractor for this and the current year do not complete they first quarter 's service until the 30th September last and by the term of they contract sixty day more be allow for the settlement of they account before the department could be call upon for payment the great difficulty and the great hardship consist in the failure to provide for the payment of the deficiency in the fiscal year end the 30th June 1859 the department have enter into contract in obedience to exist law for the service of that fiscal year and the contractor be fairly entitle to they compensation as it become due the deficiency as state in the bill amount to $ 3838728 but after a careful settlement of all these account it have be ascertain that it amount to $ 4296009 with the scanty means at he command the postmaster-general have manage to pay that portion of this deficiency which occur in the first two quarter of the past fiscal year end on the 31st December last in the meantime the contractor themselves under these try circumstance have behave in a manner worthy of all commendation they have one resource in the midst of they embarrassment after the amount due to each of they have be ascertain and finally settle accord to law this become a specific debt of record against the united state which enable they to borrow money on this unquestionable security still they be oblige to pay interest in consequence of the default of congress and on every principle of justice ought to receive interest from the government this interest should commence from the date when a warrant would have issue for the payment of the principal have a appropriation be make for this purpose calculate up to the 1st December it will not exceed $ 96660 -- a sum not to be take into account when contrast with the great difficulty and embarrassment of a public and private character both to the people and the state which would have result from convene and hold a special session of congress for these reason i recommend the passage of a bill at as early a day as may be practicable to provide for the payment of the amount with interest due to these last-mentioned contractor as well as to make the necessary appropriation for the service of the post-office department for the current fiscal year the failure to pass the post-office bill necessarily give birth to serious reflection congress by refuse to pass the general appropriation bill necessary to carry on the government may not only arrest its action but might even destroy its existence the army the navy the judiciary in short every department of the government can no longer perform they function if congress refuse the money necessary for they support if this failure should teach the country the necessity of elect a full congress in sufficient time to enable the president to convene they in any emergency even immediately after the old congress have expire it will have be productive of great good in a time of sudden and alarming danger foreign or domestic which all nation must expect to encounter in they progress the very salvation of we institution may be stake upon the assemble of congress without delay if under such circumstance the president should find himself in the condition in which he be place at the close of the last congress with nearly half the state of the union destitute of representative the consequence might be disastrous i therefore recommend to congress to carry into effect the provision of the constitution on this subject and to pass a law appoint some day previous to the 4th march in each year of odd number for the election of representative throughout all the state they have already appoint a day for the election of elector for president and vice-president and this measure have be approve by the country i would again express a most decide opinion in favor of the construction of a pacific railroad for the reason state in my two last annual message when i reflect upon what would be the defenseless condition of we state and territory west of the rocky mountain in case of a war with a naval power sufficiently strong to interrupt all intercourse with they by the route across the isthmus i be still more convinced than ever of the vast importance of this railroad i have never doubt the constitutional competency of congress to provide for its construction but this exclusively under the war-making power besides the constitution expressly require as a imperative duty that the united state shall protect each of they -lrb- the state -rrb- against invasion i be at a loss to conceive how this protection can be afford to californium and oregon against such a naval power by any other means i repeat the opinion contain in my last annual message that it would be inexpedient for the government to undertake this great work by agent of its own appointment and under its direct and exclusive control this would increase the patronage of the executive to a dangerous extent and would foster a system of jobbing and corruption which no vigilance on the part of federal official could prevent the construction of this road ought therefore to be intrust to incorporated company or other agency who would exercise that active and vigilant supervision over it which can be inspire alone by a sense of corporate and individual interest i venture to assert that the additional cost of transporting troops munitions of war and necessary supplies for the army across the vast intervene plain to we possession on the pacific coast would be greater in such a war than the whole amount require to construct the road and yet this resort would after all be inadequate for they defense and protection we have yet scarcely recover from the habit of extravagant expenditure produce by we overflow treasury during several year prior to the commencement of my administration the financial reverse which we have since experienced ought to teach we all to scrutinize we expenditure with the greatest vigilance and to reduce they to the lowest possible point the executive department of the government have devote themselves to the accomplishment of this object with considerable success as will appear from they different report and estimate to these i invite the scrutiny of congress for the purpose of reduce they still lower if this be practicable consistent with the great public interest of the country in aid of the policy of retrenchment i pledge myself to examine closely the bill appropriate land or money so that if any of these should inadvertently pass both house as must sometimes be the case i may afford they a opportunity for reconsideration at the same time we ought never to forget that true public economy consist not in withhold the means necessary to accomplish important national object confide to we by the constitution but in take care that the money appropriate for these purpose shall be faithfully and frugally expend it will appear from the report of the secretary of the treasury that it be extremely doubtful to say the least whether we shall be able to pass through the present and the next fiscal year without provide additional revenue this can only be accomplish by strictly confine the appropriation within the estimate of the different department without make a allowance for any additional expenditure which congress may think proper in they discretion to authorize and without provide for the redemption of any portion of the $ 20000000 of treasury note which have be already issue in the event of a deficiency which i consider probable this ought never to be supply by a resort to additional loan it would be a ruinous practice in the day of peace and prosperity to go on increase the national debt to meet the ordinary expense of the government this policy would cripple we resource and impair we credit in case the existence of war should render it necessary to

the attempt may proceed this treaty be in accordance with the policy inaugurate by the government of the united state and in a especial manner by the senate in the year 1846 and several treaty have be conclude to carry it into effect it be simple and may be embrace in a few word on the one side a grant of free and uninterrupted transit for the government and people of the united state over the transit route across the isthmus and on the other a guaranty of the neutrality and protection of these route not only for the benefit of the republic through which they pass but in the language of we treaty with new granada in order to secure to themselves the tranquil and constant enjoyment of these inter-oceanic communication the first in the series of these treaty be that with new granada of the 12th December 1846 this treaty be conclude before we acquisition of californium and when we interest on the pacific coast be of far less magnitude than at the present day for year before this period however the route across the isthmus have attract the serious attention of this government this treaty after grant we the right of transit across the isthmus of panama in the most ample term bind this government to guarantee to new granada the perfect neutrality of the before-mentioned isthmus with the view that the free transit from the one to the other sea may not be interrupted or embarrassed in any future time while this treaty exist in one respect it go further than any of its successor because it not only guarantee the neutrality of the route itself but the rights of

1847 in which the attention of that body be especially call to these important stipulation of the thirty-fifth article and in which it be state moreover that we charg d'affaire who negotiate the

deliberately adopt a copy of the executive document -lrb- confidential -rrb- twenty-ninth congress second session contain this message of president polk and the papers which accompany it be hereto annex the next in order of time of these treaty of transit and guaranty be that of the 19th April 1850 with great britain commonly call the clayton and bulwer treaty this treaty in affirmance of the policy of the new granada treaty establish a general principle which have ever since i believe guide the proceedings of both government the eighth article of that treaty contain the follow stipulation : the government of the united state have not only desire in enter into this convention to accomplish a particular object but also to establish a general principle they hereby agree to extend they protection by treaty stipulation to any other practicable communication whether by canal or railway across the isthmus which connect north and south america and especially to the interoceanic communication should the same prove to be practicable whether by canal or railway which be now propose to be establish by the way of tehuantepec or panama and that the say -- canal or railway shall also be open on like term to the citizen and subject of every other state which be willing to grant thereto such protection as the united state and great britain propose to afford the united state in a short time after the clayton and bulwer treaty be conclude carry this stipulation in regard to the tehuantepec route into effect by they treaty with mexico of the 30th December 1853 the eighth article of this treaty after grant to we the transit privilege therein mention stipulate that the mexican government have agree to protect with its whole power the prosecution preservation and security of the work the united state may extend its protection as it shall judge wise to use it when it may feel sanction and warrant by the public or international law this be a sweeping grant of power to the united state which no nation ought to have concede but which it be believe have be confine within safe limit by we treaty with mexico now before the senate such be believe to be the established policy of the government at the commencement of this administration viz the grant of transit in we favor and the guaranty of we protection as a equivalent this guaranty can never be dangerous under we form of government because it can never be carry into execution without the express authority of congress still stand on the face of treaty as it do it deter all evil-disposed party from interfere with these route under such circumstance the attention of the executive be early turn to the nicaragua route as in many respects the most important and valuable to the citizen of we country in conclude a treaty to secure we rights of transit over this route i experience many difficulty which i need not now enumerate because they be detail in different message to congress finally a treaty be negotiate exactly in accordance with the established policy of the government and the view of the executive and clear from the embarrassment which might arise under the phraseology of previous treaty the fourteenth article of the treaty contain a full clear and specific grant of the right of transit to the united state and they citizen and be believe to be perfectly unexceptionable the fifteenth article instead of leave one equivalent duty of protection general and unlimited as in we treaty with new granada and in the clayton and bulwer treaty or instead of that general right assure to the government in the mexican treaty of extend its protection as it shall itself judge wise when it may feel sanction and warrant by the public or international law confines the interference concede within just and specific limit under the sixteenth article of this treaty the government of the united state have no right to interpose for the protection of the nicaragua route except with the consent or at the request of the government of nicaragua or of the minister thereof at washington or of the competent legally appoint local authority civil or military and when in the opinion of the government of nicaragua the necessity cease such force shall be immediately withdraw nothing can be more carefully guard than this provision no force can be employ unless upon the request of the government of nicaragua and it must be immediately withdraw whenever in the opinion of that government the necessity cease when congress shall come to adopt the measure necessary to carry this provision of the treaty into effect they can guard it from any abuse which may possibly arise the general policy contain in these article although inaugurate by the united state have be fully adopt by the government of great britain and france the plenipotentiary of both these government have recently negotiate treaty with nicaragua which be but transcript of the treaty between the united state and nicaragua now before the senate the treaty with france have be ratify it be understand by both the french and nicaraguan government and be now in operation that with great britain have be delay by other negotiation in nicaragua but it be believe that these be now conclude and that the ratification of the british treaty will soon therefore be exchange it be presume that no objection will be make to the exceptional case of the sixteenth article which be only intend to provide for the landing of sailor or marine from we vessel which may happen to be within reach of the point of difficulty in order to protect the life and property of citizen of the united state from unforeseen and imminent danger the same consideration may be suggest with respect to the fifth article of the treaty with mexico which be also pend before the senate this article be a exact copy of the sixteenth article just refer to of the treaty with nicaragua the treaty with hondura which be now submit to the senate follow on this subject the language of the british treaty with that republic and be not therefore identical in its term with the nicaraguan and mexican treaty the same policy however have be adopt in all of they and it will not fail i be persuade to receive from the senate all that consideration which it so eminently deserve the importance to the united state of secure free and safe transit route across the american isthmus can not well be overestimate these route be of great interest of course to all commercial nation but they be especially so to we from we geographical and political position as a american state and because they furnish a necessary communication between we atlantic and pacific state and territory the government of the united state can never permit these route to be permanently interrupted nor can it safely allow they to pass under the control of other rival nation while it seek no exclusive privilege upon they for itself it can never consent to be make tributary to they use to any european power it be worthy of consideration however whether to some extent it would not necessarily become so if after great britain and france have adopt we policy and make treaty with the isthmian government in pursuance of it we should ourselves reconsider it and refuse to pursue it in the treaty of the united state i might add that the opening of these transit route can not fail to extend the trade and commerce of the united state with the country through which they pass to afford a outlet and a market for we manufacture within they territory to encourage american citizen to develop they vast store of mining and mineral wealth for we benefit and to introduce among they a wholesome american influence calculate to prevent revolution and to render they government

mohawk _ capture the slaver _ wildfire _ on the coast of cuba with 507 african negro on board the prize be bring into key west on the 31st April and the negro be deliver into the custody of fernando j moreno marshal of the southern district of florida the question which now demand immediate decision be what disposition shall be make of these african in the annual message to congress of December 6 1858 i express my opinion in regard to the construction of the act of the 3d march 1819 in addition to the act prohibit the slave trade so far as the same be applicable to the present case from this i make the follow extract : under the second section of this act the president be authorize to make such regulation and arrangement as he may deem expedient for the safe-keeping support and removal beyond the limit of the united state of all such negro mulatto or person of color capture by vessel of the united state as may be deliver to the marshal of the district into which they be bring and to appoint a proper person or person reside upon the coast of africa as agent or agent for receive the negro mulatto or person of color deliver from on board vessel seize in the prosecution of the slave trade by commander of united state arm vessel a doubt immediately arise as to the true construction of this act it be quite clear from its term that the president be authorize to provide for the safe-keeping support and removal of these negro up till the time of they delivery to the agent on the coast of africa but no express provision be make for they protection and support after they have reach the place of they destination still a agent be to be appoint to receive they in africa and it could not have be suppose that congress intend he should desert they at the moment they be receive and turn they loose on that inhospitable coast to perish for want of food or to become again the victim of the slave trade have this be the intention of congress the employment of a agent to receive they who be require to reside on the coast be unnecessary and they might have be land by we vessel anywhere in africa and leave expose to the suffering and the fate which would certainly await they mr monroe in he special message of December 17 1819 at the first session after the act be pass announce to congress what in he opinion be its true construction he believe it to be he duty under it to follow these unfortunate into africa and make provision for they there until they should be able to provide for themselves in communicate this interpretation of the act to congress he state that some doubt have be entertain as to its true intent and meaning and he submit the question to they so that they might should it be deem advisable amend the same before further proceedings be have under it nothing be do by congress to explain the act and mr monroe proceed to carry it into execution accord to he own interpretation this then become the practical construction adopt this construction of president monroe i enter into a agreement with the colonization society date 7th September 1858 to receive the african which have be capture on the slaver _ echo _ from the agent of the united state in liberium to furnish they during the period of one year thereafter with comfortable shelter clothing and provision and to cause they to be instruct in the art of civilized life suitable to they condition at the rate of $ 150 for each individual it be believe that within that period they would be prepare to become citizen of liberium and to take care of themselves as congress be not then in session and as there be no outstanding appropriation applicable to this purpose the society be oblige to depend for payment on the future action of that body i recommend this appropriation and $ 75000 be grant by the act of 3d march 1859 -lrb- the consular and diplomatic bill -rrb- to enable the president of the united state to carry into effect the act of congress of 3d march 1819 and any subsequent act now in force for the suppression of the slave trade of this appropriation there remain unexpended the sum of $ 2435090 after deduct from it a advance make by the secretary of the interior out of the judiciary fund of $ 1134810 i regret to say that under the mode adopt in regard to the african capture on board the _ echo _ the expense will be large but this seem to a great extent to be inevitable without a violation of the law of humanity the expenditure upon this scale for those capture on board the _ wildfire _ will not be less than $ 100000 and may considerably exceed that sum still it ought to be observe that during the period when the government itself through its own agent undertake the task of provide for capture negro in africa the cost per head be much greater than that which i agree to pay the colonization society but it will not be sufficient for congress to limit the amount appropriate to the case of the _ wildfire _ it be probable judge from the increase activity of the slave trade and the vigilance of we cruiser that several similar capture may be make before the end of the year a appropriation ought therefore to be grant large enough to cover such contingency the period have arrive when it be indispensable to provide some specific legislation for the guidance of the executive on this subject with this view i would suggest that congress might authorize the president to enter into a general agreement with the colonization society bind they to receive on the coast of africa from a agent there all the capture african which may be deliver to he and to maintain they for a limited period upon such term and condition as may combine humanity toward these unfortunate with a just economy this would obviate the necessity of make a new bargain with every new capture and would prevent delay and avoid expense in the disposition of the capture the law might then provide that in all case where this may be practicable the captor should carry the negro directly to africa and deliver they to the american agent there afterwards bring the capture vessel to the united state for adjudication the capture officer in case he should bring he prize directly to the united state ought to be require to land the negro in some one or more port to be designate by congress where the prevail health throughout the year be good at these port cheap but permanent accommodation might be provide for the negro until they could be send away without incur the expense of erect such accommodation at every port where the capture officer may think proper to enter on the present occasion these negro have be bring to key west and accord to the estimate present by the marshal of the southern district of florida to the secretary of the interior the cost of provide temporary quarter for they will be $ 2500 and the aggregate expense for the single month of may will amount to $ 12000 but this be far from be the worst evil within a few week the yellow fever will most probably prevail at key west and hence the marshal urge they removal from they present quarter at a early day which must be do in any event as soon as practicable for these reason i earnestly commend this subject to the immediate attention of congress i transmit herewith a copy of the letter and estimate of fernando j moreno marshal of the southern district of florida to the secretary of the interior dated 10th may 1860 together with a copy of the letter of the secretary of the interior to myself date 16th may it be truly lamentable that great britain and the united state should be oblige to expend such a vast amount of blood and treasure for the suppression of the african slave trade and this when the only portion of the civilized world where it be tolerate and encourage be the spanish island of cuba and porto rico jame buchanan washington _ may 22 1860 _ _ to the senate and house of representative _ : i transmit herewith the copy of a letter date yesterday from the secretary of the interior communicate the copy of a letter address to he on the 13th instant by fernando j moreno marshal of the southern district of florida from this it appear that lieutenant stanly of the united state steamer _ wyandotte _ capture the bark _ william _ with about 550 african negro on board on the south side of cuba near the isle of pine and bring she into key west on the 12th instant these negro have doubtless be deliver to the marshal and with those capture on board the _ wildfire _ will make the number in he custody about 1000 more may be daily expect at key west which both on account of a deficiency of water and provision and its exposure to yellow fever be one of the worst spot for a african negro depot which could be find on the coast of the united state jame buchanan washington _ may 22 1860 _ _ to the house of representative _ : in answer to the resolution pass on the 26th of march last call for a detailed statement of the expenditure from the appropriation make during the first session of the thirty-fourth congress and the first and second session of the thirty-fifth congress for legal assistance and other necessary expenditure in the disposal of private land claim in californium and for the service of special counsel and other extraordinary expense of such land claim amount in all to $ 114000 i have the honor to transmit to the house of representative a report of the attorney-general which with the accompany document contain the information require jame buchanan washington _ may 26 1860 _ _ to the house of representative _ : in compliance with the resolution of the house of representative of the 21st instant request any information recently receive respect the chinese cooly trade which have not be heretofore communicate to congress i transmit a report from the secretary of state with the document which accompany it jame buchanan washington _ June 14 1860 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : i submit for the consideration of the senate article of agreement and convention with the delaware indian conclude may 13 1860 i concur in the recommendation of the secretary of the interior that the treaty should be ratify with the amendment suggest by the commissioner of indian affair jame buchanan June 23 1860 _ to the senate and house of representative _ gentleman : i feel it my duty to communicate to you that it have be find impracticable to conclude a contract for the transportation of the mail between we atlantic and pacific port on the term authorize by the fourth section of a act entitle a act make appropriation for the service of the post-office department during the fiscal year end 30th June 1861 approve 15th June 1860 the postmaster-general have offer the californium mail to the several company and shipowner engage in the trade with the pacific via the isthmus but they have all decline carry they for the postage they demand a higher rate of compensation and unless power be give to the postmaster-general to accede to this demand i be well satisfied that these mail can not be forward it should not be forget that in consequence of the diversion of a large part of the letter mail to the overland route the postage derive from the californium service have be greatly reduce and afford a wholly inadequate remuneration for the ocean transportation the weight of these mail average from 12 to 15 ton semimonthly render it in view of the climate and character of the road manifestly impossible to forward they overland without involve a expenditure which no wise administration of the government would impose upon the treasury i therefore earnestly recommend that the act refer to be so modify as to empower the postmaster-general to provide for carry the californium mail at a rate of compensation which may be deem reasonable and just jame buchanan washington _ June 25 1860 _ _ to the house of representative _ : i have approve and sign the bill entitle a act make appropriation for sundry civil expense of the government for the year end the 30th of June 1861 in notify the house of my approval of this bill i deem it proper under the peculiar circumstance of the case to make a few explanatory observation so that my course may not hereafter be misunderstand amid a great variety of important appropriation this bill contain a appropriation for the completion of the washington aqueduct $ 500000 to be expend accord to the plan and estimate of captain meig and under he superintendence : _ provide _ that the office of engineer of the potomac waterworks be hereby abolish and its duty shall hereafter be discharge by the chief engineer of the washington aqueduct to this appropriation for a wise and beneficial object i have not the least objection it be true i have reason to believe when the last appropriation be make of $ 800000 on the 12th of June 1858 _ for the completion of the washington aqueduct _ this would have be sufficient for the purpose it be now discover however that it will require half a million more _ for the completion of the washington aqueduct _ and this ought to be grant the captain meig to whom the bill refer be montgomery c meig a captain in the corps of engineer of the army of the united state who have superintend this work from its commencement under the authority of the late and present secretary of war have this appropriation be make in the usual form no difficulty could have arise upon it this bill however annex a declaration to the appropriation that the money be to be expend under the superintendence of captain meig the first aspect in which this clause present itself to my mind be that it interfere with the right of the president to be commander in chief of the army and navy of the united state if this have really be the case there would have be a end to the question upon further examination i deem it impossible that congress could have intend to interfere with the clear right of the president to command the army and to order its officer to any duty he might deem most expedient for the public interest if they could withdraw a officer from the command of the president and select he for the performance of a executive duty they might upon the same principle annex to a appropriation to carry on a war a condition require it not to be use for the defense of the country unless a particular person of its own selection should command the army it be impossible that congress could have have such a intention and therefore accord to my construction of the clause in question it merely designate captain meig as its preference for the work without intend to deprive the president of the power to order he to any other army duty for the performance of which he might consider he better adapt still whilst this clause may not be and i believe be not a violation of the constitution yet how destructive it would be to all proper subordination and how demoralize its effect upon the morale of the army if it should become a precedent for future legislation officer might then be find instead of perform they appropriate duty besiege the hall of congress for the purpose of obtain special favor and choice place by legislative enactment under these circumstance i have deem it but fair to inform congress that whilst i do not consider the bill unconstitutional this be only because in my opinion congress do not intend by the language which they have employ to interfere with my absolute authority to order captain meig to any other service i might deem expedient my perfect right still remain notwithstanding the clause to send he away from washington to any part of the union to superintend the erection of a fortification or on any other appropriate duty it have be allege i think without sufficient cause that this clause be unconstitutional because it have create a new office and have appoint captain meig to perform its duty if it have do this it would have be a clear question because congress have no right to appoint to any office this be specially confer upon the president and senate it be evident that congress intend nothing more by this clause than to express a decide opinion that captain meig should be continue in the employment to which he have be previously assign by competent authority it be not improbable that another question of grave importance may arise out of this clause be the appropriation conditional and will it fall provide i do not deem it proper that it shall be expend under the superintendence of captain meig this be a question which shall receive serious consideration because upon its decision may depend whether the completion of the waterworks shall be arrest for another season it be not probable that congress could have intend that this great and important work should depend upon the various casualty and vicissitude incident to the natural or official life of a single officer of the army this would be to make the work subordinate to the man and not the man to the work and to reverse we great axiomatic rule of principle not man i desire to express no opinion upon the subject should the question ever arise it shall have my serious consideration jame buchanan veto message -lrb- 13 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 13 : the message of February 1 and February 6 1860 be pocket veto -rrb- washington city _ February 1 1860 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : on the last day of the last congress a bill which have pass both house entitle a act make a appropriation for deepen the channel over the st clair flat in the state of michigan be present to I for approval it be scarcely necessary to observe that during the closing hour of a session it be impossible for the president on the instant to examine into the merit or demerit of a important bill involve as this do grave question both of expediency and of constitutional power with that care and deliberation demand by he public duty as well as by the best interest of the country for this reason the constitution have in all case allow he ten day for deliberation because if a bill be present to he within the last ten day of the session he be not require to return it either with a approval or a veto but may retain it in which case it shall not be a law whilst a occasion can rarely occur when so long a period as ten day would be require to enable the president to decide whether he should approve or veto a bill yet to deny he even two day on important question before the adjournment of each session for this purpose as recommend by a former annual message would not only be unjust to he but a violation of the spirit of the constitution to require he to approve a bill when it be impossible he could examine into its merit would be to deprive he of the exercise of he constitutional discretion and convert he into a mere register of the decree of congress i therefore deem it a sufficient reason for have retain the bill in question that it be not present to I until the last day of the session since the termination of the last congress i have make a thorough examination of the question involve in the bill to deepen the channel over the st clair flat and now proceed to express the opinion which i have form upon the subject and 1 even if this have be a mere question of expediency it be to say the least extremely doubtful whether the bill ought to have be approve because the object which congress intend to accomplish by the appropriation which it contain of $ 55000 have be already substantially accomplished i do not mean to allege that the work have be complete in the best manner but it be sufficient for all practical purpose the st clair flat be form by the st clair river which empty into the lake of that name by several mouth and which form a bar or shoal on which in its natural state there be not more than 6 or 7 foot of water this shoal be interpose between the mouth of the river and the deep water of the lake a distance of 6000 foot and in its natural condition be a serious obstruction to navigation the obvious remedy for this be to deepen a channel through these flat by dredge so as to enable vessel which could navigate the lake and the river to pass through this intermediate channel this object have be already accomplish by previous appropriation but without my knowledge when the bill be present to I captain whipple of the topographical engineer to whom the expenditure of the last appropriation of $ 45000 for this purpose in 1856 be intrust in he annual report of the 1st October 1858 state that the dredging be discontinue on the 26th August 1858 when a channel have be cut average 275 foot wide with a depth vary from 12 to 15-1\/2 foot he say : so long as the lake retain its present height we may assume that the depth in the channel will be at least 13-1\/2 foot with this result highly creditable to captain whipple he observe that if he have be correctly inform all the lake navigator be gratified besides afterwards and during the autumn of 1858 the canadian government expend $ 20000 in deepen and widen the inner end of the channel excavate by the united state no complaint have be make previous to the passage of the bill of obstruction to the commerce and navigation across the st clair flat what then be the object of the appropriation propose by the bill it appear that the surface of the water in lake st clair have be gradually rise until in 1858 it have attain a elevation of 4 foot above what have be its level in 1841 it be infer whether correctly or not it be not for I to say that the surface of the water may gradually sink to the level of 1841 and in that event the water which be when the bill pass 13-1\/2 foot deep in the channel might sink to 9-1\/2 foot and thus obstruct the passage to provide for this contingency captain whipple suggest the propriety of place the subject before congress with a estimate for excavate a cut through the center of the new channel 150 foot in width and 4-1\/2 foot deep so as to obtain from the river to the lake a depth of 18 foot during season of extreme high water and 12 foot at period of extreme low water it be not allege that any present necessity exist for this narrower cut in the bottom of the present channel but it be infer that for the reason state it may hereafter become necessary captain whipple 's estimate amount to $ 50000 but congress by the bill have grant $ 55000 now if no other objection exist against this measure it would not seem necessary that the appropriation should have be make for the purpose indicate the channel be sufficiently deep for all practical purpose but from natural cause constantly operate in the lake which i need not explain this channel be peculiarly liable to fill up what be really require be that it should at interval be dredge out so as to preserve its present depth and surely the comparatively trifling expense necessary for this purpose ought not to be bear by the united state after a improvement have be once construct by appropriation from the treasury it be not too much to expect that it should be keep in repair by that portion of the commercial and navigate interest which enjoy its peculiar benefit the last report make by captain whipple date on the 13th September last have be submit to congress by the secretary of war and to this i would refer for information which be upon the whole favorable in relation to the present condition of the channel through the st clair flat 2 but the far more important question be do congress possess the power under the constitution to deepen the channel of river and to create and improve harbor for purpose of commerce the question of the constitutional power of congress to construct internal improvement within the state have be so frequently and so elaborately discuss that it would seem useless on this occasion to repeat or to refute at length argument which have be so often advance for my own opinion on this subject i might refer to president polk 's carefully consider message of the 15th December 1847 address to the house of representative whilst i be a member of he cabinet the power to pass the bill in question if it exist at all must be derive from the power to regulate commerce with foreign nation and among the several state and with the indian tribe the power to regulate : do this ever embrace the power to create or to construct to say that it do be to confound the meaning of word of well-known signification the word regulate have several shades of mean accord to its application to different subject but never do it approach the signification of creative power the regulate power necessarily presuppose the existence of something to be regulate as apply to commerce it signify accord to the lexicographer to subject to rule or restriction as to regulate trade etc the constitution itself be its own best expounder of the meaning of word employ by its framer thus congress have the power to coin money this be the creative power then immediately follow the power to regulate the value thereof -- that be of the coin money thus bring into existence the word regulate regulation and regulation occur several time in the constitution but always with this subordinate meaning thus after the creative power to raise and support army and to provide and maintain a navy have be confer upon congress then follow the power to make rule for the government and regulation of the land and naval force thus call into be so the constitution act upon the self-evident fact that commerce with foreign nation and among the several state and with the indian tribe already exist confer upon congress the power to regulate this commerce thus accord to chief justice marshall the power to regulate commerce be the power to prescribe the rule by which commerce be to be govern and mr madison in he veto message of the 3d march 1817 declare that -- the power to regulate commerce among the several state can not include a power to construct road and canal and to improve the navigation of water course in order to facilitate promote and secure such commerce without a latitude of construction depart from the ordinary import of the term strengthen by the known inconvenience which doubtless lead to the grant of this remedial power to congress we know from the history of the constitution what these inconvenience be different state admit foreign import at different rate of duty those which have prescribe a higher rate of duty for the purpose of increase they revenue be defeat in this object by the legislation of neighbor state admit the same foreign article at lower rate hence jealousy and dangerous rivalry have spring up between the different state it be chiefly in the desire to provide a remedy for these evil that the federal convention originate the constitution for this purpose confer upon congress the power to regulate commerce in such a manner that duty should be uniform in all the state compose the confederacy and moreover expressly provide that no preference shall be give by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the port of one state over those of another if the construction of a harbor or deepen the channel of a river be a regulation of commerce as the advocate of this power contend this would give the port of the state within which these improvement be make a preference over the port of other state and thus be a violation of the constitution it be not too much to assert that no human be in existence when the constitution be frame entertain the idea or the apprehension that by confer upon congress the power to regulate commerce its framer intend to embrace the power of construct road and canal and of create and improve harbor and deepen the channel of river throughout we extensive confederacy indeed one important branch of this very power have be deny to congress in express term by the convention a proposition be make in the convention to confer on congress the power to provide for the cutting of canal when deem necessary this be reject by the strong majority of eight state to three among the reason give for this rejection be that the expense in such case will fall on the united state and the benefit accrue to the place where the canal may be cut to say that the simple power of regulate commerce embrace within itself that of construct harbor of deepen the channel of river -- in short of create a system of internal improvement for the purpose of facilitate the operation of commerce -- would be to adopt a latitude of construction under which all political power might be usurp by the federal government such a construction would be in conflict with the well-known jealousy against federal power which actuate the framer of the constitution it be certain that the power in question be not enumerate among the express grant to congress contain in the instrument in construe the constitution we must then next inquire be its exercise necessary and proper -- not whether it may be convenient or useful for carry into execution the power to regulate commerce among the state but the jealous patriot of that day be not content even with this strict rule of construction apprehend that a dangerous latitude of interpretation might be apply in future time to the enumerated grant of power they procure a amendment to be make to the original instrument which declare that the power not delegate to the united state by the constitution nor prohibit by it to the state be reserve to the state respectively or to the people the distinctive spirit and character which pervade the constitution be that the power of the general government be confine chiefly to we intercourse with foreign nation to question of peace and war and to subject of common interest to all the state carefully leave the internal and domestic concern of each individual state to be control by its own people and legislature without specifically enumerate these power it must be admit that this well-marked distinction run through the whole instrument in nothing do the wisdom of its framer appear more conspicuously than in the care with which they seek to avoid the danger to we institution which must necessarily result from the interference of the federal government with the local concern of the state the jarring and collision which would occur from the exercise by two separate government of jurisdiction over the same subject could not fail to produce disastrous consequence besides the corrupting and seduce money influence exert by the general government in carry into effect a system of internal improvement might be pervert to increase and consolidate its own power to the detriment of the rights of the state if the power exist in congress to pass the present bill then tax must be impose and money borrow to a unlimited extent to carry such a system into execution equality among the state be equity this equality be the very essence of the constitution no preference can justly be give to one of the sovereign state over another accord to the best estimate we immense coast on the atlantic the gulf of mexico the pacific and the ivake embrace more than 9500 mile and measure by its indentation and to the head of tide water on the river the distance be believe to be more than 33000 mile this everywhere throughout its vast extent contain numerous river and harbor all of which may become the object of congressional appropriation you can not deny to one state what you have grant to another such injustice would produce strife jealousy and alarming dissension among they even within the same state improvement may be make in one river or harbor which would essentially injure the commerce and industry of another river or harbor the truth be that most of these improvement be in a great degree local in they character and for the especial benefit of corporation or individual in they vicinity though they may have a odor of nationality on the principle that whatever benefit any part indirectly benefit the whole from we past history we may have a small foretaste of the cost of revive the system of internal improvement for more than thirty year after the adoption of the federal constitution the power to appropriate money for the construction of internal improvement be neither claim nor exercise by congress after its commencement in 1820 and 1821 by very small and modest appropriation for survey it advance with such rapid stride that within the brief period of ten year accord to president polk the sum ask for from the treasury for various project amount to more than $ 200000000 the veto of general jackson and several of he successor have impede the progress of the system and limit its extent but have not altogether destroy it the time have now arrive for a final decision of the question if the power exist a general system should be adopt which would make some approach to justice among all the state if this be possible what a vast field would the exercise of this power open for job and corruption member of congress from a honest desire to promote the interest of they constituent would struggle for improvement within they own district and the body itself must necessarily be convert into a arena where each would endeavor to obtain from the treasury as much money as possible for he own locality the temptation would prove irresistible a system of _ logrolling _ -lrb- i know no word so expressive -rrb- would be inaugurate under which the treasury would be exhaust and the federal government be deprive of the means necessary to execute those great power clearly confide to it by the constitution for the purpose of promote the interest and vindicate the honor of the country whilst the power over internal improvement it be believe be reserve to the state respectively the framer of the constitution be not unmindful that it might be proper for the state legislature to possess the power to impose tonnage duty for the improvement of river and harbor within they limit the self-interest of the different locality would prevent this from be do to such a extent as to injure they trade the constitution therefore which have in a previous clause provide that all duty should be uniform throughout the united state subsequently modify the general rule so far as to declare that no state shall without the consent of congress levy any duty of tonnage the inference be therefore irresistible that with the consent of congress such a duty may be impose by the state thus those directly interested in the improvement may lay a tonnage duty for its construction without impose a tax for this purpose upon all the people of the united state to this provision several of the state resort until the period when they begin to look to the federal treasury instead of depend upon they own exertion massachusett rhode island pennsylvanium maryland virginium north carolina south carolina and georgium with the consent of congress impose small tonnage duty on vessel at different period for clearing and deepen the channel of river and improve harbor where such vessel enter the last of these legislative act believe to exist be that of virginium pass on the 22d February 1826 levy a tonnage duty on vessel for improve the navigation of jame river from warwick to rockett land the latest act of congress on this subject be pass on the 24th of February 1843 give its consent to the law of the legislature of maryland lay a tonnage duty on vessel for the improvement of the harbor of baltimore and continue it in force until 1st June 1850 thus a clear constitutional mode exist by which the legislature of michigan may in its discretion raise money to preserve the channel of the st clair river at its present depth or to render it deeper a very insignificant tonnage duty on american vessel use this channel would be sufficient for the purpose and as the st clair river be the boundary line between the united state and the province of upper canada the provincial british authority would doubtless be willing to impose a similar tonnage duty on british vessel to aid in the accomplishment of this object indeed the legislature of that province have already evince they interest on this subject by have but recently expend $ 20000 on the improvement of the st clair flat even if the constitution of the united state have confer upon congress the power of deepen the channel of the st clair river it would be unjust to impose upon the people of the united state the entire burden which ought to be bear jointly by the two party have a equal interest in the work whenever the state of michigan shall cease to depend on the treasury of the united state i doubt not that she in conjunction with upper canada will provide the necessary means for keep this work in repair in the least expensive and most effective manner and without be burdensome to any interest it have be contend in favor of the existence of the power to construct internal improvement that congress have from the beginning make appropriation for light-house and that upon the same principle of construction they possess the power of improve harbor and deepen the channel of river as a original question the authority to erect light-house under the commercial power might be consider doubtful but even be it more doubtful than it be i should regard it as settle after a uninterrupted exercise of the power for seventy year such a long and uniform practical construction of the constitution be entitle to the highest respect and have finally determine the question among the first act which pass congress after the federal government go into effect be that of August 7 1789 provide for the establishment and support of light-houses beacon buoy and public pier under this act the expense for the maintenance of all such erection then in existence be to be pay by the federal government and provision be make for the cession of jurisdiction over they by the respective state to the united state in every case since before a light-house could be build a previous cession of jurisdiction have be require this practice doubtless originate from that clause of the constitution authorize congress to exercise exclusive legislation over all place purchase by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be for the erection of fort magazine arsenal dockyard and other _ needful building _ among these _ needful building _ light-house must in fact have be include the bare statement of these fact be sufficient to prove that no analogy exist between the power to erect a light-house as a needful building and that to deepen the channel of a river in what i have say i do not mean to intimate a doubt of the power of congress to construct such internal improvement as may be essentially necessary for defense and protection against the invasion of a foreign enemy the power to declare war and the obligation to protect each state against invasion clearly cover such case it will scarcely be claim however that the improvement of the st clair river be within this category this river be the boundary line between the united state and the british province of upper canada any improvement of its navigation therefore which we could make for purpose of war would equally inure to the benefit of great britain the only enemy which could possibly confront we in that quarter war would be a sad calamity for both nation but should it ever unhappily exist the battle will not be fight on the st clair river or on the lake with which it communicate jame buchanan washington _ February 6 1860 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : on the last day of the last session of congress a resolution which have pass both house in relation to removal of obstruction to navigation in the mouth of the mississippus river be present to I for approval i have retain this resolution because it be present to I at a period when it be impossible to give the subject that examination to which it appear to be entitle i need not repeat the view on this point present in the introductory portion of my message to the senate of the 2d -lrb- 1st -rrb- instant in addition i would merely observe that although at different period sum amount in the aggregate to $ 690000 have be appropriate by congress for the purpose of remove the bar and obstruction at the mouth of the mississippus yet it be now acknowledge that this money have be expend with but little if any practical benefit to its navigation jame buchanan washington _ April 17 1860 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : i return with my objection to the senate for they reconsideration the bill entitle a act for the relief of arthur edward and he associate present to I on the 10th instant this bill direct the postmaster-general to audit and settle the account of arthur edward and he associate for transport the united state through mail on they steamer during the year 1849 and 1853 and intervene year between cleveland and detroit between sandusky and detroit and between toledo and detroit and to allow and pay they not less than $ 2860 for each and every passage of say steamer between say place during the aforementioned time when the mail be on board i have cause a statement to be make at the post-office department of the least sum which can be pay to mr edward and he associate under the bill should it become a law and from this it appear the amount will be $ 8040523 mr edward and he associate in 1854 a short time after the alleged service have be render present a claim to the postmaster-general for $ 25180 as compensation for these service this claim consist of nine item set forth specifically all the service embrace by the present bill it be fair to presume that the party best know the value of they own service and that they would not by a underestimate do themselves injustice the whole claim of $ 25180 be reject by the postmaster-general for reason which it be no part of my present purpose to discuss the claimant next present a petition to the court of claim in June 1855 for a reasonable compensation for these service and pray the judgment of you honorable court for the actual value of the service render by they and receive by the united state which amount to the sum of $ 50000 thus the estimate which they place upon they service have nearly double between 1854 and 1855 -- have rise from $ 25180 to $ 50000 on the ------ after a full hear the court decide against the claim and deliver a opinion in support of this decision which can not i think be contest on legal principle but they state in the conclusion of the opinion that for any compensation for they service beyond what they have receive they must depend upon the discretion of congress this decision of the court of claim be report to congress on the 1st of April 1858 and from it the present bill have originate the amount grant by it be more by upward of $ 55000 than the party themselves demand from the postmaster-general in 1854 and be more by upward of $ 30000 than they demand when before the court of claim the enormous difference in they favor between they own original demand and the amount grant by the present bill constitute my chief objection to it in present this objection i do not propose to enter into the question whether the claimant be entitle in equity to any compensation for they service beyond that which it be allege they have already receive or if so what would be a reasonable and fair compensation my sole purpose be to afford congress a opportunity of reconsider this case on account of its peculiar circumstance i transmit to the senate the report of horatio king act postmaster-general and of a zevely third assistant postmaster-general both date on the 14th of April 1860 on the subject of this claim jame buchanan washington _ June 22 1860 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : i return with my objection to the senate in which it originate the bill entitle a act to secure homestead to actual settler on the public domain and for other purpose present to I on the 20th instant this bill give to every citizen of the united state who be the head of a family and to every person of foreign birth reside in the country who have declare he intention to become a citizen though he may not be the head of a family the privilege of appropriate to himself 160 acre of government land of settle and reside upon it for five year and should he residence continue until the end of this period he shall then receive a patent on the payment of 25 cent per acre or one-fifth of the present government price during this period the land be protect from all the debt of the settler this bill also contain a cession to the state of all the public land within they respective limit which have be subject to sale at private entry and which remain unsold after the lapse of thirty year this provision embrace a present donation to the state of 12229731 acre and will from time to time transfer to they large body of such land which from peculiar circumstance may not be absorb by private purchase and settlement to the actual settler this bill do not make a absolute donation but the price be so small that it can scarcely be call a sale it be nominally 25 cent per acre but consider this be not to be pay until the end of five year it be in fact reduce to about 18 cent per acre or one-seventh of the present minimum price of the public land in regard to the state it be a absolute and unqualified gift 1 this state of the fact raise the question whether congress under the constitution have the power to give away the public land either to state or individual on this question i express a decide opinion in my message to the house of representative of the 24th February 1859 return the agricultural-college bill this opinion remain unchanged the argument then use apply as a constitutional objection with greater force to the present bill _ there _ it have the plea of consideration grow out of a specific beneficial purpose _ here _ it be a absolute gratuity to the state without the pretext of consideration i be compel for want of time in these the last hour of the session to quote largely from this message i presume the general proposition will be admit that congress do not possess the power to make donation of money already in the treasury raise by tax on the people either to state or individual but it be contend that the public land be place upon a different footing from money raise by taxation and that the proceeds arise from they sale be not subject to the limitation of the constitution but may be appropriate or give away by congress at its own discretion to state corporation or individual for any purpose they may deem expedient the advocate of this bill attempt to sustain they position upon the language of the second clause of the third section of the fourth article of the constitution which declare that the congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rule and regulation respect the territory or other property belong to the united state they contend that by a fair interpretation of the word dispose of in this clause congress possess the power to make this gift of public land to the state for purpose of education it would require clear and strong evidence to induce the belief that the framer of the constitution after have limit the power of congress to certain precise and specific object intend by employ the word dispose of to give that body unlimited power over the vast public domain it would be a strange anomaly indeed to have create two fund -- the one by taxation confine to the execution of the enumerated power delegate to congress and the other from the public land applicable to all subject foreign and domestic which congress might designate that this fund should be dispose of not to pay the debt of the united state nor to raise and support army nor to provide and maintain a navy nor to accomplish any one of the other great object enumerate in the constitution but be divert from they to pay the debt of the state to educate they people and to carry into effect any other measure of they domestic policy this would be to confer upon congress a vast and irresponsible authority utterly at war with the well-known jealousy of federal power which prevail at the formation of the constitution the natural intendment would be that as the constitution confine congress to well-defined specific power the fund place at they command whether in land or money should be appropriate to the performance of the duty correspond with these power if not a government have be create with all its other power carefully limited but without any limitation in respect to the public land but i can not so read the word dispose of as to make they embrace the idea of give away the true meaning of word be always to be ascertain by the subject to which they be apply and the known general intent of the lawgiver congress be a trustee under the constitution for the people of the united state to dispose of they public land and i think i may venture to assert with confidence that no case can be find in which a trustee in the position of congress have be authorize to _ dispose of _ property by its owner where it have be hold that these word authorize such trustee to give away the fund intrust to he care no trustee when call upon to account for the disposition of the property place under he management before any judicial tribunal would venture to present such a plea in he defense the true meaning of these word be clearly state by chief justice taney in deliver the opinion of the court -lrb- 19 howard p 436 -rrb- he say in reference to this clause of the constitution : it begin its enumeration of power by that of dispose in other word make sale of the land or raise money from they which as we have already say be the main object of the cession -lrb- from the state -rrb- and which be the first thing provide for in the article it be unnecessary to refer to the history of the time to establish the known fact that this statement of the chief justice be perfectly well found that it never be intend by the framer of the constitution that these land should be give away by congress be manifest from the conclude portion of the same clause by it congress have power not only to dispose of the territory but of the other property of the united state in the language of the chief justice -lrb- p 437 -rrb- : and the same power of make needful rule respect the territory be in precisely the same language apply to the other property of the united state associate the power over the territory in this respect with the power over movable or personal property that be the ship arm or munitions of war which then belong in common to the state sovereignty the question be still clearer in regard to the public land in the state and territory within the louisiana and florida purchase these land be pay for out of the public treasury from money raise by taxation now if congress have no power to appropriate the money with which these land be purchase be it not clear that the power over the land be equally limit the mere conversion of this money into land could not confer upon congress new power over the disposition of land which they have not possess over money if it could then a trustee by change the character of the fund intrust to he care for special object from money into land might give the land away or devote it to any purpose he think proper however foreign from the trust the inference be irresistible that this land partake of the very same character with the money pay for it and can be devote to no object different from those to which the money could have be devote if this be not the case then by the purchase of a new territory from a foreign government out of the public treasury congress could enlarge they own power and appropriate the proceeds of the sale of the land thus purchase at they own discretion to other and far different object from what they could have apply the purchase money which have be raise by taxation 2 it will prove unequal and unjust in its operation among the actual settler themselves the first settler of a new country be a most meritorious class they brave the danger of savage warfare suffer the privation of a frontier life and with the hand of toil bring the wilderness into cultivation the old settler as they be everywhere call be public benefactor this class have all pay for they land the government price or $ 125 per acre they have construct road establish school and lay the foundation of prosperous commonwealth be it just be it equal that after they have accomplish all this by they labor new settler should come in among they and receive they farm at the price of 25 or 18 cent per acre surely the old settler as a class be entitle to at least equal benefit with the new if you give the new settler they land for a comparatively nominal price upon every principle of equality and justice you will be oblige to refund out of the common treasury the difference which the old have pay above the new settler for they land 3 this bill will do great injustice to the old soldier who have receive land warrant for they service in fight the battle of they country it will greatly reduce the market value of these warrant already they value have sink for 160-acre warrant to 67 cent per acre under a apprehension that such a measure as this might become a law what price would they command when any head of a family may take possession of a quarter section of land and not pay for it until the end of five year and then at the rate of only 25 cent per acre the magnitude of the interest to be affect will appear in the fact that there be outstanding unsatisfied land warrant reach back to the last war with great britain and even revolutionary time amount in round number to seven and a half million of acre 4 this bill will prove unequal and unjust in its operation because from its nature it be confine to one class of we people it be a boon exclusively confer upon the cultivator of the soil whilst it be cheerfully admit that these be the most numerous and useful class of we fellow-citizen and eminently deserve all the advantage which we law have already extend to they yet there should be no new legislation which would operate to the injury or embarrassment of the large body of respectable artisan and laborer the mechanic who emigrate to the west and pursue he call must labor long before he can purchase a quarter section of land whilst the tiller of the soil who accompany he obtain a farm at once by the bounty of the government the numerous body of mechanic in we large city can not even by emigrate to the west take advantage of the provision of this bill without enter upon a new occupation for which they habit of life have render they unfit 5 this bill be unjust to the old state of the union in many respects and amongst these state so far as the public land be concern we may enumerate every state east of the mississippus with the exception of wisconsin and a portion of minnesota it be a common belief within they limit that the older state of the confederacy do not derive they proportionate benefit from the public land this be not a just opinion it be doubtful whether they could be render more beneficial to these state under any other system than that which at present exist they proceeds go into the common treasury to accomplish the object of the government and in this manner all the state be benefit in just proportion but to give this common inheritance away would deprive the old state of they just proportion of this revenue without hold out any the least corresponding advantage whilst it be we common glory that the new state have become so prosperous and populous there be no good reason why the old state should offer premium to they own citizen to emigrate from they to the west that land of promise present in itself sufficient allurement to we young and enterprising citizen without any adventitious aid the offer of free farm would probably have a powerful effect in encouraging emigration especially from state like illinois tennessee and kentucky to the west of the mississippus and could not fail to reduce the price of property within they limit a individual in state thus situate would not pay its fair value for land when by cross the mississippus he could go upon the public land and obtain a farm almost without money and without price 6 this bill will open one vast field for speculation man will not pay $ 125 for land when they can purchase they for one-fifth of that price large number of actual settler will be carry out by capitalist upon agreement to give they half of the land for the improvement of the other half this can not be avoid secret agreement of this kind will be numerous in the entry of graduate land the experience of the land office justify this objection 7 we ought ever to maintain the most perfect equality between native and naturalized citizen they be equal and ought always to remain equal before the law we law welcome foreigner to we shore and they rights will ever be respect whilst these be the sentiment on which i have act through life it be not in my opinion expedient to proclaim to all the nation of the earth that whoever shall arrive in this country from a foreign shore and declare he intention to become a citizen shall receive a farm of 160 acre at a cost of 25 or 20 cent per acre if he will only reside on it and cultivate it the invitation extend to all and if this bill become a law we may have numerous actual settler from china and other eastern nation enjoy its benefit on the great pacific slope the bill make a distinction in favor of such person over native and naturalized citizen when apply to such citizen it be confine to such as be the head of family but when applicable to person of foreign birth recently arrive on we shore there be no such restriction such person need not be the head of family provide they have file a declaration of intention to become citizen perhaps this distinction be a inadvertence but it be nevertheless a part of the bill 8 the bill create a unjust distinction between person claim the benefit of the preemption law whilst it reduce the price of the land to exist preemptor to 62-1\/2 cent per acre and give they a credit on this sum for two year from the present date no matter how long they may have hitherto enjoy the land future preemptor will be compel to pay double this price per acre there be no reason or justice in this discrimination 9 the effect of this bill on the public revenue must be apparent to all should it become a law the reduction of the price of land to actual settler to 25 cent per acre with a credit of five year and the reduction of its price to exist preemptor to 62-1\/2 cent per acre with a credit of two year will so diminish the sale of other public land as to render the expectation of future revenue from that source beyond the expense of survey and management illusory the secretary of the interior estimate the revenue from the public land for the next fiscal year at $ 4000000 on the presumption that the present land system would remain unchanged should this bill become a law he do not believe that $ 1000000 will be derive from this source 10 this bill lay the ax at the root of we present admirable land system the public land be a inheritance of vast value to we and to we descendant it be a resource to which we can resort in the hour of difficulty and danger it have be manage heretofore with the greatest wisdom under exist law in this management the rights of actual settler have be conciliate with the interest of the government the price to all have be reduce from $ 2 per acre to $ 125 for fresh land and the claim of actual settler have be secure by we preemption law any man can now acquire a title in fee simple to a homestead of 80 acre at the minimum price of $ 125 per acre for $ 100 should the present system remain we shall derive a revenue from the public land of $ 10000000 per annum when the bounty-land warrant be satisfy without oppression to any human be in time of war when all other source of revenue be seriously impaired this will remain intact it may become the best security for public loan hereafter in time of difficulty and danger as it have be heretofore why should we impair or destroy the system at the present moment what necessity exist for it the people of the united state have advance with steady but rapid stride to they present condition of power and prosperity they have be guide in they progress by the fix principle of protect the equal rights of all whether they be rich or poor no agrarian sentiment have ever prevail among they the honest poor man by frugality and industry can in any part of we country acquire a competence for himself and he family and in do this he feel that he eat the bread of independence he desire no charity either from the government or from he neighbor this bill which propose to give he land at a almost nominal price out of the property of the government will go far to demoralize the people and repress this noble spirit of independence it may introduce among we those pernicious social theory which have prove so disastrous in other country jame buchanan protest washington _ march 28 1860 _ _ to the house of representative _ : after a delay which have afford I ample time for reflection and after much and careful deliberation i find myself constrain by a imperious sense of duty as a coordinate branch of the federal government to protest against the first two clause of the first resolution adopt by the house of representative on the 5th instant and publish in the congressional globe on the succeed day these clause be in the follow word : _ resolve _ that a committee of five member be appoint by the speaker for the purpose first of investigate whether the president of the united state or any other officer of the government have by money patronage or other improper means seek to influence the action of congress or any committee thereof for or against the passage of any law appertaining to the rights of any state or territory and second also to inquire into and investigate whether any officer or officer of the government have by combination or otherwise prevent or defeat or attempt to prevent or defeat the execution of any law or law now upon the statute book and whether the president have fail or refuse to compel the execution of any law thereof i confine myself exclusively to these two branch of the resolution because the portion of it which follow relate to allege abuse in post-offices navy-yard public building and other public work of the united state in such case inquiry be highly proper in themselves and belong equally to the senate and the house as incident to they legislative duty and be necessary to enable they to discover and to provide the appropriate legislative remedy for any abuse which may be ascertain although the term of the latter portion of the resolution be extremely vague and general yet my sole purpose in adverting to they at present be to mark the broad line of distinction between the accusatory and the remedial clause of this resolution the house of representative possess no power under the constitution over the first or accusatory portion of the resolution except as a impeaching body whilst over the last in common with the senate they authority as a legislative body be fully and cheerfully admit it be solely in reference to the first or impeaching power that i propose to make a few observation except in this single case the constitution have invest the house of representative with no power no jurisdiction no supremacy whatever over the president in all other respects he be quite as independent of they as they be of he as a coordinate branch of the government he be they equal indeed he be the only direct representative on earth of the people of all and each of the sovereign state to they and to they alone be he responsible whilst act within the sphere of he constitutional duty and not in any manner to the house of representative the people have think proper to invest he with the most honorable responsible and dignified office in the world and the individual however unworthy now hold this exalted position will take care so far as in he lie that they rights and prerogative shall never be violate in he person but shall pass to he successor unimpaired by the adoption of a dangerous precedent he will defend they to the last extremity against any unconstitutional attempt come from what quarter it may to abridge the constitutional rights of the executive and render he subservient to any human power except themselves the people have not confine the president to the exercise of executive duty they have also confer upon he a large measure of legislative discretion no bill can become a law without he approval as represent the people of the united state unless it shall pass after he veto by a majority of two-third of both house in he legislative capacity he might in common with the senate and the house institute a inquiry to ascertain any fact which ought to influence he judgment in approve or veto any bill this participation in the performance of legislative duty between the coordinate branch of the government ought to inspire the conduct of all of they in they relation toward each other with mutual forbearance and respect at least each have a right to demand justice from the other the cause of complaint be that the constitutional rights and immunity of the executive have be violate in the person of the president the trial of a impeachment of the president before the senate on charge prefer and prosecute against he by the house of representative would be a impose spectacle for the world in the result not only he removal from the presidential office would be involve but what be of infinitely greater importance to himself he character both in the eye of the present and of future generation might possibly be tarnish the disgrace cast upon he would in some degree be reflect upon the character of the american people who elect he hence the precaution adopt by the constitution to secure a fair trial on such a trial it declare that the chief justice shall preside this be doubtless because the framer of the constitution believe it to be possible that the vice-president might be bias by the fact that in case of the removal of the president from office the same shall devolve on the vice-president the preliminary proceedings in the house in the case of charge which may involve impeachment have be well and wisely settle by long practice upon principle of equal justice both to the accuse and to the people the precedent establish in the case of judge peck of missourus in 1831 after a careful review of all former precedent will i venture to predict stand the test of time in that case luke edward lawless the accuser present a petition to the house in which he set forth minutely and specifically he cause of complaint he pray that the conduct and proceedings in this behalf of say judge peck may be inquire into by you honorable body and such decision make thereon as to you wisdom and justice shall seem proper this petition be refer to the judiciary committee such have ever be deem the appropriate committee to make similar investigation it be a standing committee suppose to be appoint without reference to any special case and at all time be presume to be compose of the most eminent lawyer in the house from different portion of the union whose acquaintance with judicial proceedings and whose habit of investigation qualify they peculiarly for the task no tribunal from they position and character could in the nature of thing be more impartial in the case of judge peck the witness be select by the committee itself with a view to ascertain the truth of the charge they be cross-examine by he and everything be conduct in such a manner as to afford he no reasonable cause of complaint in view of this precedent and what be of far greater importance in view of the constitution and the principle of eternal justice in what manner have the president of the united state be treat by the house of representative mr john covode a representative from pennsylvanium be the accuser of the president instead of follow the wise precedent of former time and especially that in the case of judge peck and refer the accusation to the committee on the judiciary the house have make my accuser one of my judge to make the accuser the judge be a violation of the principle of universal justice and be condemn by the practice of all civilized nation every freeman must revolt at such a spectacle i be to appear before mr covode either personally or by a substitute to cross-examine the witness which he may produce before himself to sustain he own accusation against I and perhaps even this poor boon may be deny to the president and what be the nature of the investigation which he resolution propose to institute it be as vague and general as the english language afford word in which to make it the committee be to inquire not into any specific charge or charge but whether the president have by money patronage or other improper means seek to influence not the action of any individual member or member of congress but the action of the entire body of congress itself or any committee thereof the president might have have some glimmering of the nature of the offense to be investigate have he accuser point to the act or act of congress which he seek to pass or to defeat by the employment of money patronage or other improper means but the accusation be bound by no such limit it extend to the whole circle of legislation -- to interference for or against the passage of any law appertaining to the rights of any state or territory and what law do not appertain to the rights of some state or territory and what law or law have the president fail to execute these might easily have be point out have any such exist have mr lawless ask a inquiry to be make by the house whether judge peck in general term have not violate he judicial duty without the specification of any particular act i do not believe there would have be a single vote in that body in favor of the inquiry since the time of the star-chamber and of general warrant there have be no such proceeding in england the house of representative the high impeach power of the country without consent to hear a word of explanation have indorse this accusation against the president and make it they own act they even refuse to permit a member to inquire of the president 's accuser what be the specific charge against he thus in this preliminary accusation of high crime and misdemeanor against a coordinate branch of the government under the impeach power the house refuse to hear a single suggestion even in regard to the correct mode of proceeding but without a moment 's delay pass the accusatory resolution under the pressure of the previous question in the institution of a prosecution for any offense against the most humble citizen -- and i claim for myself no greater rights than he enjoy -- the constitution of the united state and of the several state require that he shall be inform in the very beginning of the nature and cause of the accusation against he in order to enable he to prepare for he defense there be other principle which i might enumerate not less sacred present a impenetrable shield to protect every citizen falsely charge with a criminal offense these have be violate in the prosecution institute by the house of representative against the executive branch of the government shall the president alone be deprive of the protection of these great principle which prevail in every land where a ray of liberty penetrate the gloom of despotism shall the executive alone be deprive of rights which all he fellow-citizen enjoy the whole proceeding against he justify the fear of those wise and great man who before the constitution be adopt by the state apprehend that the tendency of the government be to the aggrandizement of the legislative at the expense of the executive and judicial department i again declare emphatically that i make this protest for no reason personal to myself and i do it with perfect respect for the house of representative in which i have the honor of serve as a member for five successive term i have live long in this goodly land and have enjoy all the office and honor which my country could bestow amid all the political storm through which i have pass the present be the first attempt which have ever be make to my knowledge to assail my personal or official integrity and this as the time be approach when i shall voluntarily retire from the service of my country i feel proudly conscious that there be no public act of my life which will not bear the strictest scrutiny i defy all investigation nothing but the basest perjury can sully my good name i do not fear even this because i cherish a humble confidence that the gracious be who have hitherto defend and protect I against the shaft of falsehood and malice will not desert I now when i have become old and gray head i can declare before god and my country that no human being -lrb- with a exception scarcely worthy of notice -rrb- have at any period of my life dare to approach I with a corrupt or dishonorable proposition and until recent development it have never enter into my imagination that any person even in the storm of exasperated political excitement would charge I in the most remote degree with have make such a proposition to any human be i may now however exclaim in the language of complaint employ by my first and greatest predecessor that i have be abuse in such exaggerated and indecent term as could scarcely be apply to a nero to a notorious defaulter or even to a common pickpocket i do therefore for the reason state and in the name of the people of the several state solemnly protest against these proceedings of the house of representative because they be in violation of the rights of the coordinate executive branch of the government and subversive of its constitutional independence because they be calculate to foster a band of interested parasite and informer ever ready for they own advantage to swear before _ ex parte _ committee to pretended private conversation between the president and themselves incapable from they nature of be disprove thus furnish material for harass he degrade he in the eye of the country and eventually should he be a weak or a timid man render he subservient to improper influence in order to avoid such persecution and annoyance because they tend to destroy that harmonious action for the common good which ought to be maintain and which i sincerely desire to cherish between coordinate branch of the government and finally because if unresisted they would establish a precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all my successor to whatever political party they might be attach jame buchanan washington _ June 22 1860 _ _ to the house of representative _ : in my message to the house of representative of the 28th march last i solemnly protest against the creation of a committee at the head of which be place my accuser for the purpose of investigate whether the president have by money patronage or other improper means seek to influence the action of congress or any committee thereof for or against the passage of any law appertaining to the rights of any state or territory i protest against this because it be destitute of any specification because it refer to no particular act to enable the president to prepare for he defense because it deprive he of the constitutional guard which in common with every citizen of the united state he possess for he protection and because it assail he constitutional independence as a coordinate branch of the government there be a enlighten justice as well as a beautiful symmetry in every part of the constitution this be conspicuously manifest in regard to impeachment the house of representative possess the sole power of impeachment the senate the sole power to try all impeachment and the impeachable offens be treason bribery or other high crime or misdemeanor the practice of the house from the earliest time have be in accordance with its own dignity the rights of the accuse and the demand of justice at the commencement of each judicial investigation which might lead to a impeachment specific charge be always prefer the accuse have a opportunity of cross-examine the witness and he be place in full possession of the precise nature of the offense which he have to meet a impartial and elevated standing committee be charge with this investigation upon which no member inspire with the ancient sense of honor and justice would have serve have he ever express a opinion against the accuse until the present occasion it be never deem proper to transform the accuser into the judge and to confer upon he the selection of he own committee the charge make against I in vague and general term be of such a false and atrocious character that i do not entertain a moment 's apprehension for the result they be abhorrent to every principle instil into I from my youth and every practice of my life and i do not believe it possible that the man exist who would so basely perjure himself as to swear to the truth of any such accusation in this conviction i be inform i have not be mistake in my former protest therefore i truly and emphatically declare that it be make for no reason personal to myself but because the proceedings of the house be in violation of the rights of the coordinate executive branch of the government subversive of its constitutional independence and if unresisted would establish a precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all my successor notwithstanding all this if the committee have not transcend the authority confer upon it by the resolution of the house of representative broad and general as this be i should have remain silent upon the subject what i now charge be that they have act as though they possess unlimited power and without any warrant whatever in the resolution under which they be appoint have pursue a course not merely at war with the constitutional rights of the executive but tend to degrade the presidential office itself to such a degree as to render it unworthy of the acceptance of any man of honor or principle the resolution of the house so far as it be accusatory of the president be confine to a inquiry whether he have use corrupt or improper means to influence the action of congress or any of its committee on legislative measure pend before they -- nothing more nothing less i have not learn through the newspaper or in any other mode that the committee have touch the other accusatory branch of the resolution charge the president with a violation of duty in fail to execute some law or law this branch of the resolution be therefore out of the question by what authority then have the committee undertake to investigate the course of the president in regard to the convention which frame the lecompton constitution by what authority have they undertake to pry into we foreign relation for the purpose of assail he on account of the instruction give by the secretary of state to we minister in mexico relative to the tehuantepec route by what authority have they inquire into the cause of removal from office and this from the party themselves remove with a view to prejudice he character notwithstanding this power of removal belong exclusively to the president under the constitution be so decide by the first congress in the year 1789 and have accordingly ever since be exercise there be in the resolution no pretext of authority for the committee to investigate the question of the printing of the post-office blank nor be it to be suppose that the house if ask would have grant such a authority because this question have be previously commit to two other committee -- one in the senate and the other in the house notwithstanding this absolute want of power the committee rush into this investigation in advance of all other subject the committee proceed for month from march 22 1860 to examine _ ex parte _ and without any notice to myself into every subject which could possibly affect my character interested and vindictive witness be summon and examine before they and the first and only information of they testimony which in almost every instance i receive be obtain from the publication of such portion of it as could injuriously affect myself in the new york journal it matter not that these statement be so far as i have learn disprove by the most respectable witness who happen to be on the spot the telegraph be silent respect these contradiction it be a secret committee in regard to the testimony in my defense but it be public in regard to all the testimony which could by possibility reflect on my character the poison be leave to produce its effect upon the public mind whilst the antidote be carefully withhold in they examination the committee violate the most sacred and honorable confidence exist among man private correspondence which a truly honorable man would never even entertain a distant thought of divulge be drag to light different person in official and confidential relation with myself and with whom it be suppose i might have hold conversation the revelation of which would do I injury be examine even member of the senate and member of my own cabinet both my constitutional adviser be call upon to testify for the purpose of discover something if possible to my discredit the distribution of the patronage of the government be by far the most disagreeable duty of the president applicant be so numerous and they application be press with such eagerness by they friend both in and out of congress that the selection of one for any desirable office give offense to many disappointed applicant remove officer and those who for any cause real or imaginary have become hostile to the administration present themselves or be invite by a summons to appear before the committee these be the most dangerous witness even with the best intention they be so influence by prejudice and disappointment that they almost inevitably discolor truth they swear to they own version of private conversation with the president without the possibility of contradiction he lip be seal and he be leave at they mercy he can not as a coordinate branch of the government appear before a committee of investigation to contradict the oath of such witness every coward know that he can employ insulting language against the president with impunity and every false or prejudiced witness can attempt to swear away he character before such a committee without the fear of contradiction thus for month whilst do my best at one end of the avenue to perform my high and responsible duty to the country have there be a committee of the house of representative in session at the other end of the avenue spread a drag net without the shadow of authority from the house over the whole union to catch any disappointed man willing to malign my character and all this in secret conclave the lion 's mouth at venice into which secret denunciation be drop be a apt illustration of the covode committee the star-chamber tyrannical and odious as it be never proceed in such a manner for century there have be nothing like it in any civilized country except the revolutionary tribunal of france in the day of robespierre now i undertake to state and to prove that should the proceedings of the committee be sanction by the house and become a precedent for future time the balance of the constitution will be entirely upset and there will no longer remain the three coordinate and independent branch of the government -- legislative executive and judicial the worst fear of the patriot and statesman who frame the constitution in regard to the usurpation of the legislative on the executive and judicial branch will then be realize in the language of mr madison speak on this very subject in the forty-eighth number of the federalist : in a representative republic where the executive magistracy be carefully limit both in the extent and duration of its power and where the legislative power be exercise by a assembly which be inspire by a suppose influence over the people with a intrepid confidence in its own strength which be sufficiently numerous to feel all the passion which actuate a multitude yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursue the object of its passion by means which reason prescribe it be against the enterprising ambition of this department that the people ought to indulge all they jealousy and exhaust all they precaution and in the expressive and pointed language of mr jefferson when speaking of the tendency of the legislative branch of government to usurp the rights of the weaker branch : the concentrate these in the same hand be precisely the definition of despotic government it will be no alleviation that these power will be exercise by a plurality of hand and not by a single one one hundred and seventy-three despot would surely be as oppressive as one let those who doubt it turn they eye on the republic of venice as little will it avail we that they be choose by ourselves a elective despotism be not the government we fight for but one which should not only be found on free principle but in which the power of government should be so divide and balance among several body of magistracy as that no one could transcend they legal limit without be effectually check and control by the other should the proceedings of the covode committee become a precedent both the letter and spirit of the constitution will be violate one of the three massive column on which the whole superstructure rest will be break down instead of the executive be a coordinate it will become a subordinate branch of the government the presidential office will be drag into the dust the house of representative will then have render the executive almost necessarily subservient to its wish instead of be independent how be it possible that two power in the state can be coordinate and independent of each other if the one claim and exercise the power to reprove and to censure all the official act and all the private conversation of the other and this upon _ ex parte _ testimony before a secret inquisitorial committee in short to assume a general censorship over the other the idea be as absurd in public as it would be in private life should the president attempt to assert and maintain he own independence future covode committee may dragoon he into submission by collect the host of disappointed office hunter remove officer and those who desire to live upon the public treasury which must follow in the wake of every administration and they in secret conclave will swear away he reputation under such circumstance he must be a very bold man should he not surrender at discretion and consent to exercise he authority accord to the will of those invest with this terrific power the sovereign people of the several state have elect he to the highest and most honorable office in the world he be they only direct representative in the government by they constitution they have make he commander in chief of they army and navy he represent they in they intercourse with foreign nation clothe with they dignity and authority he occupy a proud position before all nation civilized and savage with the consent of the senate he appoint all the important officer of the government he exercise the veto power and to that extent control the legislation of congress for the performance of these high duty he be responsible to the people of the several state and not in any degree to the house of representative shall he surrender these high power confer upon he as the representative of the american people for they benefit to the house to be exercise under they overshadow influence and control shall he alone of all the citizen of the united state be deny a fair trial shall he alone not be inform of the nature and cause of the accusation against he shall he alone not be confront with the witness against he shall the house of representative usurp the power of the senate proceed to try the president through the agency of a secret committee of the body where it be impossible he can make any defense and then without afford he a opportunity of be hear pronounce a judgment of censure against he the very same rule might be apply for the very same reason to every judge of every court of the united state from what part of the constitution be this terrible secret inquisitorial power derive no such express power exist from which of the enumerated power can it be infer it be true the house can not pronounce the formal judgment against he of removal from office but they can by they judgment of censure asperse he reputation and thus to the extent of they influence render the office contemptible a example be at hand of the reckless manner in which this power of censure can be employ in high party time the house on a recent occasion have attempt to degrade the president by adopt the resolution of mr john sherman declare that he in conjunction with the secretary of the navy by receive and consider the party relation of bidder for contract and the effect of award contract upon pend election have set a example dangerous to the public safety and deserving the reproof of this house it will scarcely be credit that the sole pretext for this vote of censure be the simple fact that in dispose of the numerous letter of every imaginable character which i daily receive i have in the usual course of business refer a letter from colonel patterson of philadelphium in relation to a contract to the attention of the secretary of the navy the head of the appropriate department without express or intimate any opinion whatever on the subject and to make the matter if possible still plainer the secretary have inform the committee that _ the president do not in any manner interfere in this case nor have he in any other case of contract since i have be in the department _ the absence of all proof to sustain this attempt to degrade the president whilst it manifest the venom of the shaft aim at he have destroy the vigor of the bow to return after this digression : should the house by the institution of covode committee vote of censure and other device to harass the president reduce he to subservience to they will and render he they creature then the well-balanced government which we father frame will be annihilate this conflict have already be commence in earnest by the house against the executive a bad precedent rarely if ever die it will i fear be pursue in the time of my successor no matter what may be they political character should secret committee be appoint with unlimited authority to range over all the word and action and if possible the very thought of the president with a view to discover something in he past life prejudicial to he character from parasite and informer this would be a ordeal which scarcely any mere man since the fall could endure it would be to subject he to a reign of terror from which the stoutest and purest heart might shrink i have pass triumphantly through this ordeal my vindication be complete the committee have report no resolution look to a impeachment against I no resolution of censure not even a resolution point out any abuse in any of the executive department of the government to be correct by legislation this be the highest commendation which could be bestow on the head of these department the sovereign people of the state will however i trust save my successor whoever they may be from any such ordeal they be frank bold and honest they detest delator and informer i therefore in the name and as the representative of this great people and stand upon the rampart of the constitution which they have ordain and establish do solemnly protest against these unprecedented and unconstitutional proceedings there be still another committee raise by the house on the 6th march last on motion of mr hoard to which i have not the slightest objection the resolution create it be confine to specific charge which i have ever since be ready and willing to meet i have at all time invite and defy fair investigation upon constitutional principle i have receive no notice that this committee have ever proceed to the investigation why should the house of representative desire to encroach on the other department of the government they rightful power be ample for every legitimate purpose they be the impeach body in they legislative capacity it be they most wise and wholesome prerogative to institute rigid examination into the manner in which all department of the government be conduct with a view to reform abuse to promote economy and to improve every branch of administration should they find reason to believe in the course of they examination that any grave offense have be commit by the president or any officer of the government render it proper in they judgment to resort to impeachment they course would be plain they would then transfer the question from they legislative to they accusatory jurisdiction and take care that in all the preliminary judicial proceedings preparatory to the vote of article of impeachment the accuse should enjoy the benefit of cross-examine the witness and all the other safeguard with which the constitution surround every american citizen if in a legislative investigation it should appear that the public interest require the removal of any officer of the government no president have ever exist who after give he a fair hearing would hesitate to apply the remedy this i take to be the ancient and well-established practice a adherence to it will best promote the harmony and the dignity of the intercourse between the coordinate branch of the government and render we all more respectable both in the eye of we own countryman and of foreign nation jame buchanan proclamation by the president of the united state of america a proclamation whereas a extraordinary occasion have occur render it necessary and proper that the senate of the united state shall be convene to receive and act upon such communication as have be or may be make to it on the part of the executive : now therefore i james buchanan president of the united state do issue this my proclamation declare that a extraordinary occasion require the senate of the united state to convene for the transaction of business at the capitol in the city of washington on the 26th day of June instant at 12 o'clock at noon of that day of which all who shall then be entitle to act as member of that body be hereby require to take notice -lrb- seal -rrb- give under my hand and the seal of the united state at washington this 25th day of June a d 1860 and of the independence of the united state the eighty-fourth jame buchanan by the president : lewi cass _ secretary of state _ fourth annual message washington city _ December 3 1860 _ _ fellow-citizen of the senate and house of representative _ : throughout the year since we last meeting the country have be eminently prosperous in all its material interest the general health have be excellent we harvest have be abundant and plenty smile throughout the land we commerce and manufacture have be prosecute with energy and industry and have yield fair and ample return in short no nation in the tide of time have ever present a spectacle of greater material prosperity than we have do until within a very recent period why be it then that discontent now so extensively prevail and the union of the state which be the source of all these blessing be threaten with destruction the long-continued and intemperate interference of the northern people with the question of slavery in the southern state have at length produce its natural effect the different section of the union be now array against each other and the time have arrive so much dread by the father of he country when hostile geographical party have be form i have long foresee and often forewarned my countryman of the now impending danger this do not proceed solely from the claim on the part of congress or the territorial legislature to exclude slavery from the territory nor from the effort of different state to defeat the execution of the fugitive-slave law all or any of these evil might have be endure by the south without danger to the union -lrb- as other have be -rrb- in the hope that time and reflection might apply the remedy the immediate peril arise not so much from these cause as from the fact that the incessant and violent agitation of the slavery question throughout the north for the last quarter of a century have at length produce its malign influence on the slave and inspire they with vague notion of freedom hence a sense of security no longer exist around the family altar this feeling of peace at home have give place to apprehension of servile insurrection many a matron throughout the south retire at night in dread of what may befall herself and child before the morning should this apprehension of domestic danger whether real or imaginary extend and intensify itself until it shall pervade the mass of the southern people then disunion will become inevitable self-preservation be the first law of nature and have be implant in the heart of man by he creator for the wisest purpose and no political union however fraught with blessing and benefit in all other respects can long continue if the necessary consequence be to render the home and the fireside of nearly half the party to it habitually and hopelessly insecure sooner or later the bond of such a union must be sever it be my conviction that this fatal period have not yet arrive and my prayer to god be that he would preserve the constitution and the union throughout all generation but let we take warning in time and remove the cause of danger it can not be deny that for five and twenty year the agitation at the north against slavery have be incessant in 1835 pictorial handbill and inflammatory appeal be circulate extensively throughout the south of a character to excite the passion of the slave and in the language of general jackson to stimulate they to insurrection and produce all the horror of a servile war this agitation have ever since be continue by the public press by the proceedings of state and county convention and by abolition sermon and lecture the time of congress have be occupy in violent speech on this never-ending subject and appeal in pamphlet and other form indorse by distinguished name have be send forth from this central point and spread broadcast over the union how easy would it be for the american people to settle the slavery question forever and to restore peace and harmony to this distract country they and they alone can do it all that be necessary to accomplish the object and all for which the slave state have ever contend be to be let alone and permit to manage they domestic institution in they own way as sovereign state they and they alone be responsible before god and the world for the slavery exist among they for this the people of the north be not more responsible and have no more right to interfere than with similar institution in russium or in brazil upon they good sense and patriotic forbearance i confess i still greatly rely without they aid it be beyond the power of any president no matter what may be he own political proclivity to restore peace and harmony among the state wisely limit and restrain as be he power under we constitution and law he alone can accomplish but little for good or for evil on such a momentous question and this bring I to observe that the election of any one of we fellow-citizen to the office of president do not of itself afford just cause for dissolve the union this be more especially true if he election have be effect by a mere plurality and not a majority of the people and have result from transient and temporary cause which may probably never again occur in order to justify a resort to revolutionary resistance the federal government must be guilty of a deliberate palpable and dangerous exercise of power not grant by the constitution the late presidential election however have be hold in strict conformity with its express provision how then can the result justify a revolution to destroy this very constitution reason justice a regard for the constitution all require that we shall wait for some overt and dangerous act on the part of the president elect before resort to such a remedy it be say however that the antecedent of the president elect have be sufficient to justify the fear of the south that he will attempt to invade they constitutional rights but be such apprehension of contingent danger in the future sufficient to justify the immediate destruction of the noblest system of government ever devise by mortal from the very nature of he office and its high responsibility he must necessarily be conservative the stern duty of administer the vast and complicated concern of this government afford in itself a guaranty that he will not attempt any violation of a clear constitutional right after all he be no more than the chief executive officer of the government he province be not to make but to execute the law and it be a remarkable fact in we history that notwithstanding the repeat effort of the antislavery party no single act have ever pass congress unless we may possibly except the missourus compromise impair in the slightest degree the rights of the south to they property in slave and it may also be observe judge from present indication that no probability exist of the passage of such a act by a majority of both house either in the present or the next congress surely under these circumstance we ought to be restrain from present action by the precept of he who speak as man never speak that sufficient unto the day be the evil thereof the day of evil may never come unless we shall rashly bring it upon ourselves it be allege as one cause for immediate secession that the southern state be deny equal rights with the other state in the common territory but by what authority be these deny not by congress which have never pass and i believe never will pass any act to exclude slavery from these territory and certainly not by the supreme court which have solemnly decide that slave be property and like all other property they owner have a right to take they into the common territory and hold they there under the protection of the constitution so far then as congress be concern the objection be not to anything they have already do but to what they may do hereafter it will surely be admit that this apprehension of future danger be no good reason for a immediate dissolution of the union it be true that the territorial legislature of kansa on the 23d February 1860 pass in great haste a act over the veto of the governor declare that slavery be and shall be forever prohibit in this territory such a act however plainly violate the rights of property secure by the constitution will surely be declare void by the judiciary whenever it shall be present in a legal form only three day after my inauguration the supreme court of the united state solemnly adjudge that this power do not exist in a territorial legislature yet such have be the factious temper of the time that the correctness of this decision have be extensively impugn before the people and the question have give rise to angry political conflict throughout the country those who have appeal from this judgment of we highest constitutional tribunal to popular assembly would if they could invest a territorial legislature with power to annul the sacred rights of property this power congress be expressly forbid by the federal constitution to exercise every state legislature in the union be forbid by its own constitution to exercise it it can not be exercise in any state except by the people in they highest sovereign capacity when frame or amend they state constitution in like manner it can only be exercise by the people of a territory represent in a convention of delegate for the purpose of frame a constitution preparatory to admission as a state into the union then and not until then be they invest with power to decide the question whether slavery shall or shall not exist within they limit this be a act of sovereign authority and not of subordinate territorial legislation be it otherwise then indeed would the equality of the state in the territory be destroy and the rights of property in slave would depend not upon the guaranty of the constitution but upon the shift majority of a irresponsible territorial legislature such a doctrine from its intrinsic unsoundness can not long influence any considerable portion of we people much less can it afford a good reason for a dissolution of the union the most palpable violation of constitutional duty which have yet be commit consist in the act of different state legislature to defeat the execution of the fugitive-slave law it ought to be remembered however that for these act neither congress nor any president can justly be hold responsible have be pass in violation of the federal constitution they be therefore null and void all the court both state and national before whom the question have arise have from the beginning declare the fugitive-slave law to be constitutional the single exception be that of a state court in wisconsin and this have not only be reverse by the proper appellate tribunal but have meet with such universal reprobation that there can be no danger from it as a precedent the validity of this law have be establish over and over again by the supreme court of the united state with perfect unanimity it be found upon a express provision of the constitution require that fugitive slave who escape from service in one state to another shall be deliver up to they master without this provision it be a well-known historical fact that the constitution itself could never have be adopt by the convention in one form or other under the act of 1793 and 1850 both be substantially the same the fugitive-slave law have be the law of the land from the day of washington until the present moment here then a clear case be present in which it will be the duty of the next president as it have be my own to act with vigor in execute this supreme law against the conflict enactment of state legislature should he fail in the performance of this high duty he will then have manifest a disregard of the constitution and law to the great injury of the people of nearly one-half of the state of the union but be we to presume in advance that he will thus violate he duty this would be at war with every principle of justice and of christian charity let we wait for the overt act the fugitive-slave law have be carry into execution in every contest case since the commencement of the present administration though often it be to be regret with great loss and inconvenience to the master and with considerable expense to the government let we trust that the state legislature will repeal they unconstitutional and obnoxious enactment unless this shall be do without unnecessary delay it be impossible for any human power to save the union the southern state stand on the basis of the constitution have a right to demand this act of justice from the state of the north should it be refuse then the constitution to which all the state be party will have be willfully violate by one portion of they in a provision essential to the domestic security and happiness of the remainder in that event the injured state after have first use all peaceful and constitutional means to obtain redress would be justify in revolutionary resistance to the government of the union i have purposely confine my remark to revolutionary resistance because it have be claim within the last few year that any state whenever this shall be its sovereign will and pleasure may secede from the union in accordance with the constitution and without any violation of the constitutional rights of the other member of the confederacy that as each become party to the union by the vote of its own people assemble in convention so any one of they may retire from the union in a similar manner by the vote of such a convention in order to justify secession as a constitutional remedy it must be on the principle that the federal government be a mere voluntary association of state to be dissolve at pleasure by any one of the contracting party if this be so the confederacy be a rope of sand to be penetrate and dissolve by the first adverse wave of public opinion in any of the state in this manner we thirty-three state may resolve themselves into as many petty jarring and hostile republic each one retire from the union without responsibility whenever any sudden excitement might impel they to such a course by this process a union might be entirely break into fragment in a few week which cost we forefather many year of toil privation and blood to establish such a principle be wholly inconsistent with the history as well as the character of the federal constitution after it be frame with the greatest deliberation and care it be submit to convention of the people of the several state for ratification its provision be discuss at length in these body compose of the first man of the country its opponent contend that it confer power upon the federal government dangerous to the rights of the state whilst its advocate maintain that under a fair construction of the instrument there be no foundation for such apprehension in that mighty struggle between the first intellect of this or any other country it never occur to any individual either among its opponent or advocate to assert or even to intimate that they effort be all vain labor because the moment that any state feel herself aggrieve she might secede from the union what a crush argument would this have prove against those who dread that the rights of the state would be endanger by the constitution the truth be that it be not until many year after the origin of the federal government that such a proposition be first advance it be then meet and refute by the conclusive argument of general jackson who in he message of the 16th of January 1833 transmit the nullify ordinance of south carolina to congress employ the follow language : the right of the people of a single state to absolve themselves at will and without the consent of the other state from they most solemn obligation and hazard the liberty and happiness of the million compose this union can not be acknowledge such authority be believe to be utterly repugnant both to the principle upon which the general government be constitute and to the object which it be expressly form to attain it be not pretend that any clause in the constitution give countenance to such a theory it be altogether found upon inference not from any language contain in the instrument itself but from the sovereign character of the several state by which it be ratify but be it beyond the power of a state like a individual to yield a portion of its sovereign rights to secure the remainder in the language of mr madison who have be call the father of the constitution -- it be form by the state that be by the people in each of the state act in they highest sovereign capacity and form consequently by the same authority which form the state constitution nor be the government of the united state create by the constitution less a government in the strict sense of the term within the sphere of its power than the government create by the constitution of the state be within they several sphere it be like they organize into legislative executive and judiciary department it operate like they directly on person and thing and like they it have at command a physical force for execute the power commit to it it be intend to be perpetual and not to be annul at the pleasure of any one of the contracting party the old article of confederation be entitle article of confederation and perpetual union between the state and by the thirteenth article it be expressly declare that the article of this confederation shall be inviolably observe by every state and the union shall be perpetual the preamble to the constitution of the united state have express reference to the article of confederation recite that it be establish in order to form a more perfect union and yet it be contend that this more perfect union do not include the essential attribute of perpetuity but that the union be design to be perpetual appear conclusively from the nature and extent of the power confer by the constitution on the federal government these power embrace the very highest attribute of national sovereignty they place both the sword and the purse under its control congress have power to make war and to make peace to raise and support army and navy and to conclude treaty with foreign government it be invest with the power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof and to regulate commerce with foreign nation and among the several state it be not necessary to enumerate the other high power which have be confer upon the federal government in order to carry the enumerated power into effect congress possess the exclusive right to lay and collect duty on import and in common with the state to lay and collect all other tax but the constitution have not only confer these high power upon congress but it have adopt effectual means to restrain the state from interfere with they exercise for that purpose it have in strong prohibitory language expressly declare that -- no state shall enter into any treaty alliance or confederation grant letter of marque and reprisal coin money emit bill of credit make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debt pass any bill of attainder _ ex post facto _ law or law impair the obligation of contract moreover -- no state shall without the consent of the congress lay any impost or duty on import or export except what may be absolutely necessary for execute its inspection law and if they exceed this amount the excess shall belong to the united state and -- no state shall without the consent of congress lay any duty of tonnage keep troops or ship of war in time of peace enter into any agreement or compact with another state or with a foreign power or engage in war unless actually invade or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay in order still further to secure the uninterrupted exercise of these high power against state interposition it be provide : that -- this constitution and the law of the united state which shall be make in pursuance thereof and all treaty make or which shall be make under the authority of the united state shall be the supreme law of the land and the judge in every state shall be bind thereby anything in the constitution or law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding the solemn sanction of religion have be superad to the obligation of official duty and all senator and representative of the united state all member of state legislature and all executive and judicial officer both of the united state and of the several state shall be bind by oath or affirmation to support this constitution in order to carry into effect these power the constitution have establish a perfect government in all its form -- legislative executive and judicial and this government to the extent of its power act directly upon the individual citizen of every state and execute its own decree by the agency of its own officer in this respect it differ entirely from the government under the old confederation which be confine to make requisition on the state in they sovereign character this leave it in the discretion of each whether to obey or to refuse and they often decline to comply with such requisition it thus become necessary for the purpose of remove this barrier and in order to form a more perfect union to establish a government which could act directly upon the people and execute its own law without the intermediate agency of the state this have be accomplish by the constitution of the united state in short the government create by the constitution and derive its authority from the sovereign people of each of the several state have precisely the same right to exercise its power over the people of all these state in the enumerated case that each one of they possess over subject not delegate to the united state but reserve to the state respectively or to the people to the extent of the delegated power the constitution of the united state be as much a part of the constitution of each state and be as binding upon its people as though it have be textually insert therein this government therefore be a great and powerful government invest with all the attribute of sovereignty over the special subject to which its authority extend its framer never intend to implant in its bosom the seed of its own destruction nor be they at its creation guilty of the absurdity of provide for its own dissolution it be not intend by its framer to be the baseless fabric of a vision which at the touch of the enchanter would vanish into thin air but a substantial and mighty fabric capable of resist the slow decay of time and of defy the storm of age indeed well may the jealous patriot of that day have indulge fear that a government of such high power might violate the reserved rights of the state and wisely do they adopt the rule of a strict construction of these power to prevent the danger but they do not fear nor have they any reason to imagine that the constitution would ever be so interpret as to enable any state by she own act and without the consent of she sister state to discharge she people from all or any of they federal obligation it may be ask then be the people of the state without redress against the tyranny and oppression of the federal government by no mean the right of resistance on the part of the govern against the oppression of they government can not be deny it exist independently of all constitution and have be exercise at all period of the world 's history under it old government have be destroy and new one have take they place it be embody in strong and express language in we own declaration of independence but the distinction must ever be observe that this be revolution against a established government and not a voluntary secession from it by virtue of a inherent constitutional right in short let we look the danger fairly in the face secession be neither more nor less than revolution it may or it may not be a justifiable revolution but still it be revolution what in the meantime be the responsibility and true position of the executive he be bind by solemn oath before god and the country to take care that the law be faithfully execute and from this obligation he can not be absolved by any human power but what if the performance of this duty in whole or in part have be render impracticable by event over which he could have exercise no control such at the present moment be the case throughout the state of south carolina so far as the law of the united state to secure the administration of justice by means of the federal judiciary be concern all the federal officer within its limit through whose agency alone these law can be carry into execution have already resign we no longer have a district judge a district attorney or a marshal in south carolina in fact the whole machinery of the federal government necessary for the distribution of remedial justice among the people have be demolish and it would be difficult if not impossible to replace it the only act of congress on the statute book bearing upon this subject be those of February 28 1795 and march 3 1807 these authorize the president after he shall have ascertain that the marshal with he _ posse comitatus _ be unable to execute civil or criminal process in any particular case to call forth the militia and employ the army and navy to aid he in perform this service have first by proclamation command the insurgent to disperse and retire peaceably to they respective abode within a limited time this duty can not by possibility be perform in a state where no judicial authority exist to issue process and where there be no marshal to execute it and where even if there be such a officer the entire population would constitute one solid combination to resist he the bare enumeration of these provision prove how inadequate they be without further legislation to overcome a unite opposition in a single state not to speak of other state who may place themselves in a similar attitude congress alone have power to decide whether the present law can or can not be amend so as to carry out more effectually the object of the constitution the same insuperable obstacle do not lie in the way of execute the law for the collection of the custom the revenue still continue to be collect as heretofore at the custom-house in charleston and should the collector unfortunately resign a successor may be appoint to perform this duty then in regard to the property of the united state in south carolina this have be purchase for a fair equivalent by the consent of the legislature of the state for the erection of fort magazine arsenal etc and over these the authority to exercise exclusive legislation have be expressly grant by the constitution to congress it be not believe that any attempt will be make to expel the united state from this property by force but if in this i should prove to be mistake the officer in command of the fort have receive order to act strictly on the defensive in such a contingency the responsibility for consequence would rightfully rest upon the head of the assailant apart from the execution of the law so far as this may be practicable the executive have no authority to decide what shall be the relation between the federal government and south carolina he have be invest with no such discretion he possess no power to change the relation heretofore exist between they much less to acknowledge the independence of that state this would be to invest a mere executive officer with the power of recognize the dissolution of the confederacy among we thirty-three sovereign state it bear no resemblance to the recognition of a foreign _ de facto _ government involve no such responsibility any attempt to do this would on he part be a naked act of usurpation it be therefore my duty to submit to congress the whole question in all its bearing the course of event be so rapidly hasten forward that the emergency may soon arise when you may be call upon to decide the momentous question whether you possess the power by force of arm to compel a state to remain in the union i should feel myself recreant to my duty be i not to express a opinion on this important subject the question fairly state be have the constitution delegate to congress the power to coerce a state into submission which be attempt to withdraw or have actually withdraw from the confederacy if answer in the affirmative it must be on the principle that the power have be confer upon congress to declare and to make war against a state after much serious reflection i have arrive at the conclusion that no such power have be delegate to congress or to any other department of the federal government it be manifest upon a inspection of the constitution that this be not among the specific and enumerated power grant to congress and it be equally apparent that its exercise be not necessary and proper for carry into execution any one of these power so far from this power have be delegate to congress it be expressly refuse by the convention which frame the constitution it appear from the proceedings of that body that on the 31st may 1787 the clause _ authorize a exertion of the force of the whole against a delinquent state _ come up for consideration mr madison oppose it in a brief but powerful speech from which i shall extract but a single sentence he observe : the use of force against a state would look more like a declaration of war than a infliction of punishment and would probably be consider by the party attack as a dissolution of all previous compact by which it might be bind upon he motion the clause be unanimously postpone and be never i believe again present soon afterwards on the 8th June 1787 when incidentally advert to the subject he say : any government for the united state form on the suppose practicability of use force against the unconstitutional proceedings of the state would prove as visionary and fallacious as the government of congress evidently mean the then exist congress of the old confederation without descend to particulars it may be safely assert that the power to make war against a state be at variance with the whole spirit and intent of the constitution suppose such a war should result in the conquest of a state how be we to govern it afterwards shall we hold it as a province and govern it by despotic power in the nature of thing we could not by physical force control the will of the people and compel they to elect senator and representative to congress and to perform all the other duty depend upon they own volition and require from the free citizen of a free state as a constituent member of the confederacy but if we possess this power would it be wise to exercise it under exist circumstance the object would doubtless be to preserve the union war would not only present the most effectual means of destroy it but would vanish all hope of its peaceable reconstruction besides in the fraternal conflict a vast amount of blood and treasure would be expend render future reconciliation between the state impossible in the meantime who can foretell what would be the suffering and privation of the people during its existence the fact be that we union rest upon public opinion and can never be cement by the blood of its citizen shed in civil war if it can not live in the affection of the people it must one day perish congress possess many means of preserve it by conciliation but the sword be not place in they hand to preserve it by force but may i be permit solemnly to invoke my countryman to pause and deliberate before they determine to destroy this the grandest temple which have ever be dedicate to human freedom since the world begin it have be consecrate by the blood of we father by the glory of the past and by the hope of the future the union have already make we the most prosperous and ere long will if preserve render we the most powerful nation on the face of the earth in every foreign region of the globe the title of american citizen be hold in the highest respect and when pronounce in a foreign land it cause the heart of we countryman to swell with honest pride surely when we reach the brink of the yawning abyss we shall recoil with horror from the last fatal plunge by such a dread catastrophe the hope of the friend of freedom throughout the world would be destroy and a long night of leaden despotism would enshroud the nation we example for more than eighty year would not only be lose but it would be quote as a conclusive proof that man be unfit for self-government it be not every wrong -- nay it be not every grievous wrong -- which can justify a resort to such a fearful alternative this ought to be the last desperate remedy of a despairing people after every other constitutional means of conciliation have be exhaust we should reflect that under this free government there be a incessant ebb and flow in public opinion the slavery question like everything human will have its day i firmly believe that it have reach and pass the culminate point but if in the midst of the exist excitement the union shall perish the evil may then become irreparable congress can contribute much to avert it by propose and recommend to the legislature of the several state the remedy for exist evil which the constitution have itself provide for its own preservation this have be try at different critical period of we history and always with eminent success it be to be find in the fifth article provide for its own amendment under this article amendment have be propose by two-third of both house of congress and have be ratify by the legislature of three-fourth of the several state and have consequently become part of the constitution to this process the country be indebted for the clause prohibit congress from pass any law respect a establishment of religion or abridge the freedom of speech or of the press or of the right of petition to this we be also indebted for the bill of rights which secure the people against any abuse of power by the federal government such be the apprehension justly entertain by the friend of state rights at that period as to have render it extremely doubtful whether the constitution could have long survive without those amendment again the constitution be amend by the same process after the election of president jefferson by the house of representative in February 1803 this amendment be render necessary to prevent a recurrence of the danger which have seriously threaten the existence of the government during the pendency of that election the article for its own amendment be intend to secure the amicable adjustment of conflict constitutional question like the present which might arise between the government of the state and that of the united state this appear from contemporaneous history in this connection i shall merely call attention to a few sentence in mr madison 's justly celebrated report in 1799 to the legislature of virginium in this he ably and conclusively defend the resolution of the preceding legislature against the stricture of several other state legislature these be mainly found upon the protest of the virginia legislature against the alien and sedition act as palpable and alarming infraction of the constitution in point out the peaceful and constitutional remedy -- and he refer to none other -- to which the state be authorize to resort on such occasion he conclude by say that -- the legislature of the state might have make a direct representation to congress with a view to obtain a rescind of the two offensive act or they might have represent to they respective senator in congress they wish that two-third thereof would propose a explanatory amendment to the constitution or two-third of themselves if such have be they option might by a application to congress have obtain a convention for the same object this be the very course which i earnestly recommend in order to obtain a explanatory amendment of the constitution on the subject of slavery this might originate with congress or the state legislature as may be deem most advisable to attain the object the explanatory amendment might be confine to the final settlement of the true construction of the constitution on three special point : 1 a express recognition of the right of property in slave in the state where it now exist or may hereafter exist 2 the duty of protect this right in all the common territory throughout they territorial existence and until they shall be admit as state into the union with or without slavery as they constitution may prescribe 3 a like recognition of the right of the master to have he slave who have escape from one state to another restore and deliver up to he and of the validity of the fugitive-slave law enact for this purpose together with a declaration that all state law impair or defeat this right be violation of the constitution and be consequently null and void it may be object that this construction of the constitution have already be settle by the supreme court of the united state and what more ought to be require the answer be that a very large proportion of the people of the united state still contest the correctness of this decision and never will cease from agitation and admit its binding force until clearly establish by the people of the several state in they sovereign character such a explanatory amendment would it be believe forever terminate the exist dissension and restore peace and harmony among the state it ought not to be doubt that such a appeal to the arbitrament establish by the constitution itself would be receive with favor by all the state of the confederacy in any event it ought to be try in a spirit of conciliation before any of these state shall separate themselves from the union when i enter upon the duty of the presidential office the aspect neither of we foreign nor domestic affair be at all satisfactory we be involve in dangerous complication with several nation and two of we territory be in a state of revolution against the government a restoration of the african slave trade have numerous and powerful advocate unlawful military expedition be countenance by many of we citizen and be suffer in defiance of the effort of the government to escape from we shore for the purpose of make war upon the unoffending people of neighbor republic with whom we be at peace in addition to these and other difficulty we experience a revulsion in monetary affair soon after my advent to power of unexampled severity and of ruinous consequence to all the great interest of the country when we take a retrospect of what be then we condition and contrast this with its material prosperity at the time of the late presidential election we have abundant reason to return we grateful thanks to that merciful providence which have never forsake we as a nation in all we past trial we relation with great britain be of the most friendly character since the commencement of my administration the two dangerous question arise from the clayton and bulwer treaty and from the right of search claim by the british government have be amicably and honorably adjust the discordant construction of the clayton and bulwer treaty between the two government which at different period of the discussion bear a threatening aspect have result in a final settlement entirely satisfactory to this government in my last annual message i inform congress that the british government have not then complete treaty arrangement with the republic of hondura and nicaragua in pursuance of the understanding between the two government it be nevertheless confidently expect that this good work will ere long be accomplish this confident expectation have since be fulfil she britannic majesty conclude a treaty with hondura on the 28th November 1859 and with nicaragua on the 28th August 1860 relinquish the mosquito protectorate besides by the former the bay island be recognize as a part of the republic of hondura it may be observe that the stipulation of these treaty conform in every important particular to the amendment adopt by the senate of the united state to the treaty conclude at london on the 17th October 1856 between the two government it will be recollect that this treaty be reject by the british government because of its objection to the just and important amendment of the senate to the article relate to ruatan and the other island in the bay of hondura it must be a source of sincere satisfaction to all class of we fellow-citizen and especially to those engage in foreign commerce that the claim on the part of great britain forcibly to visit and search american merchant vessel on the high sea in time of peace have be abandon this be by far the most dangerous question to the peace of the two country which have exist since the war of 1812 whilst it remain open they might at any moment have be precipitate into a war this be render manifest by the exasperated state of public feeling throughout we entire country produce by the forcible search of american merchant vessel by british cruiser on the coast of cuba in the spring of 1858 the american people hail with general acclaim the order of the secretary of the navy to we naval force in the gulf of mexico to protect all vessel of the united state on the high sea from search or detention by the vessel of war of any other nation these order might have produce a immediate collision between the naval force of the two country this be most fortunately prevent by a appeal to the justice of great britain and to the law of nation as expound by she own most eminent jurist the only question of any importance which still remain open be the disputed title between the two government to the island of san juan in the vicinity of washington territory as this question be still under negotiation it be not deem advisable at the present moment to make any other allusion to the subject the recent visit of the prince of wale in a private character to the people of this country have prove to be a most auspicious event in its consequence it can not fail to increase the kindred and kindly feeling which i trust may ever actuate the government and people of both country in they political and social intercourse with each other with france we ancient and powerful ally we relation continue to be of the most friendly character a decision have recently be make by a french judicial tribunal with the approbation of the imperial government which can not fail to foster the sentiment of mutual regard that have so long exist between the two country under the french law no person can serve in the army of france unless he be a french citizen the law of france recognize the natural right of expatriation it follow as a necessary consequence that a frenchman by the fact of have become a citizen of the united state have change he allegiance and have lose he native character he can not therefore be compel to serve in the french army in case he should return to he native country these principle be announce in 1852 by the french minister of war and in two late case have be confirm by the french judiciary in these two native of france have be discharge from the french army because they have become american citizen to employ the language of we present minister to france who have render good service on this occasion i do not think we french naturalized fellow-citizen will hereafter experience much annoyance on this subject i venture to predict that the time be not far distant when the other continental power will adopt the same wise and just policy which have do so much honor to the enlighten government of the emperor in any event we government be bind to protect the rights of we naturalized citizen everywhere to the same extent as though they have draw they first breath in this country we can recognize no distinction between we native and naturalized citizen between the great empire of russium and the united state the mutual friendship and regard which have so long exist still continue to prevail and if possible to increase indeed we relation with that empire be all that we could desire we relation with spain be now of a more complicated though less dangerous character than they have be for many year we citizen have long hold and continue to hold numerous claim against the spanish government these have be ably urge for a series of year by we successive diplomatic representative at madrid but without obtain redress the spanish government finally agree to institute a joint commission for the adjustment of these claim and on the 5th day of march 1860 conclude a convention for this purpose with we present minister at madrid under this convention what have be denominate the cuban claim amount to $ 12863554 in which more than 100 of we fellow-citizen be interested be recognize and the spanish government agree to pay $ 100000 of this amount within three month follow the exchange of ratification the payment of the remain $ 2863554 be to await the decision of the commissioner for or against the _ amistad _ claim but in any event the balance be to be pay to the claimant either by spain or the united state these term i have every reason to know be highly satisfactory to the holder of the cuban claim indeed they have make a formal offer authorize the state department to settle these claim and to deduct the amount of the _ amistad _ claim from the sum which they be entitle to receive from spain this offer of course can not be accept all other claim of citizen of the united state against spain or the subject of the queen of spain against the united state include the _ amistad _ claim be by this convention refer to a board of commissioner in the usual form neither the validity of the _ amistad _ claim nor of any other claim against either party with the single exception of the cuban claim be recognize by the convention indeed the spanish government do not insist that the validity of the _ amistad _ claim should be thus recognize notwithstanding its payment have be recommend to congress by two of my predecessor as well as by myself and a appropriation for that purpose have pass the senate of the united state they be content that it should be submit to the board for examination and decision like the other claim both government be bind respectively to pay the amount award to the several claimant at such time and place as may be fix by and accord to the tenor of say award i transmit this convention to the senate for they constitutional action on the 3d of may 1860 and on the 27th of the succeed June they determine that they would not advise and consent to its ratification these proceedings place we relation with spain in a awkward and embarrassing position it be more than probable that the final adjustment of these claim will devolve upon my successor i reiterate the recommendation contain in my annual message of December 1858 and repeat in that of December 1859 in favor of the acquisition of cuba from spain by fair purchase i firmly believe that such a acquisition would contribute essentially to the well-being and prosperity of both country in all future time as well as prove the certain means of immediately abolish the african slave trade throughout the world i would not repeat this recommendation upon the present occasion if i believe that the transfer of cuba to the united state upon condition highly favorable to spain could justly tarnish the national honor of the proud and ancient spanish monarchy surely no person ever attribute to the first napoleon a disregard of the national honor of france for transfer louisiana to the united state for a fair equivalent both in money and commercial advantage with the emperor of austrium and the remain continental power of europe include that of the sultan we relation continue to be of the most friendly character the friendly and peaceful policy pursue by the government of the united state toward the empire of china have produce the most satisfactory result the treaty of tien-tsin of the 18th June 1858 have be faithfully observe by the chinese authority the convention of the 8th November 1858 supplementary to this treaty for the adjustment and satisfaction of the claim of we citizen on china refer to in my last annual message have be already carry into effect so far as this be practicable under this convention the sum of 500000 tael equal to about $ 700000 be stipulate to be pay in satisfaction of the claim of american citizen out of the one-fifth of the receipt for tonnage import and export duty on american vessel at the port of canton shanghaus and fuchau and it be agree that this amount shall be in full liquidation of all claim of american citizen at the various port to this date debenture for this amount to wit 300000 tael for canton 100000 for shanghaus and 100000 for fuchau be deliver accord to the term of the convention by the respective chinese collector of the custom of these port to the agent select by we minister to receive the same since that time the claim of we citizen have be adjust by the board of commissioner appoint for that purpose under the act of march 3 1859 and they award which prove satisfactory to the claimant have be approve by we minister in the aggregate they amount to the sum of $ 49869478 the claimant have already receive a large proportion of the sum award to they out of the fund provide and it be confidently expect that the remainder will ere long be entirely pay after the award shall have be satisfy there will remain a surplus of more than $ 200000 at the disposition of congress as this will in equity belong to the chinese government would not justice require its appropriation to some benevolent object in which the chinese may be specially interested we minister to china in obedience to he instruction have remain perfectly neutral in the war between great britain and france and the chinese empire although in conjunction with the russian minister he be ever ready and willing have the opportunity offer to employ he good office in restore peace between the party it be but a act of simple justice both to we present minister and he predecessor to state that they have prove fully equal to the delicate try and responsible position in which they have on different occasion be place the ratification of the treaty with japan conclude at yeddo on the 29th July 1858 be exchange at washington on the 22d may last and the treaty itself be proclaim on the succeed day there be good reason to expect that under its protection and influence we trade and intercourse with that distant and interesting people will rapidly increase the ratification of the treaty be exchange with unusual solemnity for this purpose the tycoon have accredit three of he most distinguished subject as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary who be receive and treat with marked distinction and kindness both by the government and people of the united state there be every reason to believe that they have return to they native land entirely satisfy with they visit and inspire by the most friendly feeling for we country let we ardently hope in the language of the treaty itself that there shall henceforward be perpetual peace and friendship between the united state of america and he majesty the tycoon of japan and he successor with the wise conservative and liberal government of the empire of brazil we relation continue to be of the most amicable character the exchange of the ratification of the convention with the republic of new granada sign at washington on the 10th of September 1857 have be long delay from accidental cause for which neither party be censurable these ratification be duly exchange in this city on the 5th of November last thus have a controversy be amicably terminate which have become so serious at the period of my inauguration as to require I on the 17th of April 1857 to direct we minister to demand he passport and return to the united state under this convention the government of new granada have specially acknowledge itself to be responsible to we citizen for damages which be cause by the riot at panama on the 15th April 1856 these claim together with other claim of we citizen which have be long urge in vain be refer for adjustment to a board of commissioner i submit a copy of the convention to congress and recommend the legislation necessary to carry it into effect persevere effort have be make for the adjustment of the claim of american citizen against the government of costa rica and i be happy to inform you that these have finally prevail a convention be sign at the city of san jose on the 2d July last between the minister resident of the united state in costa rica and the plenipotentiary of that republic refer these claim to a board of commissioner and provide for the payment of they award this convention will be submit immediately to the senate for they constitutional action the claim of we citizen upon the republic of nicaragua have not yet be provide for by treaty although diligent effort for this purpose have be make by we minister resident to that republic these be still continue with a fair prospect of success we relation with mexico remain in a most unsatisfactory condition in my last two annual message i discuss extensively the subject of these relation and do not now propose to repeat at length the fact and argument then present they prove conclusively that we citizen reside in mexico and we merchant trade thereto have suffer a series of wrong and outrage such as we have never patiently bear from any other nation for these we successive minister invoke the faith of treaty have in the name of they country persistently demand redress and indemnification but without the slightest effect indeed so confident have the mexican authority become of we patient endurance that they universally believe they might commit these outrage upon american citizen with absolute impunity thus write we minister in 1856 and express the opinion that nothing but a manifestation of the power of the government and of its purpose to punish these wrong will avail afterwards in 1857 come the adoption of a new constitution for mexico the election of a president and congress under its provision and the inauguration of the president within one short month however this president be expel from the capital by a rebellion in the army and the supreme power of the republic be assign to general zuloaga this usurper be in he turn soon compel to retire and give place to general miramon under the constitution which have thus be adopt seor juarez as chief justice of the supreme court become the lawful president of the republic and it be for the maintenance of the constitution and he authority derive from it that the civil war commence and still continue to be prosecute throughout the year 1858 the constitutional party grow stronger and stronger in the previous history of mexico a successful military revolution at the capital have almost universally be the signal for submission throughout the republic not so on the present occasion a majority of the citizen persistently sustain the constitutional government when this be recognize in April 1859 by the government of the united state its authority extend over a large majority of the mexican state and people include vera cruz and all the other important seaport of the republic from that period we commerce with mexico begin to revive and the constitutional government have afford it all the protection in its power meanwhile the government of miramon still hold sway at the capital and over the surrounding country and continue its outrage against the few american citizen who still have the courage to remain within its power to cap the climax after the battle of tacubaya in April 1859 general marquez order three citizen of the united state two of they physician to be seize in the hospital at that place take out and shoot without crime and without trial this be do notwithstanding we unfortunate countryman be at the moment engage in the holy cause of afford relief to the soldier of both party who have be wound in the battle without make any distinction between they the time have arrive in my opinion when this government be bind to exert its power to avenge and redress the wrong of we citizen and to afford they protection in mexico the interpose obstacle be that the portion of the country under the sway of miramon could not be reach without pass over territory under the jurisdiction of the constitutional government under these circumstance i deem it my duty to recommend to congress in my last annual message the employment of a sufficient military force to penetrate into the interior where the government of miramon be to be find with or if need be without the consent of the juarez government though it be not doubt that this consent could be obtain never have i have a clearer conviction on any subject than of the justice as well as wisdom of such a policy no other alternative be leave except the entire abandonment of we fellow-citizen who have go to mexico under the faith of treaty to the systematic injustice cruelty and oppression of miramon 's government besides it be almost certain that the simple authority to employ this force would of itself have accomplish all we object without strike a single blow the constitutional government would then ere this have be establish at the city of mexico and would have be ready and willing to the extent of its ability to do we justice in addition -- and i deem this a most important consideration -- european government would have be deprive of all pretext to interfere in the territorial and domestic concern of mexico we should thus have be relieve from the obligation of resist even by force should this become necessary any attempt by these government to deprive we neighbor republic of portion of she territory -- a duty from which we could not shrink without abandon the traditional and established policy of the american people i be happy to observe that firmly rely upon the justice and good faith of these government there be no present danger that such a contingency will happen have discover that my recommendation would not be sustain by congress the next alternative be to accomplish in some degree if possible the same object by treaty stipulation with the constitutional government such treaty be accordingly conclude by we late able and excellent minister to mexico and on the 4th of January last be submit to the senate for ratification as these have not yet receive the final action of that body it would be improper for I to present a detailed statement of they provision still i may be permit to express the opinion in advance that they be calculate to promote the agricultural manufacturing and commercial interest of the country and to secure we just influence with a adjoining republic as to whose fortune and fate we can never feel indifferent whilst at the same time they provide for the payment of a considerable amount toward the satisfaction of the claim of we injured fellow-citizen at the period of my inauguration i be confront in kansa by a revolutionary government exist under what be call the topeka constitution its avowed object be to subdue the territorial government by force and to inaugurate what be call the topeka government in its stead to accomplish this object a extensive military organization be form and its command intrust to the most violent revolutionary leader under these circumstance it become my imperative duty to exert the whole constitutional power of the executive to prevent the flame of civil war from again rage in kansa which in the excited state of the public mind both north and south might have extend into the neighboring state the hostile party in kansa have be inflamed against each other by emissary both from the north and the south to a degree of malignity without parallel in we history to prevent actual collision and to assist the civil magistrate in enforce the law a strong detachment of the army be station in the territory ready to aid the marshal and he deputy when lawfully call upon as a _ posse comilatus _ in the execution of civil and criminal process still the trouble in kansa could not have be permanently settle without a election by the people the ballot box be the surest arbiter of dispute among freeman under this conviction every proper effort be employ to induce the hostile party to vote at the election of delegate to frame a state constitution and afterwards at the election to decide whether kansa should be a slave or free state the insurgent party refuse to vote at either lest this might be consider a recognition on they part of the territorial government establish by congress a better spirit however seem soon after to prevail and the two party meet face to face at the third election hold on the first Monday of January 1858 for member of the legislature and state officer under the lecompton constitution the result be the triumph of the antislavery party at the poll this decision of the ballot box prove clearly that this party be in the majority and remove the danger of civil war from that time we have hear little or nothing of the topeka government and all serious danger of revolutionary trouble in kansa be then at a end the lecompton constitution which have be thus recognize at this state election by the vote of both political party in kansa be transmit to I with the request that i should present it to congress this i could not have refuse to do without violate my clearest and strongest conviction of duty the constitution and all the proceedings which precede and follow its formation be fair and regular on they face i then believe and experience have prove that the interest of the people of kansa would have be best consult by its admission as a state into the union especially as the majority within a brief period could have amend the constitution accord to they will and pleasure if fraud exist in all or any of these proceedings it be not for the president but for congress to investigate and determine the question of fraud and what ought to be its consequence if at the first two election the majority refuse to vote it can not be pretend that this refusal to exercise the elective franchise could invalidate a election fairly hold under lawful authority even if they have not subsequently vote at the third election it be true that the whole constitution have not be submit to the people as i always desire but the precedent be numerous of the admission of state into the union without such submission it would not comport with my present purpose to review the proceedings of congress upon the lecompton constitution it be sufficient to observe that they final action have remove the last vestige of serious revolutionary trouble the desperate band recently assemble under a notorious outlaw in the southern portion of the territory to resist the execution of the law and to plunder peaceful citizen will i doubt not be speedily subdue and bring to justice have i treat the lecompton constitution as a nullity and refuse to transmit it to congress it be not difficult to imagine whilst recall the position of the country at that moment what would have be the disastrous consequence both in and out of the territory from such a dereliction of duty on the part of the executive peace have also be restore within the territory of utah which at the commencement of my administration be in a state of open rebellion this be the more dangerous as the people animated by a fanatical spirit and intrench within they distant mountain fastness might have make a long and formidable resistance cost what it might it be necessary to bring they into subjection to the constitution and the law sound policy therefore as well as humanity require that this object should if possible be accomplish without the effusion of blood this could only be effect by send a military force into the territory sufficiently strong to convince the people that resistance would be hopeless and at the same time to offer they a pardon for past offens on condition of immediate submission to the government this policy be pursue with eminent success and the only cause for regret be the heavy expenditure require to march a large detachment of the army to that remote region and to furnish it subsistence utah be now comparatively peaceful and quiet and the military force have be withdraw except that portion of it necessary to keep the indian in check and to protect the emigrant train on they way to we pacific possession in my first annual message i promise to employ my best exertion in cooperation with congress to reduce the expenditure of the government within the limit of a wise and judicious economy a overflow treasury have produce habit of prodigality and extravagance which could only be gradually correct the work require both time and patience i apply myself diligently to this task from the beginning and be aid by the able and energetic effort of the head of the different executive department the result of we labor in this good cause do not appear in the sum total of we expenditure for the first two year mainly in consequence of the extraordinary expenditure necessarily incur in the utah expedition and the very large amount of the contingent expense of congress during this period these greatly exceed the pay and mileage of the member for the year end June 30 1858 whilst the pay and mileage amount to $ 1490214 the contingent expense rise to $ 209330979 and for the year end June 30 1859 whilst the pay and mileage amount to $ 85909366 the contingent expense amount to $ 143156578 i be happy however to be able to inform you that during the last fiscal year end June 30 1860 the total expenditure of the government in all its branch -- legislative executive and judicial -- exclusive of the public debt be reduce to the sum of $ 5540246546 this conclusively appear from the book of the treasury in the year end June 30 1858 the total expenditure exclusive of the public debt amount to $ 7190112977 and that for the year end June 30 1859 to $ 6634622613 whilst the book of the treasury show a actual expenditure of $ 5984847472 for the year end June 30 1860 include $ 104066771 for the contingent expense of congress there must be deduct from this amount the sum of $ 429600926 with the interest upon it of $ 150000 appropriate by the act of February 15 1860 for the purpose of supply the deficiency in the revenue and defray the expense of the post-office department for the year end June 30 1859 this sum therefore justly chargeable to the year 1859 must be deduct from the sum of $ 5984847472 in order to ascertain the expenditure for the year end June 30 1860 which leave a balance for the expenditure of that year of $ 5540246546 the interest on the public debt include treasury note for the same fiscal year end June 30 1860 amount to $ 317731462 which add to the above sum of $ 5540246546 make the aggregate of $ 5857978008 it ought in justice to be observe that several of the estimate from the department for the year end June 30 1860 be reduce by congress below what be and still be deem compatible with the public interest allow a liberal margin of $ 2500000 for this reduction and for other cause it may be safely assert that the sum of $ 61000000 or at the most $ 62000000 be amply sufficient to administer the government and to pay the interest on the public debt unless contingent event should hereafter render extraordinary expenditure necessary this result have be attain in a considerable degree by the care exercise by the appropriate department in enter into public contract i have myself never interfere with the award of any such contract except in a single case with the colonization society deem it advisable to cast the whole responsibility in each case on the proper head of the department with the general instruction that these contract should always be give to the lowest and best bidder it have ever be my opinion that public contract be not a legitimate source of patronage to be confer upon personal or political favorite but that in all such case a public officer be bind to act for the government as a prudent individual would act for himself it be with great satisfaction i communicate the fact that since the date of my last annual message not a single slave have be import into the united state in violation of the law prohibit the african slave trade this statement be found upon a thorough examination and investigation of the subject indeed the spirit which prevail some time since among a portion of we fellow-citizen in favor of this trade seem to have entirely subside i also congratulate you upon the public sentiment which now exist against the crime of set on foot military expedition within the limit of the united state to proceed from thence and make war upon the people of unoffending state with whom we be at peace in this respect a happy change have be effect since the commencement of my administration it surely ought to be the prayer of every christian and patriot that such expedition may never again receive countenance in we country or depart from we shore it would be a useless repetition to do more than refer with earnest commendation to my former recommendation in favor of the pacific railroad of the grant of power to the president to employ the naval force in the vicinity for the protection of the life and property of we fellow-citizen pass in transit over the different central american route against sudden and lawless outbreak and depredation and also to protect american merchant vessel they crew and cargo against violent and unlawful seizure and confiscation in the port of mexico and the south american republic when these may be in a disturbed and revolutionary condition it be my settled conviction that without such a power we do not afford that protection to those engage in the commerce of the country which they have a right to demand i again recommend to congress the passage of a law in pursuance of the provision of the constitution appoint a day certain previous to the 4th march in each year of a odd number for the election of representative throughout all the state a similar power have already be exercise with general approbation in the appointment of the same day throughout the union for hold the election of elector for president and vice-president of the united state my attention be earnestly direct to this subject from the fact that the thirty-fifth congress terminate on the 3d march 1859 without make the necessary appropriation for the service of the post-office department i be then force to consider the best remedy for this omission and a immediate call of the present congress be the natural resort upon inquiry however i ascertain that fifteen out of the thirty-three state compose the confederacy be without representative and that consequently these fifteen state would be disfranchise by such a call these fifteen state will be in the same condition on the 4th march next ten of they can not elect representative accord to exist state law until different period extend from the beginning of August next until the month of October and November in my last message i give warn that in a time of sudden and alarming danger the salvation of we institution might depend upon the power of the president immediately to assemble a full congress to meet the emergency it be now quite evident that the financial necessity of the government will require a modification of the tariff during you present session for the purpose of increase the revenue in this aspect i desire to reiterate the recommendation contain in my last two annual message in favor of impose specific instead of _ ad valorem _ duty on all import article to which these can be properly apply from long observation and experience i be convince that specific duty be necessary both to protect the revenue and to secure to we manufacturing interest that amount of incidental encouragement which unavoidably result from a revenue tariff as a abstract proposition it may be admit that _ ad valorem _ duty would in theory be the most just and equal but if the experience of this and of all other commercial nation have demonstrate that such duty can not be assess and collect without great fraud upon the revenue then it be the part of wisdom to resort to specific duty indeed from the very nature of a _ ad valorem _ duty this must be the result under it the inevitable consequence be that foreign goods will be enter at less than they true value the treasury will therefore lose the duty on the difference between they real and fictitious value and to this extent we be defraud the temptation which _ ad valorem _ duty present to a dishonest importer be irresistible he object be to pass he goods through the custom-house at the very lowest valuation necessary to save they from confiscation in this he too often succeed in spite of the vigilance of the revenue officer hence the resort to false invoice one for the purchaser and another for the custom-house and to other expedient to defraud the government the honest importer produce he invoice to the collector state the actual price at which he purchase the article abroad not so the dishonest importer and the agent of the foreign manufacturer and here it may be observe that a very large proportion of the manufacture import from abroad be consign for sale to commission merchant who be mere agent employ by the manufacturer in such case no actual sale have be make to fix they value the foreign manufacturer if he be dishonest prepare a invoice of the goods not at they actual value but at the very lowest rate necessary to escape detection in this manner the dishonest importer and the foreign manufacturer enjoy a decide advantage over the honest merchant they be thus enable to undersell the fair trader and drive he from the market in fact the operation of this system have already drive from the pursuit of honorable commerce many of that class of regular and conscientious merchant whose character throughout the world be the pride of we country the remedy for these evil be to be find in specific duty so far as this may be practicable they dispense with any inquiry at the custom-house into the actual cost or value of the article and it pay the precise amount of duty previously fix by law they present no temptation to the appraiser of foreign goods who receive but small salary and might by undervaluation in a few case render themselves independent besides specific duty best conform to the requisition in the constitution that no preference shall be give by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the port of one state over those of another under we _ ad valorem _ system such preference be to some extent inevitable and complaint have often be make that the spirit of this provision have be violate by a lower appraisement of the same article at one port than at another a impression strangely enough prevail to some extent that specific duty be necessarily protective duty nothing can be more fallacious great britain glory in free trade and yet she whole revenue from import be at the present moment collect under a system of specific duty it be a striking fact in this connection that in the commercial treaty of January 23 1860 between france and england one of the article provide that the _ ad valorem _ duty which it impose shall be convert into specific duty within six month from its date and these be to be ascertain by make a average of the price for six month previous to that time the reverse of the proposition would be nearer to the truth because a much larger amount of revenue would be collect by merely convert the _ ad valorem _ duty of a tariff into equivalent specific duty to this extent the revenue would be increase and in the same proportion the specific duty might be diminish specific duty would secure to the american manufacturer the incidental protection to which he be fairly entitle under a revenue tariff and to this surely no person would object the framer of the exist tariff have go further and in a liberal spirit have discriminate in favor of large and useful branch of we manufacture not by raise the rate of duty upon the importation of similar article from abroad but what be the same in effect by admit article free of duty which enter into the composition of they fabric under the present system it have be often truly remark that this incidental protection decrease when the manufacturer need it most and increase when he need it least and constitute a slide scale which always operate against he the revenue of the country be subject to similar fluctuation instead of approach a steady standard as would be the case under a system of specific duty they sink and rise with the sinking and rise price of article in foreign country it would not be difficult for congress to arrange a system of specific duty which would afford additional stability both to we revenue and we manufacture and without injury or injustice to any interest of the country this might be accomplish by ascertain the average value of any give article for a series of year at the place of exportation and by simply convert the rate of _ ad valorem _ duty upon it which might be deem necessary for revenue purpose into the form of a specific duty such a arrangement could not injure the consumer if he should pay a greater amount of duty one year this would be counterbalance by a lesser amount the next and in the end the aggregate would be the same i desire to call you immediate attention to the present condition of the treasury so ably and clearly present by the secretary in he report to congress and to recommend that measure be promptly adopt to enable it to discharge its press obligation the other recommendation of the report be well worthy of you favorable consideration i herewith transmit to congress the report of the secretary of war of the navy of the interior and of the postmaster-general the recommendation and suggestion which they contain be highly valuable and deserve you careful attention the report of the postmaster-general detail the circumstance under which cornelius vanderbilt on my request agree in the month of July last to carry the ocean mail between we atlantic and pacific coast have he not thus act this important intercommunication must have be suspend at least for a season the postmaster-general have no power to make he any other compensation than the postage on the mail matter which he might carry it be know at the time that these postage would fall far short of a adequate compensation as well as of the sum which the same service have previously cost the government mr vanderbilt in a commendable spirit be willing to rely upon the justice of congress to make up the deficiency and i therefore recommend that a appropriation may be grant for this purpose i should do great injustice to the attorney-general be i to omit the mention of he distinguished service in the measure adopt and prosecute by he for the defense of the government against numerous and unfounded claim to land in californium purport to have be make by the mexican government previous to the treaty of cession the successful opposition to these claim have save the united state public property worth many million of dollar and to individual hold title under they to at least a equal amount it have be represent to I from source which i deem reliable that the inhabitant in several portion of kansa have be reduce nearly to a state of starvation on account of the almost total failure of they crop whilst the harvest in every other portion of the country have be abundant the prospect before they for the approach winter be well calculate to enlist the sympathy of every heart the destitution appear to be so general that it can not be relieve by private contribution and they be in such indigent circumstance as to be unable to purchase the necessaries of life for themselves i refer the subject to congress if any constitutional measure for they relief can be devise i would recommend its adoption i cordially commend to you favorable regard the interest of the people of this district they be eminently entitle to you consideration especially since unlike the people of the state they can appeal to no government except that of the union jame buchanan special message washington _ December 5 1860 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : i transmit for the consideration of the senate with a view to ratification a convention for the adjustment of claim of citizen of the united state against the government of the republic of costa rica sign by the plenipotentiary of the contracting party at san jose on the 2d day of July last jame buchanan washington _ December 5 1860 _ _ to the house of representative _ : in answer to the resolution of the house of representative of the 9th of April last request information concern the african slave trade i transmit a report from the secretary of state and the document by which it be accompany jame buchanan washington _ January 2 1861 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : i transmit to the senate for its consideration with a view to ratification a treaty of amity commerce and navigation and for the surrender of fugitive criminal between the united state and the republic of venezuelum sign at caraca on the 27th of August last a similar treaty be conclude on the 10th July 1856 be submit to the senate and be by a resolution of that body approve with a amendment on the 10th march 1857 before this amendment could be lay before the government of venezuelum for acceptance a new minister of the united state be accredit to that government meantime the attention of this government have be draw to the disadvantage which would result to we citizen reside in venezuelum if the second article of the treaty of 1856 be permit to go into effect the pecuniary equivalent for exemption from military duty be a arbitrary and generally a excessive sum in view of this fact it be deem preferable to instruct we new minister to negotiate a new treaty which should omit the objectionable second article and also the few word of the twenty-eighth article which have be stricken out by the senate with these change and with the addition of the last clause to the twenty-seventh article the treaty be the same as that already approve by the senate jame buchanan washington city _ January 8 1861 _ _ to the senate and house of representative _ : at the opening of you present session i call you attention to the danger which threaten the existence of the union i express my opinion freely concern the original cause of those danger and recommend such measure as i believe would have the effect of tranquilize the country and save it from the peril in which it have be needlessly and most unfortunately involve those opinion and recommendation i do not propose now to repeat my own conviction upon the whole subject remain unchanged the fact that a great calamity be impend over the nation be even at that time acknowledge by every intelligent citizen it have already make itself feel throughout the length and breadth of the land the necessary consequence of the alarm thus produce be most deplorable the import fall off with a rapidity never know before except in time of war in the history of we foreign commerce the treasury be unexpectedly leave without the means which it have reasonably count upon to meet the public engagement trade be paralyzed manufacture be stop the best public security suddenly sink in the market every species of property depreciate more or less and thousand of poor man who depend upon they daily labor for they daily bread be turn out of employment i deeply regret that i be not able to give you any information upon the state of the union which be more satisfactory than what i be then oblige to communicate on the contrary matter be still worse at present than they then be when congress meet a strong hope pervade the whole public mind that some amicable adjustment of the subject would speedily be make by the representative of the state and of the people which might restore peace between the conflicting section of the country that hope have be diminish by every hour of delay and as the prospect of a bloodless settlement fade away the public distress become more and more aggravate as evidence of this it be only necessary to say that the treasury note authorize by the act of 17th of December last be advertise accord to the law and that no responsible bidder offer to take any considerable sum at par at a lower rate of interest than 12 per cent from these fact it appear that in a government organize like ours domestic strife or even a well-grounded fear of civil hostility be more destructive to we public and private interest than the most formidable foreign war in my annual message i express the conviction which i have long deliberately hold and which recent reflection have only tend to deepen and confirm that no state have a right by its own act to secede from the union or throw off its federal obligation at pleasure i also declare my opinion to be that even if that right exist and should be exercise by any state of the confederacy the executive department of this government have no authority under the constitution to recognize its validity by acknowledge the independence of such state this leave I no alternative as the chief executive officer under the constitution of the united state but to collect the public revenue and to protect the public property so far as this might be practicable under exist law this be still my purpose my province be to execute and not to make the law it belong to congress exclusively to repeal to modify or to enlarge they provision to meet exigency as they may occur i possess no dispense power i certainly have no right to make aggressive war upon any state and i be perfectly satisfy that the constitution have wisely withhold that power even from congress but the right and the duty to use military force defensively against those who resist the federal officer in the execution of they legal function and against those who assail the property of the federal government be clear and undeniable but the dangerous and hostile attitude of the state toward each other have already far transcend and cast in the shade the ordinary executive duty already provide for by law and have assume such vast and alarming proportion as to place the subject entirely above and beyond executive control the fact can not be disguise that we be in the midst of a great revolution in all its various bearing therefore i commend the question to congress as the only human tribunal under providence possess the power to meet the exist emergency to they exclusively belong the power to declare war or to authorize the employment of military force in all case contemplate by the constitution and they alone possess the power to remove grievance which might lead to war and to secure peace and union to this distract country on they and on they alone rest the responsibility the union be a sacred trust leave by we revolutionary father to they descendant and never do any other people inherit so rich a legacy it have render we prosperous in peace and triumphant in war the national flag have float in glory over every sea under its shadow american citizen have find protection and respect in all land beneath the sun if we descend to consideration of purely material interest when in the history of all time have a confederacy be bind together by such strong tie of mutual interest each portion of it be dependent on all and all upon each portion for prosperity and domestic security free trade throughout the whole supplies the want of one portion from the production of another and scatter wealth everywhere the great planting and farming state require the aid of the commercial and navigating state to send they production to domestic and foreign market and to furnish the naval power to render they transportation secure against all hostile attack should the union perish in the midst of the present excitement we have already have a sad foretaste of the universal suffering which would result from its destruction the calamity would be severe in every portion of the union and would be quite as great to say the least in the southern as in the northern state the greatest aggravation of the evil and that which would place we in the most unfavorable light both before the world and posterity be as i be firmly convince that the secession movement have be chiefly base upon a misapprehension at the south of the sentiment of the majority in several of the northern state let the question be transfer from political assembly to the ballot box and the people themselves would speedily redress the serious grievance which the south have suffer but in heaven 's name let the trial be make before we plunge into armed conflict upon the mere assumption that there be no other alternative time be a great conservative power let we pause at this momentous point and afford the people both north and south a opportunity for reflection would that south carolina have be convince of this truth before she precipitate action i therefore appeal through you to the people of the country to declare in they might that the union must and shall be preserve by all constitutional means i most earnestly recommend that you devote yourselve exclusively to the question how this can be accomplish in peace all other question when compare to this sink into insignificance the present be no time for palliation action prompt action be require a delay in congress to prescribe or to recommend a distinct and practical proposition for conciliation may drive we to a point from which it will be almost impossible to recede a common ground on which conciliation and harmony can be produce be surely not unattainable the proposition to compromise by let the north have exclusive control of the territory above a certain line and to give southern institution protection below that line ought to receive universal approbation in itself indeed it may not be entirely satisfactory but when the alternative be between a reasonable concession on both side and a destruction of the union it be a imputation upon the patriotism of congress to assert that its member will hesitate for a moment even now the danger be upon we in several of the state which have not yet secede the fort arsenal and magazine of the united state have be seize this be by far the most serious step which have be take since the commencement of the trouble this public property have long be leave without garrison and troops for its protection because no person doubt its security under the flag of the country in any state of the union besides we small army have scarcely be sufficient to guard we remote frontier against indian incursion the seizure of this property from all appearance have be purely aggressive and not in resistance to any attempt to coerce a state or state to remain in the union at the beginning of these unhappy trouble i determine that no act of mine should increase the excitement in either section of the country if the political conflict be to end in a civil war it be my determine purpose not to commence it nor even to furnish a excuse for it by any act of this government my opinion remain unchanged that justice as well as sound policy require we still to seek a peaceful solution of the question at issue between the north and the south entertaining this conviction i refrain even from send reenforcement to major anderson who command the fort in charleston harbor until a absolute necessity for do so should make itself apparent lest it might unjustly be regard as a menace of military coercion and thus furnish if not a provocation at least a pretext for a outbreak on the part of south carolina no necessity for these reenforcement seem to exist i be assure by distinguished and upright gentleman of south carolina that no attack upon major anderson be intend but that on the contrary it be the desire of the state authority as much as it be my own to avoid the fatal consequence which must eventually follow a military collision and here i deem it proper to submit for you information copy of a communication date December 28 1860 address to I by rw barnwell jh adam and jame l orr commissioner from south carolina with the accompany document and copy of my answer thereto date December 31 in further explanation of major anderson 's removal from fort moultrie to fort sumter it be proper to state that after my answer to the south carolina commissioner the war department receive a letter from that gallant officer date on the 27th of December 1860 the day after this movement from which the follow be a extract : i will add as my opinion that many thing convinced I that the authority of the state design to proceed to a hostile act evidently refer to the order date December 11 of the late secretary of war under this impression i could not hesitate that it be my solemn duty to move my command from a fort which we could not probably have hold longer than forty-eight or sixty hour to this one where my power of resistance be increase to a very great degree it will be recollect that the conclude part of these order be in the follow term : the smallness of you force will not permit you perhaps to occupy more than one of the three fort but a attack on or attempt to take possession of either one of they will be regard as a act of hostility and you may then put you command into either of they which you may deem most proper to increase its power of resistance you be also authorize to take similar defensive step whenever you have tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act it be say that serious apprehension be to some extent entertain -lrb- in which i do not share -rrb- that the peace of this district may be disturb before the 4th of march next in any event it will be my duty to preserve it and this duty shall be perform in conclusion it may be permit to I to remark that i have often warn my countryman of the danger which now surround we this may be the last time i shall refer to the subject officially i feel that my duty have be faithfully though it may be imperfectly perform and whatever the result may be i shall carry to my grave the consciousness that i at least mean well for my country jame buchanan washington _ January 15 1861 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : in compliance with the resolution of the senate pass on the 10th instant request I to inform that body if not incompatible with the public interest whether john b floyd whose appointment as secretary of war be confirm by the senate on the 6th of march 1857 still continue to hold say office and if not when and how say office become vacant and further to inform the senate how and by whom the duty of say office be now discharge and if a appointment of a act or provisional secretary of war have be make how when and by what authority it be so make and why the fact of say appointment have not be communicate to the senate i have to inform the senate that john b floyd the late secretary of the war department resign that office on the 29th day of December last and that on the 1st day of January instant joseph holt be authorize by I to perform the duty of the say office until a successor should be appoint or the vacancy fill under this authority the duty of the war department have be perform by mr holt from the day last mention to the present time the power to carry on the business of the government by means of a provisional appointment when a vacancy occur be expressly give by the act of February 13 1795 which enact -- that in case of vacancy in the office of secretary of state secretary of the treasury or of the secretary of the department of war or of any officer of either of the say department whose appointment be not in the head thereof whereby they can not perform the duty of they respective office it shall be lawful for the president of the united state in case he shall think it necessary to authorize any person or person at he discretion to perform the duty of the say respective office until a successor be appoint or such vacancy be fill : _ provide _ that no one vacancy shall be supply in manner aforesaid for a longer period than six month it be manifest that if the power which this law give have be withhold the public interest would frequently suffer very serious detriment vacancy may occur at any time in the most important office which can not be immediately and permanently fill in a manner satisfactory to the appoint power it be wise to make a provision which would enable the president to avoid a total suspension of business in the interval and equally wise so to limit the executive discretion as to prevent any serious abuse of it this be what the framer of the act of 1795 do and neither the policy nor the constitutional validity of they law have be question for sixty-five year the practice of make such appointment whether in a vacation or during the session of congress have be constantly follow during every administration from the earliest period of the government and its perfect lawfulness have never to my knowledge be question or deny without go back further than the year 1829 and without take into the calculation any but the chief officer of the several department it will be find that provisional appointment to fill vacancy be make to the number of 179 from the commencement of general jackson 's administration to the close of general pierce 's this number would probably be greatly increase if all the case which occur in the subordinate office and bureau be add to the count some of they be make while the senate be in session some which be make in vacation be continue in force long after the senate assemble sometimes the temporary officer be the commission head of another department sometimes a subordinate in the same department sometimes the affair of the navy department have be direct _ ad interim _ by a commodore and those of the war department by a general in most if not all of the case which occur previous to 1852 it be believe that the compensation provide by law

award of these commissioner that the united state and paraguay navigation company have not prove or establish any right to damages upon they say claim against the government of the republic of paraguay and that upon the proof aforesaid the say government be not responsible to the say company in any damages or pecuniary compensation whatever in all the premise the question arise have the commissioner authority under the convention to make such a award or be they not confine to the assessment of damages which the company have sustain from the government of paraguay we relation with that republic have for year be of a most unsatisfactory character they have be investigate by the precede and by the present administration the latter come to the conclusion that both the interest and honor of the country require that we rights against that government for they attack on the _ water witch _ and for the injury they have inflict on this company should if necessary be enforce accordingly the president in he annual message of December 1857 call the attention of congress to the subject in the follow language : a demand for these purpose will be make in a firm but conciliatory spirit this will the more probably be grant if the executive shall have authority to use other means in the event of a refusal this be accordingly recommend after due deliberation congress on the 2d of June 1858 authorize the president to adopt such measure and use such force as in he judgment may be necessary and advisable in the premise a commissioner be accordingly appoint and a force fit out and dispatch to paraguay for the purpose if necessary of enforce atonement for these wrong the expedition appear in the water of the la plata and we commissioner succeed in conclude a treaty and convention embrace both branch of we demand the convention of indemnity be sign on the 4th of February 1859 the preamble of this convention refer to the interruption for a time of the good understanding and harmony between the two nation which have render that distant armament necessary by the first article the government of paraguay bind itself for the responsibility in favor of the united state and paraguay navigation company which may result from the decree of commissioner to be appoint in the manner provide by article 2 this be in accordance with the instruction to we commissioner who be tell that a indispensable preliminary to the negotiation would of course be a acknowledgment on the part of the paraguayan government of its liability to the company the first paragraph of this second article clearly specify the object of the convention this be not to ascertain whether the claim be just to enforce which we have send a fleet to paraguay but to constitute a commission to determine not the existence but the amount of say reclamation the final paragraph provide that the two commissioner name in the say manner shall meet in the city of washington to investigate adjust and _ determine the amount _ of the claim of the above-mentioned company upon sufficient proof of the charge and defens of the contend party by the fifth article the government of paraguay bind itself to pay to the government of the united state of america in the city of assumption paraguay thirty day after presentation to the government of the republic the draft which that of the united state of america shall issue for the amount for which the two commissioner concur or by the umpire shall declare it responsible to the say company the act of congress of may 16 1860 employ the same language that be use in the convention to investigate adjust and determine the amount of the claim against paraguay congress not doubt that a award would be make in favor of the company for some certain amount of damages in the sixth section of the act refer to provide that the money pay out of the treasury for the expense of the commission shall be retain by the united state out of the money -lrb- not any money -rrb- that may pursuant to the term of say convention be receive from paraguay after all this have be do after we have fit out a warlike expedition in part to obtain satisfaction for this very claim after these solemn act have be perform by the two republic the commissioner have feel themselves competent to decide that they could go behind the action of the legislative and executive branch of this government and determine that there be no justice in the original claim a commissioner of paraguay might have be a proper person to act merely in assess the amount of damages when a arbiter have be provide to decide between he and the commissioner on the part of the united state but to have authorize he to decide upon the original justice of the claim against he own government would have be a novelty the american commissioner be as pure and honest a man as i have ever know but i think he take a wrong view of he power under the convention the principle of the liability of paraguay have be establish by the highest political act of the united state and that republic in they sovereign capacity the commissioner who would seem to have misapprehend they power have investigate and undertake to decide whether the government of the united state be right or wrong in the authority which they give to make war if necessary to secure the indemnity government may be and doubtless often have be wrong in go to war to enforce claim but after this have be do and the inquiry which lead to the reclamation have be acknowledge by the government that inflict it it do not appear to I to be competent for commissioner authorize to ascertain the indemnity for the injury to go behind they authority and decide upon the original merit of the claim for which the war be make if a commissioner be appoint under a convention to ascertain the damage sustain by a american citizen in consequence of the capture of a vessel admit by the foreign government to be illegal and he should go behind the convention and decide that the original capture be a lawful prize it would certainly be regard as a extraordinary assumption of authority the present appear to I to be a case of this character and for these reason i have deem it advisable to submit the whole subject for the consideration of the senate jame buchanan washington _ February 21 1861 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : the treaty conclude between great britain and the united state on the 15th of June 1846 provide in its first article that the line of boundary between the territory of she britannic majesty and those of the united state from the point on the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude up to which it have already be ascertain should be continue westward along the say parallel to the middle of the channel which separate the continent from vancouver island and thence southerly through the middle of say channel and of fuca strait to the pacific ocean when the commissioner appoint by the two government to mark the boundary line come to that point of it which be require to run southerly through the channel which divide the continent from vancouver island they differ entirely in they opinion not only concern the true point of deflection from the forty-ninth parallel but also as to the channel intend to be designate in the treaty after a long-continued and very able discussion of the subject which produce no result they report they disagreement to they respective government since that time the two government through they minister here and at london have have a voluminous correspondence on the point in controversy each sustain the view of its own commissioner and neither yield in any degree to the claim of the other in the meantime the unsettled condition of this affair have produce some serious local disturbance and on one occasion at least have threaten to destroy the harmonious relation exist between great britain and the united state the island of san juan will fall to the united state if we construction of the treaty be right while if the british interpretation be adopt it will be on they side of the line that island be a important possession to this country and valuable for agricultural as well as military purpose i be convince that it be ours by the treaty fairly and impartially construe but argument have be exhaust on both side without increase the probability of final adjustment on the contrary each party seem now to be more convinced than at first of the justice of its own demand there be but one mode left of settle the dispute and that be by submit it to the arbitration of some friendly and impartial power unless this be do the two country be expose to the constant danger of a collision which may end in war it be under these circumstance that the british government through its minister here have propose the reference of the matter in controversy to the king of sweden and norway the king of the netherland or to the republic of the swiss confederation before accept this proposition i have think it right to take the advice of the senate the precise question which i submit be these : will the senate approve a treaty refer to either of the sovereign power above name the dispute now exist between the government of the united state and great britain concern the boundary line between vancouver island and the american continent in case the referee shall find himself unable to decide where the line be by the description of it in the treaty of 15th June 1846 shall he be authorize to establish a line accord to the treaty as nearly as possible which of the three power name by great britain as a arbiter shall be choose by the united state all important papers bear on the question be herewith

of any portion of the citizen of this country to seize upon the capital and prevent the inauguration of the president elect the president submit that the number of troops assemble in this city be not large as the resolution presuppose its total amount be 653 man exclusive of the marine who be of course at the navy-yard as they appropriate station these troops be order here to act as a _ posse comitatus _ in strict subordination to the civil authority for the purpose of preserve peace and order in the city of washington should this be necessary before or at the period of the inauguration of the president elect since the date of the resolution hon mr howard from the select committee have make a report to the house on this subject it be thoroughly investigate by the committee and although they have express the opinion that the evidence before they do not prove the existence of a secret organization here or elsewhere hostile to the government that have for its object upon its own responsibility a attack upon the capital or any of the public property here or a interruption of any of the function of the government yet the house lay upon the table by a very large majority a resolution express the opinion that the regular troops now in this city ought to be forthwith remove therefrom this of itself be a sufficient reason for not withdraw the troops but what be the duty of the president at the time the troops be order to this city ought he to have wait before this precautionary measure be adopt until he could obtain proof that a secret organization exist to seize the capital in the language of the select committee this be in a time of high excitement consequent upon revolutionary event transpire all around we the very air fill with rumor and individual indulge in the most extravagant expression of fear and threat under these and other circumstance which i need not detail but which appear in the testimony before the select committee i be convince that i ought to act the safety of the immense amount of public property in this city and that of the archive of the government in which all the state and especially the new state in which the public land be situate have a deep interest the peace and order of the city itself and the security of the inauguration of the president elect be object of such vast importance to the whole country that i could not hesitate to adopt precautionary defensive measure at the present moment when all be quiet it be difficult to realize the state of alarm which prevail when the troops be first order to this city this almost instantly subside after the arrival of the first company and a feeling of comparative peace and security have since exist both in washington and throughout the country have i refuse to adopt this precautionary measure and evil consequence which many good man at the time apprehend have follow i should never have forgive myself jame buchanan washington _ march 2 1861 _ _ to the senate of the united state _ : i deem it proper to invite the attention of the senate to the fact that with this day expire the limitation of time for the exchange of the ratification of the treaty with costa rica of 2d July 1860 the minister of that republic be disappoint in not have receive the copy intend for exchange and the period will lapse without the possibility of carry out the provision of the convention in this respect i submit therefore the expediency of the passage of a resolution authorize the exchange of ratification at such time as may be convenient the limitation of the ninth article to the contrary notwithstanding jame buchanan veto message washington city _ January 25 1861 _ _ to the house of representative of the united state _ : i return with my objection to the house in which it originate the bill entitle a act for the relief of hockaday & leggit present to I on the 15th instant this bill appropriate $ 59576 to hockaday & leggit in full payment for damages sustain by they in reduction of pay for carry the mail on route no 8911 and that say amount be pay to william leggit for and on account of hockaday & leggit and for they benefit a bill contain the same language with the single exception that the sum appropriate therein be $ 40000 instead of $ 59576 pass both house of congress at they last session but it be present to I at so late a period of the session that i could not examine its merit before the time fix for the adjournment and it therefore under the constitution fail to become a law the increase of the sum appropriate in the present bill over that in the bill of the last session be within a fraction of $ 20000 have induce I to examine the question with some attention and i find that the bill involve a important principle which if establish by congress may take large sum out of the treasury it appear that on the 1st day of April 1858 john m hockaday enter into a contract with the postmaster-general for transport the mail on route no 8911 from st joseph mo by fort kearney nebraska territory and fort leavenworth to salt lake city for the sum of $ 190000 per annum for a weekly service the service be to commence on the 1st day of may 1858 and to terminate on the 30th November 1860 by this contract the postmaster-general reserve to himself the right to reduce the service to semimonthly whenever the necessity of the public and the condition of affair in the territory of utah may not require it more frequently and again : that the postmaster-general may discontinue or curtail the service in whole or in part in order to place on the route a greater degree of service or whenever the public interest require such discontinuance for any other cause he allow one month 's extra pay on the amount of service dispense with on the 11th April 1859 the postmaster-general curtail the service which he have a clear right to do under the contract to semimonthly with a annual deduction of $ 65000 leave the compensation $ 125000 for twenty-four trip per year instead of $ 190000 for fifty-two trip this curtailment be not to take effect till the 1st of July 1859 at the time the contract be make it be expect that the army in utah might be engage in active operation and hence the necessity of frequent communication between the war department and that territory the reservation of the power to curtail the service to semimonthly trip itself prove that the party have in view the contingency of such curtailment whenever the necessity of the public and the condition of affair in the territory of utah may not require it more frequently before the postmaster-general order this curtailment he have a interview with the secretary of war upon the subject in the course of which the secretary agree that a weekly mail to st joseph and salt lake city be no longer need for the purpose of the government -- this evidently because the trouble in utah have end mr hockaday faithfully comply with he contract and the full compensation be pay at the rate of $ 190000 per annum up to the 1st July 1859 and one month 's extra pay on the amount of service dispense with accord to the contract previous to that date as have be already state on the 14th of April 1859 the postmaster-general curtail the service to twice per month and on the 11th may 1859 messr hockaday & co assign the contract to jone russell & co for a bonus of $ 50000 they property connect with the route be to be appraise which be effect and they receive on this account about $ 94000 make the whole amount about $ 144000 there be no doubt that the contractor have sustain considerable loss in the whole transaction the amount i shall not pretend to decide whether $ 40000 or $ 59576 or any other sum it will be for congress to consider whether the precedent establish by this bill will not in effect annul all restriction contain in the mail contract enable the postmaster-general to reduce or curtail the postal service accord to the public exigency as they may arise i have no other solicitude upon the subject i be inform that there be many case in the post-office department depend upon the same principle jame buchanan proclamation by
