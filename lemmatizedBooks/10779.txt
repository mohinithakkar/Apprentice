send he away to divert they mind he tell they to put on they hat and take a ramble in the field with he and perhaps he would walk with they up the high hill near he farm if they little visitor think he leg be strong enough to climb so high edward think they be so they set off shout and race through the field while mr wilson follow leisurely in the road they find it rather hard work to climb the hill which be very steep but when they get to the top they be well pay for all they trouble they could see many pretty town with the beautiful river glide along through they and many high hill like the one they be on far away in the distance mr wilson point out and tell they the name of the different village which be in sight and thus amuse and instruct they till they be all well rest then they

few minute then leave mr wilson there they chase the butterfly and pick the early flower as they range through other field until they come to a pleasant little piece of wood where they stop to look at the old hollow oak in which all four could just crowd in here they stop to rest a little and to watch the labor of a a pretty bird build its nest on the branch of a neighbor tree then they wander down in a meadow to get a drink of water from a fine spring near the foot of a huge old tree and have refresh themselves turn they step homewards on they way the cousin show edward a shine little brook of
