be grant the power of human speech and the ox and the ass knelt in they stall in adoration of the infant savior then it be that the shepherd abide in the field with they flock hear the angel praise god and king of the orient watch in they far country see ablaze in the heaven the long-expected sign even in distant rome there spring up a well or fountain which run largely and the ancient prophetess sibyl look eastward from the capitoline hill hear the angel song and saw in vision all the wonder of that night there be many such traditional tale of the nativity of the star-led wizard and of the marvel work by the boy christ they tell of the bee sing they sweet hymn of praise to the lord of the palm-tree bend down its branch that the weary traveller flee from the wrath of herod might be refresh by its fruit of the juniper which open to conceal they and of the sweet-smelling balsam which grow wherever the drop of moisture fall from the brow of the boy as he run about or toil

miracle of the first christmas happen again so in these tale the thorn-tree blossom anew and wonderful rose bloom in the bleak forest other story tell how on each christmas eve the little christ-child come again to earth and wander through village or town while light candle be place in the window to guide he on he way these various legend and traditional tale which spring up among the people like flower by the wayside and become a part of the life of the middle age be still of interest to we of to-day and have a distinct charm of they own and when the childlike faith and beauty of thought of the finest of these have find expression in literary form they seem particularly suit for we reading at the gracious time the adoration of the shepherd st luke ii 1-16 and it come to pass in those day that there go out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be tax and this tax be first make when cyrenius be governor of syrium and all go to be tax every one into he own city and joseph also go up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judaea unto the city of david which be call bethlehem because he be of the house and lineage of david : to be tax with mary he espouse wife be great with child and so it be that while they be there the day be accomplish that she should be deliver and she bring forth she firstborn son and wrap he in swaddle clothes and lay he in a manger because there be no room for they in the inn and there be in the same country shepherd abide in the field keep watch over they flock by night and lo the angel of the lord come upon they and the glory of the lord shone round about they : and they be sore afraid and the angel say unto they fear not : for behold i bring you good tiding of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you be bear this day in the city of david a savior which be christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrap in swaddle clothes lie in a manger and suddenly there be with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praise god and say glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward man and it come to pass as the angel be go away from they into heaven the shepherd say one to another let we now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which be come to pass which the lord have make known unto we and they come with haste and find mary and joseph and the babe lie in a manger the child bear at bethlehem horace elisha scudder about six mile to the south of jerusalem be the village of bethlehem lie along the slope and on the top of a gray hill from the steep eastern end of which one look over a broad plain toward a range of high hill beyond at any time as one draw near the place come from jerusalem he would pass by round hill and now and then cross little ravine with brook sometimes full of water sometimes only bed of stone and if it be spring-time he would see the hill and valley cover with they grass and sprinkle abundantly with a great variety of wild flower daisy poppy the star of bethlehem tulip and anemone -- a broad sheet of color of scarlet white and green perhaps very long ago there be tree also where now there be none and on those hill gray with the stone that peep out through the grass stand the mighty cedar of lebanon stretch out they sweeping branch and oak sturdy and rich with dark foliage green the year round at any rate then as now we may believe that there be vineyard upon the sunny slope and we know that the wind blow over corn-field cover the plain that lay between the range of hill it be of the time long since that we be think when there be no massive building on bethlehem hill such as be to be see in the town as it now appear instead there be low house many of mud and sunburnt brick some so poor doubtless that the cattle be stall if not in the same room with the people of the house yet so near that they could be hear through the partition stamp and crunch they food there be a inn there also but we must not think of it as like we modern public-house with a landlord and servant where one could have what he need by pay for it rather it be a collection of building for the convenience and accommodation of traveler who bring with they whatever they require of food and the means of prepare it find there only shelter and the roughest convenience the larger inn of this sort be build in the form of a great courtyard surround by arcade in which people stay and keep they goods if they be merchant the inn at bethlehem be not probably one of these great caravanserai -- as they be call now in the east because caravan stop at they and it be even possible that the stable about the inn be simply cave scoop out of the soft chalk rock for the country there have a abundance of these cave use for this very purpose from the hill on which bethlehem stand one can see traveler approach and at that time long ago no doubt the people who live there see company of traveler on foot or mount come up to the village for it be a busy time in judea the emperor at rome the capital of the world have order a tax to be lay upon he subject and first it have to be know just who be liable to be tax nowadays and in we country people have they name take down at the door of they own house and pay they tax in the town where they live but then in judea it be different if a man have always live in one place and he parent before he well and good : there he name be take down and there he be tax but if he be of a family that have leave another place he go back to the old home and there he name be register there be many it may be who at this time be visit bethlehem for this purpose at least we know of two amongst these traveler devout and humble people they be joseph a carpenter living in nazareth a village of galilee sixty mile or more to the northward and mary he wife together they be come to bethlehem for while nazareth be now they home they be spring from a family that once live in bethlehem and though they be now poor and lowly that family be the royal family and king david the greatest king that ever sit on the jewish throne be they ancestor perhaps as they climb the hill they think of ruth who have glean in the corn-field just where they be pass and no doubt they think of ruth 's great-grandson king david who be bear here and here keep he father 's sheep -- such sheep as even now they could see on the hillside watch by the watch shepherd they come like the rest to the caravanserai but find it already fill with traveler they could not have room with other man and woman and yet there be shelter to be have for the place where the horse and beast of burden stand be not all take up it may be that many of those now occupy the inn have come on joseph 's errand and not be merchant have come unattended by the beast that bear the goods of merchant who be there occupy the inn and what be they there for we can only guess all be forget of that gathering man remember only the two traveler from nazareth who could find no room in the inn and make they resting-place by a manger for there away from the crowd be bear to mary a child whom she wrap in swaddling-clothes and lay in the manger she be away from home she be not even in a friend 's house nor yet in the inn the lord god have make ready a crib for the babe in the feeding-place of cattle what gathering of friend could there be to rejoice over a child bear in this solitary place yet there be some friend of the child and of the child 's mother who welcome its birth with great rejoice it may be that when mary be lay he upon he first hard earthly resting-place there be not far off such a sight as never before be see on earth on the hilly slope about bethlehem be flock of sheep that day and night crop the grass watch by shepherd just as so long before young david in the same place have watch he father 's sheep these shepherd be devout man who sing we may easily believe the song which the shepherd david have teach they and now in the night-time on the quiet slope as they keep guard over they flock out of the darkness appear a heavenly visitor : whence he come they know not but round about he be a brightness which they know could be no other than the brightness of he presence which god cast about he messenger great fear fall upon they -- for who of mortal could stand before the heavenly being but the angel quick to see they fear speak in word which be the word of man and fall in peaceful accent : -- fear not say he for see i bring you glad tiding of a great joy that shall be to all the people for there have be bear to you this very day a savior who be the holy lord bear in the city of david and this shall be its sign to you : ye shall find a child wrap in swaddling-clothes lie in a manger and now suddenly before they could speak to the heavenly messenger they see not he alone but the place full of the like heavenly being a multitude be there they come not as if from some distant place but as angel that ever stand round these shepherd the eye of the man be open and they see besides the grassy slope and feed sheep and distant bethlehem and the star above a host of angel they ear be open and besides the move sheep and rustling bough they hear from this great army of heavenly being a song rise to god and fall like a blessing upon the sleep world : -- glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will to man in the lowly manger a little child on the hillside pasture a heavenly host singing he praise then it be once more quiet and the darkness be about the shepherd they look at one another and say -- let we go indeed to bethlehem to see this thing that have come to pass which the lord have make we know so in all haste with the sound of that hymn of glory in they ear they leave the pasture and seek the town they go to the inn but they look not there for the child where the manger be there they seek he and find he lie and by he joseph and mary there be other by the new-born child some who have doubtless come out from the inn at hearing of the birth whence be these shepherd they might have say to themselves and what have bring they to this birthplace to all by the manger the shepherd they mind full of the strange sight they have witness recount the marvel they tell how one appear with such brightness about he as in old time they have hear give witness that the lord god would speak to he people how they fear at he presence be quiet by he strange and joyful word and how when he have say ye shall find a child wrap in swaddling-clothes lie in a manger they suddenly be aware of a host of angel round about they sound praise to which god also listen those to whom they tell these thing be amaze indeed at the strangeness what do the marvel mean they wonder they could know no more than the shepherd have tell they and as for these man they go away to they flock again praise god for now they too have see the child and it be all true and with they human voice they catch up the song of rejoice which have fall from angelic lip there be one who hear it all and we may think do not say much or ask much but lay it away in she heart it be mary and she have in the treasure-house where she put away this wonder other thought and recollection in company with it there in she inmost heart she keep the remembrance of a heavenly visitor who have appear to she when she be alone and have quiet she fear by word that tell she of this come birth and fill she soul with the thought that he whom she should bear be to have the long-deserted throne and a kingdom without end she remember how when she visit she cousin elizabeth she be greet with a psalm of rejoice that spring to the lip of that holy woman and from she own heart have come a psalm of response and now the child be bear -- bear in the place of david yet bear to be lay in a manger a name have be give it by the angel and she call the child jesus for jesus mean savior and he shall say the angel save he people from they sin as joseph be a-walking old english carol as joseph be a-walking he hear a angel sing : -- this night there shall be bear we heavenly king he neither shall be bear in housen nor in hall nor in the place of paradise but in a ox 's stall he neither shall be clothèd in purple nor in pall but in the fair white linen that usen baby all he neither shall be rockèd in silver nor in gold but in a wooden cradle that rock on the mould he neither shall be christen in white wine nor in red but with fair spring water with which we be christen mary take she baby she dress he so sweet she lay he in a manger all there for to sleep as she stand over he she hear angel sing o bless we dear savior we heavenly king the peaceful night

they should not return to herod they depart into they own country another way the three king henry wadsworth longfellow three king come ride from far away melchior and gaspar and baltasar three wise man out of the east be they and they travel by night and they sleep by day for they guide be a beautiful wonderful star the star be so beautiful large and clear that all the other star of the sky become a white mist in the atmosphere and by this they know that the come be near of the prince foretold in the prophecy three casket they bear on they saddle-bow three casket of gold with golden key they robe be of crimson silk with row of bell and pomegranate and furbelow they turban like blossom almond-tree and so the three king ride into the west through the dusk of night over hill and dell and sometimes they nod with beard on breast and sometimes talk as they pause to rest with the people they meet at some wayside well of the child that be bear say baltasar good people i pray you tell we the news for we in the east have see he star and have ride fast and have ride far to find and worship the king of the jew and the people answer you ask in vain we know of no king but herod the great they think the wise man be man insane as they spur they horse across the plain like rider in haste and who can not wait and when they come to jerusalem herod the great who have hear this thing send for the wise man and question they and say go down unto bethlehem and bring I tiding of this new king so they ride away and the star stand still the only one in the gray of morn yes it stop -- it stand still of its own free will right over bethlehem on the hill the city of david where christ be bear and the three king ride through the gate and the guard through the silent street till they horse turn and neigh as they enter the great inn-yard but the window be close and the door be bar and only a light in the stable burned and cradle there in the scented hay in the air make sweet by the breath of kine the little child in the manger lay the child that would be king one day of a kingdom not human but divine he mother mary of nazareth sit watch beside he place of rest watch the even flow of he breath for the joy of life and the terror of death be mingle together in she breast they lay they offering at he foot : the gold be they tribute to a king the frankincense with its odor sweet be for the priest the paraclete the myrrh for the body 's bury and the mother wonder and bow she head and sit as still as a statue of stone she heart be trouble yet comfort remember what the angel have say of a endless reign and of david 's throne then the king ride out of the city gate with a clatter of hoof in proud array but they go not back to herod the great for they know he malice and fear he hate and return to they home by another way the three holy king adapt from the golden legend and other source in a far country in the day before jesus be bear in judea there be great astrologer who study the heaven by night and by day for they know of the prophecy which say that a star shall be bear or spring out of jacob and a man shall arise of the lineage of israel and twelve of they be choose to take heed who every year ascend upon a mountain which be call the hill of victory three day they abide there and pray we lord that he would show to they the star that balaam have say and prophesy now it happen on a time that they be there on the day of the nativity of jesus christ and a star come over they upon this mountain which have the form of a right fair child and under he head be a shine cross and from this cross come a voice say : to-day be there bear a king in judea now in arabia the land in which the soil be red with gold there reign a king call melchior and in saba where frankincense flow from the tree the king balthasar rule and in the land where myrrh hang from the bush the kingdom of tharsis reign a third king call caspar these three king also see the star and hear the voice and they each make ready to go on a journey and no one of the three know that the other intend thus to make a pilgrimage and they gather together they treasure to present to the king whom they should seek and summon those who should attend they so each set out with a great company and great estate and as they journey they find the mountain make level as the plain while the swollen river become as dry land and never do they lose sight of the star which shine upon they as the sun always move before they to guide they on they way but when they be come within two mile of jerusalem the star disappear a heavy fog arise and each party halt melchior as it fall out take he stand on mount calvary balthasar on the mount of olive and caspar just between they and when the fog clear away each be astonish to see two other great company besides he own and then the king first discover that all have come upon the same errand and they embrace with great joy and ride together into jerusalem and when they come into the city herod and all the people be trouble because of they so great company like unto a army then they demand in what place the king of the jew be bear for say they we have see he star in the orient and therefore we come to worship he and when herod have hear this he be much troubled and all jerusalem with he then herod call all the priest of the law and the doctor and demand of they where jesus christ should be bear and when he have understand they that he should be bear in bethlehem he call the three king apart and demand of they diligently the time that the star appear to they and he say to they that as soon as they should have find the child and have worship he that they should return and show it to he feign that he would worship he also though he think that he would go to slay he and as soon as the king be enter into jerusalem the sight of the star be take from they but when they be issue out of the city the star appear again and go before they until it come above the place in bethlehem where the child be and they have journey now full thirteen day and when they have enter into the place they worship the young child and mary he mother now the king have bring great treasure with they for it must be know that all that alexander the great left at he death and all that the queen of sheba give to king solomon and all that solomon collect for the temple have descend to the three king from they ancestor and all this they have now bring with they but when they have bow down before the child they be fill with fear and amazement because of the so great light which be in the place and they each offer quickly the first thing that come to they hand and forget all they other gift melchior offer thirty golden penny balthasar give frankincense and caspar myrrh but all else they quite forget and only remember that they bow before the child and say thanks be to god and when they would have stay to do honor to the holy child a angel come to they in a dream to warn they against herod who would do they harm so they depart each to he own country journey for two year and they preach unto the people tell they of the new-born king and everywhere upon the temple man place the figure of a star the child and a cross now it happen year later that st thoma the apostle journey to the far country to preach and that he wonder why the star be place upon the temple then the priest in those temple tell he about the three king and how they have journey to bethlehem and have see the young child and the three king be very old and feeble but when they hear about st thoma each set out from he own place to go to meet he and when they have come together they build they a city and live together there for two year worship god and preach then melchior die and be bury in a large and costly tomb and when balthasar die he too be bury there and at last caspar be place beside he companion now in the day of constantine the great he mother helena determine to find the body of the three king and for this she make a journey to the far country and when she have find they she bring they to constantinople to the church of st sophium where they be hold in much honor and from constantinople they be take to milan where again many pilgrim come now when frederick barbarossa lay siege to the city of milan he rejoice above all else to find they there and by he they be take to cologne and there a golden shrine be build in which the bone of the three holy king be place that there they might remain until the judgment day the three king of cologne eugene field from out cologne there come three king to worship jesus christ they king to he they seek fine herb they bring and many a beauteous golden thing they bring they gift to bethlehem town and in that manger set they down then speak the first king and he say : o child most heavenly bright and fair i bring this crown to bethlehem town for thee and only thee to wear so give a heavenly crown to I when i shall come at last to thee the second then i bring thee here this royal robe o child he cry of silk ` tis spin and such a one there be not in the world beside so in the day of doom requite I with a heavenly robe of white the third king give he gift and quoth : spikenard and myrrh to thee i bring and with these twain would i most fain anoint the body of my king so may they incense sometime rise to plead for I in yonder sky thus speak the three king of cologne that give they gift and go they way and now kneel i in prayer hard by the cradle of the child to-day nor crown nor robe nor spice i bring as offer unto christ my king yet have i bring a gift the child may not despise however small for here i lay my heart to-day and it be full of love to all take thou the poor but loyal thing my only tribute christ my king babouscka adelaide skeel if you be a russian child you would not watch to see santa klaus come down the chimney but you would stand by the window to catch a peep at poor babouscka as she hurry by who be babouscka be she santa klaus ' wife no indeed she be only a poor little crooked wrinkled old woman who come at christmas time into everybody 's house who peep into every cradle turn back every coverlid drop a tear on the baby 's white pillow and go away very sorrowful and not only at christmas time but through all the cold winter and especially in march when the wind blow loud and whistle and howl and die away like a sigh the russian child hear the rustling step of the babouscka she be always in a hurry one hear she running fast along the crowded street and over the quiet country field she seem to be out of breath and tired yet she hurry on whom be she try to overtake she scarcely look at the little child as they press they rosy face against the window pane and whisper to each other be the babouscka look for we no she will not stop only on christmas eve will she come up-stair into the nursery and give each little one a present you must not think she leave handsome gift such as santa klaus bring for you she do not bring bicycle to the boy or french doll to the girl she do not come in a gay little sleigh draw by reindeer but hobble along on foot and she lean on a crutch she have she old apron fill with candy and cheap toy and the child all love she dearly they watch to see she come and when one hear a rustling he cry lo the babouscka then all other look but one must turn one 's head very quickly or she vanish i never see she myself best of all she love little baby and often when the tired mother sleep she bend over they cradle put she brown wrinkled face close down to the pillow and look very sharply what be she look for ah that you can not guess unless you know she sad story long long ago a great many yesterday ago the babouscka who be even then a old woman be busy sweep she little hut she live in the coldest corner of cold russium and she live alone in a lonely place where four wide road meet these road be at this time white with snow for it be winter time in the summer when the field be full of flower and the air full of sunshine and singing bird babouscka 's home do not seem so very quiet but in the winter with only the snow-flake and the shy snow-bird and the loud wind for company the little old woman feel very cheerless but she be a busy old woman and as it be already twilight and she home but half sweep she feel in a great hurry to finish she work before bed-time you must know the babouscka be poor and could not afford to do she work by candle-light presently down the widest and the lonesomest of the white road there appear a long train of people come they be walk slowly and seem to be ask each other question as to which way they should take as the procession come nearer and finally stop outside the little hut babouscka be frighten at the splendor there be three king with crown on they head and the jewel on the king ' breastplate sparkle like sunlight they heavy fur cloak be white with the fall snow-flake and the queer humpy camel on which they ride look white as milk in the snow-storm the harness on the camel be decorate with gold and plate of silver adorn the saddle the saddlecloth be of the richest eastern stuff and all the servant have the dark eye and hair of a eastern people the slave carry heavy load on they back and each of the three king carry a present one carry a beautiful transparent jar and in the fading light babouscka could see in it a golden liquid which she know from its color must be myrrh another have in he hand a richly weave bag and it seem to be heavy as indeed it be for it be full of gold the third have a stone vase in he hand and from the rich perfume which fill the snowy air one could guess the vase to have be fill with incense babouscka be terribly frighten so she hide herself in she hut and let the servant knock a long time at she door before she dare open it and answer they question as to the road they should take to a far-away town you know she have never study a geography lesson in she life be old and stupid and scared she know the way across the field to the nearest village but she know nothing else of all the wide world full of city the servant scold but the three king speak kindly to she and ask she to accompany they on they journey that she might show they the way as far as she know it they tell she in word so simple that she could not fail to understand that they have see a star in the sky and be follow it to a little town where a young child lay the snow be in the sky now and the star be lose out of sight who be the child ask the old woman he be a king and we go to worship he they answer these present of gold frankincense and myrrh be for he when we find he we will take the crown off we head and lay they at he foot come with we babouscka what do you suppose should not you have think the poor little woman would have be glad to leave she desolate home on the plain to accompany these king on they journey but the foolish woman shake she head no the night be dark and cheerless and she little home be warm and cosy she look up into the sky and the star be nowhere to be see besides she want to put she hut in order -- perhaps she would be ready to go to-morrow but the three king could not wait so when to-morrow 's sun rise they be far ahead on they journey it seem like a dream to poor babouscka for even the track of the camel ' foot be cover by the deep white snow everything be the same as usual and to make sure that the night 's visitor have not be a fancy she find she old broom hang on a peg behind the door where she have put it when the servant knock now that the sun be shine and she remember the glitter of the gold and the smell of the sweet gum and myrrh she wish she have go with the traveller and she think a great deal about the little baby the three king have go to worship she have no child of she own -- nobody love she -- ah if she have only go the more she brood on the think the more miserable she grow till the very sight of she home become hateful to she it be a dreadful feeling to realize that one have lose a chance of happiness there be a feeling call remorse that can gnaw like a sharp little tooth babouscka feel this little tooth cut into she heart every time she remember the visit of the three king after a while the thought of the little child become she first thought at wake and she last at night one day she shut the door of she house forever and set out on a long journey she have no hope of overtake the three king but she long to find the child that she too might love and worship he she ask every one she meet and some people think she crazy but other give she kind answer have you perhaps guess that the young child whom the three king seek be we lord himself people tell babouscka how he be bear in a manger and many other thing which you child have learn long ago these answer puzzle the old dame mightily she have but one idea in she ignorant head the three king have go to seek a baby she would if not too late seek he too she forget i be sure how many long year have go by she look in vain for the christ-child in he manger-cradle she spend all she little savings in toy and candy so as to make friend with little child that they might not run away when she come hobble into they nursery now you know for whom she be sadly seek when she push back the bed-curtain and bend down over each baby 's pillow sometimes when the old grandmother sit nod by the fire and the bigger child sleep in they bed old babouscka come hobble into the room and whisper softly be the young child here ah no she have come too late too late but the little child know she and love she two thousand year ago she lose the chance of find he crooked wrinkled old sick and sorry she yet live on look into each baby 's face -- always disappointed always seek will she find he at last the flight into egypt selma lagerlöf far away in a desert in the east there grow many year ago a palm that be very very old and very very tall no one pass through the desert could help stop to look at it for it be much higher than other palm and people say of it that it would surely grow to be higher than the obelisk and pyramid this great palm standing in its loneliness and look over the desert one day see something which cause its huge crown of leaf to wave to and fro with surprise on its slender stem on the outskirts of the desert two lonely person be wander they be still so far away that even a camel would have look no larger than a ant at that distance but they be assuredly human being two who be stranger to the desert -- for the palm know the people of the desert -- a man and a woman who have neither guide nor beast of burden nor tent nor water-bag verily say the palm to itself these two have come hither to die the palm look quickly around i be surprised it say that the lion have not already go out to seize they prey but i do not see a single one about nor do i see any of the robber of the desert but they be sure to come there await they a sevenfold death think the palm the lion will devour they the serpent will sting they thirst will consume they the sand-storm will bury they the robber will kill they the burning sun will overcome they fear will destroy they the palm try to think of something else the fate of these two make it sad but in the immeasurable desert around it there be not a single thing that the palm have not know and gaze at for thousand of year nothing could attract its attention it be again oblige to think of the two wanderer by the drought and the wind say the palm invoke the two greatest enemy of life what be the woman carry on she arm i believe these mad people have a little child with they the palm which be long-sighted as the aged generally be saw aright the woman carry in she arm a child that have lay its head on she breast and be sleep the child have not even enough clothes on say the palm i see that the mother have lift up she skirt and throw it over it she have take it out of its bed in great haste and hurry away with it now i understand : these people be fugitive but they be mad all the same continue the palm if they have not a angel to protect they they should rather have let they enemy do they worst than have take refuge in the desert i can imagine how it have all happen the man be at work the child sleep in its cradle the woman have go to fetch water when she have go a few step from the door she see the enemy approach she rush in seize the child call to the husband that he shall follow she and run away since then they have continue they flight the whole day they have assuredly not rest a single moment yes so it have all happen but i say all the same if no angel protect they -- they be in such fear that they do not feel either fatigue or other suffering but i read thirst in they eye i think i should know the face of a thirsty man and when the palm begin to think about thirst a fit of tremble go through its high stem and the innumerable frond of its long leaf curl up as if hold over a fire if i be a man it say i would never venture into the desert he be truly brave who venture here without have root reach down to the inexhaustible water-vein there can be danger even for palm even for such a palm as i could i advise they i would beg they to return they enemy could never be as cruel to they as the desert they think perhaps that it be easy to live in the desert but i know that even i at time have have difficulty in keep alive i remember once in my youth when a whirlwind throw a whole mountain of sand over I i be nearly choke if i _ could _ die i should have die then the palm continue to think aloud as lonely old people do i hear a wonderful melodious murmur pass through my crown it say all the frond of my leaf must be move i do not know why the sight of these poor stranger move I so but this sorrowful woman be so beautiful it remind I of the most wonderful thing that ever happen to I and whilst its leaf continue they melodious rustle the palm remember how once long long ago a glorious human being have visit the oasis it be the queen of sheba accompany by the wise king solomon the beautiful queen be on she way back to she own country the king have accompany she part of the way and now they be about to part in memory of this moment say the queen i now plant a date-kernel in the earth and i ordain that from it shall grow a palm which shall live and grow until a king be bear in judaea greater than solomon and as she say this she place the kernel in the ground and she tear water it how can it be that i should just happen to think of this to-day say the palm can it be possible that this woman be so beautiful that she remind I of the most beautiful of all queen of she at whose bidding i have live and grow to this very day i hear my leaf rustling stronger and stronger say the palm and it sound sorrowful like a death-song it be as if they prophesy that someone should soon pass away it be well to know that it be not mean for I inasmuch that i can not die the palm think that the death-song in its leaf must be for the two lonely wanderer they themselves surely think that they last hour be draw near one could read it in they face when they walk past one of the skeleton of the camel that lay by the roadside one see it from the glance with which they watch a couple of vulture fly past it could not be otherwise -- they must perish they have now discover the palm in the oasis and hasten thither to find water but when they at last reach it they sink down in despair for the well be dry up the woman exhaust lay down the child and sit down cry by the side of the well the man throw himself down by she side he lay and beat the ground with he clenched hand the palm hear they say to each other that they must die it also understand from they conversation that king herod have cause all child of two or three year of age to be kill from fear that the great expected king in judaea have be bear it rustle stronger and stronger in my leaf say the palm these poor fugitive have soon come to they last moment it also hear that they be afraid of the desert the man say it would have be better to remain and fight the soldier than to flee he say that it would have be a easier death god will surely help we say the woman we be all alone amongst serpent and beast of prey say the man we have no food and no water how can god help we he tear he clothes in despair and press he face against the earth he be hopeless like a man with a mortal wound in he heart the woman sit upright with she hand fold upon she knee but the glance she cast over the desert speak of unutterable despair the palm hear the sorrowful rustling in its leaf grow still stronger the woman have evidently hear it too for she look up to the crown of the tree and in the same moment she involuntarily raise she arm date date she cry there be such a longing in she voice that the old palm wish it have not be any higher than the gorse and that its date have be as easy to reach as the red berry of the hawthorn it know that its crown be full of cluster of date but how could man reach to such a dazzling height the man have already see that the date be so high it be impossible to reach they he do not even lift he head he tell he wife that she must not wish for the impossible but the child which have crawl about alone and be play with stick and straw hear the mother 's exclamation the little one could probably not understand why he mother should not have everything she wish for as soon as he hear the word date he begin to look at the tree he wonder and ponder how he should get the date there come almost wrinkle on he forehead under the fair lock at last a smile pass over he face now he know what he would do he go to the palm stroke it with he little hand and say in he gentle childish voice : bend down palm bend down palm but what be this what could this be the palm-leaves rustle as if a hurricane rush through they and shudder upon shudder pass through the tall stem and the palm feel that the little one be the stronger it could not resist he and with its high stem it bow down before the child as man bow down before prince in a mighty arch it lower itself towards earth and at last bow so low that its great crown of tremble leaf sweep the sand of the desert the child do not seem to be either frightened or surprised but with a joyous exclamation it run and pluck one cluster after another from the crown of the old palm when the child have gather enough and the tree be still lie on the earth he again go to it stroke it and say in he gentlest voice : arise palm arise and the great tree raise itself silently and obediently on its stem whilst the leaf play like harp now i know for whom they play the death-song the old palm say to itself when it again stand erect it be not for any of these stranger but the man and woman kneel down on they knee and praise god thou hast see we fear and take it from we thou art the mighty one that bend the stem of the palm like a reed of whom should we be afraid when thy strength protect we next time a caravan pass through the desert one of the traveller see that the crown of the great palm have wither how can that have happen say the traveller have we not hear that this palm should not die before it have see a king greater than solomon perhaps it have see he answer another wanderer of the desert the haughty aspen _ a german legend _ nora archibald smith as i go through the tangled

stature and stronger than any man whom the world have ever see therefore be he call offero or the bearer now he serve the king of canaan but he be proud of he great strength and upon a time it come in he mind that he would seek the greatest king who then reign and he only would he serve and obey so he travel from one country to another until at length he come to one where rule a powerful king whose fame be great in all the land thou art the conqueror of nation ask offero i be reply the king then take I into you service for i will serve none but the mightiest of earth that then be i return the king for truly i fear none so the king receive offero into he service and make he to dwell in he court but once at eventide a minstrel sing before the king a merry song in which he name oft the evil one and every time that the king hear the name of satan he grow pale and hastily make the sign of the cross upon he forehead offero marvel thereat and demand of the king the meaning of the sign and wherefore he thus cross himself and because the king would not tell he offero say if thou tell I not i shall no longer dwell with thee then the king answer say always when i hear satan name i fear that he may have power over I and therefore i make this sign that he harm I not who be satan ask offero he be a wicked monarch reply the king wicked but powerful more powerful than thou art aye verily and fearest thou that he hurt thee that do i and so do all then cry offero be he more mighty and greater than thou art i will go seek he henceforth he shall be my master for i would fain serve the mightiest and the greatest lord of all the world so offero depart from the king and seek satan everywhere he meet people who have give themselves over to he rule and at last one day as he be cross a wide desert he see a great company of knight approach one of they mount upon a great black horse come to he and demand whither he go and offero make answer i seek satan for he be mighty and i would fain serve he then return the knight i be he whom thou seekest when offero hear these word he be right glad and take satan to be he lord and master this king be indeed powerful and a long time do offero serve he but it chance one day as they be journey together they come to a place where four road meet and in the midst of the space stand a little cross as soon as satan see the cross he be afraid and turn quickly aside and flee toward the desert offero follow he marvel much at the sight and after when they have come back to the highway they have leave he inquire of satan why he be thus trouble and have go so far out of he way to avoid the cross but satan answer he not a word then offero say to he if thou wilt not tell I i shall depart from thee straightway and shall serve thee no more know then say satan there be a man call christ who suffer on the cross and whenever i see he sign i be sore afraid and flee from it lest he destroy I if then thou art afraid of he sign cry offero he be greater and more mighty than thou and i see well that i have labor in vain for i have not find the greatest lord of the world i will serve thee no longer go thy way alone for i will go to seek christ and when he have long seek and demand where he should find he he come at length into a great desert where dwell a hermit a servant of the christ the hermit tell he of the master whom he be seek and say to he this king whom thou dost wish to serve be not a earthly ruler and he requireth that thou oft fast and make many prayer but offero understand not the meaning of worship and prayer and he answer require of I some other thing and i shall do it but i know naught of this which thou requirest then the hermit say to he knowest thou the river a day 's journey from here where there be neither ford nor bridge and many perish and be lose thou art large and strong therefore go thou and dwell by this river and bear over all who desire to cross its water that be a service which will be well please to the christ whom thou desirest to serve and sometime if i mistake not he whom thou seekest will come to thee offero be right joyful at these word and answer this service may i well do so he

wax heavy insomuch that he fear that they would both be drown already he strength be nearly go but he think of he master whom he have not yet see and stay he footstep with he palm staff struggle with all he might to reach the opposite shore as at last he climb the steep bank suddenly the storm cease and the water calm he set the child down upon the shore say child thou hast put I in great peril have i carry the whole world on my shoulder the weight have not be greater i might bear no greater burden offero answer the child marvel not but rejoice for thou hast bear not only all the world upon thee but thou hast bear he that create and make all the world upon thy shoulder i be christ the king whom thou servest in this work and for a token that thou mayst know what i say to be the truth set thy staff in the earth by thy house and thou shalt see in the morning that it shall bear flower and fruit with these word the child vanish from offero 's sight but offero do even as he be bid and set he staff in the earth and when he arise on the morrow he find it like a palm-tree bearing flower and leave and cluster of date then he know that it be indeed christ whom he have bear through the water

fewer still to translate amid such influence the life of a cowherd could scarcely be lift above that of the beast he care for if he hunger and thirst be satisfied he would ask no more than a pleasant daisied meadow in summer and a warm nook in the winter but caedmon have a sensitive nature that crave something nobler when the minstrel strike they harp and sing the wild tradition and fierce conflict of they tribe and the guest follow with boisterous jest in they uncouth ballad caedmon sit silent and gloomy one evening as the harp pass from one to another draw nearer he dread the oft-repeated taunt of he fellow he creep away in the shadow and go to he only bed -- a truss of straw after a while he sleep and in he sleep some one of lofty stature and with kindly-beaming eye stand

in December brother franci with one companion be walk through the beautiful valley of the velino river toward rietus a little city where he come often on he way from assisus to rome to-night he have turn somewhat aside from the main road for he wish to spend christmas with he friend sir john of greccio greccio be a tiny village lie where the foothill begin on the western side of the valley the very foot of brother franci know the road so well that he could have walk safely in the darkness but it be not dark the full moon float over the valley make the narrow river and the sharp outline of the snow-covered mountain shine like silver the plain and the lower hill be pasture land and not far from the road on a grassy slope the brother see the red glow of a almost spend shepherd ' fire let we stop and visit we brother the shepherd say franci and they turn toward the fading fire there be no sense of winter in the air scarcely a touch of frost and the only snow be that on the silver peak against the sky the shepherd three man and one boy lay sleep soundly on the bare ground with they sheepskin coat draw closely around they all about they the sheep be sleep too but the solemn white sheep dog be wide awake if a stranger 's foot have tread the grass never so softly every dog would have bark and every shepherd would have be on he foot in a instant but the dog trot silently up to the gray brother and rub against they as if they say we be glad to see you again for they know the friendly foot of the little poor man and they have more than once help he to eat the bread that be he only dinner follow by the dog franci walk about among the shepherd but they sleep on as only man who live out of door can sleep and franci could not find it in he heart to waken they the sheep lay huddle together in group for more warmth around one small square of grass a net be stretch and inside it be the mother sheep who have little lamb there be no sound except the faint cry now and then of a baby lamb the coal over which the shepherd have cook they supper pale from dull red to gray and there be only a thin column of smoke white in the moonlight franci sit down on a stone and the largest of the white dog press up against he knee another go dutifully back to he post beside the fold where the mother and baby sleep the italian hillside seem to franci to change to that of bethlehem which he have see perhaps on he eastern journey the clear December night seem like that of the first christmas eve how these shepherd sleep he think how they would awaken if they hear the ` peace on earth ' of the angel ' song then he remember sadly how the army that call themselves christian have year after year battle with the saracen over the cradle and the tomb of the prince of peace the moonlight grow misty about he the silver height of the mountain and the silver line of the river fade for the eye of brother franci be full of tear as the two brother go on they way franci grow light of heart again the sight of the shepherd sleep on the grass have give he a new idea and he be plan a surprise for he friend at greccio for at greccio all be he friend from sir john he host down to the baby in the street in the valley of rietus he be almost as well know and as dearly love as in he own valley of assisus the child of greccio have never hear of christmas tree nor perhaps of christmas present i be not sure that in the thirteenth century italian have the beautiful custom which they now have of give present at twelfth night in memory of the come of the three king with they gift to the christ child but in the thirteenth century even as now christmas be the happiest festival of the year this year all the folk of greccio big and little be happier than usual because they beloved brother franci be to help they keep they christmas-tide next day franci confide he plan to he friend sir john who promise that all should be ready on christmas eve on the day before christmas the people come from all the country around to see and hear brother franci man woman and child dress in they holiday clothes walk ride on donkey crowd into little cart draw by great white ox from everywhere and in every fashion the country folk come toward greccio many come from far away and the early winter darkness fall long before they could reach the town the light of they torch might be see on the open road and the sound of they singing reach the gate of greccio before they that night the little town be almost as crowd as be bethlehem on the eve of the first christmas the crowd be poor folk for the most part peasant from the field charcoal burner from the mountain shepherd in they sheepskin coat and trousers make with the wool outside so that the wearer look like strange two-legged animal the four shepherd who have sleep so soundly a few night before be of the company but they know nothing of they midnight visitor the white dog know but they could keep a secret the shepherd be almost as quiet as they dog they always talk and sing less than other people have grow use to long silence among they sheep gather at last into the square before the church by the light of flare torch for the moon would rise late the people see with wonder and delight the surprise which brother franci and sir john have prepare for they they look into a real stable there be the manger full of hay there be a live ox and a live ass even by torchlight they breath show in the frosty air and there on the hay lay a real baby wrap from the cold asleep and smile it look as sweet and innocent as the christ child himself the people shout with delight they clap they hand and wave they torch then there be silence for brother franci stand before they and the voice they love so well and have come so far to hear begin to read the old story of the birth of the child jesus of the shepherd in the field and of the angel ' song when the reading be end brother franci talk to they as a father might speak to he child he tell of the love that be gentle as a little child that be willing to be poor and humble as the baby who be lay in a manger among the cattle he beg he listener to put anger and hatred and envy out of they heart this christmas eve and to think only thought of peace and good will all listen eagerly while brother franci speak but the moment he finish the great crowd break into singing from the church tower the bell ring loud the torch wave wildly while voice here and there shout for brother franci and for the bless little christ never before have such glorious hymn nor such joyous shout be hear in the town of greccio only the mother with baby in they arm and the shepherd in they woolly coat look on silently and think : we be in bethlehem the sin of the prince bishop william canton the prince bishop evrard stand gaze at he marvellous cathedral and as he let he eye wander in delight over the three deep sculptured portal and the double gallery above they and the great rise window and the ringer ' gallery and so up to the massive western tower he feel as though he heart be clap hand for joy within he and he think to himself surely in all the world god have no more beautiful house than this which i have build with such long labor and at so princely a outlay of my treasure and thus the prince bishop fall into the sin of vainglory and though he be a holy man he do not perceive that he have fall so fill with gladness be he at the sight of he complete work in the double gallery of the west front there be many great statue with crown and sceptre but a niche over the central portal be empty and this the prince bishop intend to fill with a statue of himself it be to be a very small simple statue as become one who prize lowliness of heart but as he look up at the vacant place it give he pleasure to think that hundred of year after he be dead people would pause before he effigy and praise he and he work and this too be vainglory as the prince bishop lay asleep that night a mighty six-winged angel stand beside he and bid he rise come he say and i will show thee some of those who have work with thee in build the great church and whose service in god 's eye have be more worthy than thine and the angel lead he past the cathedral and down the steep street of the ancient city and though it be midday the people go to and fro do not seem to see they beyond the gate they follow the shelve road till they come to green level field and there in the middle of the road between grassy bank cover white with cherry blossom two great white ox yoke to a huge block of stone stand rest before they begin the toilsome ascent look say the angel and the prince bishop see a little blue-winged bird which perch on the stout yoke beam fasten to the horn of the ox and sing such a heavenly song of rest and contentment that the big shaggy creature cease to blow stormily through they nostril and draw long tranquil breath instead look again say the angel and from a hut of wattle and clay a little peasant girl come with a bundle of hay in she arm and give first one of the ox and then the other a wisp then she stroke they black muzzle and lay she rosy face against they white cheek then the prince bishop see the rude teamster rise from he rest on the bank and cry to he cattle and the oxen strain against the beam and the thick rope tighten and the huge block of stone be once more set in motion and when the prince bishop see that it be these fellow-worker whose service be more worthy in god 's eye than he own he be abashed and sorrowful for he sin and the tear of he own weep awake he so he send for the master of the sculptor and bid he fill the little niche over the middle portal not with he own effigy but with a image of the child and he bid he make two colossal figure of the white ox and to the great wonderment of the people these be set up high in the tower so that man could see they against the blue sky and as for I he say let my body be bury with my face downward outside the great church in front of the middle entrance that man may trample on my vainglory and that i may serve they as a stepping-stone to the house of god and the little child shall look on I when i lie in the dust now the little girl in the niche be carve with wisp of hay in she hand but the child who have feed the oxen know nothing of this and as she grow up she forget she childish service so that when she have grow to womanhood and chance to see this statue over the portal she do not know it be she own self in stone but what she have do be not forget in heaven and as for the ox one of they look east and one look west across the wide fruitful country about the foot of the hill-city and one catch the first gray gleam and the first rosy flush and the first golden splendor of the sunrise and the other be light with the color of the sunset long after the lowland have fade away in the blue mist of the twilight weary man and worn woman look up at they feel that a gladness and a glory and a deep peace have fall on the life of toil and then when people begin to understand they say it be well that these mighty laborer who have help to build the house should still find a place of service and honor in the house and they remember that the master of the house have once be a babe warm in a manger by the breath of kine and at the thought of this man grow more pitiful to they cattle and to the beast in servitude and to all dumb animal and that be one good fruit which spring from the prince bishop 's repentance now over the colossal stone ox hang the bell of the cathedral on christmas eve the ringer accord to the old custom ascend to they gallery to ring in the birth of the babe divine at the moment of midnight the master ringer give the word and the great bell begin to swing in joyful sequence down below in the crowded church lay the image of the new-born child on the cold straw and at he haloed head stand the image of the ox and the ass far out across the snow-roofed city far away over the white glistening country ring the glad music of the tower people who go to they door to listen cry in astonishment : hark what strange music be that it sound as if the lowing of cattle be mingle with the chime of the bell in truth it be so and in every byre the ox and the kine answer the strange sweet cadence with they lowing and the great stone ox low back to they kin of the meadow through the deep note of the joy-peal in the fulness of time the prince bishop evrard die and be bury as he have will with he face humbly turn to the earth and to this day the weather-wasted figure of the little girl look down on he from she niche and the slab over he grave serve as a stepping-stone to pious foot take by permission of ep dutton and company from a child 's

cloister and that they be unable to drive she out and must call for assistance but abbot han upbraid they for use force and forbid they call for help he send both monk back to they work and although he be a old and fragile man he take with he only the lay brother when abbot han come out in the garden robber mother be still wander among the flower-bed he regard she with astonishment he be certain that robber mother have never before see a herb garden yet she saunter leisurely between all the small patch each of which have be plant with its own species of rare flower and look at they as if they be old acquaintance at some she smile at other she shake she head abbot han love he herb garden as much as it be possible for he to love anything earthly and perishable wild and terrible as the old woman look he could not help liking that she have fight with three monk for the privilege of view the garden in peace he come up to she and ask in a mild tone if the garden please she robber mother turn defiantly toward abbot han for she expect only to be trap and overpower but when she notice he white hair and bent form she answer peaceably first when i see this i think i have never see a prettier garden but now i see that it can not be compare with one i know of abbot han have certainly expect a different answer when he hear that robber mother have see a garden more beautiful than he a faint flush spread over he withered cheek the lay brother who be stand close by immediately begin to censure the old woman this be abbot han say he who with much care and diligence have gather the flower from far and near for he herb garden we all know that there be not a more beautiful garden to be find in all skåne and it be not befitting that you who live in the wild forest all the year around should find fault with he work i do not wish to make myself the judge of either he or you say robber mother i be only say that if you could see the garden of which i be think you would uproot all the flower plant here and cast they away like weed but the abbot 's assistant be hardly less proud of the flower than the abbot himself and after hear she remark he laugh derisively i can understand that you only talk like this to tease we it must be a pretty garden that you have make for yourself amongst the pine in göinge forest i would be willing to wager my soul 's salvation that you have never before be within the wall of a herb garden robber mother grow crimson with rage to think that she word be doubt and she cry out : it may be true that until to-day i have never be within the wall of a herb garden but you monk who be holy man certainly must know that on every christmas eve the great göinge forest be transform into a beautiful garden to commemorate the hour of we lord 's birth we who live in the forest have see this happen every year and in that garden i have see flower so lovely that i dare not lift my hand to pluck they the lay brother want to continue the argument but abbot han give he a sign to be silent for ever since he childhood abbot han have hear it say that on every christmas eve the forest be dress in holiday glory he have often long to see it but he have never have the good fortune eagerly he beg and implore robber mother that he might come up to the robber ' cave on christmas eve if she would only send one of she child to show he the way he could ride up there alone and he would never betray they -- on the contrary he would reward they in so far as it lay in he power robber mother say no at first for she be think of robber father and of the peril which might befall he should she permit abbot han to ride up to they cave at the same time the desire to prove to the monk that the garden which she know be more beautiful than he get the better of she and she give in but more than one follower you can not take with you say she and you be not to waylay we or trap we as sure as you be a holy man this abbot han promise and then robber mother go she way abbot han command the lay brother not to reveal to a soul that which have be agree upon he fear that the monk should they learn of he purpose would not allow a man of he year to go up to the robber ' cave nor do he himself intend to reveal he project to a human being and then it happen that archbishop absalon from lund come to övid and remain through the night when abbot han be show he the herb garden he get to thinking of robber mother 's visit and the lay brother who be at work in the garden hear abbot han tell the bishop about robber father who these many year have live as a outlaw in the forest and ask he for a letter of ransom for the man that he might lead a honest life among respectable folk as thing be now say abbot han he child be grow up into worse malefactor than himself and you will soon have a whole gang of robber to deal with up there in the forest but the archbishop reply that he do not care to let the robber loose among honest folk in the village it would be best for all that he remain in the forest then abbot han grow zealous and tell the bishop all about göinge forest which every year at yuletide clothe itself in summer bloom around the robber ' cave if these bandit be not so bad but that god 's glory can be make manifest to they surely we can not be too wicked to experience the same blessing the archbishop know how to answer abbot han this much i will promise you abbot han he say smile that any day you send I a blossom from the garden in göinge forest i will give you letter of ransom for all the outlaw you may choose to plead for the lay brother apprehend that bishop absalon believe as little in this story of robber mother 's as he himself but abbot han perceive nothing of the sort but thank absalon for he good promise and say that he would surely send he the flower abbot han have he way and the follow christmas eve he do not sit at home with he monk in övid cloister but be on he way to göinge forest one of robber mother 's wild youngster run ahead of he and close behind he be the lay brother who have talk with robber mother in the herb garden abbot han have be longing to make this journey and he be very happy now that it have come to pass but it be a different matter with the lay brother who accompany he abbot han be very dear to he and he would not willingly have allow another to attend he and watch over he but he do not believe that he should see any christmas eve garden he think the whole thing a snare which robber mother have with great cunning lay for abbot han that he might fall into she husband 's clutch while abbot han be ride toward the forest he see that everywhere they be prepare to celebrate christmas in every peasant settlement fire be light in the bathhouse to warm it for the afternoon bathing great hunk of meat and bread be be carry from the larder into the cabin and from the barn come the man with big sheaf of straw to be strew over the floor as he ride by the little country church he observe that each parson with he sexton be busily engage in decorate he church and when he come to the road which lead to bösjo cloister he observe that all the poor of the parish be come with armful of bread and long candle which they have receive at the cloister gate when abbot han see all these christmas preparation he haste increase he be think of the festivity that await he which be greater than any the other would be privileged to enjoy but the lay brother whine and fret when he see how they be prepare to celebrate christmas in every humble cottage he grow more and more anxious and begged and implored abbot han to turn back and not to throw himself deliberately into the robber 's hand abbot han go straight ahead pay no heed to he lamentation he leave the plain behind he and come up into desolate and wild forest region here the road be bad almost like a stony and burr-strewn path with neither bridge nor plank to help they over brooklet and rivulet the farther they ride the colder it grow and after a while they come upon snow-covered ground it turn out to be a long and hazardous ride through the forest they climb steep and slippery side path crawl over swamp and marsh and push through windfall and bramble just as daylight be wane the robber boy guide they across a forest meadow skirt by tall naked leaf tree and green fir tree back of the meadow loom a mountain wall and in this wall they see a door of thick board now abbot han understand that they have arrive and dismount the child open the heavy door for he and he look into a poor mountain grotto with bare stone wall robber mother be seat before a log fire that burn in the middle of the floor alongside the wall be bed of virgin pine and moss and on one of these bed lay robber father asleep come in you out there shout robber mother without rise and fetch the horse in with you so they will not be destroy by the night cold abbot han walk boldly into the cave and the lay brother follow here be wretchedness and poverty and nothing be do to celebrate christmas robber mother have neither brew nor baked she have neither wash nor scour the youngster be lie on the floor around a kettle eating but no better food be provide for they than a watery gruel robber mother speak in a tone as haughty and dictatorial as any well-to-do peasant woman sit down by the fire and warm yourself abbot han say she and if you have food with you eat for the food which we in the forest prepare you would not care to taste and if you be tire after the long journey you can lie down on one of these bed to sleep you need not be afraid of oversleep for i be sit here by the fire keep watch i shall awaken you in time to see that which you have come up here to see abbot han obey robber mother and bring forth he food sack but he be so fatigue after the journey he be hardly able to eat and as soon as he could stretch himself on the bed he fall asleep the lay brother be also assign a bed to rest upon but he do not dare sleep as he think he have better keep he eye on robber father to prevent he get up and capture abbot han but gradually fatigue get the better of he too and he drop into a doze when he wake up he see that abbot han have leave he bed and be sit by the fire talk with robber mother the outlaw robber sit also by the fire he be a tall raw-boned man with a dull sluggish appearance he back be turn to abbot han as though he would have it appear that he be not listen to the conversation abbot han be tell robber mother all about the christmas preparation he have see on the journey remind she of christmas feast and game which she must have know in she youth when she live at peace with mankind i be sorry for you child who can never run on the village street in holiday dress or tumble in the christmas straw say he at first robber mother answer in short gruff sentence but by degree she become more subdue and listen more intently suddenly robber father turn toward abbot han and shake he clenched fist in he face you miserable monk do you come here to coax from I my wife and child do not you know that i be a outlaw and may not leave the forest abbot han look he fearlessly in the eye it be my purpose to get a letter of ransom for you from archbishop absalon say he he have hardly finish speak when the robber and he wife burst out laugh they know well enough the kind of mercy a forest robber could expect from bishop absalon oh if i get a letter of ransom from absalon say robber father then i 'll promise you that never again will i steal so much as a goose the lay brother be annoy with the robber folk for daring to laugh at abbot han but on he own account he be well pleased he have seldom see the abbot sit more peaceful and meek with he monk at övid than he now sit with this wild robber folk suddenly robber mother rise you sit here and talk abbot han she say so that we be forget to look at the forest now i can hear even in this cave how the christmas bell be ring the word be barely utter when they all spring up and rush out but in the forest it be still dark night and bleak winter the only thing they mark be a distant clang bear on a light south wind how can this bell ringing ever awaken the dead forest think abbot han for now as he stand out in the winter darkness he think it far more impossible that a summer garden could spring up here than it have seem to he before when the bell have be ring a few moment a sudden illumination penetrate the forest the next moment it be dark again and then the light come back it push its way forward between the stark tree like a shimmering mist this much it effect : the darkness merge into a faint daybreak then abbot han see that the snow have vanish from the ground as if some one have remove a carpet and the earth begin to take on a green cover then the fern shoot up they frond roll like a bishop 's staff the heather that grow on the stony hill and the bog-myrtle root in the ground moss dress themselves quickly in new bloom the moss-tuft thicken and raise themselves and the spring blossom shoot upward they swell bud which already have a touch of color abbot han ' heart beat fast as he mark the first sign of the forest 's awaken old man that i be shall i behold such a miracle think he and the tear want to spring to he eye again it grow so hazy that he fear the darkness would once more cover the earth but almost immediately there come a new wave of light it bring with it the splash of rivulet and the rush of cataract then the leaf of the tree burst into bloom as if a swarm of green butterfly come fly and cluster on the branch it be not only tree and plant that awake but crossbeak hop from branch to branch and the woodpecker hammer on the limb until the splinter fairly fly around they a flock of starling from up country light in a fir top to rest they be paradise starling the tip of each tiny feather shone in brilliant red and as the bird move they glitter like so many jewel again all be dark for a instant but soon there come a new light wave a fresh warm south wind blow and scatter over the forest meadow all the little seed that have be bring here from southern land by bird and ship and wind and which could not thrive elsewhere because of this country 's cruel cold these take root and spring up the instant they touch the ground when the next warm wind come along the blueberry and lignon ripen crane and wild goose shriek in the air the bullfinch build nest and the baby squirrel begin play on the branch of the tree everything come so fast now that abbot han could not stop to reflect on how immeasurably great be the miracle that be take place he have time only to use he eye and ear the next light wave that come rush in bring with it the scent of newly plough acre and far off in the distance the milkmaid be hear coax the cow -- and the tinkle of the sheep 's bell pine and spruce tree be so thickly clothe with red cone that they shine like crimson mantle the juniper berry change color every second and forest flower cover the ground till it be all red blue and yellow abbot han bent down to the earth and break off a wild strawberry blossom and as he straighten up the berry ripen in he hand the mother fox come out of she lair with a big litter of black-legged young she go up to robber mother and scratch at she skirt and robber mother bent down to she and praise she young the horned owl who have just begin he night chase be astonish at the light and go back to he ravine to perch for the night the male cuckoo crow and he mate steal up to the nest of the little bird with she egg in she mouth robber mother 's youngster let out perfect shriek of delight they stuff themselves with wild strawberry that hang on the bush large as pine cone one of they play with a litter of young hare another run a race with some young crow which have hop from they nest before they be really ready a third catch up a adder from the ground and wound it around he neck and arm robber father be stand out on a marsh eating raspberry when he glance up a big black bear stand beside he robber father break off a osier twig and strike the bear on the nose keep to you own ground you he say this be my turf then the huge bear turn around and lumber off in another direction new wave of warmth and light keep come and now they bring with they seed from the star-flower golden pollen from rye field fairly fly in the air then come butterfly so big that they look like fly lily the bee-hive in a hollow oak be already so full of honey that it drip down on the trunk of the tree then all the flower whose seed have be bring from foreign land begin to blossom the loveliest rose climb up the mountain wall in a race with the blackberry vine and from the forest meadow spring flower as large as human face abbot han think of the flower he be to pluck for bishop absalon but each new flower that appear be more beautiful than the other and he want to choose the most beautiful of all wave upon wave keep come until the air be so fill with light that it glitter all the life and beauty and joy of summer smile on abbot han he feel that earth could bring no greater happiness than that which well up about he and he say to himself i do not know what new beauty the next wave that come can bring with it but the light keep streaming in and now it seem to abbot han that it carry with it something from a infinite distance he feel a celestial atmosphere enfold he and tremblingly he begin to anticipate now that earth 's joy have come the glory of heaven be approach then abbot han mark how all grow still the bird hush they song the flower cease grow and the young fox play no more the glory now near be such that the heart want to stop beat the eye weep without one 's know it the soul long to soar away into the eternal from far in the distance faint harp tone be hear and celestial song like a soft murmur reach he abbot han clasp he hand and drop to he knee he face be radiant with bliss never have he dream that even in this life it should be grant he to taste the joy of heaven and to hear angel sing christmas carol but beside abbot han stand the lay brother who have accompany he in he mind there be dark thought this can not be a true miracle he think since it be reveal to malefactor this do not come from god but have its origin in witchcraft and be send hither by satan it be the evil one 's power that be tempting we and compelling we to see that which have no real existence from afar be hear the sound of angel harp and the tone of a miserere but the lay brother think it be the evil spirit of hell come closer they would enchant and seduce we sigh he and we shall be sell into perdition the angel throng be so near now that abbot han see they bright form through the forest branch the lay brother see they too but back of all this wondrous beauty he see only some dread evil for he it be the devil who perform these wonder on the anniversary of we savior 's birth it be do simply for the purpose of more effectually delude poor human being all the while the bird have be circle around the head of abbot han and they let he take they in he hand but all the animal be afraid of the lay brother no bird perch on he shoulder no snake play at he foot then there come a little forest dive when she mark that the angel be near she pluck up courage and fly down on the lay brother 's shoulder and lay she head against he cheek then it appear to he as if sorcery be come right upon he to tempt and corrupt he he strike with he hand at the forest dive and cry in such a loud voice that it ring throughout the forest go thou back to hell whence thou art come just then the angel be so near that abbot han feel the feathery touch of they great wing and he bow down to earth in reverent greet but when the lay brother 's word sound they song be hushed and the holy guest turn in flight at the same time the light and the mild warmth vanish in unspeakable terror for the darkness and cold in a human heart darkness sink over the earth like a coverlet frost come all the growth shrivel up the animal and bird hasten away the rush of stream be hush the leaf drop from the tree rustling like rain abbot han feel how he heart which have but lately swell with bliss be now contract with insufferable agony i can never outlive this thought he that the angel from heaven have be so close to I and be drive away that they want to sing christmas carol for I and be drive to flight then he remember the flower he have promise bishop absalon and at the last moment he fumble among the leaf and moss to try and find a blossom but he sense how the ground under he finger freeze and how the white snow come glide over the ground then he heart cause he ever greater anguish he could not rise but fall prostrate on the ground and lay there when the robber folk and the lay brother have grope they way back to the cave they miss abbot han they take brand with they and go out to search for he they find he dead upon the coverlet of snow then the lay brother begin weep and lament for he understand that it be he who have kill abbot han because he have dash from he the cup of happiness which he have be thirst to drain to its last drop when abbot han have be carry down to övid those who take charge of the dead saw that he hold he right hand lock tight around something which he must have grasp at the moment of death when they finally get he hand open they find that the thing which he have hold in such a iron grip be a pair of white root bulb which he have tear from among the moss and leave when the lay brother who have accompany abbot han see the bulb he take they and plant they in abbot han ' herb garden he guard they the whole year to see if any flower would spring from they but in vain he wait through the spring the summer and the autumn finally when winter have set in and all the leaf and the flower be dead he cease care for they but when christmas eve come again he be so strongly remind of abbot han that he wander out into the garden to think of he and look as he come to the spot where he have plant the bare root bulb he see that from they have spring flourish green stalk which bear beautiful flower with silver white leaf he call out all the monk at övid and when they see that this plant bloom on christmas eve when all the other growth be as if dead they understand that this flower have in truth be pluck by abbot han from the christmas garden in göinge forest then the lay brother ask the monk if he might take a few blossom to bishop absalon and when he appear before bishop absalon he give he the flower and say : abbot han send you these they be the flower he promise to pick for you from the garden in göinge forest when bishop absalon behold the flower which have spring from the earth in darkest winter and hear the word he turn as pale as if he have meet a ghost he sit in silence a moment thereupon he say abbot han have faithfully keep he word and i shall also keep mine and he order that a letter of ransom be draw up for the wild robber who be outlaw and have be force to live in the forest ever since he youth he hand the letter to the lay brother who depart at once for the robber ' cave when he step in there on christmas day the robber come toward he with axe uplift i would like to hack you monk into bit as many as you be say he it must be you fault that göinge forest do not last night dress itself in christmas bloom the fault be mine alone say the lay brother and i will gladly die for it but first i must deliver a message from abbot han and he draw forth the bishop 's letter and tell the man that he be free hereafter you and you child shall play in the christmas straw and celebrate you christmas among people just as abbot han wish to have it say he then robber father stand there pale and speechless but robber mother say in he name abbot han have indeed keep he word and robber father will keep he when the robber and he wife leave the cave the lay brother move in and live all alone in the forest in constant meditation and prayer that he hard-heartedness might be forgive he but göinge forest never again celebrate the hour of we savior 's birth and of all its glory there live to-day only the plant which abbot han have pluck it have be name christmas rise and each year at christmastide she send forth from the earth she green stalk and white blossom as if she never could forget that she have once grow in the great christmas garden at göinge forest félix by evaleen stein a very long while ago perhaps as many as two hundred year the little provençal village of sur varne be all bustle and stir for it be the week before christmas and always in all the world no one have know better how to keep the joyous holiday than have the happy-hearted people of provence the southeastern corner of france everybody be busy hurry to and fro gathering garland of myrtle and laurel bring home they yule log with pretty old song and ceremony and in various way make ready for the all-important festival not a house in sur varne but in some manner tell the come of the bless birthday and especially be there great preparation in the cottage of the shepherd père michaud this cottage cover with white stucco and thatched with long marsh-grass stand at the edge of the village olive and mulberry tree cluster about it and a wild jasmine vine clamber over the doorway while on this particular morning all around the low project eaves hang a row of tiny wheat-sheaves swinging in the crisp December air and twinkle in the sunlight like a golden fringe for the père michaud have be up betime make ready the christmas feast for the bird which no provençal peasant ever forget at this gracious season and the bird know it for already dozen of saucy robin and linnet and fieldfare be gather in the père 's mulberry-tree they mouth fairly water with anticipation within the cottage the good dame the misè michaud with wide sleeve roll up and kirtle tuck back be hard at work make all manner of savory goody while in the huge oven beside the blaze hearth the great christmas cake be bake the famous _ pompou _ and _ fougasse _ as they be call dear to the heart of the child of old provence now and then as the cottage door swing open on the dame 's various cookery errand one might hear a faint baa baa from the sheepfold where little félix michaud be very busy also through the crevice of its weather-beaten board come the sound of vigorous scrubbing of wool and sometimes a impatient ninette ninette -- thou silly sheep wilt thou never stand still or else in a softer tone a eager beppo my little beppo dost thou know dost thou know to all of which there would come no answer save the lamb 's weak little baa baa for ninette beppo 's mother be a silly old sheep and beppo be a very young little lamb and so they could not possibly be expect to know what a great honor have suddenly befall they they do not dream that the night before père michaud have tell félix that he beppo -lrb- for beppo be félix 's very own -rrb- have be choose by the shepherd for the offer lamb of the christmas eve procession in all its festival splendor in the great church of the village of the importance of this procession in the eye of the peasant folk i will tell you more by and by it be enough to say now that to be the offer lamb or indeed the offer lamb 's mother for both always go together be the greatest honor and glory that could possibly happen to a provençal sheep and so little félix be fairly burst with pride and delight and so it be too that he be now busy himself wash they wool which he determine should shine like spin silver on the great night he tug away scrub and brushing and comb the thick fleece and at last after much labor consider they toilet do for the day then give each a handful of fresh hay to nibble he leave the fold and trudge into the cottage well little one say the misè hast thou finish thy work yes mother answer félix and i shall scrub they so each day till the holy night even now ninette be white as milk and beppo shine like a angel ah but i shall be proud when he ride up to the altar in he little cart and mother dost thou not really think he far handsomer than be jean 's lamb that stupid nano in the procession last year there there say the misè never thou mind about jean 's lamb but run along now and finish thy crèche now in provence at the time when félix live no one have ever hear of such a thing as a christmas tree but in its stead every cottage have a crèche that be in one corner of the great living-room the room of the fireplace the peasant child and they father and mother build up on a table a mimic village of bethlehem with house and people and animal and above all with the manger where the christ child lay everyone take the greatest pain to make the crèche as perfect as possible and some even go so far as to fasten tiny angel to the rafter so that they hover over the toy house like a flock of white butterfly and sometimes a gold star hang on a golden thread quiver over the little manger in memory of the wonderful star of the magus in the michaud cottage the crèche be already well under way in the corner across from the fireplace the père have build up a mound and this félix have cover with bit of rock and tuft of grass and little green bough for tree all to represent the rocky hillside of judea then half-way up he begin to place the tiny house these he have cut out of wood and adorn with wonderful carve in which indeed he be very skilful and then such figure as he have make such quaint little man and woman such marvelous animal camel and ox and sheep and horse be never before see in sur varne but the figure on which he have lavish he utmost skill be that of the little christ child which be not to be place in the manger until christmas night itself félix keep this figure in he blouse pocket carefully wrap up in a bit of wool and he spend all he spare moment strive to give it some fresh beauty for i will tell you a secret : poor little félix have a great passion for carve and the one thing for which he long above all other be to be allow to apprentice himself in the workshop of père videau who be the master carver of the village and whose beautiful work on the portal of the great church be the admiration of félix 's heart he long too for better tool than the rude little knife he have and for day and year in which to learn to use they but the père michaud have scant patience with these notion of the little son 's and once when félix have venture to speak to he about it have insist rather sharply that he be to stick to he sheep-tending so that when the père himself grow old he could take charge of the flock and keep the family in bread for the père have small faith in the art of the carver as be able to supply the big brown loaf that the misè baked every week in the great stone oven so félix be oblige to go on mind the flock but whenever he have a moment of he own he employ it in carve a bit of wood or chip at a fragment of soft stone but while i have stop to tell you all this he have almost finish the crèche the little house be all in place and the animal group about the holy stable or else seem to crop the tuft of moss on the mimic rocky hillside well well say the père michaud who have just enter the cottage ' t be a fine bit of work thou hast there my son truly ' t be a brave crèche but here the misè call they both to the midday meal which she have spread smoking hot on the shine deal table when this be finish félix arise and as the père wish once more go out to the fold to see how the sheep and especially he little beppo be fare as he push open the swing door ninette who be lazily doze with she toe double up under she fleece blink she eye and look sleepily around but beppo be nowhere to be see ninette demand félix fiercely what hast thou do with my beppo at this ninette peer about in a dazed sort of way and give a alarmed little baa for she have not before miss beppo who while she be asleep have manage to push open the door of the fold and scamper off no one know just where félix gaze around in dismay when he realize that he lamb the choose one who have bring such pride and honor to he -- that this be go beppo he shout at the top of he lung beppo beppo-o but no trace could he see of the little bundle of fleece he have scrub and comb so carefully that morning he stand irresolute a moment then think that if beppo really be run off not a second be to be lose he set out at a brisk pace across the sheep-meadow he have no idea in what direction the truant lamb would be likely to stray but on he go call every little while in a shrill voice beppo now and then he fancy that he see in the distance a glimpse of white but once it prove the misè fouchard 's linen hang to dry on a currant-bush and again it be a great white stone -- but no beppo and all the while félix keep on quite forget that beppo 's weak woolly leg could not possibly have carry he so great a distance by and by he have leave the village meadow far behind and be skirt the great marsh sometimes he shaded he eye with he hand and look far across this low wet land to see if perhaps beppo have stray into its uncertain foothold but nothing could he see but the wave rush and the tall bittern wade about on long yellow leg and still he press heedlessly on farther and farther till after a while he find himself thrust through a thick coppice of willow bough oh think félix what if poor beppo have stray into this woodland and tire as he be he urge himself on search among the tree and it be not until he have wander on and on deeper and deeper into the wood that he realize that the dusk have fall and that he must be a very very long way from sur varne félix then begin to grow uneasy he stand still and look anxiously about he the dark forest tree close around he on all side and he be quite unable to remember from which direction he have enter the wood now félix be really a very brave little fellow but he fairly quake as he peer through the gathering darkness for in those day the forest of provence be know to harbor many dangerous animal especially wild boar and wolf he prick up he ear and now and then think he hear in the distance the stealthy tread of some four-footed forest prowler and once he be sure he catch the deep howl of a wolf that end he hesitation he look quickly around and grasp the low bough of a slender sapling manage to swing himself up into a tall chestnut-tree that grow close by and there he cling clutch the thick branch with might and main feeling very cold and hungry and miserable he heart all the while sink clear down into he little peasant shoe and indeed he have cause for fear for not a great while after he have thus hide himself a gaunt wolf really do pass close by sniff and peer till poor félix fairly give up all hope of escape from the tree but luckily the wolf do not see he and at last slowly creep on through the underwood how long the little boy stay in the perilous shelter of the chestnut-tree he never know but it seem untold age to he after a while the moon rise and shed a faint light through the close-lapping branch and then by and by félix 's ear strain to listen for every lightest sound catch the echo of distant tramp as of horse ' hoof and presently two horseman come in sight pick they way cautiously along a narrow bridle-path he do not know whom they might prove to be but wisely think that anything would be better than stay in a tree all night at the mercy of hungry wolf he wait till the first rider come quite close and then he pluck up courage to call out faintly : oh sir stop i pray thee at this the rider who be none other than the noble count bernard of bois varne quickly draw rein and turn call to he companion : ho brian heardest thou aught nay my lord answer brian who be some pace behind naught save the trampling of we own horse ' hoof the count look all around and see nothing think himself mistaken in the sound and begin to pace on then félix in terror give another shout this time louder and at the same moment a little twig he be press with he elbow break away and drop strike against the count 's stirrup for the bridle-path wound directly under the tree where félix be perch the count instantly check he horse again and peer up into the bough overhead he catch sight of félix he yellow hair wet with dew and shine in the moonlight and he dark eye wide with fear heigh-ho exclaim the count in blank amazement upon my word now what art thou -- boy or goblin at this félix give a little sob for he be very tired and very cold he hug the tree tightly and steadying himself against the bough at last manage to falter out : please thee sir i be félix michaud and my lamb beppo who be to ride in the christmas procession run off to-day and -- and -- i have be hunting he i think ever since -- since yesterday here poor félix grow a trifle bewilder it seem to he so very long ago since he have set out in search of beppo and i live in sur varne at this the count give a long whistle at sur varne he exclaim if thou speakest truly my little man thou hast indeed a sturdy pair of leg to have carry thee thus far and he eye curiously félix 's dusty little foot and leathern leggings dangle

that be a beautiful wrought-iron basket in which blaze a ruddy torch of oil to light they on they way at sight of this the count and brian spur on they horse and be soon clatter across the bridge and into the great paved courtyard the count fling he bridle to a little page who hasten out to meet he and then spring from he saddle lightly lift félix and swing he to the ground he take the boy by the

he order he trusty squire brian to saddle a horse and conduct félix back to sur varne meantime the little lady elinor beg hard that he stay longer in the castle for she playfellow and be quite heartbroken when she see the horse stand ready in the courtyard indeed she would not be satisfy until she father the count who could not bear to see she unhappy have promise to some day take she over to see félix in sur varne then she smile and make a pretty farewell courtesy and suddenly snatch from she dark hair a crimson ribbon of lyon taffeta she tie it about félix 's sleeve declare there thou must keep this token and be my little knight for the lady elinor have many lofty notion in she small curly head félix could only stammer out a embarrassed good-by for in the presence of this lively

after several hour ' ride they draw near sur varne félix show brian the way to the michaud cottage and you can fancy how overjoy be the père and misè to see the traveler for they have be fairly beside themselves with grief and have search all night for they little son of course almost the first question félix ask be about beppo and he feel a great load take off he mind when he learn that the little truant who have not really stray very far from the village have be find and bring home by one of the shepherd and be even then pen up safe and sound in the sheepfold after a good night 's sleep félix be quite rest from he journey and be busy the next day in help garland the yule log in give ninette and beppo a extra scrubbing and brushing and in all the final happy preparation for the great holiday and so christmas eve come it be a lovely star-lit night and on all side one could hear the beautiful christmas song of old provence that all the peasant and the child sing as they troop along the road on they way to the great church of the village for thither every one flock as the expect hour draw on then presently the stately service begin and go on with song and incense and the sweet chanting of child 's voice till suddenly from the upper tower of the church a joyous peal of bell ring in the midnight and all at once through the dense throng of worshiper nearest the door a pathway open and in come four peasant play on pipe and flute and flageolet a quaint old air make up three hundred year before by good king rené for just such a ceremony as be to follow after the piper walk ten shepherd two by two each wear a long brown cloak and carry a staff and light candle that be all save the first two and these bear one a basket of fruit the melon and grape and pear of sunny provence while the other hold in he hand a pair of pretty white pigeon with rose-colored eye and soft flutter wing and then behind the shepherd come -- what do you suppose -- ninette ninette she fleece shine like snow a garland of laurel and myrtle about she neck and twig of holly nodding behind she ear while bind about she woolly shoulder a little harness of scarlet leather shone against the white with dazzling effect and fasten to the harness and trundle along at ninette 's heel come the gayest of little wooden cart it be paint in the brightest color its wheel be wrap with garland and in it curl up in a fat fleecy ball lay beppo tie about he neck in a huge bow be a crimson ribbon of lyon taffeta with a sprig of holly tuck into its loop beppo lay quite still look about he with a bewildered half-dazed expression and just behind he cart come ten more shepherd with staff and candle while follow they be a great throng of peasant folk and child -lrb- among they félix -rrb- all carry light taper and radiant with delight for this be the procession of the offer lamb and to walk in its train be consider by all as the greatest honor and privilege and especially do the shepherd folk love the beautiful old custom which for century the people of provence have cherish from year to year in memory of the time long ago when the real christ child lay in the manger of bethlehem and the shepherd of judea seek he out to worship he and to offer he they fruit and lamb as gift and so on up the long aisle the procession slowly move the piper play and ninette march solemnly along only now and then pause to thrust she nose between the père michaud and he companion who walk directly in front of she ninette patter on as if she have tread the floor of church all she life and as for beppo only once do he stir and then he give a faint baa and try to uncurl himself and stand up but just then the queer little cart give a joggle which quite upset he shaky lamb leg and down he sink and keep quiet throughout the rest of the time after the service the player again strike up king rené 's tune and the procession shepherd ninette beppo peasant and all once more move on this time down the outer aisle and toward the great open portal it take some time for the last of its follower to reach the doorway for the throng be very great but at length félix who have march with the child in the last group come to the threshold and step out into the starry night he stand for a moment smile and gaze aimlessly ahead overwhelm with the glory of all that have pass within the church when presently he feel some one pluck he sleeve and turn round he meet the dancing eye of the little lady elinor she give a little peal of laughter at he surprise and exclaim : oh i coax _ mon père _ the count to fetch I hither for this bless night thou knowest he promise i ride my white palfrey all the way by the side of he big brown horse and i have see the procession and beppo with my red ribbon round he neck here she give another little gurgle of delight and oh félix my father have see thine and ' t be all settle thou art to be a famous carver with the père videau as thou wishest -lrb- for the lady elinor have unbounded faith in félix 's power -rrb- and félix she add i trow ' t be the little christ child for thy crèche that do it then with a merry little smile she dart off to she father the count bernard who be wait for she down the church path for a little while after she have go félix do not move but stand as one in a dream presently a loud bleat close at he side startle he and look down he see that ninette deck in she gay garland and still drag the be-ribboned beppo in the little cart have break away from the père michaud and come close up to himself then with a sudden movement he stoop over and seize beppo in both arm hug and squeeze he till poor beppo squeak with surprise and open he red mouth and fairly gasp for breath but félix only hug he the harder murmuring under he breath bless thy little heart beppo bless thy little heart for in a vague way he realize that the truant lamb have somehow bring he he heart 's desire and that be quite enough christmas happiness for one year and the little lady elinor be right too year after when félix grow to be a man he do in very truth become a famous carver as she have declare far surpass he first master the père videau he travel and work in many city yet never through all he long life do he forget that christmas eve in the little village of sur varne those who know he best say that among he dearest treasure he always keep a beautifully carve little box and in it a bit of fade crimson ribbon from the loom of lyon while as for beppo -- well if ever some happy day you chance to visit the lovely land of provence perhaps you will see a certain grand old cathedral in the ancient city of arle and if you do look sharp at the figure of a lamb chisel in white stone over the great portal look well i say for félix when he carve it would have tell you that he be think all the while of he little pet lamb beppo the sabot of little wolff françois coppée once upon a time -- it be so long ago that the whole world have forget the date -- in a city in the north of europe whose name be so difficult to pronounce that nobody remember it -- once upon a time there be a little boy of seven name wolff he be a orphan in charge of a old aunt who be hard and avaricious who only kiss he on new year 's day and who breathe a sigh of regret every time that she give he a porringer of soup but the poor little lad be naturally so good that he love he aunt just the same although she frighten he very much and he could never see she without tremble for fear she would whip he as the aunt of wolff be know through all the village to have a house and a old stock full of gold she do not dare send she nephew to the school for the poor but she obtain a reduction of the price with the schoolmaster whose school little wolff attend the teacher vex at have a scholar so badly dress and who pay so poorly often punish he unjustly and even set he fellow-pupil against he the poor little fellow be therefore as miserable as the stone in the street and hide himself in out-of-the-way corner to cry when christmas come the night before christmas the schoolmaster be to take all of he pupil to church and bring they back to they home as the winter be very severe that year and as for several day a great quantity of snow have fall the child come to the master 's house warmly wrap and bundle up with fur cap pull down over they ear double and triple jacket knit glove and mitten and good thick-nailed boot with strong sole only little wolff come shiver in the clothes that he wear week-day and sunday and with nothing on he foot but coarse strasbourg sock and heavy sabot or wooden shoe he thoughtless comrade make a thousand jest over he forlorn look and he peasant 's dress but little wolff be so occupy in blow on he finger to keep they warm that he take no notice of the boy or what they say the troop of boy with they master at they head start for the church as they go they talk of the fine supper that be wait they at home the son of the burgomaster have see before he go out a monstrous goose that the truffle mark with black spot like a leopard at the house of one of the boy there be a little fir tree in a wooden box from whose branch hang orange sweetmeat and toy the child speak too of what the christ-child would bring to they and what he would put in they shoe which they would of course be very careful to leave in the chimney before go to bed and the eye of those little boy lively as a parcel of mouse sparkle in advance with the joy of see in they imagination pink paper bag fill with cake lead soldier draw up in battalion in they box menagerie smell of varnished wood and magnificent jumping-jack cover with purple and bell little wolff know very well by experience that he old aunt would send he supperless to bed but know that all the year he have be as good and industrious as possible he hope that the christ-child would not forget he and he too look eagerly forward to put he wooden shoe in the ash of the fireplace when the service be end every one go away anxious for he supper and the band of child walk two by two after they teacher leave the church in the porch sit on a stone seat under a gothic niche a child be sleep -- a child who be clothe in a robe of white linen and whose foot be bare notwithstanding the cold he be not a beggar for he robe be new and fresh and near he on the ground be see a square a hatchet a pair of compass and the other tool of a carpenter 's apprentice under the light of the star he face bear a expression of divine sweetness and he long lock of golden hair seem like a aureole about he head but the child 's foot blue in the cold of that December night be sad to see the child so well clothed and shod for the winter pass heedlessly before the unknown child one of they the son of one of the principal man in the village look at the waif with a expression in which no pity could be see but little wolff come the last out of the church stop full of compassion before the beautiful sleep child alas say the orphan to himself it be too bad that this poor little one have to go barefoot in such bad weather but what be worse than all he have not even a boot or a wooden shoe to leave before he while he sleep to-night so that the christ-child could put something there to comfort he in he misery and carry away by the goodness of he heart little wolff take off the wooden shoe from he right foot and lay it in front of the sleep child then limp along on he poor blistered foot and drag he sock through the snow he go back to he aunt 's house look at that worthless fellow cry he aunt full of anger at he return without one of he shoe what have you do with you wooden shoe little wretch little wolff do not know how to deceive and although he be shake with terror he try to stammer out some account of he adventure the old woman burst into a frightful peal of laughter ah monsieur take off he shoe for beggar ah monsieur give away he wooden shoe to a barefoot this be something new ah well since that be so i be go to put the wooden shoe which you have leave in the chimney and i promise you the christ-child will leave there to-night something to whip you with in the morning and you shall pass the day to-morrow on dry bread and water we will see if next time you give away you shoe to the first vagabond that come then the

martin could just see the passer-by it be true that he could see little more than they boot but martin avdyeeich could read a man 's character by he boot so he need no more martin avdyeeich have live long in that one place and have many acquaintance few indeed be the boot in that neighborhood which have not pass through he hand at some time or other on some he would fasten new sole to other he would give side-piece other again he would stitch all round and even give they new upper if need be and often he see he own handiwork through the window there be always lot of work for he for avdyeeich 's hand be cunning and he leather good nor do he overcharge and he always keep he word he always engage to do a job by a fixed time if he could but if he could not he say so at once and deceive no man so every one know avdyeeich and he have no lack of work avdyeeich have always be a pretty good man but as he grow old he begin to think more about he soul and draw nearer to he god while martin be still a journeyman he wife have die but he wife have leave he a little boy -- three year old they other child have not live all the eldest have die early martin wish at first to send he little child into the country to he sister but afterwards he think better of it my kapitoshka think he will feel miserable in a strange household he shall stay here with I and so avdyeeich leave he master and take to live in lodgings alone with he little son but god do not give avdyeeich happiness in he child no sooner have the little one begin to grow up and be a help and a joy to he father 's heart than a sickness fall upon kapitoshka the little one take to he bed lay there in a rage fever for a week and then die martin bury he son in despair -- so desperate be he that he begin to murmur against god such disgust of life overcome he that he more than once beg god that he might die and he reproach god for take not he a old man but he darling he only son instead and after that avdyeeich leave off go to church and lo one day there come to avdyeeich from the troitsa monastery a aged peasant-pilgrim -- it be already the eighth year of he pilgrimage avdyeeich fall a-talking with he and begin to complain of he great sorrow as for live any longer thou man of god say he i desire it not would only that i might die that be my sole prayer to god i be now a man who have no hope and the old man say to he : thy speech martin be not good how shall we judge the doings of god god 's judgment be not we thought god will that thy son shouldst die but that thou shouldst live therefore 'twa the best thing both for he and for thee it be because thou wouldst fain have live for thy own delight that thou dost now despair but what then _ be _ a man to live for ask avdyeeich and the old man answer : for god martin he give thee life and for he therefore must thou live when thou dost begin to live for he thou wilt grieve about nothing more and all thing will come easy to thee martin be silent for a moment and then he say : and how must one live for god christ have show we the way thou knowest thy letter buy the gospel and read there thou wilt find out how to live for god there everything be explain these word make the heart of avdyeeich burn within he and he go the same day and buy for himself a new testament print in very large type and begin to read avdyeeich set out with the determination to read it only on holiday but as he read it do he heart so much good that he take to read it every day and the second time he read until all the kerosene in the lamp have burn itself out and for all that he could not tear himself away from the book and so it be every evening and the more he read the more clearly he understand what god want of he and how it behoove he to live for god and he heart grow lighter and lighter continually formerly whenever he lay down to sleep he would only sigh and groan and think of nothing but kapitoshka but now he would only say to himself : glory to thee glory to thee o lord thy will be do henceforth the whole life of avdyeeich be change formerly whenever he have a holiday he would go to the tavern to drink tea nor would he say no to a drop of brandy now and again he would tipple with he comrade and though not actually drunk would for all that leave the inn a bit merry babble nonsense and talk loudly and censoriously he have do with all that now he life become quiet and joyful with the morning light he sit down to he work work out he time then take down he lamp from the hook place it on the table take down he book from the shelf bent over it and sit he down to read and the more he read the more he understand and he heart grow brighter and happier it happen once that martin be up read till very late he be read st luke 's gospel he be read the sixth chapter and as he read he come to the word : and to he that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other this passage he read several time and presently he come to that place where the lord say : and why call ye I lord lord and do not the thing which i say whosoever cometh to I and heareth my saying and doeth they i will show you to whom he be like he be like a man which build a house and dig deep and lay the foundation on a rock and when the flood arise the storm beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it be found upon a rock but he that heareth and doeth not be like a man that without a foundation build a house upon the earth against which the stream do beat vehemently and immediately it fall and the ruin of that house be great avdyeeich read these word through and through and he heart be glad he take off he glass lay they on the book rest he elbow on the table and fall a-thinking and he begin to measure he own life by these word and he think to himself be my house build on the rock or on the sand how good to be as on a rock how easy it all seem to thee sit alone here it seem as if thou wert do god 's will to the full and so thou takest no heed and fallest away again and yet thou wouldst go on strive for so it be good for thee o lord help I thus think he and would have lay he down but it be a grief to tear himself away from the book and so he begin read the seventh chapter he read all about the centurion he read all about the widow 's son he read all about the answer to the disciple of st john and so he come to that place where the rich pharisee invite we lord to be he guest and he read all about how the woman who be a sinner anoint he foot and wash they with she tear and how he justify she and so he come at last to the forty-fourth verse and there he read these word and he turn to the woman and say to simon seest thou this woman i enter into thine house thou gavest I no water for my foot but she have wash my foot with tear and wipe they with the hair of she head thou gavest I no kiss but this woman since the time i come in have not cease to kiss my foot mine head with oil thou didst not anoint and again avdyeeich take off he glass and lay they on the book and fall a-thinking so it be quite plain that i too have something of the pharisee about I be i not always think of myself be i not always think of drinking tea and keep myself as warm and cozy as possible without think at all about the guest simon think about himself but do not give the slightest thought to he guest but who be the guest the lord himself and suppose he be to come to I should i treat he as the pharisee do and avdyeeich lean both he elbow on the table and without perceive it fall a-dozing martin -- it be as though the voice of some one close to he ear martin start up from he nap who be there he turn round he gaze at the door but there be no one again he doze off suddenly he hear quite plainly martin martin i say look to-morrow into the street i be come martin awake rise from he chair and begin to rub he eye and he do not know himself whether he have hear these word asleep or awake he turn down the lamp and lay he down to rest at dawn next day avdyeeich arise pray to god light he stove get ready he gruel and cabbage soup fill he samovar put on he apron and sit he down by he window to work there avdyeeich sit and work and think of nothing but the thing of yesternight he thought be divide he think at one time that he must have go off doze and then again he think he really must have hear that voice it might have be so think he martin sit at the window and look as much at he window as at he work and whenever a strange pair of boot pass by he bend forward and look out of the window so as to see the face as well as the foot of the passer-by the house porter pass by in new feel boot the water-carrier pass by and after that there pass close to the window a old soldier one of nichola 's veteran in tattered old boot with a shovel in he hand avdyeeich know he by he boot the old fellow be call stepanuich and live with the neighbor shopkeeper who harbor he of he charity he duty be to help the porter stepanuich stop before avdyeeich 's window to sweep away the snow avdyeeich cast a glance at he and then go on work as before i be not grow sager as i grow older thought avdyeeich with some self-contempt i make up my mind that christ be come to I and lo ` tis only stepanuich clearing away the snow thou simpleton thou thou art wool-gathering then avdyeeich make ten more stitch and then he stretch he head once more towards the window he look through the window again and there he see that stepanuich have place the shovel against the wall and be warm himself and take breath a bit the old man be very much broken thought avdyeeich to himself it be quite plain that he have scarcely strength enough to scrape away the snow suppose i make he drink a little tea the samovar too be just on the boil avdyeeich put down he awl get up place the samovar on the table put some tea in it and tap on the window with he finger stepanuich turn round and come to the window avdyeeich beckon to he and then go and open the door come in and warm yourself a bit cry he you be a bit chill eh christ requite you yes and all my bone ache too say stepanuich stepanuich come in shake off the snow and begin to wipe he foot so as not to soil the floor but he totter sadly do not trouble about wipe you foot i 'll rub it off myself it be all in the day 's work come in and sit down say avdyeeich here take a cup of tea and avdyeeich fill two cup and give one to he guest and he pour he own tea out into the saucer and begin to blow it stepanuich drink he cup turn it upside down put a gnawed crust on the top of it and say thank you but it be quite plain that he want to be ask to have some more have a drop more do say avdyeeich and pour out fresh cup for he guest and himself and as avdyeeich drink he cup he could not help glance at the window from time to time dost thou expect any one ask he guest do i expect any one well honestly i hardly know i be expect and i be not expect and there be a word which have burn itself right into my heart whether it be a vision or no i know not look now my brother i be read yesterday about we little father christ how he suffer how he come on earth hast thou hear of he eh i have hear i have hear reply stepanuich but we poor ignorant one know not we letter anyhow i be read about this very thing -- how he come down upon earth i be read how he go to the pharisee and how the pharisee do not meet he half-way that be what i be read about yesternight little brother mine i read that very thing and bethought I how the honorable do not receive we little father christ honorably but suppose i think if he come to one like I -- would i receive he simon at any rate do not receive he at all thus i think and so think fall asleep i fall asleep i say little brother mine and i hear my name call i start up a voice be whisper at my very ear ` look out to-morrow ' it say ' i be come ' and so it befall twice now look wouldst thou believe it the idea stick to I -- i scold myself for my folly and yet i look for he we little father christ stepanuich shake he head and say nothing but he drink he cup dry and put it aside then avdyeeich take up the cup and fill it again drink some more ` twill do thee good now it seem to I that when we little father go about on earth he despise no one but seek unto the simple folk most of all he be always among the simple folk those disciple of he too he choose most of they from amongst we brother-laborer sinner like unto we he that exalteth himself he say shall be abased and he that abaseth himself shall be exalt ye say he call I lord and i say he wash you foot he who would be the first among you he say let he become the servant of all and therefore it be that he say bless be the lowly the peacemaker the humble and the long-suffering stepanuich forget he tea he be a old man soft-hearted and tearful he sit and listen and the tear roll down he cheek come drink a little more say avdyeeich but stepanuich cross himself express he thanks push away he cup and get up i thank thee martin avdyeeich i have fare well at thy hand and thou hast refresh I both in body and soul thou wilt show I a kindness by come again i be so glad to have a guest say avdyeeich stepanuich depart and martin pour out the last drop of tea drink it wash up and again sit down by the window to work -- he have some back-stitching to do he stitch and stitch and now and then cast glance at the window -- he be look for christ and could think of nothing but he and he work and the diver saying of christ be in he head all the time two soldier pass by one in regimental boot the other in boot of he own making after that the owner of the next house pass by in nicely brush golosh a baker with a basket also pass by all these pass by in turn and then there come alongside the window a woman in worsted stocking and rustic shoe and as she be pass by she stop short in front of the partition wall avdyeeich look up at she from he window and he see that the woman be a stranger and poorly clothe and that she have a little child with she she be lean up against the wall with she back to the wind and try to wrap the child up but she have nothing to wrap it up with the woman wear summer clothes and thin enough they be and from out of he corner avdyeeich hear the child cry and the woman try to comfort it but she could not then avdyeeich get up go out

not put he finger into its mouth because he finger be black and sticky with cobbler 's wax and the child stare at the finger and be silent and presently it begin to laugh and avdyeeich be delighted
