muffle roar and the glisten of tear ` round the moon and in fancy the tread of vanish shoon -- out in the night with the dead hush and hark to the sorrowful cry of the wind in the dark hush and hark without murmur or sigh to shoon that tread the lose aeon : to the sound that bid you to die hush and hark hush and hark _ shoon of the dead _ author 's introduction to the manuscript many be the hour in which i have ponder upon the story that be set forth in the follow page i trust that my instinct be not awry when they prompt I to leave the account in simplicity as it be hand to I and the m itself -- you must picture I when first it be give into my care turn it over curiously and make a swift jerky examination a small book it be but thick and all save the last few page fill with a quaint but legible handwriting and writ very close i have the queer faint pit-water smell of it in my nostril now as i write and my finger have subconscious memory of the soft cloggy feel of the long-damp page i read and in read lift the curtain of the impossible that blind the mind and look out into the unknown amid stiff abrupt sentence i wander and presently i have no fault to charge against they abrupt telling for better far than my own ambitious phrasing be this mutilate story capable of bring home all that the old recluse of the vanish house have strive to tell of the simple stiffly give account of weird and extraordinary matter i will say little it lie before you the inner story must be uncovered personally by each reader accord to ability and desire and even should any fail to see as now i see the shadowed picture and conception of that to which one may well give the accept title of heaven and hell yet can i promise certain thrill merely take the story as a story william hope hodgson December 17 1907 _ i _ the finding of the manuscript right away in the west of ireland lie a tiny hamlet call kraighten it be situate alone at the base of a low hill far around there spread a waste of bleak and totally inhospitable country where here and there at great interval one may come upon the ruin of some long desolate cottage -- unthatched and stark the whole land be bare and unpeopled the very earth scarcely cover the rock that lie beneath it and with which the country abound in place rise out of the soil in wave-shaped ridge yet in spite of its desolation my friend tonnison and i have elect to spend we vacation there he have stumble on the place by mere chance the year previously during the course of a long walking tour and discover the possibility for the angler in a small and unnamed river that run past the outskirts of the little village i have say that the river be without name i may add that no map that i have hitherto consult have show either village or stream they seem to have entirely escape observation : indeed they might never exist for all that the average guide tell one possibly this can be partly account for by the fact that the nearest railway station -lrb- ardrahan -rrb- be some forty mile distant it be early one warm evening when my friend and i arrive in kraighten we have reach ardrahan the previous night sleep there in room hire at the village post office and leave in good time on the follow morning cling insecurely to one of the typical jaunting car it have take we all day to accomplish we journey over some of the roughest track imaginable with the result that we be thoroughly tire and somewhat bad temper however the tent have to be erect and we goods stow away before we could think of food or rest and so we set to work with the aid of we driver and soon have the tent up upon a small patch of ground just outside the little village and quite near to the river then have store all we belongings we dismiss the driver as he have to make he way back as speedily as possible and tell he to come across to we at the end of a fortnight we have bring sufficient provision to last we for that space of time and water we could get from the stream fuel we do not need as we have include a small oil-stove among we outfit and the weather be fine and warm it be tonnison 's idea to camp out instead of get lodgings in one of the cottage as he put it there be no joke in sleep in a room with a numerous family of healthy irish in one corner and the pigsty in the other while overhead a ragged colony of roost fowl distribute they blessing impartially and the whole place so full of peat smoke that it make a fellow sneeze he head off just to put it inside the doorway tonnison have get the stove light now and be busy cut slice of bacon into the frying pan so i take the kettle and walk down to the river for water on the way i have to pass close to a little group of the village people who eye I curiously but not in any unfriendly manner though none of they venture a word as i return with my kettle fill i go up to they and after a friendly nod to which they reply in like manner i ask they casually about the fishing but instead of answer they just shake they head silently and stare at I i repeat the question address more particularly a great gaunt fellow at my elbow yet again i receive no answer then the man turn to a comrade and say something rapidly in a language that i do not understand and at once the whole crowd of they fall to jabber in what after a few moment i guess to be pure irish at the same time they cast many glance in my direction for a minute perhaps they speak among themselves thus then the man i have address face ` round at I and say something by the expression of he face i guess that he in turn be question I but now i have to shake my head and indicate that i do not comprehend what it be they want to know and so we stand look at one another until i hear tonnison call to I to hurry up with the kettle then with a smile and a nod i leave they and all in the little crowd smile and nod in return though they face still betray they puzzlement it be evident i reflect as i go toward the tent that the inhabitant of these few hut in the wilderness do not know a word of english and when i tell tonnison he remark that he be aware of the fact and more that it be not at all uncommon in that part of the country where the people often live and die in they isolate hamlet without ever come in contact with the outside world i wish we have get the driver to interpret for we before he leave i remark as we sit down to we meal it seem so strange for the people of this place not even to know what we have come for tonnison grunt a assent and thereafter be silent for a while later have satisfy we appetite somewhat we begin to talk lay we plan for the morrow then after a smoke we close the flap of the tent and prepare to turn in i suppose there be no chance of those fellow outside take anything i ask as we roll ourselves in we blanket tonnison say that he do not think so at least while we be about and as he go on to explain we could lock up everything except the tent in the big chest that we have bring to hold we provision i agree to this and soon we be both asleep next morning early we rise and go for a swim in the river after which we dress and have breakfast then we rouse out we fishing tackle and overhaul it by which time we breakfast have settle somewhat we make all secure within the tent and stride off in the direction my friend have explore on he previous visit during the day we fish happily work steadily upstream and by evening we have one of the prettiest creel of fish that i have see for a long while return to the village we make a good feed off we day 's spoil after which have select a few of the finer fish for we breakfast we present the remainder to the group of villager who have assemble at a respectful distance to watch we doings they seem wonderfully grateful and heap mountain of what i presume to be irish blessing upon we head thus we spend several day have splendid sport and first-rate appetite to do justice upon we prey we be please to find how friendly the villager be incline to be and that there be no evidence of they have venture to meddle with we belongings during we absence it be on a Tuesday that we arrive in kraighten and it would be on the Sunday follow that we make a great discovery hitherto we have always go up-stream on that day however we lay aside we rod and take some provision set off for a long ramble in the opposite direction the day be warm and we trudge along leisurely enough stop about mid-day to eat we lunch upon a great flat rock near the riverbank afterward we sit and smoke awhile resume we walk only when we be tire of inaction for perhaps another hour we wander onward chat quietly and comfortably on this and that matter and on several occasion stop while my companion -- who be something of a artist -- make rough sketch of striking bit of the wild scenery and then without any warn whatsoever the river we have follow so confidently come to a abrupt end -- vanish into the earth good lord i say who ever would have think of this and i stare in amazement then i turn to tonnison he be look with a blank expression upon he face at the place where the river disappear in a moment he speak let we go on a bit it may reappear again -- anyhow it be worth investigate i agree and we go forward once more though rather aimlessly for we be not at all certain in which direction to prosecute we search for perhaps a mile we move onward then tonnison who have be gaze about curiously stop and shaded he eye see he say after a moment be not that mist or something over there to the right -- away in a line with that great piece of rock and he indicate with he hand i stare and after a minute seem to see something but could not be certain and say so anyway my friend reply we 'll just go across and have a glance and he start off in the direction he have suggest i follow presently we come among bush and after a time out upon the top of a high boulder-strewn bank from which we look down into a wilderness of bush and tree seem as though we have come upon a oasis in this desert of stone mutter tonnison as he gaze interestedly then he be silent he eye fix and i look also for up from somewhere about the center of the wooded lowland there rise high into the quiet air a great column of hazelike spray upon which the sun shine cause innumerable rainbow how beautiful i exclaimed yes answer tonnison thoughtfully there must be a waterfall or something over there perhaps it be we river come to light again let 's go and see down the sloping bank we make we way and enter among the tree and shrubbery the bush be mat and the tree overhang we so that the place be disagreeably gloomy though not dark enough to hide from I the fact that many of the tree be fruit tree and that here and there one could trace indistinctly sign of a long depart cultivation thus it come to I that we be make we way through the riot of a great and ancient garden i say as much to tonnison and he agree that there certainly seem reasonable grounds for my belief what a wild place it be so dismal and somber somehow as we go forward a sense of the silent loneliness and desertion of the old garden grow upon I and i feel shivery one could imagine thing lurk among the tangled bush while in the very air of the place there seem something uncanny i think tonnison be conscious of this also though he say nothing suddenly we come to a halt through the tree there have grow upon we ear a distant sound tonnison bent forward listen i could hear it more plainly now it be continuous and harsh -- a sort of drone roar seem to come from far away i experience a queer indescribable little feeling of nervousness what sort of place be it into which we have get i look at my companion to see what he think of the matter and note that there be only puzzlement in he face and then as i watch he feature a expression of comprehension creep over they and he nod he head that be a waterfall he exclaim with conviction i know the sound now and he begin to push vigorously through the bush in the direction of the noise as we go forward the sound become plainer continually show that we be head straight toward it steadily the roaring grow louder and nearer until it appear as i remark to tonnison almost to come from under we foot -- and still we be surround by the tree and shrub take care tonnison call to I look where you be go and then suddenly we come out from among the tree on to a great open space where not six pace in front of we yawn the mouth of a tremendous chasm from the depths of which the noise appear to rise along with the continuous mistlike spray that we have witness from the top of the distant bank for quite a minute we stand in silence stare in bewilderment at the sight then my friend go forward cautiously to the edge of the abyss i follow and together we look down through a boil of spray at a monster cataract of frothing water that burst spout from the side of the chasm nearly a hundred foot below good lord say tonnison i be silent and rather awed the sight be so unexpectedly grand and eerie though this latter quality come more upon I later presently i look up and across to the further side of the chasm there i see something tower up among the spray : it look like a fragment of a great ruin and i touch tonnison on the shoulder he glance ` round with a start and i point toward the thing he gaze follow my finger and he eye light up with a sudden flash of excitement as the object come within he field of view come along he shout above the uproar we 'll have a look at it there be something queer about this place i feel it in my bone and he start off ` round the edge of the craterlike abyss as we near this new thing i see that i have not be mistake in my first impression it be undoubtedly a portion of some ruin building yet now i make out that it be not build upon the edge of the chasm itself as i have at first suppose but perch almost at the extreme end of a huge spur of rock that jut out some fifty or sixty foot over the abyss in fact the jagged mass of ruin be literally suspend in midair arrive opposite it we walk out on to the project arm of rock and i must confess to have feel a intolerable sense of terror as i look down from that dizzy perch into the unknown depths below we -- into the deep from which there rise ever the thunder of the fall water and the shroud of rise spray reach the ruin we clamber ` round it cautiously and on the further side come upon a mass of fall stone and rubble the ruin itself seem to I as i proceed now to examine it minutely to be a portion of the outer wall of some prodigious structure it be so thick and substantially build yet what it be do in such a position i could by no means conjecture where be the rest of the house or castle or whatever there have be i go back to the outer side of the wall and thence to the edge of the chasm leave tonnison root systematically among the heap of stone and rubbish on the outer side then i commence to examine the surface of the ground near the edge of the abyss to see whether there be not leave other remnant of the building to which the fragment of ruin evidently belong but though i scrutinize the earth with the greatest care i could see no sign of anything to show that there have ever be a building erect on the spot and i grow more puzzle than ever then i hear a cry from tonnison he be shout my name excitedly and without delay i hurry along the rocky promontory to the ruin i wonder whether he have hurt himself and then the thought come that perhaps he have find something i reach the crumble wall and climb ` round there i find tonnison standing within a small excavation that he have make among the _ débris _ : he be brushing the dirt from something that look like a book much crumpled and dilapidated and open he mouth every second or two to bellow my name as soon as he see that i have come he hand he prize to I tell I to put it into my satchel so as to protect it from the damp while he continue he exploration this i do first however run the page through my finger and note that they be closely fill with neat old-fashioned writing which be quite legible save in one portion where many of the page be almost destroy be muddy and crumple as though the book have be double back at that part this i find out from tonnison be actually as he have discover it and the damage be due probably to the fall of masonry upon the open part curiously enough the book be fairly dry which i attribute to its have be so securely bury among the ruin have put the volume away safely i turned-to and give tonnison a hand with he self-imposed task of excavate yet though we put in over a hour 's hard work turn over the whole of the upheaped stone and rubbish we come upon nothing more than some fragment of broken wood that might have be part of a desk or table and so we give up search and go back along the rock once more to the safety of the land the next thing we do be to make a complete tour of the tremendous chasm which we be able to observe be in the form of a almost perfect circle save for where the ruin-crowned spur of rock jut out spoil its symmetry the abyss be as tonnison put it like nothing so much as a gigantic well or pit go sheer down into the bowels of the earth for some time longer we continue to stare about we and then notice that there be a clear space away to the north of the chasm we bent we step in that direction here distant from the mouth of the mighty pit by some hundred of yard we come upon a great lake of silent water -- silent that be save in one place where there be a continuous bubbling and gurgle now be away from the noise of the spout cataract we be able to hear one another speak without have to shout at the top of we voice and i ask tonnison what he think of the place -- i tell he that i do not like it and that the sooner we be out of it the better i should be pleased he nod in reply and glance at the wood behind furtively i ask he if he have see or hear anything he make no answer but stand silent as though listen and i keep quiet also suddenly he speak hark he say sharply i look at he and then away among the tree and bush hold my breath involuntarily a minute come and go in strained silence yet i could hear nothing and i turn to tonnison to say as much and then even as i open my lip to speak there come a strange wail noise out of the wood on we leave it appear to float through the tree and there be a rustle of stir leaf and then silence all at once tonnison speak and put he hand on my shoulder let we get out of here he say and begin to move slowly toward where the surround tree and bush seem thinnest as i follow he it come to I suddenly that the sun be low and that there be a raw sense of chilliness in the air tonnison say nothing further but keep on steadily we be among the tree now and i glance around nervously but see nothing save the quiet branch and trunk and the tangled bush onward we go and no sound break the silence except the occasional snap of a twig under we foot as we move forward yet in spite of the quietness i have a horrible feeling that we be not alone and i keep so close to tonnison that twice i kick he heel clumsily though he say nothing a minute and then another and we reach the confines of the wood come out at last upon the bare rockiness of the countryside only then be i able to shake off the haunting dread that have follow I among the tree once as we move away there seem to come again a distant sound of wail and i say to myself that it be the wind -- yet the evening be breathless presently tonnison begin to talk look you he say with decision i would not spend the night in _ that _ place for all the wealth that the world hold there be something unholy -- diabolical -- about it it come to I all in a moment just after you speak it seem to I that the wood be full of vile thing -- you know yes i answer and look back toward the place but it be hide from we by a rise in the ground there be the book i say and i put my hand into the satchel you have get it safely he question with a sudden access of anxiety yes i reply perhaps he continue we shall learn something from it when we get back to the tent we have better hurry too we be a long way off still and i do not fancy now be catch out here in the dark it be two hour later when we reach the tent and without delay we set to work to prepare a meal for we have eat nothing since we lunch at midday supper over we clear the thing out of the way and light we pipe then tonnison ask I to get the manuscript out of my satchel this i do and then as we could not both read from it at the same time he suggest that i should read the thing out loud and mind he caution know my propensity do not go skip half the book yet have he but know what it contain he would have realize how needless such advice be for once at least and there seat in the opening of we little tent i begin the strange tale of _ the house on the borderland _ -lrb- for such be the title of the m -rrb- this be tell in the follow page _ ii _ the plain of silence i be a old man i live here in this ancient house surround by huge unkempt garden the peasantry who inhabit the wilderness beyond say that i be mad that be because i will have nothing to do with they i live here alone with my old sister who be also my housekeeper we keep no servant -- i hate they i have one friend a dog yes i would sooner have old pepper than the rest of creation together he at least understand I -- and have sense enough to leave I alone when i be in my dark mood i have decide to start a kind of diary it may enable I to record some of the thought and feeling that i can not express to anyone but beyond this i be anxious to make some record of the strange thing that i have hear and see during many year of loneliness in this weird old building for a couple of century this house have have a reputation a bad one and until i buy it for more than eighty year no one have live here consequently i get the old place at a ridiculously low figure i be not superstitious but i have cease to deny that thing happen in this old house -- thing that i can not explain and therefore i must need ease my mind by write down a account of they to the best of my ability though should this my diary ever be read when i be go the reader will but shake they head and be the more convinced that i be mad this house how ancient it be though its age strike one less perhaps than the quaintness of its structure which be curious and fantastic to the last degree little curved tower and pinnacle with outline suggestive of leap flame predominate while the body of the building be in the form of a circle i have hear that there be a old story tell amongst the country people to the effect that the devil build the place however that be as may be true or not i neither know nor care save as it may have help to cheapen it ere i come i must have be here some ten year before i see sufficient to warrant any belief in the story current in the neighborhood about this house it be true that i have on at least a dozen occasion see vaguely thing that puzzle I and perhaps have feel more than i have see then as the year pass bring age upon I i become often aware of something unseen yet unmistakably present in the empty room and corridor still it be as i have say many year before i see any real manifestation of the so-called supernatural it be not halloween if i be tell a story for amusement 's sake i should probably place it on that night of night but this be a true record of my own experience and i would not put pen to paper to amuse anyone no it be after midnight on the morning of the twenty-first day of January i be sit reading as be often my custom in my study pepper lay sleep near my chair without warn the flame of the two candle go low and then shine with a ghastly green effulgence i look up quickly and as i do so i see the light sink into a dull ruddy tint so that the room glow with a strange heavy crimson twilight that give the shadow behind the chair and table a double depth of blackness and wherever the light strike it be as though luminous blood have be splash over the room down on the floor i hear a faint frightened whimper and something press itself in between my two foot it be pepper cower under my dress gown pepper usually as brave as a lion it be this movement of the dog 's i think that give I the first twinge of _ real _ fear i have be considerably startle when the light burnt first green and then red but have be momentarily under the impression that the change be due to some influx of noxious gas into the room now however i see that it be not so for the candle burn with a steady flame and show no sign of go out as would have be the case have the change be due to fume in the atmosphere i do not move i feel distinctly frightened but could think of nothing better to do than wait for perhaps a minute i keep my glance about the room nervously then i notice that the light have commence to sink very slowly until presently they show minute speck of red fire like the gleaming of ruby in the darkness still i sit watch while a sort of dreamy indifference seem to steal over I banish altogether the fear that have begin to grip I away in the far end of the huge old-fashioned room i become conscious of a faint glow steadily it grow fill the room with gleam of quiver green light then they sink quickly and change -- even as the candle flame have do -- into a deep somber crimson that strengthened and light up the room with a flood of awful glory the light come from the end wall and grow ever brighter until its intolerable glare cause my eye acute pain and involuntarily i close they it may have be a few seconds before i be able to open they the first thing i notice be that the light have decrease greatly so that it no longer try my eye then as it grow still duller i be aware all at once that instead of look at the redness i be stare through it and through the wall beyond gradually as i become more accustomed to the idea i realize that i be look out on to a vast plain light with the same gloomy twilight that pervade the room the immensity of this plain scarcely can be conceive in no part could i perceive its confines it seem to broaden and spread out so that the eye fail to perceive any limitation slowly the detail of the nearer portion begin to grow clear then in a moment almost the light die away and the vision -- if vision it be -- fade and be go suddenly i become conscious that i be no longer in the chair instead i seem to be hover above it and look down at a dim something huddle and silent in a little while a cold blast strike I and i be outside in the night float like a bubble up through the darkness as i move a icy coldness seem to enfold I so that i shiver after a time i look to right and left and see the intolerable blackness of the night pierce by remote gleam of fire onward outward i drive once i glance behind and see the earth a small crescent of blue light recede away to my leave further off the sun a splash of white flame burn vividly against the dark a indefinite period pass then for the last time i see the earth -- a enduring globule of radiant blue swimming in a eternity of ether and there i a fragile flake of soul dust flicker silently across the void from the distant blue into the expanse of the unknown a great while seem to pass over I and now i could nowhere see anything i have pass beyond the fix star and plunge into the huge blackness that wait beyond all this time i have experience little save a sense of lightness and cold discomfort now however the atrocious darkness seem to creep into my soul and i become fill with fear and despair what be go to become of I where be i go even as the thought be form there grow against the impalpable blackness that wrap I a faint tinge of blood it seem extraordinarily remote and mistlike yet at once the feeling of oppression be lighten and i no longer despaired slowly the distant redness become plainer and larger until as i draw nearer it spread out into a great somber glare -- dull and tremendous still i flee onward and presently i have come so close that it seem to stretch beneath I like a great ocean of somber red i could see little save that it appear to spread out interminably in all direction in a further space i find that i be descend upon it and soon i sink into a great sea of sullen red-hued cloud slowly i emerge from these and there below I i see the stupendous plain that i have see from my room in this house that stand upon the border of the silence presently i land and stand surround by a great waste of loneliness the place be light with a gloomy twilight that give a impression of indescribable desolation afar to my right within the sky there burn a gigantic ring of dull-red fire from the outer edge of which be project huge writhe flame dart and jag the interior of this ring be black black as the gloom of the outer night i comprehend at once that it be from this extraordinary sun that the place derive its doleful light from that strange source of light i glance down again to my surroundings everywhere i look i see nothing but the same flat weariness of interminable plain nowhere could i descry any sign of life not even the ruin of some ancient habitation gradually i find that i be be bear forward float across the flat waste for what seem a eternity i move onward i be unaware of any great sense of impatience though some curiosity and a vast wonder be with I continually always i see around I the breadth of that enormous plain and always i search for some new thing to break its monotony but there be no change -- only loneliness silence and desert presently in a half-conscious manner i notice that there be a faint mistiness ruddy in hue lie over its surface still when i look more intently i be unable to say that it be really mist for it appear to blend with the plain give it a peculiar unrealness and convey to the sens the idea of unsubstantiality gradually i begin to weary with the sameness of the thing yet it be a great time before i perceive any sign of the place toward which i be be convey at first i see it far ahead like a long hillock on the surface of the plain then as i draw nearer i perceive that i have be mistake for instead of a low hill i make out now a chain of great mountain whose distant peak tower up into the red gloom until they be almost lose to sight _ iii _ the house in the arena and so after a time i come to the mountain then the course of my journey be alter and i begin to move along they basis until all at once i see that i have come opposite to a vast rift opening into the mountain through this i be bear move at no great speed on either side of I huge scarped wall of rocklike substance rise sheer far overhead i discern a thin ribbon of red where the mouth of the chasm open among inaccessible peak within be gloom deep and somber and chilly silence for a while i go onward steadily and then at last i see ahead a deep red glow that tell I i be near upon the further opening of the gorge a minute come and go and i be at the exit of the chasm stare out upon a enormous amphitheatre of mountain yet of the mountain and the terrible grandeur of the place i recked nothing for i be confound with amazement to behold at a distance of several mile and occupy the center of the arena a stupendous structure build apparently of green jade yet in itself it be not the discovery of the building that have so astonished I but the fact which become every moment more apparent that in no particular save in color and its enormous size do the lonely structure vary from this house in which i live for a while i continue to stare fixedly even then i could scarcely believe that i see aright in my mind a question form reiterate incessantly : ` what do it mean ' ` what do it mean ' and i be unable to make answer even out of the depths of my imagination i seem capable only of wonder and fear for a time longer i gaze note continually some fresh point of resemblance that attract I at last wearied and sorely puzzle i turn from it to view the rest of the strange place on to which i have intrude hitherto i have be so engross in my scrutiny of the house that i have give only a cursory glance ` round now as i look i begin to realize upon what sort of a place i have come the arena for so i have term it appear a perfect circle of about ten to twelve mile in diameter the house as i have mention before stand in the center the surface of the place like to that of the plain have a peculiar misty appearance that be yet not mist from a rapid survey my glance pass quickly upward along the slope of the circle mountain how silent they be i think that this same abominable stillness be more try to I than anything that i have so far see or imagine i be look up now at the great crag tower so loftily up there the impalpable redness give a blur appearance to everything and then as i peered curiously a new terror come to I for away up among the dim peak to my right i have descry a vast shape of blackness giantlike it grow upon my sight it have a enormous equine head with gigantic ear and seem to peer steadfastly down into the arena there be that about the pose that give I the impression of a eternal watchfulness -- of have ward that dismal place through unknown eternity slowly the monster become plainer to I and then suddenly my gaze spring from it to something further off and higher among the crag for a long minute i gaze fearfully i be strangely conscious of something not altogether unfamiliar -- as though something stir in the back of my mind the thing be black and have four grotesque arm the feature show indistinctly ` round the neck i make out several light-colored object slowly the detail come to I and i realize coldly that they be skull further down the body be another circle belt show less dark against the black trunk then even as i puzzle to know what the thing be a memory slide into my mind and straightway i know that i be look at a monstrous representation of kali the hindu goddess of death other remembrance of my old student day drift into my thought my glance fall back upon the huge beast-headed thing simultaneously i recognize it for the ancient egyptian god set or seth the destroyer of soul with the knowledge there come a great sweep of question -- ` two of the -- ' i stop and endeavor to think thing beyond my imagination peer into my frightened mind i see obscurely ` the old god of mythology ' i try to comprehend to what it be all point my gaze dwelt flickeringly between the two ` if -- ' a idea come swiftly and i turn and glance rapidly upward search the gloomy crag away to my left something loom out under a great peak a shape of greyness i wonder i have not see it earlier and then remember i have not yet view that portion i see it more plainly now it be as i have say gray it have a tremendous head but no eye that part of its face be blank now i see that there be other thing up among the mountain further off recline on a lofty ledge i make out a livid mass irregular and ghoulish it seem without form save for a unclean half-animal face that look out vilely from somewhere about its middle and then i see other -- there be hundred of they they seem to grow out of the shadow several i recognize almost immediately as mythological deity other be strange to I utterly strange beyond the power of a human mind to conceive on each side i look and see more continually the mountain be full of strange thing -- beast-god and horror so atrocious and bestial that possibility and decency deny any further attempt to describe they and i -- i be fill with a terrible sense of overwhelming horror and fear and repugnance yet spite of these i wonder exceedingly be there then after all something in the old heathen worship something more than the mere deifying of man animal and element the thought grip I -- be there later a question repeat itself what be they those beast-god and the other at first they have appear to I just sculpture monster place indiscriminately among the inaccessible peak and precipice of the surround mountain now as i scrutinize they with greater intentness my mind begin to reach out to fresh conclusion there be something about they a indescribable sort of silent vitality that suggest to my broaden consciousness a state of life-in-death -- a something that be by no means life as we understand it but rather a inhuman form of existence that well might be liken to a deathless trance -- a condition in which it be possible to imagine they continue eternally ` immortal ' the word rise in my thought unbidden and straightway i grow to wonder whether this might be the immortality of the god and then in the midst of my wonder and muse something happen until then i have be stay just within the shadow of the exit of the great rift now without volition on my part i drift out of the semi-darkness and begin to move slowly across the arena -- toward the house at this i give up all thought of those prodigious shape above I -- and could only stare frightenedly at the tremendous structure toward which i be be convey so remorselessly yet though i search earnestly i could discover nothing that i have not already see and so become gradually calmer presently i have reach a point more than halfway between the house and the gorge all around be spread the stark loneliness of the place and the unbroken silence steadily i near the great building then all at once something catch my vision something that come ` round one of the huge buttress of the house and so into full view it be a gigantic thing and move with a curious lope go almost upright after the manner of a man it be quite unclothed and have a remarkable luminous appearance yet it be the face that attract and frighten I the most it be the face of a swine silently intently i watch this horrible creature and forget my fear momentarily in my interest in its movement it be make its way cumbrously ` round the building stop as it come to each window to peer in and shake at the bar with which -- as in this house -- they be protect and whenever it come to a door it would push at it finger the fasten stealthily evidently it be search for a ingress into the house i have come now to within less than a quarter of a mile of the great structure and still i be compel forward abruptly the thing turn and gaze hideously in my direction it open its mouth and for the first time the stillness of that abominable place be break by a deep booming note that send a add thrill of apprehension through I then immediately i become aware that it be come toward I swiftly and silently in a instant it have cover half the distance that lay between and still i be bear helplessly to meet it only a hundred yard and the brutish ferocity of the giant face numb I with a feeling of unmitigated horror i could have scream in the supremeness of my fear and then in the very moment of my extremity and despair i become conscious that i be look down upon the arena from a rapidly increase height i be rise rise in a inconceivably short while i have reach a altitude of many hundred foot beneath I the spot that i have just leave be occupy by the foul swine-creature it have go down on all fours and be snuff and root like a veritable hog at the surface of the arena a moment and it rise to its foot clutch upward with a expression of desire upon its face such as i have never see in this world continually i mount higher a few minute it seem and i have rise above the great mountain -- float alone afar in the redness at a tremendous distance below the arena show dimly with the mighty house look no larger than a tiny spot of green the swine-thing be no longer visible presently i pass over the mountain out above the huge breadth of the plain far away on its surface in the direction of the ring-shaped sun there show a confused blur i look toward it indifferently it remind I somewhat of the first glimpse i have catch of the mountain-amphitheatre with a sense of weariness i glance upward at the immense ring of fire what a strange thing it be then as i stare out from the dark center there spurt a sudden flare of extraordinary vivid fire compare with the size of the black center it be as naught yet in itself stupendous with awaken interest i watch it carefully note its strange boiling and glowing then in a moment the whole thing grow dim and unreal and so pass out of sight much amaze i glance down to the plain from which i be still rise thus i receive a fresh surprise the plain -- everything have vanish and only a sea of red mist be spread far below I gradually as i stare this grow remote and die away into a dim far mystery of red against a unfathomable night a while and even this have go and i be wrap in a impalpable lightless gloom _ iv _ the earth thus i be and only the memory that i have live through the dark once before serve to sustain my thought a great time pass -- age and then a single star break its way through the darkness it be the first of one of the outlying cluster of this universe presently it be far behind and all about I shine the splendor of the countless star later year it seem i see the sun a clot of flame around it i make out presently several remote speck of light -- the planet of the solar system and so i see the earth again blue and unbelievably minute it grow larger and become define a long space of time come and go and then at last i enter into the shadow of the world -- plunge headlong into the dim and holy earth night overhead be the old constellation and there be a crescent moon then as i near the earth 's surface a dimness sweep over I and i appear to sink into a black mist for a while i know nothing i be unconscious gradually i become aware of a faint distant whine it become plainer a desperate feeling of agony possess I i struggle madly for breath and try to shout a moment and i get my breath more easily i be conscious that something be lick my hand something damp sweep across my face i hear a panting and then again the whine it seem to come to my ear now with a sense of familiarity and i open my eye all be dark but the feeling of oppression have leave I i be seat and something be whine piteously and lick I i feel strangely confused and instinctively try to ward off the thing that lick my head be curiously vacant and for the moment i seem incapable of action or think then thing come back to I and i call ` pepper ' faintly i be answer by a joyful bark and renew and frantic caress in a little while i feel stronger and put out my hand for the match i groped about for a few moment blindly then my hand light upon they and i strike a light and look confusedly around all about I i see the old familiar thing and there i sit full of dazed wonder until the flame of the match burnt my finger and i drop it while a hasty expression of pain and anger escape my lip surprising I with the sound of my own voice after a moment i strike another match and stumble across the room light the candle as i do so i observe that they have not burn away but have be put out as the flame shoot up i turn and stare about the study yet there be nothing unusual to see and suddenly a gust of irritation take I what have happen i hold my head with both hand and try to remember ah the great silent plain and the ring-shaped sun of red fire where be they where have i see they how long ago i feel dazed and muddle once or twice i walk up and down the room unsteadily my memory seem dull and already the thing i have witness come back to I with a effort i have a remembrance of cursing peevishly in my bewilderment suddenly i turn faint and giddy and have to grasp at the table for support during a few moment i hold on weakly and then manage to totter sideways into a chair after a little time i feel somewhat better and succeed in reach the cupboard where usually i keep brandy and biscuit i pour myself out a little of the stimulant and drink it off then take a handful of biscuit i return to my chair and begin to devour they ravenously i be vaguely surprise at my hunger i feel as though i have eat nothing for a uncountably long while as i eat my glance rove about the room take in its various detail and still search though almost unconsciously for something tangible upon which to take hold among the invisible mystery that encompass I ` surely ' i think ` there must be something -- ' and in the same instant my gaze dwelt upon the face of the clock in the opposite corner therewith i stop eat and just stare for though its tick indicate most certainly that it be still go the hand be point to a little _ before _ the hour of midnight whereas it be as well i know considerably _ after _ that time when i have witness the first of the strange happening i have just describe for perhaps a moment i be astounded and puzzle have the hour be the same as when i have last see the clock i should have conclude that the hand have stick in one place while the internal mechanism go on as usual but that would in no way account for the hand have travel backward then even as i turn the matter over in my wearied brain the thought flash upon I that it be now close upon the morning of the twenty-second and that i have be unconscious to the visible world through the greater portion of the last twenty-four hour the thought occupy my attention for a full minute then i commence to eat again i be still very hungry during breakfast next morning i inquire casually of my sister regard the date and find my surmise correct i have indeed be absent -- at least in spirit -- for nearly a day and a night my sister ask I no question for it be not by any mean the first time that i have keep to my study for a whole day and sometimes a couple of day at a time when i have be particularly engross in my book or work and so the day pass on and i be still fill with a wonder to know the meaning of all that i see on that memorable night yet well i know that my curiosity be little likely to be satisfied _ v _ the thing in the pit this house be as i have say before surround by a huge estate and wild and uncultivated garden away at the back distant some three hundred yard be a dark deep ravine -- speak of as the ` pit ' by the peasantry at the bottom run a sluggish stream so overhung by tree as scarcely to be see from above in pass i must explain that this river have a subterranean origin emerge suddenly at the east end of the ravine and disappear as abruptly beneath the cliff that form its western extremity it be some month after my vision -lrb- if vision it be -rrb- of the great plain that my attention be particularly attract to the pit i happen one day to be walk along its southern edge when suddenly several piece of rock and shale be dislodge from the face of the cliff immediately beneath I and fall with a sullen crash through the tree i hear they splash in the river at the bottom and then silence i should not have give this incident more than a pass thought have not pepper at once begin to bark savagely nor would he be silent when i bade he which be most unusual behavior on he part feel that there must be someone or something in the pit i go back to the house quickly for a stick when i return pepper have cease he bark and be growl and smell uneasily along the top whistle to he to follow I i start to descend cautiously the depth to the bottom of the pit must be about a hundred and fifty foot and some time as well as considerable care be expend before we reach the bottom in safety once down pepper and i start to explore along the bank of the river it be very dark there due to the overhang tree and i move warily keep my glance about I and my stick ready pepper be quiet now and keep close to I all the time thus we search right up one side of the river without hearing or see anything then we cross over -- by the simple method of jump -- and commence to beat we way back through the underbrush we have accomplish perhaps half the distance when i hear again the sound of fall stone on the other side -- the side from which we have just come one large rock come thunder down through the treetop strike the opposite bank and bound into the river drive a great jet of water right over we at this pepper give out a deep growl then stop and prick up he ear i listen also a second later a loud half-human half-piglike squeal sound from among the tree apparently about halfway up the south cliff it be answer by a similar note from the bottom of the pit at this pepper give a short sharp bark and spring across the little river disappear into the bush immediately afterward i hear he bark increase in depth and number and in between there sound a noise of confused jabbering this cease and in the succeed silence there rise a semi-human yell of agony almost immediately pepper give a long-drawn howl of pain and then the shrub be violently agitate and he come run out with he tail down and glance as he run over he shoulder as he reach I i see that he be bleed from what appear to be a great claw wound in the side that have almost lay bare he rib see pepper thus mutilate a furious feeling of anger seize I and whirling my staff i spring across and into the bush from which pepper have emerge as i force my way through i think i hear a sound of breathing next instant i have burst into a little clear space just in time to see something livid white in color disappear among the bush on the opposite side with a shout i run toward it but though i strike and probe among the bush with my stick i neither see nor hear anything further and so return to pepper there after bathing he wound in the river i bind my wetted handkerchief ` round he body have do which we retreat up the ravine and into the daylight again on reach the house my sister inquire what have happen to pepper and i tell she he have be fight with a wildcat of which i have hear there be several about i feel it would be better not to tell she how it have really happen though to be sure i scarcely know myself but this i do know that the thing i have see run into the bush be no wildcat it be much too big and have so far as i have observe a skin like a hog 's only of a dead unhealthy white color and then -- it have run upright or nearly so upon its hind foot with a motion somewhat resemble that of a human be this much i have notice in my brief glimpse and truth to tell i feel a good deal of uneasiness besides curiosity as i turn the matter over in my mind it be in the morning that the above incident have occur then it would be after dinner as i sit reading that happen to look up suddenly i see something peer in over the window ledge the eye and ear alone show ' a pig by jove ' i say and rise to my foot thus i see the thing more completely but it be no pig -- god alone know what it be it remind I vaguely of the hideous thing that have haunt the great arena it have a grotesquely human mouth and jaw but with no chin of which to speak the nose be prolong into a snout thus it be that with the little eye and queer ear give it such a extraordinarily swinelike appearance of forehead there be little and the whole face be of a unwholesome white color for perhaps a minute i stand look at the thing with a ever grow feeling of disgust and some fear the mouth keep jabber inanely and once emit a half-swinish grunt i think it be the eye that attract I the most they seem to glow at time with a horribly human intelligence and keep flicker away from my face over the detail of the room as though my stare disturbed it it appear to be support itself by two clawlike hand upon the windowsill these claw unlike the face be of a clayey brown hue and bear a indistinct resemblance to human hand in that they have four finger and a thumb though these be web up to the first joint much as be a duck 's nail it have also but so long and powerful that they be more like the talon of a eagle than aught else as i have say before i feel some fear though almost of a impersonal kind i may explain my feeling better by say that it be more a sensation of abhorrence such as one might expect to feel if bring in contact with something superhumanly foul something unholy -- belong to some hitherto undreamt of state of existence i can not say that i grasped these various detail of the brute at the time i think they seem to come back to I afterward as though imprint upon my brain i imagine more than i see as i look at the thing and the material detail grow upon I later for perhaps a minute i stare at the creature then as my nerve steady a little i shake off the vague alarm that hold I and take a step toward the window even as i do so the thing duck and vanish i rush to the door and look ` round hurriedly but only the tangled bush and shrub meet my gaze i run back into the house and get my gun sally out to search through the garden as i go i ask myself whether the thing i have just see be likely to be the same of which i have catch a glimpse in the morning i incline to think it be i would have take pepper with I but judge it better to give he wound a chance to heal besides if the creature i have just see be as i imagine he antagonist of the morning it be not likely that he would be of much use i begin my search systematically i be determine if it be possible to find and put a end to that swine-thing this be at least a material horror at first i search cautiously with the thought of pepper 's wound in my mind but as the hour pass and not a sign of anything living show in the great lonely garden i become less apprehensive i feel almost as though i would welcome the sight of it anything seem better than this silence with the ever-present feeling that the creature might be lurk in every bush i pass later i grow careless of danger to the extent of plunge right through the bush probe with my gun barrel as i go at time i shout but only the echo answer back i think thus perhaps to frighten or stir the creature to show itself but only succeed in bring my sister mary out to know what be the matter i tell she that i have see the wildcat that have wound pepper and that i be try to hunt it out of the bush she seem only half satisfied and go back into the house with a expression of doubt upon she face i wonder whether she have see or guess anything for the rest of the afternoon i prosecute the search anxiously i feel that i should be unable to sleep with that bestial thing haunt the shrubbery and yet when evening fall i have see nothing then as i turn homeward i hear a short unintelligible noise among the bush to my right instantly i turn and aim quickly fire in the direction of the sound immediately afterward i hear something scuttle away among the bush it move rapidly and in a minute have go out of hearing after a few step i cease my pursuit realize how futile it must be in the fast gathering gloom and so with a curious feeling of depression i enter the house that night after my sister have go to bed i go ` round to all the window and door on the ground floor and see to it that they be securely fasten this precaution be scarcely necessary as regard the window as all of those on the lower storey be strongly bar but with the door -- of which there be five -- it be wisely think as not one be lock have secure these i go to my study yet somehow for once the place jar upon I it seem so huge and echoey for some time i try to read but at last finding it impossible i carry my book down to the kitchen where a large fire be burn and sit there i dare say i have read for a couple of hour when suddenly i hear a sound that make I lower my book and listen intently it be a noise of something rubbing and fumble against the back door once the door creak loudly as though force be be apply to it during those few short moment i experience a indescribable feeling of terror such as i should have believe impossible my hand shake a cold sweat break out on I and i shiver violently gradually i calm the stealthy movement outside have cease then for a hour i sit silent and watchful all at once the feeling of fear take I again i feel as i imagine a animal must under the eye of a snake yet now i could hear nothing still there be no doubt that some unexplained influence be at work gradually imperceptibly almost something steal on my ear -- a sound that resolve itself into a faint murmur quickly it develop and grow into a muffle but hideous chorus of bestial shriek it appear to rise from the bowels of the earth i hear a thud and realize in a dull half comprehend way that i have drop my book after that i just sit and thus the daylight find I when it creep wanly in through the bar high window of the great kitchen with the dawn light the feeling of stupor and fear leave I and i come more into possession of my sens thereupon i pick up my book and creep to the door to listen not a sound break the chilly silence for some minute i stand there then very gradually and cautiously i draw back the bolt and open the door peep out my caution be unneeded nothing be to be see save the gray vista of dreary tangled bush and tree extend to the distant plantation with a shiver i close the door and make my way quietly up to bed _ vi _ the swine-thing it be evening a week later my sister sit in the garden knitting i be walk up and down read my gun lean up against the wall of the house for since the advent of that strange thing in the garden i have deem it wise to take precaution yet through the whole week there have be nothing to alarm I either by sight or sound so that i be able to look back calmly to the incident though still with a sense of unmitigated wonder and curiosity i be as i have just say walk up and down and somewhat engross in my book suddenly i hear a crash away in the direction of the pit with a quick movement i turn and see a tremendous column of dust rise high into the evening air my sister have rise to she foot with a sharp exclamation of surprise and fright tell she to stay where she be i snatch up my gun and run toward the pit as i near it i hear a dull rumble sound that grow quickly into a roar split with deeper crash and up from the pit drive a fresh volume of dust the noise cease though the dust still rise tumultuously i reach the edge and look down but could see nothing save a boil of dust cloud swirl hither and thither the air be so full of the small particle that they blind and choke I and finally i have to run out from the smother to breathe gradually the suspend matter sink and hang in a panoply over the mouth of the pit i could only guess at what have happen that there have be a land-slip of some kind i have little doubt but the cause be beyond my knowledge and yet even then i have half imagining for already the thought have come to I of those fall rock and that thing in the bottom of the pit but in the first minute of confusion i fail to reach the natural conclusion to which the catastrophe point slowly the dust subside until presently i be able to approach the edge and look down for a while i peered impotently try to see through the reek at first it be impossible to make out anything then as i stare i see something below to my left that move i look intently toward it and presently make out another and then another -- three dim shape that appear to be climb up the side of the pit i could see they only indistinctly even as i stare and wonder i hear a rattle of stone somewhere to my right i glance across but could see nothing i lean forward and peer over and down into the pit just beneath where i stand and see no further than a hideous white swine-face that have rise to within a couple of yard of my foot below it i could make out several other as the thing see I it give a sudden uncouth squeal which be answer from all part of the pit at that a gust of horror and fear take I and bend down i discharge my gun right into its face straightway the creature disappear with a clatter of loose earth and stone there be a momentary silence to which probably i owe my life for during it i hear a quick patter of many foot and turn sharply see a troop of the creature come toward I at a run instantly i raise my gun and fire at the foremost who plunge head-long with a hideous howling then i turn to run more than halfway from the house to the pit i see my sister -- she be come toward I i could not see she face distinctly as the dusk have fall but there be fear in she voice as she call to know why i be shooting ` run ' i shout in reply ` run for you life ' without more ado she turn and flee -- pick up she skirt with both hand as i follow i give a glance behind the brute be run on they hind leg -- at time drop on all fours i think it must have be the terror in my voice that spur mary to run so for i feel convinced that she have not as yet see those hell creature that pursue on we go my sister lead each moment the near sound of the footstep tell I that the brute be gain on we rapidly fortunately i be accustom to live in some way a active life as it be the strain of the race be begin to tell severely upon I ahead i could see the back door -- luckily it be open i be some half-dozen yard behind mary now and my breath be sob in my throat then something touch my shoulder i wrench my head ` round quickly and see one of those monstrous pallid face close to mine one of the creature have outrun its companion have almost overtake I even as i turn it make a fresh grab with a sudden effort i spring to one side and swing my gun by the barrel bring it crash down upon the foul creature 's head the thing drop with a almost human groan even this short delay have be nearly sufficient to bring the rest of the brute down upon I so that without a instant 's waste of time i turn and run for the door reach it i burst into the passage then turn quickly slam and bolt the door just as the first of the creature rush against it with a sudden shock my sister sit gasp in a chair she seem in a faint condition but i have no time then to spend on she i have to make sure that all the door be fasten fortunately they be the one lead from my study into the garden be the last to which i go i have just have time to note that it be secure when i think i hear a noise outside i stand perfectly silent and listen yes now i could distinctly hear a sound of whispering and something slither over the panel with a rasping scratchy noise evidently some of the brute be feel with they claw-hand about the door to discover whether there be any means of ingress that the creature should so soon have find the door be -- to I -- a proof of they reasoning capability it assure I that they must not be regard by any means as mere animal i have feel something of this before when that first thing peer in through my window then i have apply the term superhuman to it with a almost instinctive knowledge that the creature be something different from the brute-beast something beyond human yet in no good sense but rather as something foul and hostile to the _ great _ and _ good _ in humanity in a word as something intelligent and yet inhuman the very think of the creature fill I with revulsion now i bethought I of my sister and go to the cupboard i get out a flask of brandy and a wine-glass take these i go down to the kitchen carry a light candle with I she be not sit in the chair but have fall out and be lie upon the floor face downward very gently i turn she over and raise she head somewhat then i pour a little of the brandy between she lip after a while she shiver slightly a little later she give several gasp and open she eye in a dreamy unrealizing way she look at I then she eye close slowly and i give she a little more of the brandy for perhaps a minute longer she lay silent breathing quickly all at once she eye open again and it seem to I as i look that the pupil be dilate as though fear have come with return consciousness then with a movement so unexpected that i start backward she sit up notice that she seem giddy i put out my hand to steady she at that she give a loud scream and scramble to she foot run from the room for a moment i stay there -- kneel and hold the brandy flask i be utterly puzzle and astonish could she be afraid of I but no why should she i could only conclude that she nerve be badly shake and that she be temporarily unhinge upstairs i hear a door bang loudly and i know that she have take refuge in she room i put the flask down on the table my attention be distract by a noise in the direction of the back door i go toward it and listen it appear to be shake as though some of the creature struggle with it silently but it be far too strongly construct and hang to be easily move out in the garden rise a continuous sound it might have be mistake by a casual listener for the grunt and squeal of a herd of pig but as i stand there it come to I that there be sense and mean to all those swinish noise gradually i seem able to trace a semblance in it to human speech -- glutinous and sticky as though each articulation be make with difficulty : yet nevertheless i be become convinced that it be no mere medley of sound but a rapid interchange of idea by this time it have grow quite dark in the passage and from these come all the varied cry and groan of which a old house be so full after nightfall it be no doubt because thing be then quieter and one have more leisure to hear also there may be something in the theory that the sudden change of temperature at sundown affect the structure of the house somewhat -- cause it to contract and settle as it be for the night however this be as may be but on that night in particular i would gladly have be quit of so many eerie noise it seem to I that each crack and creak be the come of one of those thing along the dark corridor though i know in my heart that this could not be for i have see myself that all the door be secure gradually however these sound grow on my nerve to such a extent that be it only to punish my cowardice i feel i must make the ` round of the basement again and if anything be there face it and then i would go up to my study for i know sleep be out of the question with the house surround by creature half beast half something else and entirely unholy take the kitchen lamp down from its hook i make my way from cellar to cellar and room to room through pantry and coal-hole -- along passage and into the hundred-and-one little blind alley and hidden nook that form the basement of the old house then when i know i have be in every corner and cranny large enough to conceal aught of any size i make my way to the stair with my foot on the first step i pause it seem to I i hear a movement apparently from the buttery which be to the left of the staircase it have be one of the first place i search and yet i feel certain my ear have not deceive I my nerve be string now and with hardly any hesitation i step up to the door hold the lamp above my head in a glance i see that the place be empty save for the heavy stone slab support by brick pillar and i be about to leave it convinced that i have be mistake when in turn my light be flash back from two bright spot outside the window and high up for a few moment i stand there stare then they move -- revolving slowly and throw out alternate scintillation of green and red at least so it appear to I i know then that they be eye slowly i trace the shadowy outline of one of the thing it appear to be hold on to the bar of the window and its attitude suggest climb i go nearer to the window and hold the light higher there be no need to be afraid of the creature the bar be strong and there be little danger of its be able to move they and then suddenly in spite of the knowledge that the brute could not reach to harm I i have a return of the horrible sensation of fear that have assail I on that night a week previously it be the same feeling of helpless shudder fright i realize dimly that the creature 's eye be look into mine with a steady compelling stare i try to turn away but could not i seem now to see the window through a mist then i think other eye come and peer and yet other until a whole galaxy of malignant stare orb seem to hold I in thrall my head begin to swim and throb violently then i be aware of a feeling of acute physical pain in my left hand it grow more severe and forced literally force my attention with a tremendous effort i glance down and with that the spell that have hold I be break i realize then that i have in my agitation unconsciously catch hold of the hot lamp-glass and burnt my hand badly i look up to the window again the misty appearance have go and now i see that it be crowd with dozen of bestial face with a sudden access of rage i raise the lamp and hurl it full at the window it strike the glass -lrb- smash a pane -rrb- and pass between two of the bar out into the garden scattering burning oil as it go i hear several loud cry of pain and as my sight become accustomed to the dark i discover that the creature have leave the window pull myself together i groped for the door and have find it make my way upstairs stumble at each step i feel daze as though i have receive a blow on the head at the same time my hand smart badly and i be full of a nervous dull rage against those thing reach my study i light the candle as they burn up they ray be reflect from the rack of firearm on the sidewall at the sight i remember that i have there a power which as i have prove earlier seem as fatal to those monster as to more ordinary animal and i determine i would take the offensive first of all i bind up my hand for the pain be fast become intolerable after that it seem easier and i cross the room to the rifle stand there i select a heavy rifle -- a old and try weapon and have procure ammunition i make my way up into one of the small tower with which the house be crown from there i find that i could see nothing the garden present a dim blur of shadow -- a little blacker perhaps where the tree stand that be all and i know that it be useless to shoot down into all that darkness the only thing to be do be to wait for the moon to rise then i might be able to do a little execution in the meantime i sit still and keep my ear open the garden be comparatively quiet now and only a occasional grunt or squeal come up to I i do not like this silence it make I wonder on what devilry the creature be bent twice i leave the tower and take a walk through the house but everything be silent once i hear a noise from the direction of the pit as though more earth have fall follow this and last for some fifteen minute there be a commotion among the denizen of the garden this die away and after that all be again quiet about a hour later the moon 's light show above the distant horizon from where i sit i could see it over the tree but it be not until it rise clear of they that i could make out any of the detail in the garden below even then i could see none of the brute until happen to crane forward i see several of they lie prone up against the wall of the house what they be do i could not make out it be however a chance too good to be ignore and take aim i fire at the one directly beneath there be a shrill scream and as the smoke clear away i see that it have turn on its back and be writhe feebly then it be quiet the other have disappear immediately after this i hear a loud squeal in the direction of the pit it be answer a hundred time from every part of the garden this give I some notion of the number of the creature and i begin to feel that the whole affair be become even more serious than i have imagine as i sit there silent and watchful the thought come to I -- why be all this what be these thing what do it mean then my thought fly back to that vision -lrb- though even now i doubt whether it be a vision -rrb- of the plain of silence what do that mean i wonder -- and that thing in the arena ugh lastly i thought of the house i have see in that far-away place that house so like this in every detail of external structure that it might have be model from it or this from that i have never think of that -- at this moment there come another long squeal from the pit follow a second later by a couple of shorter one at once the garden be fill with answer cry i stand up quickly and look over the parapet in the moonlight it seem as though the shrubbery be alive they toss hither and thither as though shake by a strong irregular wind while a continuous rustling and a noise of scamper foot rise up to I several time i see the moonlight gleam on run white figure among the bush and twice i fire the second time my shot be answer by a short squeal of pain a minute later the garden lay silent from the pit come a deep hoarse babel of swine-talk at time angry cry smite the air and they would be answer by multitudinous grunting it occur to I that they be hold some kind of a council perhaps to discuss the problem of enter the house also i think that they seem much enraged probably by my successful shot it occur to I that now would be a good time to make a final survey of we defens this i proceed to do at once visit the whole of the basement again and examine each of the door luckily they be all like the back one build of solid iron-studded oak then i go upstairs to the study i be more anxious about this door it be palpably of a more modern make than the other and though a stout piece of work it have little of they ponderous strength i must explain here that there be a small raise lawn on this side of the house upon which this door open -- the window of the study be bar on this account all the other entrance -- except the great gateway which be never open -- be in the lower storey _ vii _ the attack i spend some time puzzling how to strengthen the study door finally i go down to the kitchen and with some trouble bring up several heavy piece of timber these i wedge up slantwise against it from the floor nail they top and bottom for half-an-hour i work hard and at last get it shore to my mind then feel easier i resume my coat which i have lay aside and proceed to attend to one or two matter before return to the tower it be whilst thus employ that i hear a fumble at the door and the latch be try keep silence i wait soon i hear several of the creature outside they be grunt to one another softly then for a minute there be quietness suddenly there sound a quick low grunt and the door creak under a tremendous pressure it would have burst inward but for the support i have place the strain cease as quickly as it have begin and there be more talk presently one of the thing squeal softly and i hear the sound of other approach there be a short confabulation then again silence and i realize that they have call several more to assist feeling that now be the supreme moment i stand ready with my rifle present if the door give i would at least slay as many as possible again come the low signal and once more the door crack under a huge force for a minute perhaps the pressure be keep up and i wait nervously expect each moment to see the door come down with a crash but no the strut hold and the attempt prove abortive then follow more of they horrible grunt talk and whilst it last i think i distinguish the noise of fresh arrival after a long discussion during which the door be several time shake they become quiet once more and i know that they be go to make a third attempt to break it down i be almost in despair the prop have be severely try in the two previous attack and i be sorely afraid that this would prove too much for they at that moment like a inspiration a thought flash into my troubled brain instantly for it be no time to hesitate i run from the room and up stair after stair this time it be not to one of the tower that i go but out on to the flat lead roof itself once there i race across to the parapet that wall it ` round and look down as i do so i hear the short grunted signal and even up there catch the cry of the door under the assault there be not a moment to lose and lean over i aim quickly and fire the report ring sharply and almost blend with it come the loud splud of the bullet strike its mark from below rise a shrill wail and the door cease its groan then as i take my weight from off the parapet a huge piece of the stone coping slide from under I and fall with a crash among the disorganized throng beneath several horrible shriek quaver through the night air and then i hear a sound of scamper foot cautiously i look over in the moonlight i could see the great copingstone lie right across the threshold of the door i think i see something under it -- several thing white but i could not be sure and so a few minute pass as i stare i see something come ` round out of the shadow of the house it be one of the thing it go up to the stone silently and bent down i be unable to see what it do in a minute it stand up it have something in its talon which it put to its mouth and tear at for the moment i do not realize then slowly i comprehend the thing be stoop again it be horrible i start to load my rifle when i look again the monster be tug at the stone -- move it to one side i lean the rifle on the coping and pull the trigger the brute collapse on its face and kick slightly simultaneously almost with the report i hear another sound -- that of break glass wait only to recharge my weapon i run from the roof and down the first two flight of stair here i pause to listen as i do so there come another tinkle of fall glass it appear to come from the floor below excitedly i spring down the step and guide by the rattle of the window-sash reach the door of one of the empty bedroom at the back of the house i thrust it open the room be but dimly illuminate by the moonlight most of the light be blot out by move figure at the window even as i stand one crawl through into the room level my weapon i fire point-blank at it -- fill the room with a deafening bang when the smoke clear i see that the room be empty and the window free the room be much lighter the night air blow in coldly through the shatter pane down below in the night i could hear a soft moan and a confused murmur of swine-voice step to one side of the window i reloaded and then stand there wait presently i hear a scuffle noise from where i stand in the shadow i could see without be see nearer come the sound and then i see something come up above the sill and clutch at the broken window-frame it catch a piece of the woodwork and now i could make out that it be a hand and arm a moment later the face of one of the swine-creature rise into view then before i could use my rifle or do anything there come a sharp crack -- cr-ac-k and the window-frame give way under the weight of the thing next instant a squash thud and a loud outcry tell I that it have fall to the ground with a savage hope that it have be kill i go to the window the moon have go behind a cloud so that i could see nothing though a steady hum of jabber just beneath where i stand indicate that there be several more of the brute close at hand as i stand there look down i marvel how it have be possible for the creature to climb so far for the wall be comparatively smooth while the distance to the ground must be at least eighty foot all at once as i bent peer i see something indistinctly that cut the gray shadow of the house-side with a black line it pass the window to the leave at a distance of about two foot then i remember that it be a gutter-pipe that have be put there some year ago to carry off the rainwater i have forget about it i could see now how the creature have manage to reach the window even as the solution come to I i hear a faint slither scratch noise and know that another of the brute be come i wait some odd moment then lean out of the window and feel the pipe to my delight i find that it be quite loose and i manage use the rifle-barrel as a crowbar to lever it out from the wall i work quickly then take hold with both band i wrench the whole concern away and hurl it down -- with the thing still cling to it -- into the garden for a few minute longer i wait there listen but after the first general outcry i hear nothing i know now that there be no more reason to fear a attack from this quarter i have remove the only means of reach the window and as none of the other window have any adjacent water pipe to tempt the climb power of the monster i begin to feel more confident of escape they clutch leave the room i make my way down to the study i be anxious to see how the door have withstand the test of that last assault enter i light two of the candle and then turn to the door one of the large prop have be displaced and on that side the door have be force inward some six inch it be providential that i have manage to drive the brute away just when i do and that copingstone i wonder vaguely how i have manage to dislodge it i have not notice it loose as i take my shot and then as i stand up it have slip away from beneath I i feel that i owe the dismissal of the attack force more to its timely fall than to my rifle then the thought come that i have better seize this chance to shore up the door again it be evident that the creature have not return since the fall of the copingstone but who be to say how long they would keep away there and then i set-to at repair the door -- work hard and anxiously first i go down to the basement and rummage ` round find several piece of heavy oak plank with these i return to the study and have remove the prop place the plank up against the door then i nail the head of the strut to these and drive they well home at the bottom nail they again there thus i make the door stronger than ever for now it be solid with the backing of board and would i feel convinced stand a heavier pressure than hitherto without give way after that i light the lamp which i have bring from the kitchen and go down to have a look at the lower window now that i have see a instance of the strength the creature possess i feel considerable anxiety about the window on the ground floor -- in spite of the fact that they be so strongly bar i go first to the buttery have a vivid remembrance of my late adventure there the place be chilly and the wind soughing in through the broken glass produce a eerie note apart from the general air of dismalness the place be as i have leave it the night before go up to the window i examine the bar closely note as i do so they comfortable thickness still as i look more intently it seem to I that the middle bar be bent slightly from the straight yet it be but trifling and it might have be so for year i have never before notice they particularly i put my hand through the break window and shake the bar it be as firm as a rock perhaps the creature have try to ` start ' it and find it beyond they power cease from the effort after that i go ` round to each of the window in turn examine they with careful attention but nowhere else could i trace anything to show that there have be any tamper have finish my survey i go back to the study and pour myself out a little brandy then to the tower to watch _ viii _ after the attack it be now about three be and presently the eastern sky begin to pale with the come of dawn gradually the day come and by its light i scan the garden earnestly but nowhere could i see any sign of the brute i lean over and glance down to the foot of the wall to see whether the body of the thing i have shoot the night before be still there it be go i suppose that other of the monster have remove it during the night then i go down on to the roof and cross over to the gap from which the coping stone have fall reach it i look over yes there be the stone as i have see it last but there be no appearance of anything beneath it nor could i see the creature i have kill after its fall evidently they also have be take away i turn and go down to my study there i sit down wearily i be thoroughly tire it be quite light now though the sun 's ray be not as yet perceptibly hot a clock chime the hour of four i awake with a start and look ` round hurriedly the clock in the corner indicate that it be three o'clock it be already afternoon i must have sleep for nearly eleven hour with a jerky movement i sit forward in the chair and listen the house be perfectly silent slowly i stand up and yawn i feel desperately tire still and sit down again wonder what it be that have wake I it must have be the clock striking i conclude presently and be commence to doze off when a sudden noise bring I back once more to life it be the sound of a step as of a person move cautiously down the corridor toward my study in a instant i be on my foot and grasp my rifle noiselessly i wait have the creature break in whilst i sleep even as i question the step reach my door halt momentarily and then continue down the passage silently i tiptoe to the doorway and peep out then i experience such a feeling of relief as must a reprieve criminal -- it be my sister she be go toward the stair i step into the hall and be about to call to she when it occur to I that it be very queer she should have creep past my door in that stealthy manner i be puzzle and for one brief moment the thought occupy my mind that it be not she but some fresh mystery of the house then as i catch a glimpse of she old petticoat the thought pass as quickly as it have come and i half laugh there could be no mistaking that ancient garment yet i wonder what she be do and remember she condition of mind on the previous day i feel that it might be best to follow quietly -- take care not to alarm she -- and see what she be go to do if she behave rationally well and good if not i should have to take step to restrain she i could run no unnecessary risk under the danger that threaten we quickly i reach the head of the stair and pause a moment then i hear a sound that send I leap down at a mad rate -- it be the rattle of bolt be unshot that foolish sister of mine be actually unbar the back door just as she hand be on the last bolt i reach she she have not see I and the first thing she know i have hold of she arm she glance up quickly like a frightened animal and scream aloud ` come mary ' i say sternly ` what be the meaning of this nonsense do you mean to tell I you do not understand the danger that you try to throw we two life away in this fashion ' to this she reply nothing only tremble violently gasp and sob as though in the last extremity of fear through some minute i reason with she point out the need for caution and ask she to be brave there be little to be afraid of now i explain -- and i try to believe that i speak the truth -- but she must be sensible and not attempt to leave the house for a few day at last i cease in despair it be no use talk to she she be obviously not quite herself for the time be finally i tell she she have better go to she room if she could not behave rationally still she take not any notice so without more ado i pick she up in my arm and carry she there at first she scream wildly but have relapse into silent tremble by the time i reach the stair arrive at she room i lay she upon the bed she lay there quietly enough neither speak nor sob -- just shake in a very ague of fear i take a rug from a chair near by and spread it over she i could do nothing more for she and so cross to where pepper lay in a big basket my sister have take charge of he since he wound to nurse he for it have prove more severe than i have think and i be please to note that in spite of she state of mind she have look after the old dog carefully stoop i speak to he and in reply he lick my hand feebly he be too ill to do more then go to the bed i bent over my sister and ask she how she feel but she only shake the more and much as it pained I i have to admit that my presence seem to make she worse and so i leave she -- lock the door and pocket the key it seem to be the only course to take the rest of the day i spend between the tower and my study for food i bring up a loaf from the pantry and on this and some claret i live for that day what a long weary day it be if only i could have go out into the garden as be my wont i should have be content enough but to be coop in this silent house with no companion save a mad woman and a sick dog be enough to prey upon the nerve of the hardiest and out in the tangled shrubbery that surround the house lurk -- for all i could tell -- those infernal swine-creature wait they chance be ever a man in such strait once in the afternoon and again later i go to visit my sister the second time i find she tend pepper but at my approach she slide over unobtrusively to the far corner with a gesture that sadden I beyond belief poor girl she fear cut I intolerably and i would not intrude on she unnecessarily she would be better i trust in a few day meanwhile i could do nothing and i judge it still needful -- hard as it seem -- to keep she confine to she room one thing there be that i take for encouragement : she have eat some of the food i have take to she on my first visit and so the day pass as the evening draw on the air grow chilly and i begin to make preparation for pass a second night in the tower -- take up two additional rifle and a heavy ulster the rifle i load and lay alongside my other as i intend to make thing warm for any of the creature who might show during the night i have plenty of ammunition and i think to give the brute such a lesson as should show they the uselessness of attempt to force a entrance after that i make the ` round of the house again pay particular attention to the prop that support the study door then feel that i have do all that lay in my power to insure we safety i return to the tower call in on my sister and pepper for a final visit on the way pepper be asleep but wake as i enter and wag he tail in recognition i think he seem slightly better my sister be lie on the bed though whether asleep or not i be unable to tell and thus i leave they reach the tower i make myself as comfortable as circumstance would permit and settle down to watch through the night gradually darkness fall and soon the detail of the garden be merge into shadow during the first few hour i sit alert listen for any sound that might help to tell I if anything be stir down below it be far too dark for my eye to be of much use slowly the hour pass without anything unusual happen and the moon rise show the garden apparently empty and silent and so through the night without disturbance or sound toward morning i begin to grow stiff and cold with my long vigil also i be get very uneasy concern the continue quietness on the part of the creature i mistrust it and would sooner far have have they attack the house openly then at least i should have know my danger and be able to meet it but to wait like this through a whole night picture all kind of unknown devilment be to jeopardize one 's sanity once or twice the thought come to I that perhaps they have go but in my heart i find it impossible to believe that it be so _ ix _ in the cellar at last what with be tired and cold and the uneasiness that possess I i resolve to take a walk through the house first call in at the study for a glass of brandy to warm I this i do and while there i examine the door carefully but find all as i have leave it the night before the day be just break as i leave the tower though it be still too dark in the house to be able to see without a light and i take one of the study candle with I on my ` round by the time i have finish the ground floor the daylight be creep in wanly through the bar window my search have show I nothing fresh everything appear to be in order and i be on the point of extinguish my candle when the thought suggest itself to I to have another glance ` round the cellar i have not if i remember rightly be into they since my hasty search on the evening of the attack for perhaps the half of a minute i hesitate i would have be very willing to forego the task -- as indeed i be incline to think any man well might -- for of all the great awe-inspiring room in this house the cellar be the hugest and weirdest great gloomy cavern of place unlit by any ray of daylight yet i would not shirk the work i feel that to do so would smack of sheer cowardice besides as i reassure myself the cellar be really the most unlikely place in which to come across anything dangerous consider that they can be enter only through a heavy oaken door the key of which i carry always on my person it be in the smallest of these place that i keep my wine a gloomy hole close to the foot of the cellar stair and beyond which i have seldom proceed indeed save for the rummage ` round already mention i doubt whether i have ever before be right through the cellar as i unlock the great door at the top of the step i pause nervously a moment at the strange desolate smell that assail my nostril then throw the barrel of my weapon forward i descend slowly into the darkness of the underground region reach the bottom of the stair i stand for a minute and listen all be silent save for a faint drip drip of water fall drop-by-drop somewhere to my leave as i stand i notice how quietly the candle burnt never a flicker nor flare so utterly windless be the place quietly i move from cellar to cellar i have but a very dim memory of they arrangement the impression leave by my first search be blur i have recollection of a succession of great cellar and of one greater than the rest the roof of which be uphold by pillar beyond that my mind be hazy and predominate by a sense of cold and darkness and shadow now however it be different for although nervous i be sufficiently collect to be able to look about I and note the structure and size of the different vault i enter of course with the amount of light give by my candle it be not possible to examine each place minutely but i be enable to notice as i go along that the wall appear to be build with wonderful precision and finish while here and there a occasional massive pillar shoot up to support the vaulted roof thus i come at last to the great cellar that i remember it be reach through a huge arched entrance on which i observe strange fantastic carving which throw queer shadow under the light of my candle as i stand and examine these thoughtfully it occur to I how strange it be that i should be so little acquaint with my own house yet this may be easily understand when one realize the size of this ancient pile and the fact that only my old sister and i live in it occupy a few of the room such as we want decide hold the light high i pass on into the cellar and keep to the right pace slowly up until i reach the further end i walk quietly and look cautiously about as i go but so far as the light show i see nothing unusual at the top i turn to the left still keep to the wall and so continue until i have traverse the whole of the vast chamber as i move along i notice that the floor be compose of solid rock in place cover with a damp mould in other bare or almost so save for a thin coating of light-grey dust i have halt at the doorway now however i turn and make my way up the center of the place passing among the pillar and glance to right and leave as i move about halfway up the cellar i stub my foot against something that give out a metallic sound stoop quickly i hold the candle and see that the object i have kick be a large metal ring bend lower i clear the dust from around it and presently discover that it be attach to a ponderous trap door black with age feeling excite and wonder to where it could lead i lay my gun on the floor and stick the candle in the trigger guard take the ring in both hand and pull the trap creak loudly -- the sound echo vaguely through the huge place -- and open heavily prop the edge on my knee i reach for the candle and hold it in the opening move it to right and left but could see nothing i be puzzle and surprise there be no sign of step nor even the appearance of there ever have be any nothing save a empty blackness i might have be look down into a bottomless sideless well then even as i stare full of perplexity i seem to hear far down as though from untold depths a faint whisper of sound i bent my head quickly more into the opening and listen intently it may have be fancy but i could have swear to hear a soft titter that grow into a hideous chuckle faint and distant startled i leap backward let the trap fall with a hollow clang that fill the place with echo even then i seem to hear that mock suggestive laughter but this i know must be my imagination the sound i have hear be far too slight to penetrate through the cumbrous trap for a full minute i stand there quiver -- glance nervously behind and before but the great cellar be silent as a grave and gradually i shake off the frightened sensation with a calmer mind i become again curious to know into what that trap open but could not then summon sufficient courage to make a further investigation one thing i feel however be that the trap ought to be secure this i accomplish by place upon it several large piece of ` dress ' stone which i have notice in my tour along the east wall then after a final scrutiny of the rest of the place i retrace my way through the cellar to the stair and so reach the daylight with a infinite feeling of relief that the uncomfortable task be accomplish _ x _ the time of wait the sun be now warm and shine brightly form a wondrous contrast to the dark and dismal cellar and it be with comparatively light feeling that i make my way up to the tower to survey the garden there i find everything quiet and after a few minute go down to mary 's room here have knock and receive a reply i unlock the door my sister be sit quietly on the bed as though wait she seem quite herself again and make no attempt to move away as i approach yet i observe that she scan my face anxiously as though in doubt and but half assure in she mind that there be nothing to fear from I to my question as to how she feel she reply sanely enough that she be hungry and would like to go down to prepare breakfast if i do not mind for a minute i meditate whether it would be safe to let she out finally i tell she she might go on condition that she promise not to attempt to leave the house or meddle with any of the outer door at my mention of the door a sudden look of fright cross she face but she say nothing save to give the require promise and then leave the room silently cross the floor i approach pepper he have wake as i enter but beyond a slight yelp of pleasure and a soft rap with he tail have keep quiet now as i pat he he make a attempt to stand up and succeed only to fall back on he side with a little yowl of pain i speak to he and bid he lie still i be greatly delighted with he improvement and also with the natural kindness of my sister 's heart in take such good care of he in spite of she condition of mind after a while i leave he and go downstairs to my study in a little time mary appear carry a tray on which smoke a hot breakfast as she enter the room i see she gaze fasten on the prop that support the study door she lip tighten and i think she pale slightly but that be all put the tray down at my elbow she be leave the room quietly when i call she back she come it seem a little timidly as though startle and i note that she hand clutch at she apron nervously ` come mary ' i say ` cheer up thing look brighter i have see none of the creature since yesterday morning early ' she look at I in a curiously puzzle manner as though not comprehend then intelligence sweep into she eye and fear but she say nothing beyond a unintelligible murmur of acquiescence after that i keep silence it be evident that any reference to the swine-thing be more than she shake nerve could bear breakfast over i go up to the tower here during the greater part of the day i maintain a strict watch over the garden once or twice i go down to the basement to see how my sister be get along each time i find she quiet and curiously submissive indeed on the last occasion she even venture to address I on she own account with regard to some household matter that need attention though this be do with a almost extraordinary timidity i hail it with happiness as be the first word voluntarily speak since the critical moment when i have catch she unbar the back door to go out among those wait brute i wonder whether she be aware of she attempt and how near a thing it have be but refrain from question she thinking it best to let well alone that night i sleep in a bed the first time for two night in the morning i rise early and take a walk through the house all be as it should be and i go up to the tower to have a look at the garden here again i find perfect quietness at breakfast when i meet mary i be greatly pleased to see that she have sufficiently regain command over herself to be able to greet I in a perfectly natural manner she talk sensibly and quietly only keep carefully from any mention of the past couple of day in this i humor she to the extent of not attempt to lead the conversation in that direction earlier in the morning i have be to see pepper he be mend rapidly and bid fair to be on he leg in earnest in another day or two before leave the breakfast table i make some reference to he improvement in the short discussion that follow i be surprise to gather from my sister 's remark that she be still under the impression that he wound have be give by the wildcat of my invention it make I feel almost ashamed of myself for deceive she yet the lie have be tell to prevent she from be frightened and then i have be sure that she must have know the truth later when those brute have attack the house during the day i keep on the alert spending much of my time as on the previous day in the tower but not a sign could i see of the swine-creature nor hear any sound several time the thought have come to I that the thing have at last leave we but up to this time i have refuse to entertain the idea seriously now however i begin to feel that there be reason for hope it would soon be three day since i have see any of the thing but still i intend to use the utmost caution for all that i could tell this protracted silence might be a ruse to tempt I from the house -- perhaps right into they arm the thought of such a contingency be alone sufficient to make I circumspect so it be that the fourth fifth and sixth day go by quietly without my make any attempt to leave the house on the sixth day i have the pleasure of see pepper once more upon he foot and though still very weak he manage to keep I company during the whole of that day _ xi _ the search of the garden how slowly the time go and never a thing to indicate that any of the brute still infested the garden it be on the ninth day that finally i decide to run the risk if any there be and sally out with this purpose in view i load one of the shotgun carefully -- choose it as be more deadly than a rifle at close quarter and then after a final scrutiny of the grounds from the tower i call pepper to follow I and make my way down to the basement at the door i must confess to hesitate a moment the thought of what might be await I among the dark shrubbery be by no means calculate to encourage my resolution it be but a second though and then i have draw the bolt and be stand on the path outside the door pepper follow stop at the doorstep to sniff suspiciously and carry he nose up and down the jamb as though follow a scent then suddenly he turn sharply and start to run here and there in semicircle and circle all around the door finally return to the threshold here he begin again to nose about hitherto i have stand watch the dog yet all the time with half my gaze on the wild tangle of garden stretch ` round I now i go toward he and bend down examine the surface of the door where he be smell i find that the wood be cover with a network of scratch cross and recross one another in inextricable confusion in addition to this i notice that the doorpost themselves be gnaw in place beyond these i could find nothing and so stand up i begin to make the tour of the house wall pepper as soon as i walk away leave the door and run ahead still nose and sniff as he go along at time he stop to investigate here it would be a bullet-hole in the pathway or perhaps a powder stain wad anon it might be a piece of tear sod or a disturbed patch of weedy path but save for such trifle he find nothing i observe he critically as he go along and could discover nothing of uneasiness in he demeanor to indicate that he feel the nearness of any of the creature by this i be assure that the garden be empty at least for the present of those hateful thing pepper could not be easily deceive and it be a relief to feel that he would know and give I timely warning if there be any danger reach the place where i have shoot that first creature i stop and make a careful scrutiny but could see nothing from there i go on to where the great copingstone have fall it lay on its side apparently just as it have be leave when i shoot the brute that be move it a couple of foot to the right of the nearer end be a great dent in the ground show where it have strike the other end be still within the indentation -- half in and half out go nearer i look at the stone more closely what a huge piece of masonry it be and that creature have move it single-handed in its attempt to reach what lay below i go ` round to the further end of the stone here i find that it be possible to see under it for a distance of nearly a couple of foot still i could see nothing of the stricken creature and i feel much surprised i have as i have before say guess that the remains have be remove yet i could not conceive that it have be do so thoroughly as not to leave some certain sign beneath the stone indicative of they fate i have see several of the brute strike down beneath it with such force that they must have be literally drive into the earth and now not a vestige of they be to be see -- not even a bloodstain i feel more puzzle than ever as i turn the matter over in my mind but could think of no plausible explanation and so finally give it up as one of the many thing that be unexplainable from there i transfer my attention to the study door i could see now even more plainly the effect of the tremendous strain to which it have be subject and i marveled how even with the support afford by the prop it have withstand the attack so well there be no mark of blow -- indeed none have be give -- but the door have be literally rive from its hinge by the application of enormous silent force one thing that i observe affect I profoundly -- the head of one of the prop have be drive right through a panel this be of itself sufficient to show how huge a effort the creature have make to break down the door and how nearly they have succeed leave i continue my tour ` round the house finding little else of interest save at the back where i come across the piece of piping i have tear from the wall lie among the long grass underneath the break window then i return to the house and have re-bolt the back door go up to the tower here i spend the afternoon reading and occasionally glance down into the garden i have determine if the night pass quietly to go as far as the pit on the morrow perhaps i should be able to learn then something of what have happen the day slip away and the night come and go much as the last few night have go when i rise the morning have break fine and clear and i determine to put my project into action during breakfast i consider the matter carefully after which i go to the study for my shotgun in addition i load and slip into my pocket a small but heavy pistol i quite understand that if there be any danger it lay in the direction of the pit and i intend to be prepare leave the study i go down to the back door follow by pepper once outside i take a quick survey of the surround garden and then set off toward the pit on the way i keep a sharp outlook hold my gun handily pepper be run ahead i notice without any apparent hesitation from this i augured that there be no imminent danger to be apprehend and i step out more quickly in he wake he have reach the top of the pit now and be nose he way along the edge a minute later i be beside he look down into the pit for a moment i could scarcely believe that it be the same place so greatly be it change the dark wooded ravine of a fortnight ago with a foliage-hidden stream run sluggishly at the bottom exist no longer instead my eye show I a ragged chasm partly fill with a gloomy lake of turbid water all one side of the ravine be strip of underwood show the bare rock a little to my leave the side of the pit appear to have collapse altogether form a deep v-shaped cleft in the face of the rocky cliff this rift run from the upper edge of the ravine nearly down to the water and penetrate into the pit side to a distance of some forty foot its opening be at least six yard across and from this it seem to taper into about two but what attract my attention more than even the stupendous split itself be a great hole some distance down the cleft and right in the angle of the v it be clearly define and not unlike a arched doorway in shape though lie as it do in the shadow i could not see it very distinctly the opposite side of the pit still retain its verdure but so tear in place and everywhere cover with dust and rubbish that it be hardly distinguishable as such my first impression that there have be a land slip be i begin to see not sufficient of itself to account for all the change i witness and the water -- i turn suddenly for i have become aware that somewhere to my right there be a noise of run water i could see nothing but now that my attention have be catch i distinguish easily that it come from somewhere at the east end of the pit slowly i make my way in that direction the sound grow plainer as i advance until in a little i stand right above it even then i could not perceive the cause until i knelt down and thrust my head over the cliff here the noise come up to I plainly and i see below I a torrent of clear water issue from a small fissure in the pit side and rush down the rock into the lake beneath a little further along the cliff i see another and beyond that again two smaller one these then would help to account for the quantity of water in the pit and if the fall of rock and earth have block the outlet of the stream at the bottom there be little doubt but that it be contribute a very large share yet i puzzle my head to account for the generally _ shake _ appearance of the place -- these streamlet and that huge cleft further up the ravine it seem to I that more than the landslip be necessary to account for these i could imagine a earthquake or a great _ explosion _ create some such condition of affair as exist but of these there have be neither then i stand up quickly remember that crash and the cloud of dust that have follow directly rush high into the air but i shake my head unbelievingly no it must have be the noise of the fall rock and earth i have hear of course the dust would fly naturally still in spite of my reasoning i have a uneasy feeling that this theory do not satisfy my sense of the probable and yet be any other that i could suggest likely to be half so plausible pepper have be sit on the grass while i conduct my examination now as i turn up the north side of the ravine he rise and follow slowly and keep a careful watch in all direction i make the circuit of the pit but find little else that i have not already see from the west end i could see the four waterfall uninterruptedly they be some considerable distance up from the surface of the lake -- about fifty foot i calculate for a little while longer i loiter about keep my eye and ear open but still without see or hear anything suspicious the whole place be wonderfully quiet indeed save for the continuous murmur of the water at the top end no sound of any description break the silence all this while pepper have show no sign of uneasiness this seem to I to indicate that for the time be at least there be none of the swine-creature in the vicinity so far as i could see he attention appear to have be take chiefly with scratch and sniff among the grass at the edge of the pit at time he would leave the edge and run along toward the house as though follow invisible track but in all case return after a few minute i have little doubt but that he be really trace out the footstep of the swine-thing and the very fact that each one seem to lead he back to the pit appear to I a proof that the brute have all return whence they come at noon i go home for dinner during the afternoon i make a partial search of the garden accompany by pepper but without come upon anything to indicate the presence of the creature once as we make we way through the shrubbery pepper rush in among some bush with a fierce yelp at that i jump back in sudden fright and throw my gun forward in readiness only to laugh nervously as pepper reappear chase a unfortunate cat toward evening i give up the search and return to the house all at once as we be pass a great clump of bush on we right pepper disappear and i could hear he sniff and growl among they in a suspicious manner with my gun barrel i part the intervene shrubbery and look inside there be nothing to be see save that many of the branch be bent down and break as though some animal have make a lair there at no very previous date it be probably i think one of the place occupy by some of the swine-creature on the night of the attack next day i resume my search through the garden but without result by evening i have be right through they and now i know beyond the possibility of doubt that there be no longer any of the thing conceal about the place indeed i have often think since that i be correct in my earlier surmise that they have leave soon after the attack _ xii _ the subterranean pit another week come and go during which i spend a great deal of my time about the pit mouth i have come to the conclusion a few day earlier that the arched hole in the angle of the great rift be the place through which the swine-thing have make they exit from some unholy place in the bowels of the world how near the probable truth this go i be to learn later it may be easily understand that i be tremendously curious though in a frightened way to know to what infernal place that hole lead though so far the idea have not strike I seriously of make a investigation i be far too much imbue with a sense of horror of the swine-creature to think of venture willingly where there be any chance of come into contact with they gradually however as time pass this feeling grow insensibly less so that when a few day later the thought occur to I that it might be possible to clamber down and have a look into the hole i be not so exceedingly averse to it as might have be imagine still i do not think even then that i really intend to try any such foolhardy adventure for all that i could tell it might be certain death to enter that doleful look opening and yet such be the pertinacity of human curiosity that at last my chief desire be but to discover what lay beyond that gloomy entrance slowly as the day slide by my fear of the swine-thing become a emotion of the past -- more a unpleasant incredible memory than aught else thus a day come when throw thought and fancy adrift i procure a rope from the house and have make it fast to a stout tree at the top of the rift and some little distance back from the pit edge let the other end down into the cleft until it dangle right across the mouth of the dark hole then cautiously and with many misgiving as to whether it be not a mad act that i be attempt i climb slowly down use the rope as a support until i reach the hole here still hold on to the rope i stand and peer in all be perfectly dark and not a sound come to I yet a moment later it seem that i could hear something i hold my breath and listen but all be silent as the grave and i breathe freely once more at the same instant i hear the sound again it be like a noise of labored breathing -- deep and sharp-drawn for a short second i stand petrified not able to move but now the sound have cease again and i could hear nothing as i stand there anxiously my foot dislodge a pebble which fall inward into the dark with a hollow chink at once the noise be take up and repeat a score of time each succeed echo be fainter and seem to travel away from I as though into remote distance then as the silence fall again i hear that stealthy breathing for each respiration i make i could hear a answering breath the sound appear to be come nearer and then i hear several other but fainter and more distant why i do not grip the rope and spring up out of danger i can not say it be as though i have be paralyzed i break out into a profuse sweat and try to moisten my lip with my tongue my throat have go suddenly dry and i cough huskily it come back to I in a dozen horrible throaty tone mockingly i peered helplessly into the gloom but still nothing show i have a strange choky sensation and again i cough dryly again the echo take it up rise and fall grotesquely and die slowly into a muffle silence then suddenly a thought come to I and i hold my breath the other breathing stop i breathe again and once more it re-commenced but now i no longer fear i know that the strange sound be not make by any lurk swine-creature but be simply the echo of my own respiration yet i have receive such a fright that i be glad to scramble up the rift and haul up the rope i be far too shake and nervous to think of enter that dark hole then and so return to the house i feel more myself next morning but even then i could not summon up sufficient courage to explore the place all this time the water in the pit have be creep slowly up and now stand but a little below the opening at the rate at which it be rise it would be level with the floor in less than another week and i realize that unless i carry out my investigation soon i should probably never do so at all as the water would rise and rise until the open itself be submerge it may have be that this thought stir I to act but whatever it be a couple of day later see I stand at the top of the cleft fully equip for the task this time i be resolve to conquer my shirk and go right through with the matter with this intention i have bring in addition to the rope a bundle of candle mean to use they as a torch also my double-barreled shotgun in my belt i have a heavy horse-pistol load with buckshot as before i fasten the rope to the tree then have tie my gun across my shoulder with a piece of stout cord i lower myself over the edge of the pit at this movement pepper who have be eye my action watchfully rise to he foot and run to I with a half bark half wail it seem to I of warn but i be resolve on my enterprise and bid he lie down i would much have like to take he with I but this be next to impossible in the exist circumstance as my face drop level with the pit edge he lick I right across the mouth and then seize my sleeve between he tooth begin to pull back strongly it be very evident that he do not want I to go yet have make up my mind i have no intention of give up the attempt and with a sharp word to pepper to release I i continue my descent leave the poor old fellow at the top bark and cry like a forsake pup carefully i lower myself from projection to projection i know that a slip might mean a wet reach the entrance i let go the rope and untie the gun from my shoulder then with a last look at the sky -- which i notice be clouding over rapidly -- i go forward a couple of pace so as to be shield from the wind and light one of the candle hold it above my head and grasp my gun firmly i begin to move on slowly throw my glance in all direction for the first minute i could hear the melancholy sound of pepper 's howling come down to I gradually as i penetrate further into the darkness it grow fainter until in a little while i could hear nothing the path tend downward somewhat and to the left thence it keep on still run to the leave until i find that it be lead I right in the direction of the house very cautiously i move onward stop every few step to listen i have go perhaps a hundred yard when suddenly it seem to I that i catch a faint sound somewhere along the passage behind with my heart thud heavily i listen the noise grow plainer and appear to be approach rapidly i could hear it distinctly now it be the soft padding of run foot in the first moment of fright i stand irresolute not know whether to go forward or backward then with a sudden realization of the best thing to do i back up to the rocky wall on my right and hold the candle above my head wait -- gun in hand -- cursing my foolhardy curiosity for bring I into such a strait i have not long to wait but a few seconds before two eye reflect back from the gloom the ray of my candle i raise my gun use my right hand only and aim quickly even as i do so something leap out of the darkness with a blustering bark of joy that wake the echo like thunder it be pepper how he have contrived to scramble down the cleft i could not conceive as i brush my hand nervously over he coat i notice that he be drip and conclude that he must have try to follow I and fall into the water from which he would not find it very difficult to climb have wait a minute or so to steady myself i proceed along the way pepper follow quietly i be curiously glad to have the old fellow with I he be company and somehow with he at my heel i be less afraid also i know how quickly he keen ear would detect the presence of any unwelcome creature should there be such amid the darkness that wrap we for some minute we go slowly along the path still lead straight toward the house soon i conclude we should be stand right beneath it do the path but carry far enough i lead the way cautiously for another fifty yard or so then i stop and hold the light high and reason enough i have to be thankful that i do so for there not three pace forward the path vanish and in place show a hollow blackness that send sudden fear through I very cautiously i creep forward and peer down but could see nothing then i cross to the left of the passage to see whether there might be any continuation of the path here right against the wall i find that a narrow track some three foot wide lead onward carefully i step on to it but have not go far before i regret venture thereon for after a few pace the already narrow way resolve itself into a mere ledge with on the one side the solid unyielding rock tower up in a great wall to the unseen roof and on the other that yawn chasm i could not help reflect how helpless i be should i be attack there with no room to turn and where even the recoil of my weapon might be sufficient to drive I headlong into the depths below to my great relief a little further on the track suddenly broaden out again to its original breadth gradually as i go onward i notice that the path trend steadily to the right and so after some minute i discover that i be not go forward but simply circle the huge abyss i have evidently come to the end of the great passage five minute later i stand on the spot from which i have start have be completely ` round what i guess now to be a vast pit the mouth of which must be at least a hundred yard across for some little time i stand there lose in perplexing thought ` what do it all mean ' be the cry that have begin to reiterate through my brain a sudden idea strike I and i search ` round for a piece of stone presently i find a bit of rock about the size of a small loaf stick the candle upright in a crevice of the floor i go back from the edge somewhat and take a short run launch the stone forward into the chasm -- my idea be to throw it far enough to keep it clear of the side then i stoop forward and listen but though i keep perfectly quiet for at least a full minute no sound come back to I from out of the dark i know then that the depth of the hole must be immense for the stone have it strike anything be large enough to have set the echo of that weird place whisper for a indefinite period even as it be the cavern have give back the sound of my footfall multitudinously the place be awesome and i would willingly have retrace my step and leave the mystery of its solitude unsolved only to do so mean admit defeat then a thought come to try to get a view of the abyss it occur to I that if i place my candle ` round the edge of the hole i should be able to get at least some dim sight of the place i find on count that i have bring fifteen candle in the bundle -- my first intention have be as i have already say to make a torch of the lot these i proceed to place ` round the pit mouth with a interval of about twenty yard between each have complete the circle i stand in the passage and endeavor to get a idea of how the place look but i discover immediately that they be totally insufficient for my purpose they do little more than make the gloom visible one thing they do however and that be they confirm my opinion of the size of the opening and although they show I nothing that i want to see yet the contrast they afford to the heavy darkness pleased I curiously it be as though fifteen tiny star shine through the subterranean night then even as i stand pepper give a sudden howl that be take up by the echo and repeat with ghastly variation die away slowly with a quick movement i hold aloft the one candle that i have keep and glance down at the dog at the same moment i seem to hear a noise like a diabolical chuckle rise up from the hitherto silent depths of the pit i start then i recollect that it be probably the echo of pepper 's howl pepper have move away from I up the passage a few step he be nose along the rocky floor and i think i hear he lap i go toward he hold the candle low as i move i hear my boot go sop sop and the light be reflect from something that glisten and creep past my foot swiftly toward the pit i bent lower and look then give vent to a expression of surprise from somewhere higher up the path a stream of water be run quickly in the direction of the great opening and grow in size every second again pepper give vent to that deep-drawn howl and run at I seize my coat and attempt to drag I up the path toward the entrance with a nervous gesture i shake he off and cross quickly over to the left-hand wall if anything be come i be go to have the wall at my back then as i stare anxiously up the pathway my candle catch a gleam far up the passage at the same moment i become conscious of a murmurous roar that grow louder and fill the whole cavern with deafening sound from the pit come a deep hollow echo like the sob of a giant then i have spring to one side on to the narrow ledge that run ` round the abyss and turn see a great wall of foam sweep past I and leap tumultuously into the wait chasm a cloud of spray burst over I extinguish my candle and wet I to the skin i still hold my gun the three nearest candle go out but the further one give only a short flicker after the first rush the flow of water ease down to a steady stream maybe a foot in depth though i could not see this until i have procure one of the light candle and with it start to reconnoiter pepper have fortunately follow I as i leap for the ledge and now very much subdue keep close behind a short examination show I that the water reach right across the passage and be run at a tremendous rate already even as i stand there it have deepen i could make only a guess at what have happen evidently the water in the ravine have break into the passage by some means if that be the case it would go on increase in volume until i should find it impossible to leave the place the thought be frightening it be evident that i must make my exit as hurriedly as possible take my gun by the stock i sound the water it be a little under knee-deep the noise it make plunge down into the pit be deafening then with a call to pepper i step out into the flood use the gun as a staff instantly the water boil up over my knee and nearly to the top of my thigh with the speed at which it be race for one short moment i nearly lose my footing but the thought of what lay behind stimulate I to a fierce endeavor and step-by-step i make headway of pepper i know nothing at first i have all i could do to keep on my leg and be overjoy when he appear beside I he be wade manfully along he be a big dog with longish thin leg and i suppose the water have less grasp on they than upon mine anyway he manage a great deal better than i do go ahead of I like a guide and wittingly -- or otherwise -- help somewhat to break the force of the water on we go step by step struggle and gasp until somewhere about a hundred yard have be safely traverse then whether it be because i be take less care or that there be a slippery place on the rocky floor i can not say but suddenly i slip and fall on my face instantly the water leap over I in a cataract hurl I down toward that bottomless hole at a frightful speed frantically i struggle but it be impossible to get a footing i be helpless gasping and drown all at once something grip my coat and bring I to a standstill it be pepper miss I he must have race back through the dark turmoil to find I and then catch and hold I until i be able to get to my foot i have a dim recollection of have see momentarily the gleam of several light but of this i have never be quite sure if my impression be correct i must have be wash down to the very brink of that awful chasm before pepper manage to bring I to a standstill and the light of course could only have be the distant flame of the candle i have leave burning but as i have say i be not by any means sure my eye be full of water and i have be badly shake and there be i without my helpful gun without light and sadly confuse with the water deepen depend solely upon my old friend pepper to help I out of that hellish place i be face the torrent naturally it be the only way in which i could have sustain my position a moment for even old pepper could not have hold I long against that terrific strain without assistance however blind from I perhaps a minute pass during which it be touch and go with I then gradually i re-commenced my tortuous way up the passage and so begin the grimmest fight with death from which ever i hope to emerge victorious slowly furiously almost hopelessly i strove and that faithful pepper lead I drag I upward and onward until at last ahead i see a gleam of bless light it be the entrance only a few yard further and i reach the opening with the water surge and boil hungrily around my loin and now i understand the cause of the catastrophe it be rain heavily literally in torrent the surface of the lake be level with the bottom of the opening -- nay more than level it be above it evidently the rain have swollen the lake and cause this premature rise for at the rate the ravine have be fill it would not have reach the entrance for a couple more day luckily the rope by which i have descend be streaming into the opening upon the inrush water seize the end i knot it securely ` round pepper 's body then summon up the last remnant of my strength i commence to swarm up the side of the cliff i reach the pit edge in the last stage of exhaustion yet i have to make one more effort and haul pepper into safety slowly and wearily i haul on the rope once or twice it seem that i should have to give up for pepper be a weighty dog and i be utterly do yet to let go would have mean certain death to the old fellow and the thought spur I to greater exertion i have but a very hazy remembrance of the end i recall pull through moment that lag strangely i have also some recollection of see pepper 's muzzle appear over the pit edge after what seem a indefinite period of time then all grow suddenly dark _ xiii _ the trap in the great cellar i suppose i must have swoon for the next thing i remember i open my eye and all be dusk i be lie on my back with one leg double under the other and pepper be lick my ear i feel horribly stiff and my leg be numb from the knee downward for a few minute i lay thus in a dazed condition then slowly i struggle to a sit position and look about I it have stop rain but the tree still drip dismally from the pit come a continuous murmur of run water i feel cold and shivery my clothes be sodden and i ache all over very slowly the life come back into my numbed leg and after a little i essayed to stand up this i manage at the second attempt but i be very tottery and peculiarly weak it seem to I that i be go to be ill and i make shift to stumble my way toward the house my step be erratic and my head confuse at each step that i take sharp pain shoot through my limb i have go perhaps some thirty pace when a cry from pepper draw my attention and i turn stiffly toward he the old dog be try to follow I but could come no further owing to the rope with which i have haul he up be still tie ` round he body the other end not have be unfasten from the tree for a moment i fumble with the knot weakly but they be wet and hard and i could do nothing then i remember my knife and in a minute the rope be cut how i reach the house i scarcely know and of the day that follow i remember still less of one thing i be certain that have it not be for my sister 's untiring love and nursing i have not be write at this moment when i recover my sens it be to find that i have be in bed for nearly two week yet another week pass before i be strong enough to totter out into the garden even then i be not able to walk so far as the pit i would have like to ask my sister how high the water have rise but feel it be wiser not to mention the subject to she indeed since then i have make a rule never to speak to she about the strange thing that happen in this great old house it be not until a couple of day later that i manage to get across to the pit there i find that in my few week ' absence there have be work a wondrous change instead of the three-parts fill ravine i look out upon a great lake whose placid surface reflect the light coldly the water have rise to within half a dozen foot of the pit edge only in one part be the lake disturbed and that be above the place where far down under the silent water yawn the entrance to the vast underground pit here there be a continuous bubbling and occasionally a curious sort of sob gurgle would find its way up from the depth beyond these there be nothing to tell of the thing that be hide beneath as i stand there it come to I how wonderfully thing have work out the entrance to the place whence the swine-creature have come be seal up by a power that make I feel there be nothing more to fear from they and yet with the feeling there be a sensation that now i should never learn anything further of the place from which those dreadful thing have come it be completely shut off and conceal from human curiosity forever strange -- in the knowledge of that underground hell-hole -- how apposite have be the naming of the pit one wonder how it originate and when naturally one conclude that the shape and depth of the ravine would suggest the name ` pit ' yet be it not possible that it have all along hold a deeper significance a hint -- could one but have guess -- of the greater more stupendous pit that lie far down in the earth beneath this old house under this house even now the idea be strange and terrible to I for i have prove beyond doubt that the pit yawn right below the house which be evidently support somewhere above the center of it upon a tremendous arched roof of solid rock it happen in this wise that have occasion to go down to the cellar the thought occur to I to pay a visit to the great vault where the trap be situate and see whether everything be as i have leave it reach the place i walk slowly up the center until i come to the trap there it be with the stone pile upon it just as i have see it last i have a lantern with I and the idea come to I that now would be a good time to investigate whatever lay under the great oak slab place the lantern on the floor i tumble the stone off the trap and grasp the ring pull the door open as i do so the cellar become fill with the sound of a murmurous thunder that rise from far below at the same time a damp wind blow up into my face bring with it a load of fine spray therewith i drop the trap hurriedly with a half frightened feeling of wonder for a moment i stand puzzle i be not particularly afraid the haunting fear of the swine-thing have leave I long ago but i be certainly nervous and astonished then a sudden thought possess I and i raise the ponderous door with a feeling of excitement leave it stand upon its end i seize the lantern and kneel down thrust it into the opening as i do so the moist wind and spray drive in my eye make I unable to see for a few moment even when my eye be clear i could distinguish nothing below I save darkness and whirling spray see that it be useless to expect to make out anything with the light so high i feel in my pocket for a piece of twine with which to lower it further into the opening even as i fumble the lantern slip from my finger and hurtle down into the darkness for a brief instant i watch its fall and see the light shine on a tumult of white foam some eighty or a hundred foot below I then it be go my sudden surmise be correct and now i know the cause of the wet and noise the great cellar be connect with the pit by means of the trap which open right above it and the moisture be the spray rise from the water fall into the depths in a instant i have a explanation of certain thing that have hitherto puzzle I now i could understand why the noise -- on the first night of the invasion -- have seem to rise directly from under my foot and the chuckle that have sound when first i open the trap evidently some of the swine-thing must have be right beneath I another think strike I be the creature all drown would they drown i remember how unable i have be to find any trace to show that my shooting have be really fatal have they life as we understand life or be they ghoul these thought flash through my brain as i stand in the dark search my pocket for match i have the box in my hand now and strike a light i step to the trap door and close it then i pile the stone back upon it after which i make my way out from the cellar and so i suppose the water go on thunder down into that bottomless hell-pit sometimes i have a inexplicable desire to go down to the great cellar open the trap and gaze into the impenetrable spray-damp darkness at time the desire become almost overpower in its intensity it be not mere curiosity that prompt I but more as though some unexplained influence be at work still i never go and intend to fight down the strange longing and crush it even as i would the unholy thought of self-destruction this idea of some intangible force be exert may seem reasonless yet my instinct warn I that it be not so in these thing reason seem to I less to be trust than instinct one think there be in close that impress itself upon I with ever grow insistence it be that i live in a very strange house a very awful house and i have begin to wonder whether i be do wisely in stay here yet if i leave where could i go and still obtain the solitude and the sense of she presence -lrb- 1 -rrb- that alone make my old life bearable _ xiv _ the sea of sleep for a considerable period after the last incident which i have narrate in my diary i have serious thought of leave this house and might have do so but for the great and wonderful thing of which i be about to write how well i be advise in my heart when i stay on here -- spite of those vision and sight of unknown and unexplainable thing for have i not stay then i have not see again the face of she i love yes though few know it none now save my sister mary i have love and ah I -- lose i would write down the story of those sweet old day but it would be like the tear of old wound yet after that which have happen what need have i to care for she have come to I out of the unknown strangely she warn I warn I passionately against this house beg I to leave it but admit when i question she that she could not have come to I have i be elsewhere yet in spite of this still she warn I earnestly tell I that it be a place long ago give over to evil and under the power of grim law of which none here have knowledge and i -- i just ask she again whether she would come to I elsewhere and she could only stand silent it be thus that i come to the place of the sea of sleep -- so she term it in she dear speech with I i have stay up in my study reading and must have doze over the book suddenly i awake and sit upright with a start for a moment i look ` round with a puzzle sense of something unusual there be a misty look about the room give a curious softness to each table and chair and furnish gradually the mistiness increase grow as it be out of nothing then slowly a soft white light begin to glow in the room the flame of the candle shine through it palely i look from side to side and find that i could still see each piece of furniture but in a strangely unreal way more as though the ghost of each table and chair have take the place of the solid article gradually as i look i see they fade and fade until slowly they resolve into nothingness now i look again at the candle they shine wanly and even as i watch grow more unreal and so vanish the room be fill now with a soft yet luminous white twilight like a gentle mist of light beyond this i could see nothing even the wall have vanish presently i become conscious that a faint continuous sound pulsed through the silence that wrap I i listen intently it grow more distinct until it appear to I that i hark to the breathing of some great sea i can not tell how long a space pass thus but after a while it seem that i could see through the mistiness and slowly i become aware that i be stand upon the shore of a immense and silent sea this shore be smooth and long vanish to right and left of I in extreme distance in front swam a still immensity of sleep ocean at time it seem to I that i catch a faint glimmer of light under its surface but of this i could not be sure behind I rise up to a extraordinary height gaunt black cliff overhead the sky be of a uniform cold gray color -- the whole place be light by a stupendous globe of pale fire that swim a little above the far horizon and shed a foamlike light above the quiet water beyond the gentle murmur of the sea a intense stillness prevail for a long while i stay there look out across its strangeness then as i stare it seem that a bubble of white foam float up out of the depths and then even now i know not how it be i be look upon nay look _ into _ the face of she -- aye into she face -- into she soul and she look back at I with such a commingling of joy and sadness that i run toward she blindly cry strangely to she in a very agony of remembrance of terror and of hope to come to I yet spite of my cry she stay out there upon the sea and only shake she head sorrowfully but in she eye be the old earth-light of tenderness that i have come to know before all thing ere we be part at she perverseness i grow desperate and essay to wade out to she yet though i would i could not something some invisible barrier hold I back and i be fain to stay where i be and cry out to she in the fullness of my soul ' o my darling my darling -- ' but could say no more for very intensity and at that she come over swiftly and touch I and it be as though heaven have open yet when i reach out my hand to she she put I from she with tenderly stern hand and i be abashed -- the fragment -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- _ the legible portion of the mutilate leave _ -rrb- through tear noise of eternity in my ear we part she whom i love o my god i be a great time dazed and then i be alone in the blackness of the night i know that i journey back once more to the known universe presently i emerge from that enormous darkness i have come among the star vast time the sun far and remote i enter into the gulf that separate we system from the outer sun as i speed across the divide dark i watch steadily the ever-growing brightness and size of we sun once i glance back to the star and see they shift as it be in my wake against the mighty background of night so vast be the speed of my pass spirit i draw nigher to we system and now i could see the shine of jupiter later i distinguish the cold blue gleam of the earthlight i have a moment of bewilderment all about the sun there seem to be bright object move in rapid orbit inward nigh to the savage glory of the sun there circle two dart point of light and further off there fly a blue shine speck that i know to be the earth it circle the sun in a space that seem to be no more than a earth-minute nearer with great speed i see the radiance of jupiter and saturn spin with incredible swiftness in huge orbit and ever i draw more nigh and look out upon this strange sight -- the visible circling of the planet about the mother sun it be as though time have be annihilate for I so that a year be no more to my unfleshed spirit than be a moment to a earth-bound soul the speed of the planet appear to increase and presently i be watch the sun all ringed about with hair-like circle of different color fire -- the path of the planet hurtle at mighty speed about the central flame the sun grow vast as though it leap to meet I and now i be within the circling of the outer planet and flit swiftly toward the place where the earth glimmer through the blue splendor of its orbit as though a fiery mist circle the sun at a monstrous speed -lrb- 3 -rrb- _ xv _ the noise in the night and now i come to the strangest of all the strange happening that have befall I in this house of mystery it occur quite lately -- within the month and i have little doubt but that what i saw be in reality the end of all thing however to my story i do not know how it be but up to the present i have never be able to write these thing down directly they happen it be as though i have to wait a time recover my just balance and digest -- as it be -- the thing i have hear or see no doubt this be as it should be for by wait i see the incident more truly and write of they in a calmer and more judicial frame of mind this by the way it be now the end of November my story relate to what happen in the first week of the month it be night about eleven o'clock pepper and i keep one another company in the study -- that great old room of mine where i read and work i be read curiously enough the bible i have begin in these later day to take a grow interest in that great and ancient book suddenly a distinct tremor shake the house and there come a faint and distant whir buzz that grow rapidly into a far muffle scream it remind I in a queer gigantic way of the noise that a clock make when the catch be release and it be allow to run down the sound appear to come from some remote height -- somewhere up in the night there be no repetition of the shock i look across at pepper he be sleep peacefully gradually the whir noise decrease and there come a long silence all at once a glow light up the end window which protrude far out from the side of the house so that from it one may look both east and west i feel puzzle and after a moment 's hesitation walk across the room and pull aside the blind as i do so i see the sun rise from behind the horizon it rise with a steady perceptible movement i could see it travel upward in a minute it seem it have reach the top of the tree through which i have watch it up up -- it be broad daylight now behind I i be conscious of a sharp mosquito-like buzz i glance ` round and know that it come from the clock even as i look it mark off a hour the minute hand be move ` round the dial faster than a ordinary second-hand the hour hand move quickly from space to space i have a numb sense of astonishment a moment later so it seem the two candle go out almost together i turn swiftly back to the window for i have see the shadow of the window-frame travel along the floor toward I as though a great lamp have be carry up past the window i saw now that the sun have rise high into the heaven and be still visibly move it pass above the house with a extraordinary sailing kind of motion as the window come into shadow i see another extraordinary thing the fine-weather cloud be not pass easily across the sky -- they be scamper as though a hundred-mile-an-hour wind blow as they pass they change they shape a thousand time a minute as though writhe with a strange life and so be go and presently other come and whisk away likewise to the west i see the sun drop with a incredible smooth swift motion eastward the shadow of every see thing creep toward the come greyness and the movement of the shadow be visible to I -- a stealthy writhe creep of the shadow of the wind-stirred tree it be a strange sight quickly the room begin to darken the sun slide down to the horizon and seem as it be to disappear from my sight almost with a jerk through the greyness of the swift evening i see the silver crescent of the moon fall out of the southern sky toward the west the evening seem to merge into a almost instant night above I the many constellation pass in a strange ` noiseless ' circle westward the moon fall through that last thousand fathom of the night-gulf and there be only the starlight about this time the buzz in the corner cease tell I that the clock have run down a few minute pass and i see the eastward sky lighten a gray sullen morning spread through all the darkness and hide the march of the star overhead there move with a heavy everlasting roll a vast seamless sky of gray cloud -- a cloud-sky that would have seem motionless through all the length of a ordinary earth-day the sun be hide from I but from moment to moment the world would brighten and darken brighten and darken beneath wave of subtle light and shadow the light shift ever westward and the night fall upon the earth a vast rain seem to come with it and a wind of a most extraordinary loudness -- as though the howling of a nightlong gale be pack into the space of no more than a minute this noise pass almost immediately and the cloud break so that once more i could see the sky the star be fly westward with astounding speed it come to I now for the first time that though the noise of the wind have pass yet a constant ` blur ' sound be in my ear now that i notice it i be aware that it have be with I all the time it be the world-noise and then even as i grasped at so much comprehension there come the eastward light no more than a few heartbeat and the sun rise swiftly through the tree i see it and then it be above the tree up -- up it soar and all the world be light it pass with a swift steady swing to its highest altitude and fall thence westward i see the day roll visibly over my head a few light cloud flitter northward and vanish the sun go down with one swift clear plunge and there be about I for a few seconds the darker grow gray of the gloaming southward and westward the moon be sink rapidly the night have come already a minute it seem and the moon fall those remain fathom of dark sky another minute or so and the eastward sky glow with the come dawn the sun leap upon I with a frightening abruptness and soar ever more swiftly toward the zenith then suddenly a fresh thing come to my sight a black thundercloud rush up out of the south and seem to leap all the arc of the sky in a single instant as it come i see that its advance edge flap like a monstrous black cloth in the heaven twirling and undulate rapidly with a horrid suggestiveness in a instant all the air be full of rain and a hundred lightning flash seem to flood downward as it be in one great shower in the same second of time the world-noise be drown in the roar of the wind and then my ear ache under the stunning impact of the thunder and in the midst of this storm the night come and then within the space of another minute the storm have pass and there be only the constant ` blur ' of the world-noise on my hearing overhead the star be slide quickly westward and something mayhap the particular speed to which they have attain bring home to I for the first time a keen realization of the knowledge that it be the world that revolve i seem to see suddenly the world -- a vast dark mass -- revolving visibly against the star the dawn and the sun seem to come together so greatly have the speed of the world-revolution increase the sun drive up in one long steady curve pass its highest point and sweep down into the western sky and disappear i be scarcely conscious of evening so brief be it then i be watch the fly constellation and the westward hasten moon in but a space of seconds so it seem it be slide swiftly downward through the night-blue and then be go and almost directly come the morning and now there seem to come a strange acceleration the sun make one clean clear sweep through the sky and disappear behind the westward horizon and the night come and go with a like haste as the succeed day open and close upon the world i be aware of a sweat of snow suddenly upon the earth the night come and almost immediately the day in the brief leap of the sun i see that the snow have vanish and then once more it be night thus matter be and even after the many incredible thing that i have see i experience all the time a most profound awe to see the sun rise and set within a space of time to be measure by seconds to watch -lrb- after a little -rrb- the moon leap -- a pale and ever grow orb -- up into the night sky and glide with a strange swiftness through the vast arc of blue and presently to see the sun follow spring out of the eastern sky as though in chase and then again the night with the swift and ghostly passing of starry constellation be all too much to view believingly yet so it be -- the day slip from dawn to dusk and the night slide swiftly into day ever rapidly and more rapidly the last three passage of the sun have show I a snow-covered earth which at night have seem for a few seconds incredibly weird under the fast-shifting light of the soar and fall moon now however for a little space the sky be hide by a sea of sway leaden-white cloud which lighten and blacken alternately with the passage of day and night the cloud ripple and vanish and there be once more before I the vision of the swiftly leap sun and night that come and go like shadow faster and faster spin the world and now each day and night be complete within the space of but a few seconds and still the speed increase it be a little later that i notice that the sun have begin to have the suspicion of a trail of fire behind it this be due evidently to the speed at which it apparently traverse the heaven and as the day speed each one quicker than the last the sun begin to assume the appearance of a vast flaming comet -lrb- 4 -rrb- flare across the sky at short periodic interval at night the moon present with much greater truth a comet-like aspect a pale and singularly clear fast travel shape of fire trail streak of cold flame the star show now merely as fine hair of fire against the dark once i turn from the window and glance at pepper in the flash of a day i see that he sleep quietly and i move once more to my watch the sun be now burst up from the eastern horizon like a stupendous rocket seem to occupy no more than a second or two in hurl from east to west i could no longer perceive the passage of cloud across the sky which seem to have darken somewhat the brief night appear to have lose the proper darkness of night so that the hair-like fire of the fly star show but dimly as the speed increase the sun begin to sway very slowly in the sky from south to north and then slowly again from north to south so amid a strange confusion of mind the hour pass all this while have pepper sleep presently feel lonely and distraught i call to he softly but he take no notice again i call raise my voice slightly still he move not i walk over to where he lay and touch he with my foot to rouse he at the action gentle though it be he fall to piece that be what happen he literally and actually crumble into a moulder heap of bone and dust for the space of perhaps a minute i stare down at the shapeless heap that have once be pepper i stand feeling stun what can have happen i ask myself not at once grasp the grim significance of that little hill of ash then as i stir the heap with my foot it occur to I that this could only happen in a great space of time year -- and year outside the weave fluttering light hold the world inside i stand try to understand what it mean -- what that little pile of dust and dry bone on the carpet mean but i could not think coherently i glance away ` round the room and now for the first time notice how dusty and old the place look dust and dirt everywhere pile in little heap in the corner and spread about upon the furniture the very carpet itself be invisible beneath a coating of the same all pervade material as i walk little cloud of the stuff rise up from under my footstep and assail my nostril with a dry bitter odor that make I wheeze huskily suddenly as my glance fall again upon pepper 's remain i stand still and give voice to my confusion -- question aloud whether the year be indeed pass whether this which i have take to be a form of vision be in truth a reality i pause a new thought have strike I quickly but with step which for the first time i notice totter i go across the room to the great pier-glass and look in it be too cover with grime to give back any reflection and with tremble hand i begin to rub off the dirt presently i could see myself the thought that have come to I be confirm instead of the great hale man who scarcely look fifty i be look at a bent decrepit man whose shoulder stoop and whose face be wrinkle with the year of a century the hair -- which a few short hour ago have be nearly coal black -- be now silvery white only the eye be bright gradually i trace in that ancient man a faint resemblance to my self of other day i turn away and totter to the window i know now that i be old and the knowledge seem to confirm my tremble walk for a little space i stare moodily out into the blur vista of changeful landscape even in that short time a year pass and with a petulant gesture i leave the window as i do so i notice that my hand shake with the palsy of old age and a short sob choke its way through my lip for a little while i paced tremulously between the window and the table my gaze wander hither and thither uneasily how dilapidated the room be everywhere lay the thick dust -- thick sleepy and black the fender be a shape of rust the chain that hold the brass clock-weight have rust through long ago and now the weight lay on the floor beneath themselves two cone of verdigris as i glance about it seem to I that i could see the very furniture of the room rot and decay before my eye nor be this fancy on my part for all at once the bookshelf along the sidewall collapse with a crack and rend of rotten wood precipitate its contents upon the floor and fill the room with a smother of dusty atom how tired i feel as i walk it seem that i could hear my dry joint creak and crack at every step i wonder about my sister be she dead as well as pepper all have happen so quickly and suddenly this must be indeed the beginning of the end of all thing it occur to I to go to look for she but i feel too weary and then she have be so queer about these happening of late of late i repeat the word and laugh feebly -- mirthlessly as the realization be bear in upon I that i speak of a time half a century go half a century it might have be twice as long i move slowly to the window and look out once more across the world i can best describe the passage of day and night at this period as a sort of gigantic ponderous flicker moment by moment the acceleration of time continue so that at night now i see the moon only as a sway trail of palish fire that vary from a mere line of light to a nebulous path and then dwindle again disappear periodically the flicker of the day and night quicken the day have grow perceptibly darker and a queer quality of dusk lay as it be in the atmosphere the night be so much lighter that the star be scarcely to be see save here and there a occasional hair-like line of fire that seem to sway a little with the moon quicker and ever quicker run the flicker of day and night and suddenly it seem i be aware that the flicker have die out and instead there reign a comparatively steady light which be shed upon all the world from a eternal river of flame that swing up and down north and south in stupendous mighty swing the sky be now grow very much darker and there be in the blue of it a heavy gloom as though a vast blackness peer through it upon the earth yet there be in it also a strange and awful clearness and emptiness periodically i have glimpse of a ghostly track of fire that sway thin and darkly toward the sun-stream vanish and reappear it be the scarcely visible moon-stream look out at the landscape i be conscious again of a blur sort of ` flitter ' that come either from the light of the ponderous-swinging sun-stream or be the result of the incredibly rapid change of the earth 's surface and every few moment so it seem the snow would lie suddenly upon the world and vanish as abruptly as though a invisible giant ` flit ' a white sheet off and on the earth time flee and the weariness that be mine grow insupportable i turn from the window and walk once across the room the heavy dust deaden the sound of my footstep each step that i take seem a greater effort than the one before a intolerable ache know I in every joint and limb as i trod my way with a weary uncertainty by the opposite wall i come to a weak pause and wonder dimly what be my intent i look to my left and see my old chair the thought of sit in it bring a faint sense of comfort to my bewildered wretchedness yet because i be so weary and old and tired i would scarcely brace my mind to do anything but stand and wish myself past those few yard i rock as i stand the floor even seem a place for rest but the dust lay so thick and sleepy and black i turn with a great effort of will and make toward my chair i reach it with a groan of thankfulness i sit down everything about I appear to be grow dim it be all so strange and unthought of last night i be a comparatively strong though elderly man and now only a few hour later -- i look at the little dust-heap that have once be pepper hour and i laugh a feeble bitter laugh a shrill cackling laugh that shock my dimming sens for a while i must have doze then i open my eye with a start somewhere across the room there have be a muffle noise of something fall i look and see vaguely a cloud of dust hover above a pile of _ débris _ nearer the door something else tumble with a crash it be one of the cupboard but i be tired and take little notice i close my eye and sit there in a state of drowsy semi-unconsciousness once or twice -- as though come through thick mist -- i hear noise faintly then i must have sleep _ xvi _ the awakening i awake with a start for a moment i wonder where i be then memory come to I the room be still light with that strange light -- half-sun half-moon light i feel refresh and the tired weary ache have leave I i go slowly across to the window and look out overhead the river of flame drive up and down north and south in a dancing semi-circle of fire as a mighty sleigh in the loom of time it seem -- in a sudden fancy of mine -- to be beat home the pick of the year for so vastly have the passage of time be accelerate that there be no longer any sense of the sun pass from east to west the only apparent movement be the north and south beat of the sun-stream that have become so swift now as to be better describe as a _ quiver _ as i peer out there come to I a sudden inconsequent memory of that last journey among the outer world i remember the sudden vision that have come to I as i near the solar system of the fast whirling planet about the sun -- as though the govern quality of time have be hold in abeyance and the machine of a universe allow to run down a eternity in a few moment or hour the memory pass along with a but partially comprehend suggestion that i have be permit a glimpse into further time space i stare out again seemingly at the quake of the sun-stream the speed seem to increase even as i look several lifetime come and go as i watch suddenly it strike I with a sort of grotesque seriousness that i be still alive i thought of pepper and wonder how it be that i have not follow he fate he have reach the time of he die and have pass probably through sheer length of year and here be i alive hundred of thousand of century after my rightful period of year for a time i mused absently ` yesterday -- ' i stop suddenly yesterday there be no yesterday the yesterday of which i speak have be swallow up in the abyss of year age go i grow daze with much thinking presently i turn from the window and glance ` round the room it seem different -- strangely utterly different then i know what it be that make it appear so strange it be bare : there be not a piece of furniture in the room not even a solitary fitting of any sort gradually my amazement go as i remember that this be but the inevitable end of that process of decay which i have witness commence before my sleep thousand of year million of year over the floor be spread a deep layer of dust that reach half way up to the window-seat it have grow immeasurably whilst i sleep and represent the dust of untold age undoubtedly atom of the old decayed furniture help to swell its bulk and somewhere among it all moulder the long-ago-dead pepper all at once it occur to I that i have no recollection of wade knee-deep through all that dust after i awake true a incredible age of year have pass since i approach the window but that be evidently as nothing compare with the countless space of time that i conceive have vanish whilst i be sleep i remember now that i have fall asleep sit in my old chair have it go i glance toward where it have stand of course there be no chair to be see i could not satisfy myself whether it have disappear after my waking or before if it have moulder under I surely i should have be wake by the collapse then i remember that the thick dust which cover the floor would have be sufficient to soften my fall so that it be quite possible i have sleep upon the dust for a million year or more as these thought wander through my brain i glance again casually to where the chair have stand then for the first time i notice that there be no mark in the dust of my footprint between it and the window but then age of year have pass since i have awake -- ten of thousand of year my look rest thoughtfully again upon the place where once have stand my chair suddenly i pass from abstraction to intentness for there in its standing place i make out a long undulation round off with the heavy dust yet it be not so much hidden but that i could tell what have cause it i know -- and shiver at the knowledge -- that it be a human body ages-dead lie there beneath the place where i have sleep it be lie on its right side its back turn toward I i could make out and trace each curve and outline soften and mould as it be in the black dust in a vague sort of way i try to account for its presence there slowly i begin to grow bewildered as the thought come to I that it lay just about where i must have fall when the chair collapse gradually a idea begin to form itself within my brain a thought that shake my spirit it seem hideous and insupportable yet it grow upon I steadily until it become a conviction the body under that coating that shroud of dust be neither more nor less than my own dead shell i do not attempt to prove it i know it now and wonder i have not know it all along i be a bodiless thing awhile i stand try to adjust my thought to this new problem in time -- how many thousand of year i know not -- i attain to some degree of quietude -- sufficient to enable I to pay attention to what be transpire around I now i see that the elongate mound have sink collapse level with the rest of the spreading dust and fresh atom impalpable have settle above that mixture of grave-powder which the aeon have ground a long while i stand turn from the window gradually i grow more collect while the world slip across the century into the future presently i begin a survey of the room now i see that time be begin its destructive work even on this strange old building that it have stand through all the year be it seem to I proof that it be something different from any other house i do not think somehow that i have think of its decay though why i could not have say it be not until i have meditate upon the matter for some considerable time that i fully realize that the extraordinary space of time through which it have stand be sufficient to have utterly pulverize the very stone of which it be build have they be take from any earthly quarry yes it be undoubtedly moulder now all the plaster have go from the wall even as the woodwork of the room have go many age before while i stand in contemplation a piece of glass from one of the small diamond-shaped pane drop with a dull tap amid the dust upon the sill behind I and crumble into a little heap of powder as i turn from contemplate it i see light between a couple of the stone that form the outer wall evidently the mortar be fall away after awhile i turn once more to the window and peer out i discover now that the speed of time have become enormous the lateral quiver of the sun-stream have grow so swift as to cause the dancing semi-circle of flame to merge into and disappear in a sheet of fire that cover half the southern sky from east to west from the sky i glance down to the garden they be just a blur of a palish dirty green i have a feeling that they stand higher than in the old day a feeling that they be nearer my window as though they have rise bodily yet they be still a long way below I for the rock over the mouth of the pit on which this house stand arch up to a great height it be later that i notice a change in the constant color of the garden the pale dirty green be grow ever paler and paler toward white at last after a great space they become greyish-white and stay thus for a very long time finally however the greyness begin to fade even as have the green into a dead white and this remain constant and unchanged and by this i know that at last snow lay upon all the northern world and so by million of year time winged onward through eternity to the end -- the end of which in the old-earth day i have think remotely and in hazily speculative fashion and now it be approach in a manner of which none have ever dream i recollect that about this time i begin to have a lively though morbid curiosity as to what would happen when the end come -- but i seem strangely without imagining all this while the steady process of decay be continue the few remain piece of glass have long ago vanish and every now and then a soft thud and a little cloud of rise dust would tell of some fragment of fall mortar or stone i look up again to the fiery sheet that quake in the heaven above I and far down into the southern sky as i look the impression be bear in upon I that it have lose some of its first brilliancy -- that it be duller deeper hued i glance down once more to the blur white of the worldscape sometimes my look return to the burning sheet of dull flame that be and yet hide the sun at time i glance behind I into the grow dusk of the great silent room with its aeon-carpet of sleep dust so i watch through the fleeting age lose in soul-wearing thought and wondering and possess with a new weariness _ xvii _ the slow rotation it might have be a million year later that i perceive beyond possibility of doubt that the fiery sheet that light the world be indeed darkening another vast space go by and the whole enormous flame have sink to a deep copper color gradually it darken from copper to copper-red and from this at time to a deep heavy purplish tint with in it a strange loom of blood although the light be decrease i could perceive no diminishment in the apparent speed of the sun it still spread itself in that dazzling veil of speed the world so much of it as i could see have assume a dreadful shade of gloom as though in very deed the last day of the world approach the sun be die of that there could be little doubt and still the earth whirl onward through space and all the aeon at this time i remember a extraordinary sense of bewilderment take I i find myself later wander mentally amid a odd chaos of fragmentary modern theory and the old biblical story of the world 's end then for the first time there flash across I the memory that the sun with its system of planet be and have be travel through space at a incredible speed abruptly the question rise -- _ where _ for a very great time i pondered this matter but finally with a certain sense of the futility of my puzzling i let my thought wander to other thing i grow to wonder how much longer the house would stand also i query to myself whether i should be doom to stay bodiless upon the earth through the dark-time that i know be come from these thought i fall again to speculation upon the possible direction of the sun 's journey through space and so another great while pass gradually as time flee i begin to feel the chill of a great winter then i remember that with the sun die the cold must be necessarily extraordinarily intense slowly slowly as the aeon slip into eternity the earth sink into a heavier and redder gloom the dull flame in the firmament take on a deeper tint very somber and turbid then at last it be bear upon I that there be a change the fiery gloomy curtain of flame that hang quake overhead and down away into the southern sky begin to thin and contract and in it as one see the fast vibration of a jarred harp-string i see once more the sun-stream quiver giddily north and south slowly the likeness to a sheet of fire disappear and i see plainly the slow beat of the sun-stream yet even then the speed of its swing be inconceivably swift and all the time the brightness of the fiery arc grow ever duller underneath the world loom dimly -- a indistinct ghostly region overhead the river of flame sway slower and even slower until at last it swing to the north and south in great ponderous beat that last through seconds a long space go by and now each sway of the great belt last nigh a minute so that after a great while i cease to distinguish it as a visible movement and the streaming fire run in a steady river of dull flame across the deadly-looking sky a indefinite period pass and it seem that the arc of fire become less sharply define it appear to I to grow more attenuate and i think blackish streak show occasionally presently as i watch the smooth onward-flow cease and i be able to perceive that there come a momentary but regular darkening of the world this grow until once more night descend in short but periodic interval upon the wearying earth longer and longer become the night and the day equal they so that at last the day and the night grow to the duration of seconds in length and the sun show once more like a almost invisible coppery-red color ball within the glowing mistiness of its flight correspond to the dark line show at time in its trail there be now distinctly to be see on the half-visible sun itself great dark belt year after year flash into the past and the day and night spread into minute the sun have cease to have the appearance of a tail and now rise and set -- a tremendous globe of a glowing copper-bronze hue in part ringed with blood-red band in other with the dusky one that i have already mention these circle -- both red and black -- be of vary thickness for a time i be at a loss to account for they presence then it occur to I that it be scarcely likely that the sun would cool evenly all over and that these marking be due probably to difference in temperature of the various area the red represent those part where the heat be still fervent and the black those portion which be already comparatively cool it strike I as a peculiar thing that the sun should cool in evenly define ring until i remember that possibly they be but isolate patch to which the enormous rotatory speed of the sun have impart a belt-like appearance the sun itself be very much greater than the sun i have know in the old-world day and from this i argue that it be considerably nearer at night the moon -lrb- 6 -rrb- still show but small and remote and the light she reflect be so dull and weak that she seem little more than the small dim ghost of the olden moon that i have know gradually the day and night lengthen out until they equal a space somewhat less than one of the old-earth hour the sun rise and set like a great ruddy bronze disk cross with ink-black bar about this time i find myself able once more to see the garden with clearness for the world have now grow very still and changeless yet i be not correct in say ` garden ' for there be no garden -- nothing that i know or recognize in place thereof i look out upon a vast plain stretch away into distance a little to my leave there be a low range of hill everywhere there be a uniform white covering of snow in place rise into hummock and ridge it be only now that i recognize how really great have be the snowfall in place it be vastly deep as be witness by a great upleap wave-shaped hill away to my right though it be not impossible that this be due in part to some rise in the surface of the ground strangely enough the range of low hill to my leave -- already mention -- be not entirely cover with the universal snow instead i could see they bare dark side show in several place and everywhere and always there reign a incredible death-silence and desolation the immutable awful quiet of a die world all this time the day and night be lengthen perceptibly already each day occupy maybe some two hour from dawn to dusk at night i have be surprise to find that there be very few star overhead and these small though of a extraordinary brightness which i attribute to the peculiar but clear blackness of the nighttime away to the north i could discern a nebulous sort of mistiness not unlike in appearance a small portion of the milky way it might have be a extremely remote star-cluster or -- the thought come to I suddenly -- perhaps it be the sidereal universe that i have know and now leave far behind forever -- a small dimly glowing mist of star far in the depths of space still the day and night lengthen slowly each time the sun rise duller than it have set and the dark belt increase in breadth about this time there happen a fresh thing the sun earth and sky be suddenly darken and apparently blot out for a brief space i have a sense a certain awareness -lrb- i could learn little by sight -rrb- that the earth be endure a very great fall of snow then in a instant the veil that have obscure everything vanish and i look out once more a marvelous sight meet my gaze the hollow in which this house with its garden stand be brim with snow -lrb- 7 -rrb- it lip over the sill of my window everywhere it lay a great level stretch of white which catch and reflect gloomily the somber coppery glow of the die sun the world have become a shadowless plain from horizon to horizon i glance up at the sun it shine with a extraordinary dull clearness i see it now as one who until then have see it only through a partially obscure medium all about it the sky have become black with a clear deep blackness frightful in its nearness and its unmeasured deep and its utter unfriendliness for a great time i look into it newly and shake and fearful it be so near have i be a child i might have express some of my sensation and distress by say that the sky have lose its roof later i turn and peer about I into the room everywhere it be cover with a thin shroud of the all-pervading white i could see it but dimly by reason of the somber light that now light the world it appear to cling to the ruin wall and the thick soft dust of the year that cover the floor knee-deep be nowhere visible the snow must have blow in through the open framework of the window yet in no place have it drift but lay everywhere about the great old room smooth and level moreover there have be no wind these many thousand year but there be the snow -lrb- 8 -rrb- as i have tell and all the earth be silent and there be a cold such as no living man can ever have know the earth be now illuminate by day with a most doleful light beyond my power to describe it seem as though i look at the great plain through the medium of a bronze-tinted sea it be evident that the earth 's rotatory movement be depart steadily the end come all at once the night have be the longest yet and when the die sun show at last above the world 's edge i have grow so wearied of the dark that i greet it as a friend it rise steadily until about twenty degree above the horizon then it stop suddenly and after a strange retrograde movement hang motionless -- a great shield in the sky -lrb- 9 -rrb- only the circular rim of the sun show bright -- only this and one thin streak of light near the equator gradually even this thread of light die out and now all that be leave of we great and glorious sun be a vast dead disk rim with a thin circle of bronze-red light _ xviii _ the green star the world be hold in a savage gloom -- cold and intolerable outside all be quiet -- quiet from the dark room behind I come the occasional soft thud -lrb- 10 -rrb- of fall matter -- fragment of rot stone so time pass and night grasp the world wrap it in wrapping of impenetrable blackness there be no night-sky as we know it even the few straggle star have vanish conclusively i might have be in a shutter room without a light for all that i could see only in the impalpableness of gloom opposite burnt that vast encircle hair of dull fire beyond this there be no ray in all the vastitude of night that surround I save that far in the north that soft mistlike glow still shine silently year move on what period of time pass i shall never know it seem to I wait there that eternity come and go stealthily and still i watch i could see only the glow of the sun 's edge at time for now it have commence to come and go -- light up a while and again become extinguish all at once during one of these period of life a sudden flame cut across the night -- a quick glare that light up the dead earth shortly give I a glimpse of its flat lonesomeness the light appear to come from the sun -- shoot out from somewhere near its center diagonally a moment i gaze startled then the leap flame sink and the gloom fall again but now it be not so dark and the sun be belt by a thin line of vivid white light i stare intently have a volcano break out on the sun yet i negatived the think as soon as form i feel that the light have be far too intensely white and large for such a cause another idea there be that suggest itself to I it be that one of the inner planet have fall into the sun -- become incandescent under that impact this theory appeal to I as be more plausible and account more satisfactorily for the extraordinary size and brilliance of the blaze that have light up the dead world so unexpectedly full of interest and emotion i stare across the darkness at that line of white fire cut the night one thing it tell to I unmistakably : the sun be yet rotate at a enormous speed -lrb- 11 -rrb- thus i know that the year be still fleeting at a incalculable rate though so far as the earth be concerned life and light and time be thing belong to a period lose in the long go age after that one burst of flame the light have show only as a encircle band of bright fire now however as i watch it begin slowly to sink into a ruddy tint and later to a dark copper-red color much as the sun have do presently it sink to a deeper hue and in a still further space of time it begin to fluctuate have period of glowing and anon die thus after a great while it disappear long before this the smolder edge of the sun have deaden into blackness and so in that supremely future time the world dark and intensely silent ride on its gloomy orbit around the ponderous mass of the dead sun my thought at this period can be scarcely describe at first they be chaotic and want in coherence but later as the age come and go my soul seem to imbibe the very essence of the oppressive solitude and dreariness that hold the earth with this feeling there come a wonderful clearness of thought and i realize despairingly that the world might wander for ever through that enormous night for a while the unwholesome idea fill I with a sensation of overbearing desolation so that i could have cry like a child in time however this feeling grow almost insensibly less and a unreasoning hope possess I patiently i wait from time to time the noise of drop particle behind in the room come dully to my ear once i hear a loud crash and turn instinctively to look forget for the moment the impenetrable night in which every detail be submerge in a while my gaze seek the heaven turn unconsciously toward the north yes the nebulous glow still show indeed i could have almost imagine that it look somewhat plainer for a long time i keep my gaze fix upon it feel in my lonely soul that its soft haze be in some way a tie with the past strange the trifle from which one can suck comfort and yet have i but know -- but i shall come to that in its proper time for a very long space i watch without experience any of the desire for sleep that would so soon have visit I in the old-earth day how i should have welcome it if only to have pass the time away from my perplexity and thought several time the comfortless sound of some great piece of masonry fall disturbed my meditation and once it seem i could hear whisper in the room behind I yet it be utterly useless to try to see anything such blackness as exist scarcely can be conceive it be palpable and hideously brutal to the sense as though something dead press up against I -- something soft and icily cold under all this there grow up within my mind a great and overwhelming distress of uneasiness that leave I but to drop I into a uncomfortable brooding i feel that i must fight against it and presently hope to distract my thought i turn to the window and look up toward the north in search of the nebulous whiteness which still i believe to be the far and misty glowing of the universe we have leave even as i raise my eye i be thrill with a feeling of wonder for now the hazy light have resolve into a single great star of vivid green as i stare astonish the thought flash into my mind that the earth must be travel toward the star not away as i have imagine next that it could not be the universe the earth have leave but possibly a outlying star belong to some vast star-cluster hide in the enormous depths of space with a sense of commingled awe and curiosity i watch it wonder what new thing be to be reveal to I for a while vague thought and speculation occupy I during which my gaze dwelt insatiably upon that one spot of light in the otherwise pitlike darkness hope grow up within I banish the oppression of despair that have seem to stifle I wherever the earth be travel it be at least go once more toward the realm of light light one must spend a eternity wrap in soundless night to understand the full horror of be without it slowly but surely the star grow upon my vision until in time it shine as brightly as have the planet jupiter in the old-earth day with increase size its color become more impressive remind I of a huge emerald scintillating ray of fire across the world year flee away in silence and the green star grow into a great splash of flame in the sky a little later i see a thing that fill I with amazement it be the ghostly outline of a vast crescent in the night a gigantic new moon seem to be grow out of the surround gloom utterly bemused i stare at it it appear to be quite close -- comparatively and i puzzle to understand how the earth have come so near to it without my have see it before the light throw by the star grow stronger and presently i be aware that it be possible to see the earthscape again though indistinctly awhile i stare try to make out whether i could distinguish any detail of the world 's surface but i find the light insufficient in a little i give up the attempt and glance once more toward the star even in the short space that my attention have be divert it have increase considerably and seem now to my bewildered sight about a quarter of the size of the full moon the light it throw be extraordinarily powerful yet its color be so abominably unfamiliar that such of the world as i could see show unreal more as though i look out upon a landscape of shadow than aught else all this time the great crescent be increase in brightness and begin now to shine with a perceptible shade of green steadily the star increase in size and brilliancy until it show fully as large as half a full moon and as it grow greater and brighter so do the vast crescent throw out more and more light though of a ever deepen hue of green under the combined blaze of they radiance the wilderness that stretch before I become steadily more visible soon i seem able to stare across the whole world which now appear beneath the strange light terrible in its cold and awful flat dreariness it be a little later that my attention be draw to the fact that the great star of green flame be slowly sink out of the north toward the east at first i could scarcely believe that i see aright but soon there could be no doubt that it be so gradually it sink and as it fall the vast crescent of glowing green begin to dwindle and dwindle until it become a mere arc of light against the livid color sky later it vanish disappear in the self-same spot from which i have see it slowly emerge by this time the star have come to within some thirty degree of the hidden horizon in size it could now have rival the moon at its full though even yet i could not distinguish its disk this fact lead I to conceive that it be still a extraordinary distance away and this be so i know that its size must be huge beyond the conception of man to understand or imagine suddenly as i watch the lower edge of the star vanish -- cut by a straight dark line a minute -- or a century -- pass and it dip lower until the half of it have disappear from sight far away out on the great plain i see a monstrous shadow blot it out and advance swiftly only a third of the star be visible now then like a flash the solution of this extraordinary phenomenon reveal itself to I the star be sink behind the enormous mass of the dead sun or rather the sun -- obedient to its attraction -- be rise toward it -lrb- 12 -rrb- with the earth follow in its trail as these thought expand in my mind the star vanish be completely hide by the tremendous bulk of the sun over the earth there fall once more the brooding night with the darkness come a intolerable feeling of loneliness and dread for the first time i thought of the pit and its inmate after that there rise in my memory the still more terrible thing that have haunt the shore of the sea of sleep and lurk in the shadow of this old building where be they i wonder -- and shiver with miserable thought for a time fear hold I and i prayed wildly and incoherently for some ray of light with which to dispel the cold blackness that envelop the world how long i wait it be impossible to say -- certainly for a very great period then all at once i see a loom of light shine out ahead gradually it become more distinct suddenly a ray of vivid green flash across the darkness at the same moment i see a thin line of livid flame far in the night a instant it seem and it have grow into a great clot of fire beneath which the world lay bath in a blaze of emerald green light steadily it grow until presently the whole of the green star have come into sight again but now it could be scarcely call a star for it have increase to vast proportion be incomparably greater than the sun have be in the olden time then as i stare i become aware that i could see the edge of the lifeless sun glowing like a great crescent-moon slowly its light surface broaden out to I until half of its diameter be visible and the star begin to drop away on my right time pass and the earth move on slowly traverse the tremendous face of the dead sun -lrb- 13 -rrb- gradually as the earth travel forward the star fall still more to the right until at last it shine on the back of the house send a flood of broken ray in through the skeleton-like wall glance upward i see that much of the ceiling have vanish enable I to see that the upper storey be even more decay the roof have evidently go entirely and i could see the green effulgence of the starlight shine in slantingly _ xix _ the end of the solar system from the abutment where once have be the window through which i have watch that first fatal dawn i could see that the sun be hugely greater than it have be when first the star light the world so great be it that its lower edge seem almost to touch the far horizon even as i watch i imagine that it draw closer the radiance of green that light the frozen earth grow steadily brighter thus for a long space thing be then on a sudden i see that the sun be change shape and grow smaller just as the moon would have do in past time in a while only a third of the illuminate part be turn toward the earth the star bear away on the left gradually as the world move on the star shone upon the front of the house once more while the sun show only as a great bow of green fire a instant it seem and the sun have vanish the star be still fully visible then the earth move into the black shadow of the sun and all be night -- night black starless and intolerable fill with tumultuous thought i watch across the night -- wait year it may have be and then in the dark house behind I the clotted stillness of the world be break i seem to hear a soft padding of many foot and a faint inarticulate whisper of sound grow on my sense i look ` round into the blackness and see a multitude of eye as i stare they increase and appear to come toward I for a instant i stand unable to move then a hideous swine-noise -lrb- 14 -rrb- rise up into the night and at that i leap from the window out on to the frozen world i have a confused notion of have run awhile and after that i just wait -- wait several time i hear shriek but always as though from a distance except for these sound i have no idea of the whereabouts of the house time move onward i be conscious of little save a sensation of cold and hopelessness and fear a age it seem and there come a glow that tell of the come light it grow tardily then -- with a loom of unearthly glory -- the first ray from the green star strike over the edge of the dark sun and light the world it fall upon a great ruin structure some two hundred yard away it be the house stare i see a fearsome sight -- over its wall crawl a legion of unholy thing almost cover the old building from totter tower to base i could see they plainly they be the swine-creature the world move out into the light of the star and i see that now it seem to stretch across a quarter of the heaven the glory of its livid light be so tremendous that it appear to fill the sky with quiver flame then i see the sun it be so close that half of its diameter lay below the horizon and as the world circle across its face it seem to tower right up into the sky a stupendous dome of emerald color fire from time to time i glance toward the house but the swine-thing seem unaware of my proximity year appear to pass slowly the earth have almost reach the center of the sun 's disk the light from the green _ sun _ -- as now it must be call -- shone through the interstice that gap the mouldered wall of the old house give they the appearance of be wrap in green flame the swine-creature still crawl about the wall suddenly there rise a loud roar of swine-voice and up from the center of the roofless house shoot a vast column of blood-red flame i see the little twisted tower and turret flash into fire yet still preserve they twisted crookedness the beam of the green sun beat upon the house and intermingle with its lurid glow so that it appear a blaze furnace of red and green fire fascinate i watch until a overwhelming sense of come danger draw my attention i glance up and at once it be bear upon I that the sun be closer so close in fact that it seem to overhang the world then -- i know not how -- i be catch up into strange height -- float like a bubble in the awful effulgence far below I i see the earth with the burning house leap into a ever grow mountain of flame ` round about it the ground appear to be glowing and in place heavy wreath of yellow smoke ascend from the earth it seem as though the world be become ignite from that one plague-spot of fire faintly i could see the swine-thing they appear quite unharmed then the ground seem to cave in suddenly and the house with its load of foul creature disappear into the depths of the earth send a strange blood color cloud into the height i remember the hell pit under the house in a while i look ` round the huge bulk of the sun rise high above I the distance between it and the earth grow rapidly less suddenly the earth appear to shoot forward in a moment it have traverse the space between it and the sun i hear no sound but out from the sun 's face gush a ever-growing tongue of dazzling flame it seem to leap almost to the distant green sun -- shear through the emerald light a very cataract of blind fire it reach its limit and sink and on the sun glow a vast splash of burn white -- the grave of the earth the sun be very close to I now presently i find that i be rise higher until at last i ride above it in the emptiness the green sun be now so huge that its breadth seem to fill up all the sky ahead i look down and note that the sun be pass directly beneath I a year may have go by -- or a century -- and i be leave suspend alone the sun show far in front -- a black circular mass against the molten splendor of the great green orb near one edge i observe that a lurid glow have appear mark the place where the earth have fall by this i know that the long-dead sun be still revolving though with great slowness afar to my right i seem to catch at time a faint glow of whitish light for a great time i be uncertain whether to put this down to fancy or not thus for a while i stare with fresh wondering until at last i know that it be no imaginary thing but a reality it grow brighter and presently there slide out of the green a pale globe of softest white it come nearer and i see that it be apparently surround by a robe of gently glowing cloud time pass i glance toward the diminish sun it show only as a dark blot on the face of the green sun as i watch i see it grow smaller steadily as though rush toward the superior orb at a immense speed intently i stare what would happen i be conscious of extraordinary emotion as i realize that it would strike the green sun it grow no bigger than a pea and i look with my whole soul to witness the final end of we system -- that system which have bear the world through so many aeon with its multitudinous sorrow and joy and now -- suddenly something cross my vision cut from sight all vestige of the spectacle i watch with such soul-interest what happen to the dead sun i do not see but i have no reason -- in the light of that which i saw afterward -- to disbelieve that it fall into the strange fire of the green sun and so perished and then suddenly a extraordinary question rise in my mind whether this stupendous globe of green fire might not be the vast central sun -- the great sun ` round which we universe and countless other revolve i feel confused i thought of the probable end of the dead sun and another suggestion come dumbly -- do the dead star make the green sun they grave the idea appeal to I with no sense of grotesqueness but rather as something both possible and probable _ xx _ the celestial globe for a while many thought crowd my mind so that i be unable to do aught save stare blindly before I i seem whelm in a sea of doubt and wonder and sorrowful remembrance it be later that i come out of my bewilderment i look about dazedly thus i see so extraordinary a sight that for a while i could scarcely believe i be not still wrap in the visionary tumult of my own thought out of the reign green have grow a boundless river of softly shimmering globe -- each one enfold in a wondrous fleece of pure cloud they reach both above and below I to a unknown distance and not only hide the shine of the green sun but supply in place thereof a tender glow of light that suffuse itself around I like unto nothing i have ever see before or since in a little i notice that there be about these sphere a sort of transparency almost as though they be form of clouded crystal within which burn a radiance -- gentle and subdue they move on past I continually float onward at no great speed but rather as though they have eternity before they a great while i watch and could perceive no end to they at time i seem to distinguish face amid the cloudiness but strangely indistinct as though partly real and partly form of the mistiness through which they show for a long time i wait passively with a sense of grow content i have no longer that feeling of unutterable loneliness but feel rather that i be less alone than i have be for kalpa of year this feeling of contentment increase so that i would have be satisfy to float in company with those celestial globule forever age slip by and i see the shadowy face with increase frequency also with greater plainness whether this be due to my soul have become more attuned to its surroundings i can not tell -- probably it be so but however this may be i be assure now only of the fact that i become steadily more conscious of a new mystery about I tell I that i have indeed penetrate within the borderland of some unthought-of region -- some subtle intangible place or form of existence the enormous stream of luminous sphere continue to pass I at a unvarying rate -- countless million and still they come show no sign of end nor even diminish then as i be bear silently upon the unbuoying ether i feel a sudden irresistible forward movement toward one of the pass globe a instant and i be beside it then i slide through into the interior without experience the least resistance of any description for a short while i could see nothing and wait curiously all at once i become aware that a sound break the inconceivable stillness it be like the murmur of a great sea at calm -- a sea breathing in its sleep gradually the mist that obscure my sight begin to thin away and so in time my vision dwelt once again upon the silent surface of the sea of sleep for a little i gaze and could scarcely believe i see aright i glance ` round there be the great globe of pale fire swimming as i have see it before a short distance above the dim horizon to my left far across the sea i discover presently a faint line as of thin haze which i guess to be the shore where my love and i have meet during those wonderful period of soul-wandering that have be grant to I in the old earth day another a troubled memory come to I -- of the formless thing that have haunt the shore of the sea of sleep the guardian of that silent echoless place these and other detail i remembered and know without doubt that i be look out upon that same sea with the assurance i be fill with a overwhelming feeling of surprise and joy and shake expectancy conceive it possible that i be about to see my love again intently i gaze around but could catch no sight of she at that for a little i feel hopeless fervently i prayed and ever peer anxiously how still be the sea down far beneath I i could see the many trail of changeful fire that have draw my attention formerly vaguely i wonder what cause they also i remember that i have intend to ask my dear one about they as well as many other matter -- and i have be force to leave she before the half that i have wish to say be say my thought come back with a leap i be conscious that something have touch I i turn quickly god thou wert indeed gracious -- it be she she look up into my eye with a eager longing and i look down to she with all my soul i should like to have hold she but the glorious purity of she face keep I afar then out of the wind mist she put she dear arm she whisper come to I soft as the rustle of a pass cloud ` dearest ' she say that be all but i have hear and in a moment i hold she to I -- as i prayed -- forever in a little she speak of many thing and i listen willingly would i have do so through all the age that be to come at time i whisper back and my whisper bring to she spirit face once more a indescribably delicate tint -- the bloom of love later i speak more freely and to each word she listen and make answer delightfully so that already i be in paradise she and i and nothing save the silent spacious void to see we and only the quiet water of the sea of sleep to hear we long before the float multitude of cloud-enfolded sphere have vanish into nothingness thus we look upon the face of the slumberous deep and be alone alone god i would be thus alone in the hereafter and yet be never lonely i have she and greater than this she have I aye aeon-aged I and on this thought and some other i hope to exist through the few remain year that may yet lie between we _ xxi _ the dark sun how long we soul lay in the arm of joy i can not say but all at once i be wake from my happiness by a diminution of the pale and gentle light that light the sea of sleep i turn toward the huge white orb with a premonition of come trouble one side of it be curve inward as though a convex black shadow be sweeping across it my memory go back it be thus that the darkness have come before we last parting i turn toward my love inquiringly with a sudden knowledge of woe i notice how wan and unreal she have grow even in that brief space she voice seem to come to I from a distance the touch of she hand be no more than the gentle pressure of a summer wind and grow less perceptible already quite half of the immense globe be shroud a feeling of desperation seize I be she about to leave I would she have to go as she have go before i question she anxiously frightenedly and she nestle closer explain in that strange faraway voice that it be imperative she should leave I before the sun of darkness -- as she term it -- blot out the light at this confirmation of my fear i be overcome with despair and could only look voicelessly across the quiet plain of the silent sea how swiftly the darkness spread across the face of the white orb yet in reality the time must have be long beyond human comprehension at last only a crescent of pale fire light the now dim sea of sleep all this while she have hold I but with so soft a caress that i have be scarcely conscious of it we wait there together she and i speechless for very sorrow in the dim light she face show shadowy -- blend into the dusky mistiness that encircle we then when a thin curved line of soft light be all that light the sea she release I -- push I from she tenderly she voice sound in my ear ' i may not stay longer dear one ' it end in a sob she seem to float away from I and become invisible she voice come to I out of the shadow faintly apparently from a great distance : -- ' a little while -- ' it die away remotely in a breath the sea of sleep darken into night far to my left i seem to see for a brief instant a soft glow it vanish and in the same moment i become aware that i be no longer above the still sea but once more suspend in infinite space with the green sun -- now eclipse by a vast dark sphere -- before I utterly bewilder i stare almost unseeingly at the ring of green flame leap above the dark edge even in the chaos of my thought i wonder dully at they extraordinary shape a multitude of question assail I i think more of she i have so lately see than of the sight before I my grief and thought of the future fill I be i doom to be separate from she always even in the old earth-days she have be mine only for a little while then she have leave I as i think forever since then i have see she but these time upon the sea of sleep a feeling of fierce resentment fill I and miserable questioning why could i not have go with my love what reason to keep we apart why have i to wait alone while she slumber through the year on the still bosom of the sea of sleep the sea of sleep my thought turn inconsequently out of they channel of bitterness to fresh desperate questioning where be it where be it i seem to have but just part from my love upon its quiet surface and it have go utterly it could not be far away and the white orb which i have see hide in the shadow of the sun of darkness my sight dwelt upon the green sun -- eclipse what have eclipse it be there a vast dead star circle it be the _ central _ sun -- as i have come to regard it -- a double star the thought have come almost unbidden yet why should it not be so my thought go back to the white orb strange that it should have be -- i stop a idea have come suddenly the white orb and the green sun be they one and the same my imagination wander backward and i remember the luminous globe to which i have be so unaccountably attract it be curious that i should have forget it even momentarily where be the other i revert again to the globe i have enter i think for a time and matter become clearer i conceive that by enter that impalpable globule i have pass at once into some further and until then invisible dimension there the green sun be still visible but as a stupendous sphere of pale white light -- almost as though its ghost show and not its material part a long time i mused on the subject i remember how on enter the sphere i have immediately lose all sight of the other for a still further period i continue to revolve the different detail in my mind in a while my thought turn to other thing i come more into the present and begin to look about I seeingly for the first time i perceive that innumerable ray of a subtle violet hue pierce the strange semi-darkness in all direction they radiate from the fiery rim of the green sun they seem to grow upon my vision so that in a little i see that they be countless the night be fill with they -- spread outward from the green sun fan-wise i conclude that i be enable to see they by reason of the sun 's glory be cut off by the eclipse they reach right out into space and vanish gradually as i look i become aware that fine point of intensely brilliant light traverse the ray many of they seem to travel from the green sun into distance other come out of the void toward the sun but one and all each keep strictly to the ray in which it travel they speed be inconceivably great and it be only when they near the green sun or as they leave it that i could see they as separate speck of light further from the sun they become thin line of vivid fire within the violet the discovery of these ray and the move spark interested I extraordinarily to where do they lead in such countless profusion i thought of the world in space and those spark messenger possibly the idea be fantastic but i be not conscious of its be so messenger messenger from the central sun a idea evolve itself slowly be the green sun the abode of some vast intelligence the thought be bewildering vision of the unnameable rise vaguely have i indeed come upon the dwelling-place of the eternal for a time i repel the think dumbly it be too stupendous yet huge vague thought have birth within I i feel suddenly terribly naked and a awful nearness shake I and heaven be that a illusion my thought come and go erratically the sea of sleep -- and she heaven i come back with a bind to the present somewhere out of the void behind I there rush a immense dark body -- huge and silent it be a dead star hurl onward to the bury place of the star it drive between I and the central sun -- blot they out from my vision and plunge I into a impenetrable night a age and i see again the violet ray a great while later -- aeon it must have be -- a circular glow grow in the sky ahead and i see the edge of the recede star show darkly against it thus i know that it be near the central sun presently i see the bright ring of the green sun show plainly against the night the star have pass into the shadow of the dead sun after that i just wait the strange year go slowly and ever i watch intently ` the thing i have expect come at last -- suddenly awfully a vast flare of dazzling light a streaming burst of white flame across the dark void for a indefinite while it soar outward -- a gigantic mushroom of fire it cease to grow then as time go by it begin to sink backward slowly i saw now that it come from a huge glowing spot near the center of the dark sun mighty flame still soar outward from this yet spite of its size the grave of the star be no more than the shine of jupiter upon the face of a ocean when compare with the inconceivable mass of the dead sun i may remark here once more that no word will ever convey to the imagination the enormous bulk of the two central sun _ xxii _ the dark nebula year melt into the past century aeon the light of the incandescent star sink to a furious red it be later that i see the dark nebula -- at first a impalpable cloud away to my right it grow steadily to a clot of blackness in the night how long i watch it be impossible to say for time as we count it be a thing of the past it come closer a shapeless monstrosity of darkness -- tremendous it seem to slip across the night sleepily -- a very hell-fog slowly it slide nearer and pass into the void between I and the central sun it be as though a curtain have be draw before my vision a strange tremor of fear take I and a fresh sense of wonder the green twilight that have reign for so many million of year have now give place to impenetrable gloom motionless i peer about I a century flee and it seem to I that i detect occasional dull glow of red pass I at interval earnestly i gaze and presently seem to see circular mass that show muddily red within the clouded blackness they appear to be grow out of the nebulous murk awhile and they become plainer to my accustomed vision i could see they now with a fair amount of distinctness -- ruddy-tinged sphere similar in size to the luminous globe that i have see so long previously they float past I continually gradually a peculiar uneasiness seize I i become aware of a grow feeling of repugnance and dread it be direct against those pass orb and seem bear of intuitive knowledge rather than of any real cause or reason some of the pass globe be brighter than other and it be from one of these that a face look suddenly a face human in its outline but so tortured with woe that i stare aghast i have not think there be such sorrow as i see there i be conscious of a add sense of pain on perceive that the eye which glare so wildly be sightless a while longer i see it then it have pass on into the surround gloom after this i see other -- all wear that look of hopeless sorrow and blind a long time go by and i become aware that i be nearer to the orb than i have be at this i grow uneasy though i be less in fear of those strange globule than i have be before see they sorrowful inhabitant for sympathy have temper my fear later there be no doubt but that i be be carry closer to the red sphere and presently i float among they in awhile i perceive one bear down upon I i be helpless to move from its path in a minute it seem it be upon I and i be submerge in a deep red mist this clear and i stare confusedly across the immense breadth of the plain of silence it appear just as i have first see it i be move forward steadily across its surface away ahead shine the vast blood-red ring -lrb- 15 -rrb- that light the place all around be spread the extraordinary desolation of stillness that have so impressed I during my previous wanderings across its starkness presently i see rise up into the ruddy gloom the distant peak of the mighty amphitheatre of mountain where untold age before i have be show my first glimpse of the terror that underlie many thing and where vast and silent watch by a thousand mute god stand the replica of this house of mystery -- this house that i have see swallow up in that hell-fire ere the earth have kiss the sun and vanish for ever though i could see the crest of the mountain-amphitheatre yet it be a great while before they lower portion become visible possibly this be due to the strange ruddy haze that seem to cling to the surface of the plain however be this as it may i see they at last in a still further space of time i have come so close to the mountain that they appear to overhang I presently i see the great rift open before I and i drift into it without volition on my part later i come out upon the breadth of the enormous arena there at a apparent distance of some five mile stand the house huge monstrous and silent -- lie in the very center of that stupendous amphitheatre so far as i could see it have not alter in any way but look as though it be only yesterday that i have see it around the grim dark mountain frown down upon I from they lofty silence far to my right away up among inaccessible peak loom the enormous bulk of the great beast-god higher i see the hideous form of the dread goddess rise up through the red gloom thousand of fathom above I to the left i make out the monstrous eyeless-thing gray and inscrutable further off recline on its lofty ledge the livid ghoul-shape show -- a splash of sinister color among the dark mountain slowly i move out across the great arena -- float as i go i make out the dim form of many of the other lurk horror that people those supreme height gradually i near the house and my thought flash back across the abyss of year i remember the dread specter of the place a short while pass and i see that i be be waft directly toward the enormous mass of that silent building about this time i become aware in a indifferent sort of way of a grow sense of numbness that rob I of the fear which i should otherwise have feel on approach that awesome pile as it be i view it calmly -- much as a man view calamity through the haze of he tobacco smoke in a little while i have come so close to the house as to be able to distinguish many of the detail about it the longer i look the more be i confirm in my long-ago impression of its entire similitude to this strange house save in its enormous size i could find nothing unlike suddenly as i stare a great feeling of amazement fill I i have come opposite to that part where the outer door lead into the study be situate there lie right across the threshold lay a great length of cope stone identical -- save in size and color -- with the piece i have dislodge in my fight with the pit-creature i float nearer and my astonishment increase as i note that the door be break partly from its hinge precisely in the manner that my study door have be force inward by the assault of the swine-thing the sight start a train of thought and i begin to trace dimly that the attack on this house might have a far deeper significance than i have hitherto imagine i remember how long ago in the old earth-days i have half suspect that in some unexplainable manner this house in which i live be _ en rapport _ -- to use a recognize term -- with that other tremendous structure away in the midst of that incomparable plain now however it begin to be bear upon I that i have but vaguely conceive what the realization of my suspicion mean i begin to understand with a more than human clearness that the attack i have repel be in some extraordinary manner connect with a attack upon that strange edifice with a curious inconsequence my thought abruptly leave the matter to dwell wonderingly upon the peculiar material out of which the house be construct it be -- as i have mention earlier -- of a deep green color yet now that i have come so close to it i perceive that it fluctuate at time though slightly -- glowing and fading much as do the fume of phosphorus when rub upon the hand in the dark presently my attention be distract from this by come to the great entrance here for the first time i be afraid for all in a moment the huge door swing back and i drift in between they helplessly inside all be blackness impalpable in a instant i have cross the threshold and the great door close silently shut I in that lightless place for a while i seem to hang motionless suspend amid the darkness then i become conscious that i be move again where i could not tell suddenly far down beneath I i seem to hear a murmurous noise of swine-laughter it sink away and the succeed silence appear clog with horror then a door open somewhere ahead a white haze of light filter through and i float slowly into a room that seem strangely familiar all at once there come a bewildering scream noise that deafen I i see a blur vista of vision flame before my sight my sens be daze through the space of a eternal moment then my power of see come back to I the dizzy hazy feeling pass and i see clearly _ xxiii _ pepper i be seat in my chair back again in this old study my glance wander ` round the room for a minute it have a strange quivery appearance -- unreal and unsubstantial this disappear and i see that nothing be alter in any way i look toward the end window -- the blind be up i rise to my foot shakily as i do so a slight noise in the direction of the door attract my attention i glance toward it for a short instant it appear to I that it be be close gently i stare and see that i must have be mistake -- it seem closely shut with a succession of effort i trod my way to the window and look out the sun be just rise light up the tangled wilderness of garden for perhaps a minute i stand and stare i pass my hand confusedly across my forehead presently amid the chaos of my sens a sudden thought come to I i turn quickly and call to pepper there be no answer and i stumble across the room in a quick access of fear as i go i try to frame he name but my lip be numb i reach the table and stoop down to he with a catch at my heart he be lie in the shadow of the table and i have not be able to see he distinctly from the window now as i stooped i take my breath shortly there be no pepper instead i be reach toward a elongate little heap of gray ashlike dust i must have remain in that half-stooped position for some minute i be daze -- stunned pepper have really pass into the land of shadow _ xxiv _ the footstep in the garden pepper be dead even now at time i seem scarcely able to realize that this be so it be many week since i come back from that strange and terrible journey through space and time sometimes in my sleep i dream about it and go through in imagination the whole of that fearsome happen when i wake my thought dwell upon it that sun -- those sun be they indeed the great central sun ` round which the whole universe of the unknown heaven revolve who shall say and the bright globule float forever in the light of the green sun and the sea of sleep on which they float how unbelievable it all be if it be not for pepper i should even after the many extraordinary thing that i have witness be incline to imagine that it be but a gigantic dream then there be that dreadful dark nebula -lrb- with its multitude of red sphere -rrb- move always within the shadow of the dark sun sweep along on its stupendous orbit wrap eternally in gloom and the face that peer out at I god do they and do such a thing really exist there be still that little heap of gray ash on my study floor i will not have it touch at time when i be calmer i have wonder what become of the outer planet of the solar system it have occur to I that they may have break loose from the sun 's attraction and whirl away into space this be of course only a surmise there be so many thing about which i wonder now that i be write let I record that i be certain there be something horrible about to happen last night a thing occur which have fill I with a even greater terror than do the pit fear i will write it down now and if anything more happen endeavor to make a note of it at once i have a feeling that there be more in this last affair than in all those other i be shaky and nervous even now as i write somehow i think death be not very far away not that i fear death -- as death be understand yet there be that in the air which bid I fear -- a intangible cold horror i feel it last night it be thus : -- last night i be sit here in my study write the door lead into the garden be half open at time the metallic rattle of a dog 's chain sound faintly it belong to the dog i have buy since pepper 's death i will not have he in the house -- not after pepper still i have feel it better to have a dog about the place they be wonderful creature i be much engross in my work and the time pass quickly suddenly i hear a soft noise on the path outside in the garden -- pad pad pad it go with a stealthy curious sound i sit upright with a quick movement and look out through the open door again the noise come -- pad pad pad it appear to be approach with a slight feeling of nervousness i stare into the garden but the night hide everything then the dog give a long howl and i start for a minute perhaps i peered intently but could hear nothing after a little i pick up the pen which i have lay down and recommence my work the nervous feeling have go for i imagine that the sound i have hear be nothing more than the dog walk ` round he kennel at the length of he chain a quarter of a hour may have pass then all at once the dog howl again and with such a plaintively sorrowful note that i jump to my foot drop my pen and inking the page on which i be at work ` curse that dog ' i muttered note what i have do then even as i say the word there sound again that queer -- pad pad pad it be horribly close -- almost by the door i think i know now that it could not be the dog he chain would not allow he to come so near the dog 's growl come again and i note subconsciously the taint of fear in it outside on the windowsill i could see tip my sister 's pet cat as i look it spring to its foot its tail swell visibly for a instant it stand thus seem to stare fixedly at something in the direction of the door then quickly it begin to back along the sill until reach the wall at the end it could go no further there it stand rigid as though freeze in a attitude of extraordinary terror frightened and puzzle i seize a stick from the corner and go toward the door silently take one of the candle with I i have come to within a few pace of it when suddenly a peculiar sense of fear thrill through I -- a fear palpitant and real whence i know not nor why so great be the feeling of terror that i waste no time but retreat straight-way -- walk backward and keep my gaze fearfully on the door i would have give much to rush at it fling it to and shoot the bolt for i have have it repair and strengthen so that now it be far stronger than ever it have be like tip i continue my almost unconscious progress backward until the wall bring I up at that i start nervously and glance ` round apprehensively as i do so my eye dwell momentarily on the rack of firearm and i take a step toward they but stop with a curious feeling that they would be needless outside in the garden the dog moan strangely suddenly from the cat there come a fierce long screech i glance jerkily in its direction -- something luminous and ghostly encircle it and grow upon my vision it resolve into a glowing hand transparent with a lambent greenish flame flicker over it the cat give a last awful caterwaul and i see it smoke and blaze my breath come with a gasp and i lean against the wall over that part of the window there spread a smudge green and fantastic it hide the thing from I though the glare of fire shone through dully a stench of burn steal into the room pad pad pad -- something pass down the garden path and a faint mouldy odor seem to come in through the open door and mingle with the burnt smell the dog have be silent for a few moment now i hear he yowl sharply as though in pain then he be quiet save for a occasional subdue whimper of fear a minute go by then the gate on the west side of the garden slam distantly after that nothing not even the dog 's whine i must have stand there some minute then a fragment of courage steal into my heart and i make a frightened rush at the door dash it to and bolt it after that for a full half-hour i sit helpless -- stare before I rigidly slowly my life come back into I and i make my way shakily up-stair to bed that be all _ xxv _ the thing from the arena this morning early i go through the garden but find everything as usual near the door i examine the path for footprint yet here again there be nothing to tell I whether or not i dream last night it be only when i come to speak to the dog that i discover tangible proof that something do happen when i go to he kennel he keep inside crouch up in one corner and i have to coax he to get he out when finally he consent to come it be in a strangely cowed and subdue manner as i pat he my attention be attract to a greenish patch on he left flank on examine it i find that the fur and skin have be apparently burn off for the flesh show raw and scorch the shape of the mark be curious remind I of the imprint of a large talon or hand i stand up thoughtful my gaze wander toward the study window the ray of the rise sun shimmer on the smoky patch in the lower corner cause it to fluctuate from green to red oddly ah that be undoubtedly another proof and suddenly the horrible thing i see last night rise in my mind i look at the dog again i know the cause now of that hateful look wound on he side -- i know also that what i have see last night have be a real happen and a great discomfort fill I pepper tip and now this poor animal i glance at the dog again and notice that he be lick at he wound ` poor brute ' i muttered and bent to pat he head at that he get upon he foot nose and lick my hand wistfully presently i leave he have other matter to which to attend after dinner i go to see he again he seem quiet and disincline to leave he kennel from my sister i have learn that he have refuse all food today she appear a little puzzle when she tell I though quite unsuspicious of anything of which to be afraid the day have pass uneventfully enough after tea i go again to have a look at the dog he seem moody and somewhat restless yet persist in remain in he kennel before lock up for the night i move he kennel out away from the wall so that i shall be able to watch it from the small window tonight the thought come to I to bring he into the house for the night but consideration have decide I to let he remain out i can not say that the house be in any degree less to be fear than the garden pepper be in the house and yet it be now two o'clock since eight i have watch the kennel from the small side window in my study yet nothing have occur and i be too tired to watch longer i will go to bed during the night i be restless this be unusual for I but toward morning i obtain a few hour ' sleep i rise early and after breakfast visit the dog he be quiet but morose and refuse to leave he kennel i wish there be some horse doctor near here i would have the poor brute look to all day he have take no food but have show a evident desire for water -- lap it up greedily i be relieve to observe this the evening have come and i be in my study i intend to follow my plan of last night and watch the kennel the door lead into the garden be bolt securely i be consciously glad there be bar to the window night : -- midnight have go the dog have be silent up to the present through the side window on my left i can make out dimly the outline of the kennel for the first time the dog move and i hear the rattle of he chain i look out quickly as i stare the dog move again restlessly and i see a small patch of luminous light shine from the interior of the kennel it vanish then the dog stir again and once more the gleam come i be puzzle the dog be quiet and i can see the luminous thing plainly it show distinctly there be something familiar about the shape of it for a moment i wonder then it come to I that it be not unlike the four finger and thumb of a hand like a hand and i remember the contour of that fearsome wound on the dog 's side it must be the wound i see it be luminous at night -- why the minute pass my mind be fill with this fresh thing suddenly i hear a sound out in the garden how it thrill through I it be approach pad pad pad a prickly sensation traverse my spine and seem to creep across my scalp the dog move in he kennel and whimper frightenedly he must have turn ` round for now i can no longer see the outline of he shine wound outside the garden be silent once more and i listen fearfully a minute pass and another then i hear the padding sound again it be quite close and appear to be come down the graveled path the noise be curiously measure and deliberate it cease outside the door and i rise to my foot and stand motionless from the door come a slight sound -- the latch be be slowly raise a singing noise be in my ear and i have a sense of pressure about the head -- the latch drop with a sharp click into the catch the noise startle I afresh jarring horribly on my tense nerve after that i stand for a long while amid a ever-growing quietness all at once my knee begin to tremble and i have to sit quickly a uncertain period of time pass and gradually i begin to shake off the feeling of terror that have possess I yet still i sit i seem to have lose the power of movement i be strangely tired and inclined to doze my eye open and close and presently i find myself fall asleep and wake in fit and start it be some time later that i be sleepily aware that one of the candle be gutter when i wake again it have go out and the room be very dim under the light of the one remain flame the semi-darkness trouble I little i have lose that awful sense of dread and my only desire seem to be to sleep -- sleep suddenly although there be no noise i be awake -- wide awake i be acutely conscious of the nearness of some mystery of some overwhelming presence the very air seem pregnant with terror i sit huddle and just listen intently still there be no sound nature herself seem dead then the oppressive stillness be break by a little eldritch scream of wind that sweep ` round the house and die away remotely i let my gaze wander across the half-lighted room by the great clock in the far corner be a dark tall shadow for a short instant i stare frightenedly then i see that it be nothing and be momentarily relieve in the time that follow the thought flash through my brain why not leave this house -- this house of mystery and terror then as though in answer there sweep up across my sight a vision of the wondrous sea of sleep -- the sea of sleep where she and i have be allow to meet after the year of separation and sorrow and i know that i shall stay on here whatever happen through the side window i note the somber blackness of the night my glance wander away and ` round the room rest on one shadowy object and another suddenly i turn and look at the window on my right as i do so i breathe quickly and bend forward with a frightened gaze at something outside the window but close to the bar i be look at a vast misty swine-face over which fluctuate a flamboyant flame of a greenish hue it be the thing from the arena the quiver mouth seem to drip with a continual phosphorescent slaver the eye be stare straight into the room with a inscrutable expression thus i sit rigidly -- frozen the thing have begin to move it be turn slowly in my direction its face be come ` round toward I it see I two huge inhumanly human eye be look through the dimness at I i be cold with fear yet even now i be keenly conscious and note in a irrelevant way that the distant star be blot out by the mass of the giant face a fresh horror have come to I i be rise from my chair without the least intention i be on my foot and something be impel I toward the door that lead out into the garden i wish to stop but can not some immutable power be oppose to my will and i go slowly forward unwilling and resistant my glance fly ` round the room helplessly and stop at the window the great swine-face have disappear and i hear again that stealthy pad pad pad it stop outside the door -- the door toward which i be be compel there succeed a short intense silence then there come a sound it be the rattle of the latch be slowly lift at that i be fill with desperation i will not go forward another step i make a vast effort to return but it be as though i press back upon a invisible wall i groan out loud in the agony of my fear and the sound of my voice be frightening again come that rattle and i shiver clammily i try -- aye fight and struggle to hold back _ back _ but it be no use i be at the door and in a mechanical way i watch my hand go forward to undo the topmost bolt it do so entirely without my volition even as i reach up toward the bolt the door be violently shake and i get a sickly whiff of mouldy air which seem to drive in through the interstice of the doorway i draw the bolt back slowly fight dumbly the while it come out of its socket with a click and i begin to shake aguishly there be two more one at the bottom of the door the other a massive affair be place about the middle for perhaps a minute i stand with my arm hang slackly by my side the influence to meddle with the fastening of the door seem to have go all at once there come the sudden rattle of iron at my foot i glance down quickly and realize with a unspeakable terror that my foot be push back the lower bolt a awful sense of helplessness assail I the bolt come out of its hold with a slight ringing sound and i stagger on my foot grasp at the great central bolt for support a minute pass a eternity then another -- my god help I i be be force to work upon the last fastening _ i will not _ better to die than open to the terror that be on the other side of the door be there no escape god help I i have jerk the bolt half out of its socket my lip emit a hoarse scream of terror the bolt be three part draw now and still my unconscious hand work toward my doom only a fraction of steel between my soul and that twice i scream out in the supreme agony of my fear then with a mad effort i tear my hand away my eye seem blind a great blackness be fall upon I nature have come to my rescue i feel my knee give there be a loud quick thud upon the door and i be fall fall i must have lie there at least a couple of hour as i recover i be aware that the other candle have burn out and the room be in a almost total darkness i can not rise to my foot for i be cold and fill with a terrible cramp yet my brain be clear and there be no longer the strain of that unholy influence cautiously i get upon my knee and feel for the central bolt i find it and push it securely back into its socket then the one at the bottom of the door by this time i be able to rise to my foot and so manage to secure the fastening at the top after that i go down upon my knee again and creep away among the furniture in the direction of the stair by do this i be safe from observation from the window i reach the opposite door and as i leave the study cast one nervous glance over my shoulder toward the window out in the night i seem to catch a glimpse of something impalpable but it may be only a fancy then i be in the passage and on the stair reach my bedroom i clamber into bed all clothe as i be and pull the bedclothes over I there after awhile i begin to regain a little confidence it be impossible to sleep but i be grateful for the add warmth of the bedclothes presently i try to think over the happening of the past night but though i can not sleep i find that it be useless to attempt consecutive thought my brain seem curiously blank toward morning i begin to toss uneasily i can not rest and after awhile i get out of bed and pace the floor the wintry dawn be begin to creep through the window and show the bare discomfort of the old room strange that through all these year it have never occur to I how dismal the place really be and so a time pass from somewhere down stair a sound come up to I i go to the bedroom door and listen it be mary bustling about the great old kitchen get the breakfast ready i feel little interest i be not hungry my thought however continue to dwell upon she how little the weird happening in this house seem to trouble she except in the incident of the pit creature she have seem unconscious of anything unusual occur she be old like myself yet how little we have to do with one another be it because we have nothing in common or only that be old we care less for society than quietness these and other matter pass through my mind as i meditate and help to distract my attention for a while from the oppressive thought of the night after a time i go to the window and open it look out the sun be now above the horizon and the air though cold be sweet and crisp gradually my brain clear and a sense of security for the time be come to I somewhat happier i go down stair and out into the garden to have a look at the dog as i approach the kennel i be greet by the same mouldy stench that assail I at the door last night shake off a momentary sense of fear i call to the dog but he take no heed and after call once more i throw a small stone into the kennel at this he move uneasily and i shout he name again but do not go closer presently my sister come out and join I in try to coax he from the kennel in a little the poor beast rise and shambles out lurch queerly in the daylight he stand sway from side to side and blinking stupidly i look and note that the horrid wound be larger much larger and seem to have a whitish fungoid appearance my sister move to fondle he but i detain she and explain that i think it will be better not to go too near he for a few day as it be impossible to tell what may be the matter with he and it be well to be cautious a minute later she leave I come back with a basin of odd scrap of food this she place on the ground near the dog and i push it into he reach with the aid of a branch break from one of the shrub yet though the meat should be tempting he take no notice of it but retire to he kennel there be still water in he drinking vessel so after a few moment ' talk we go back to the house i can see that my sister be much puzzle as to what be the matter with the animal yet it would be madness even to hint the truth to she the day slip away uneventfully and night come on i have determine to repeat my experiment of last night i can not say that it be wisdom yet my mind be make up still however i have take precaution for i have drive stout nail in at the back of each of the three bolt that secure the door open from the study into the garden this will at least prevent a recurrence of the danger i run last night from ten to about two-thirty i watch but nothing occur and finally i stumble off to bed where i be soon asleep _ xxvi _ the luminous speck i awake suddenly it be still dark i turn over once or twice in my endeavor to sleep again but i can not sleep my head be ache slightly and by turn i be hot and cold in a little i give up the attempt and stretch out my hand for the match i will light my candle and read awhile perhaps i shall be able to sleep after a time for a few moment i grope then my hand touch the box but as i open it i be startle to see a phosphorescent speck of fire shine amid the darkness i put out my other hand and touch it it be on my wrist with a feeling of vague alarm i strike a light hurriedly and look but can see nothing save a tiny scratch ` fancy ' i mutter with a half sigh of relief then the match burn my finger and i drop it quickly as i fumble for another the thing shine out again i know now that it be no fancy this time i light the candle and examine the place more closely there be a slight greenish discoloration ` round the scratch i be puzzle and worry then a thought come to I i remember the morning after the thing appear i remember that the dog lick my hand it be this one with the scratch on it though i have not be even conscious of the abasement until now a horrible fear have come to I it creep into my brain -- the dog 's wound shine at night with a dazed feeling i sit down on the side of the bed and try to think but can not my brain seem numb with the sheer horror of this new fear time move on unheeded once i rouse up and try to persuade myself that i be mistaken but it be no use in my heart i have no doubt hour after hour i sit in the darkness and silence and shiver hopelessly the day have come and go and it be night again this morning early i shoot the dog and bury it away among the bush my sister be startle and frighten but i be desperate besides it be better so the foul growth have almost hide its left side and i -- the place on my wrist have enlarged perceptibly several time i have catch myself mutter prayer -- little thing learn as a child god almighty god help I i shall go mad six day and i have eat nothing it be night i be sit in my chair ah god i wonder have any ever feel the horror of life that i have come to know i be swathe in terror i feel ever the burning of this dread growth it have cover all my right arm and side and be begin to creep up my neck tomorrow it will eat into my face i shall become a terrible mass of live corruption there be no escape yet a thought have come to I bear of a sight of the gun-rack on the other side of the room i have look again -- with the strangest of feeling the thought grow upon I god thou knowest thou must know that death be better aye better a thousand time than this this jesus forgive I but i can not live can not can not i dare not i be beyond all help -- there be nothing else leave it will at least spare I that final horror i think i must have be doze i be very weak and oh so miserable so miserable and tired -- tire the rustle of the paper try my brain my hearing seem preternaturally sharp i will sit awhile and think hush i hear something down -- down in the cellar it be a creaking sound my god it be the opening of the great oak trap what can be do that the scratch of my pen deafen I i must listen there be step on the stair strange padding step that come up and nearer jesus be merciful to I a old man there be something fumble at the door-handle o god help I now jesus -- the door be open -- slowly somethus -- that be all -lrb- 16 -rrb- _ xxvii _ conclusion i put down the manuscript and glance across at tonnison : he be sit stare out into the dark i wait a minute then i speak well i say he turn slowly and look at I he thought seem to have go out of he into a great distance be he mad i ask and indicate the m with a half nod tonnison stare at I unseeingly a moment then he wit come back to he and suddenly he comprehend my question no he say i open my lip to offer a contradictory opinion for my sense of the saneness of thing would not allow I to take the story literally then i shut they again without say anything somehow the certainty in tonnison 's voice affect my doubt i feel all at once less assure though i be by no means convince as yet after a few moment ' silence tonnison rise stiffly and begin to undress he seem disincline to talk so i say nothing but follow he example i be weary though still full of the story i have just read somehow as i roll into my blanket there creep into my mind a memory of the old garden as we have see they i remember the odd fear that the place have conjure up in we heart and it grow upon I with conviction that tonnison be right it be very late when we rise -- nearly midday for the greater part of the night have be spend in read the m tonnison be grumpy and i feel out of sort it be a somewhat dismal day and there be a touch of chilliness in the air there be no mention of go out fishing on either of we part we get dinner and after that just sit and smoke in silence presently tonnison ask for the manuscript : i hand it to he and he spend most of the afternoon in read it through by himself it be while he be thus employ that a thought come to I : -- what do you say to have another look at -- i nod my head down stream tonnison look up nothing he say abruptly and somehow i be less annoyed than relieved at he answer after that i leave he alone a little before teatime he look up at I curiously sorry old chap if i be a bit short with you just now -lrb- just now indeed he have not speak for the last three hour -rrb- but i would not go there again and he indicate with he head for anything that you could offer I ugh and he put down that history of a man 's terror and hope and despair the next morning we rise early and go for we accustomed swim : we have partly shake off the depression of the previous day and so take we rod when we have finish breakfast and spend the day at we favorite sport after that day we enjoy we holiday to the utmost though both of we look forward to the time when we driver should come for we be tremendously anxious to inquire of he and through he among the people of the tiny hamlet whether any of they could give we information about that strange garden lie away by itself in the heart of a almost unknown tract of country at last the day come on which we expect the driver to come across for we he arrive early while we be still abed and the first thing we know he be at the opening of the tent inquire whether we have have good sport we reply in the affirmative and then both together almost in the same breath we ask the question that be uppermost in we mind : -- do he know anything about a old garden and a great pit and a lake situate some mile away down the river also have he ever hear of a great house thereabout no he do not and have not yet stay he have hear a rumor once upon a time of a great old house standing alone out in the wilderness but if he remember rightly it be a place give over to the fairy or if that have not be so he be certain that there have be something quare about it and anyway he have hear nothing of it for a very long while -- not since he be quite a gossoon no he could not remember anything particular about it indeed he do not know he remember anything at all at all until we question he look here say tonnison finding that this be about all that he could tell we just take a walk ` round the village while we dress and find out something if you can with a nondescript salute the man depart on he errand while we make haste to get into we clothes after which we begin to prepare breakfast we be just sit down to it when he return it be all in bed the lazy divvil be sor he say with a repetition of the salute and a appreciative eye to the good thing spread out on we provision chest which we utilize as a table oh well sit down reply my friend and have something to eat with we which the man do without delay after breakfast tonnison send he off again on the same errand while we sit and smoke he be away some three-quarter of a hour and when he return it be evident that he have find out something it appear that he have get into conversation with a ancient man of the village who probably know more -- though it be little enough -- of the strange house than any other person live the substance of this knowledge be that in the ancient man 's youth -- and goodness know how long back that be -- there have stand a great house in the center of the garden where now be leave only that fragment of ruin this house have be empty for a great while year before he -- the ancient man 's -- birth it be a place shun by the people of the village as it have be shun by they father before they there be many thing say about it and all be of evil no one ever go near it either by day or night in the village it be a synonym of all that be unholy and dreadful and then one day a man a stranger have ride through the village and turn off down the river in the direction of the house as it be always term by the villager some hour afterward he have ride back take the track by which he have come toward ardrahan then for three month or so nothing be hear at the end of that time he reappear but now he be accompany by a elderly woman and a large number of donkey laden with various article they have pass through the village without stop and go straight down the bank of the river in the direction of the house since that time no one save the man whom they have charter to bring over monthly supplies of necessaries from ardrahan have ever see either of they : and he none have ever induce to talk evidently he have be well pay for he trouble the year have move onward uneventfully enough in that little hamlet the man make he monthly journey regularly one day he have appear as usual on he customary errand he have pass through the village without exchange more than a surly nod with the inhabitant and go on toward the house usually it be evening before he make the return journey on this occasion however he have reappear in the village a few hour later in a extraordinary state of excitement and with the astounding information that the house have disappear bodily and that a stupendous pit now yawn in the place where it have stand this news it appear so excited the curiosity of the villager that they overcome they fear and march _ en masse _ to the place there they find everything just as describe by the carrier this be all that we could learn of the author of the m who he be and whence he come we shall never know he identity be as he seem to have desire bury forever that same day we leave the lonely village of kraighten we have never be there since sometimes in my dream i see that enormous pit surround as it be on all side by wild tree and bush and the noise of the water rise upward and blend -- in my sleep -- with other and lower noise while over all hang the eternal shroud of spray grief -lrb- 17 -rrb- fierce hunger reign within my breast i have not dream that this whole world crush in the hand of god could yield such bitter essence of unrest such pain as sorrow now have hurl out of its dreadful heart unsealed each sob breath be but a cry my heart-stroke knell of agony and my whole brain have but one think that nevermore through life shall i -lrb- save in the ache of memory -rrb- touch hand with thee who now art naught through the whole void of night i search so dumbly cry out to thee but thou be _ not _ and night 's vast throne become a all stupendous church with star-bell knell unto I who in all space be most alone a hunger to the shore i creep perchance some comfort wait on I from the old sea 's eternal heart but lo from all the solemn deep far voice out of mystery seem question why we be apart where'er i go i be alone who once through thee have all the world my breast be one whole rage pain for that which _ be _ and now be fly into the blank where life be hurl where all be not nor be again footnote : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a
