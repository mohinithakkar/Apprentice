childhood my _ début _ upon the world 's stage occur on February 26th 1845 the scene of this first important event in my adventurous career be in scott county in the state of iowa my parent isaac and

the child who come after I be eliza nellie mary and charle bear in the order name at the time of my birth the family reside on a farm which they call napsinekee place -- a indian name -- and here the first six or seven year of my childhood be spend when i be about seven year old my father move the family to the little town of leclair located on the bank of the mississippus fifteen mile above the city of davenport even at that early age my adventurous spirit lead I into all sort of mischief and danger and when i look back upon my childhood 's day i often wonder that i do not get drown while swimming or sailing or my neck break while i be steal apple in the neighbor orchard i well remember one day that i go sailing with two other boy in a few minute we find ourselves in the middle of the mississippus become frighten at the situation we lose we presence of mind as well as we oar we at once set up a chorus of pitiful yell when a man who fortunately hear we come to we rescue with a canoe and tow we ashore we have steal the boat and we trouble do not end until we have each receive a merit whipping which impress the incident vividly upon my mind i recollect several occasion when i be nearly eat up by a large and savage dog which act as custodian of a orchard and also of a melon patch which i frequently visit once as i be climb over the fence with a hatful of apple this dog which have start for I catch I by the seat of the pantaloons and while i clung to the top of the fence he literally tear they from my leg but fortunately do not touch my flesh i get away with the apple however by tumble over to the opposite side of the fence with they it be at leclair that i acquire my first experience as a equestrian somehow or other i have manage to corner a horse near a fence and have climb upon he back the next moment the horse get he back up and hoist I into the air i fall violently to the ground striking upon my side in such a way as to severely wrench and strain my arm from the effect of which i do not recover for some time i abandon the art of horsemanship for a while and be induce after considerable persuasion to turn my attention to letter -- my a b c 's -- which be teach I at the village school my father at this time be run a stage line between chicago and davenport no railroad then have be build west of chicago in 1849 he get the californium fever and make up he mind to cross the great plain -- which be then and for year afterwards call the american desert -- to the pacific coast he get ready a complete outfit and start with quite a party after proceed a few mile all but my father and greatly to he disappointment change they mind for some reason and abandon the enterprise they all return home and soon afterwards father move he family out to walnut grove farm in scott county -lrb- illustration : youthful adventure -rrb- while live there i be send to school more for the purpose of be keep out of mischief than to learn anything much of my time be spend in trapping quail which be very plentiful i greatly enjoy study the habit of the little bird and in devise trap to take they in i be most successful with the common figure 4 trap which i could build myself thus i think it be that i acquire my love for hunting i visit the quail trap twice a day morning and evening and as i have now become quite a good rider i be allow to have one of the farm horse to carry I over my route many a jolly ride i have and many a boyish prank be perpetrate after get well away from and out of the sight of home with the horse there be one event which occur in my childhood which i can not recall without a feeling of sadness it be the death of my brother samuel who be accidentally kill in he twelfth year my father at the time be considerable of a politician as well as a farmer be attend a political convention for he be well know in those day as a old line whig he have be a member of the iowa legislature be a justice of the peace and have hold other office

samuel 's bedside a physician after examine he pronounce he injury to be of a fatal character he die the next morning my brother be a great favorite with everybody and he death cast a gloom upon the whole neighborhood it be a great blow to all of the family and especially to father who seem to be almost heart break over it father have be greatly disappoint at the failure of he californium expedition and still desire to move to some new country the death of samuel no doubt increase this desire and he determine to emigrate accordingly early in the spring of 1852 he dispose of he farm and late in march we take we departure for kansa which be then a unsettled territory we outfit consist of one carriage three wagon and some fine blooded horse the carriage be occupy by my mother and sister thus we leave we iowa home -lrb- illustration : samuel 's fatal accident -rrb- father have a brother elijah cody living at weston platte county missourus he be the lead merchant of the place as the town be located near the kansas line father determine to visit he and thither we journey be direct we route lay across iowa and missourus and the trip prove of interest to all of we and especially to I there be something new to be see at nearly every turn of the road at night the family generally put up at hotel or cross-road tavern along the way one day as we be proceed on we way we be meet by a horseman who want to sell he horse or trade-him for another he say the horse have be capture wild in californium that he be a runner and a racer that he have be sell by he different owner on account of he great desire to run away when take part in a race the stranger seem to be very frank in he statement and appear to be very anxious to get rid of the animal and as we be go to kansa where there would be plenty of room for the horse to run as far as he please father conclude to make a trade for he so a exchange of animal be easily and satisfactorily effect the new horse be a small gray we name he little gray a opportunity of test the racing quality of the horse be soon afford one day we drive into a small missourus town or hamlet which lay on we route where the farmer from the surrounding country be congregate for the purpose of have a holiday -- the principal amusement be horse-racing father have no trouble in arrange a race for little gray and select one of he teamster to ride he the missourian match they fastest horse against he and be confident of clean out the emigrant as they call father they be a hard look crowd they wear they pantaloons in they boot they hair be long bushy and untrimmed they face have evidently never make the acquaintance of a razor they seem determine to win the race by fair means or foul they do a great deal of swearing and swagger about in rather a ruffianly style all these incident attract my attention -- everything be new to I -- and become firmly impressed upon my memory my father be unaccustomed to the way of such rough people act very cautiously and as they be all very anxious to bet on they own horse he could not be induce to wager a very large sum on little gray as he be afraid of foul play wa-al now stranger exclaim one of the crowd what kind o ' critter have you get anyhow as how you be afraid to back he up very heavy i 'll bet five to one agin the emergrant 's gray say another i be bet the same way i 'll go yer five hundred dollar agin a hundred that the gray nag git leave behind do i hear any man who want to come agin I on they yer term shout still another hi yer boy give the stranger a chance do not scare he out of he boot say a man who evidently be afraid that my father might back out father have but little to say however and would not venture more than fifty dollar on the result of the race gentleman i be only race my horse for sport say he and be only bet enough to make it interesting i have never see little gray run and therefore do not know what he can do at the same time he be confident that he horse would come in the winner as he have choose a excellent rider for he finally all the preliminary of the contest be arrange the judge be choose and the money be deposit in the hand of a stake-holder the race be to be a single dash of a mile the horse be bring side by side and mount by they rider at the signal -- one two three go -- off they start like a flash the missouri horse take the lead for the first quarter of a mile at the half-mile however he begin to weaken the missourian shout themselves hoarse in urge they horse but all to no avail the little gray pass he and continue to leave he farther and farther behind easily win the race the affair create a great deal of enthusiasm but the race be conduct with honor and fairness which be quite a agreeable surprise to my father who soon find the missourian to be at heart very clever man -- thus show that outside appearance be sometimes very deceptive they nearly all come up and congratulate he on he success ask he why he have not bet more money on the race and want to buy little gray gentleman say he when i drive up here and arrange for this race i feel confident that my horse would win it i be among entire stranger and therefore i only bet a small amount i be afraid that you would cheat I in some way or other i see now that i be mistake as i have find you to be honorable man wa-all you could have break _ I _ say the man who want to bet the five hundred dollar to one hundred for that there nag o ' yourn look no more like a runner nor i do during we stay in the place they treat we very kindly and continue to try to purchase little gray my father however remain firm in he determination not to part with he the next place of interest which we reach after resume we journey be within twenty mile of weston we have be stop at farm house along the road and could not get anything to eat in the shape of bread except corn bread of which all have become heartily tire as we be drive along we see in the distance a large and handsome brick residence father say : they probably have white bread there we drive up to the house and learn that it be own and occupy by mr burn mother of a well-known lawyer of that name who be now live in leavenworth she be a wealthy lady and give we to understand in a pleasant way that she do not entertain traveler my father in the course of the conversation with she say : do you know elijah cody indeed i do say she he frequently visit we and we visit he we be the best of friend he be a brother of mine say father be it possible she exclaim why you must remain here all night have you family come into the house at once you must not go another step today the kind invitation be accept and we remain there over night as father have predict we find plenty of white bread at this house and it prove quite a luxurious treat my curiosity be considerably arouse by the many negro which i see about the premise as i have scarcely ever see any colored people the few be on the steamboat as they pass up and down the mississippus river the next day my father and mother drive over to weston in a carriage and return with my uncle elijah we then all proceed to he house and as kansa be not yet open for settlement as a territory we remain there a few day while father cross over into kansa on a prospect tour he visit the kickapoo agency -- five mile above weston -- on the kansas side of the missourus river he become acquaint with the agent and make arrangement to establish himself there as a indian trader he then return to weston and located the family on one of elijah cody 's farm three mile from town where we be to remain until kansa should be throw open for settlement after complete these arrangement he establish a trading post at salt creek valley in kansas four mile from the kickapoo agency one day after he have be absent some little time he come home and say that he have buy two pony for I and that next morning he would take I over into kansa this be pleasant news as i have be very anxious to go there with he and the fact that i be now the owner of two pony make I feel very proud that night i could not sleep a wink in the morning i be up long before the sun and after a early breakfast father and i start out on we trip cross the missourus river at the rialto ferry we land in kansa and pass along to fort leavenworth four mile distant chapter ii early influence general harney be in command at fort leavenworth at the time of we visit and a regiment of cavalry be station there they be have a dress parade when we ride up and as this be the first time that i have ever see any soldier i think it be a grand sight i shall never forget it especially the maneuver on horseback after witness the parade we resume we journey on the way to my father 's trading camp we have to cross over a high hill know as salt creek hill from the top of which we look down upon the most beautiful valley i have ever see it be about twelve mile long and five mile wide the different tributary of salt creek come down from the range of hill at the southwest at the foot of the valley another small river -- plum creek also flow the bluff fringe with tree clothe in they full foliage add greatly to the picturesqueness of the scene while this beautiful valley greatly interested I yet the most novel sight of a entirely different character which meet my enraptured gaze be the vast number of white-covered wagon or prairie-schooner which be encamp along the different stream i ask my father what they be and where they be go he explain to I that they be emigrant wagon bind for utah and californium at that time the mormon and californium trail run through this valley which be always select as a camping place there be at least one thousand wagon in the valley and they white cover lend a please contrast to the green grass the cattle be quietly grazing near the wagon while the emigrant be either rest or attend to camp duty a large number of the wagon as i learn from my father belong to major & russell the great government freighter they have several train there each consist of twenty-five wagon heavily load with government supplies they be all camp and corrale in a circle while we be view this scene a long wagon train come pull up the hill bind out from fort leavenworth to some distant frontier post the cattle be wild and the man be

engage in trading and gossip the man have huge pistol and knife in they belt they pantaloons be tuck in they boot and they wear large broad-rimmed hat to I they appear like a lot of cut-throat pirate who have come ashore for a lark it be the first time i have ever see man carry pistol and knife and they look like a very dangerous crowd some be buy article of merchandise other be talk about the cholera the various camp and matter of interest while other be drink whisky freely and become intoxicate it be a busy and a exciting scene and rively appear to be do a rush trade at some little distance from the store i notice a small party of dark-skinned and rather fantastically dress people whom i ascertain be indian and as i have never before see a real live indian i be much interested in they i go over and endeavor to talk to they but we conversation be very limited that evening we reach we camp which be located two mile west of rively 's the first thing i do be to hunt up my pony and from my father 's description of they i have no difficulty in find they they be lariate in the grass and i immediately run up to they suppose they to be gentle animal i be greatly mistaken however as they snort and jump away from I and would not allow I to come near they my father who be stand not far distant inform I that the pony be not yet broken i be somewhat disappoint at this and thereupon he and one of he man catch one of the animal and bridle she then put I on she back lead she around greatly to my delight i keep pet she so much that she soon allow I to approach she she be a

camp-fire and that night be the first time i ever camp out and sleep upon the ground the day have be a eventful one to I for all the incident be full of excitement and romance to my youthful mind and i think no apology be need for mention so many of the little circumstance which so greatly interested I in my childhood 's day and which no doubt have a great influence in shape my course in after year my love of hunting and scout and life on the plain generally be the result of my early surroundings the next morning father visit the kickapoo agency take I along he ride a horse and put I on my

act of kansas territory be pass in April 1854 and father immediately pre-empt the claim on which we be live the summer of that year be a exciting period in the history of the new territory thousand and thousand of people seek new home flock thither a large number of the emigrant come over from adjoining state the missourian some of they would come laden with bottle of whisky and after drink the liquor would drive the bottle into the ground to mark they land claim not wait to put up any building the missourian mostly be pro-slavery man and hold enthusiastic meeting at which they express they desire that kansa should be a slave state and do not hesitate to declare they determination to make it so rively 's store be the headquarters for these man and there they hold they meeting -lrb- illustration : stake out lot -rrb- at first they think father would coincide with they on account of he brother elijah be a missourian but in this they be greatly mistake at one of they gathering when there be about one hundred of the reckless man present my father who happen also to be there be call upon for a speech after considerable urge he mount the box and begin speak as nearly as i can recollect as follow : gentleman and fellow-citizen : you have call upon I for a speech and i have accept you invitation rather against my will as my view may not accord with the sentiment of the rest of this assembly my remark at this time will be brief and to the point the question before we to-day be shall the territory of kansas be a free or a slave state the question of slavery in itself be a broad one and one which i do not care at this time and place to discuss at length i apprehend that you motive in call upon I be to have I express my sentiment in regard to the introduction of slavery into kansas i shall gratify you wish in that respect i be one of the pioneer of the state of iowa and aid in its settlement when it be a territory and help to organize it as a state gentleman i vote that it should be a _ white _ state -- that negro whether free or slave should never be allow to locate within its limit and gentleman i say to you now and i say it boldly that i propose to exert all my power in make kansa the same kind of a state as iowa i believe in let slavery remain as it now exist and i shall always oppose its further extension these be my sentiment gentleman and let I tell you -- he never finish this sentence or he speech he expression be anything but acceptable to the rough-looking crowd whose ire have be gradually rise to fever heat and at this point they hoot and hiss he and shout you black abolitionist shut up get down from that box kill he shoot he and so on father however maintain he position on the dry-goods box notwithstanding the excitement and the numerous invitation to step down until a hot-headed pro-slavery man who be in the employ of my uncle elijah crowd up and say : get off that box you black abolitionist or i 'll pull you off father pay but little attention to he and attempt to resume he speech intend doubtless to explain he position and endeavor to somewhat pacify the angry crowd but the fellow jump up on the box and pull out a huge bowie knife stab father twice who reel and fall to the ground the man spring after he and would have end he life then and there have not some of the better man in the crowd interfere in time to prevent he from carry out he murderous intention the excitement be intense and another assault would probably have be make on my father have not rively hurriedly carry he to he home there be no doctor within any reasonable distance and father at once request that he be convey in the carriage to he brother elijah 's house in weston my mother and a driver accordingly go there with he where he wound be dress he remain in weston several week before he be able to stir about again but he never fully recover from the wound which eventually prove the cause of he death -lrb- illustration : my father stab -rrb- my uncle of course at once discharge the ruffian from he employ the man afterwards become a note desperado and be quite conspicuous in the kansas war my father 's indiscreet speech at rively 's bring upon we family all of the misfortune and difficulty which from that time on befall we as soon as he be able to attend to he business again the missourian begin to harass he in every possible way and keep it up with hardly a moment 's cessation kickapoo city as it be call a small town that have spring into existence seven mile up the river from fort leavenworth become the hot-bed of the pro-slavery doctrine and the headquarters of its advocate here be really the beginning of the kansas trouble my father who have shed the first blood in the cause of the freedom of kansa be

horseman between whom he pass be unable to detect he in he disguise suppose he to be a woman they neither halt he nor follow he and he pass safely on into the corn-field where he conceal himself the horseman soon dismount and inquire for father mother very truthfully tell they that he be away they be not satisfy with she statement however and they at once make a thorough search of the house they rave and swear when they could not find he and threaten he with death whenever they should catch he i be sure if they have capture he that night they would have kill he they carry off nearly everything of value in the house and about the premise then go to the pasture they drive off all the horse my pony prince afterward succeed in break away from they and come back home father lay secrete in the corn-field for three day as there be man in the vicinity who be watch for he all the time he finally make he escape and reach fort leavenworth in safety whither the pro-slavery man do

it be very fortunate that i have hear the remark about my be the son of the abolitionist for then i know in a instant that they be _ en route _ to grasshopper fall to murder my father i at once see the importance of my escape and warn father in time it be a matter of life or death to he so i urge prince to he utmost speed feeling that upon he and myself depend a human life -- a life that be

i 'll give you just two minute to get out of the yard if you be not out by the end of that time i shall order they to fire on you she withdraw from the window for a few moment and hurriedly instruct the herder to call aloud certain name -- any that he might think of -- just as if the house be full of man to whom he be give order he follow she direction to the very letter he could not have do it any better have he rehearse the act a dozen time the party outside hear he as it be intend they should and they suppose that my mother really have quite a force at she command while this little by play be be enact she step to the open window again and say : john green you and you friend have better go away or the man will surely fire on you at this point the herder myself and my sister commence

and give I a quilt kiss she and my sister a fond farewell i start off on my first trip across the plain and with a light heart too notwithstanding my trouble of a few hour before the trip prove a most enjoyable one to I although no incident worthy of note occur on the way on my return from fort kearney i be pay off the same as the rest of the employee the remainder of the summer and fall i spend in herd cattle and work for russell major & waddell i finally venture home -- not without some fear however of the gobel family -- and be delighted to learn that during my absence mother have have a interview with mr gobel and have settle the difficulty with he the two family have become friend again and i may state incidentally that they ever after remain so i have since often meet stephen gobel and we have have many a laugh together over we love affair and the affray at the school-house mary hyatt the innocent cause of the whole difficulty be now marry and live in chicago thus end my first love scrape in the winter of 1856-57 my father in company with a man name jc bole go to cleveland ohio and organize a colony of about thirty family whom they bring to kansa and located on the grasshopper several of these family still reside there it be during this winter that father after he return from cleveland catch a severe cold this in connection with the wound he have receive at rively 's -- from which he have never entirely recover -- affect he seriously and in April 1857 he die at home from kidney disease this sad event leave my mother and the family in poor circumstance and i determine to follow the plain for a livelihood for they and myself i have no difficulty in obtain work under my old employer and in may 1857 i start for salt lake city with a herd of beef cattle in charge of frank and bill mccarthy for general albert sidney johnson 's army which be then be send across the plain to fight the mormon nothing occur to interrupt we journey until we reach plum creek on the south platte river thirty-five mile west of old fort kearney we have make a morning drive and have camp for dinner the wagon-master and a majority of the man have go to sleep under the mess wagon the cattle be be guard by three man and the cook be prepare dinner no one have any idea that indian be anywhere near we the first warning we have that they be infest that part of the country be the firing of shot and the whoop and yell from a party of they who catch we nap give we a most unwelcome surprise all the man jump to they foot and seize they gun they see with astonishment the cattle run in every direction they have be stampede by the indian who have shoot and kill the three man who be on day-herd duty and the red devil be now charge down upon the rest of we i then think of mother 's fear of my fall into the hand of the indian and i have about make up my mind that such be to be my fate but when i see how coolly and determinedly the mccarthy brother be conduct themselves and give order to the little band i become convinced that we would stand the indian off as the say be we man be all well arm with colt 's revolver and mississippus yager which last carry a bullet and two buckshot the mccarthy boy at the proper moment give order to fire upon the advance enemy the volley check they although they return the compliment and shoot one of we party through the leg frank mccarthy then sing out boy make a break for the slough yonder and we can then have the bank for a breast-work -lrb- illustration : kill my first indian -rrb- we make a run for the slough which be only a short distance off and succeed in safely reach it bring with we the wounded man the bank prove to be a very effective breast-work afford we good protection we have be there but a short time when frank mccarthy see that the longer we be corrale the worse it would be for we say : well boy we 'll try to make we way back to fort kearney by wade in the river and keep the bank for a breast-work we all agree that this be the best plan and we accordingly proceed down the river several mile in this way manage to keep the indian at a safe distance with we gun until the slough make a junction with the main platte river from there down we find the river at time quite deep and in order to carry the wounded man along with we we construct a raft of pole for he accommodation and in this way he be transport occasionally the water would be too deep for we to wade and we be oblige to put we weapon on the raft and swim the indian follow we pretty close and be continually watch for a opportunity to get a good range and give we a rake fire cover ourselves by keep well under the bank we push ahead as rapidly as possible and make pretty good progress the night find we still on the way and we enemy still on we track i be the youngest and smallest of the party become somewhat tired and without notice it i have fall behind the other for some little distance it be about ten o'clock and we be keep very quiet and hug close to the bank when i happen to look up to the moon-lit sky and see the plumed head of a indian peeping over the bank instead of hurry ahead and alarming the man in a quiet way i instantly aim my gun at the head and fire the report ring out sharp and loud on the night air and be immediately follow by a indian whoop and the next moment about six foot of dead indian come tumble into the river i be not only overcome with astonishment but be badly scare as i could hardly realize what i have do i expect to see the whole force of indian come down upon we while i be stand thus bewilder the man who have hear the shot and the war-whoop and have see the indian take a tumble come rush back who fire that shot cry frank mccarthy i do reply i rather proudly as my confidence return and i see the man come up yes and little billy have kill a indian stone-dead -- too dead to skin say one of the man who have approach nearer than the rest and have almost stumble upon the corpse from that time forward i become a hero and a indian killer this be of course the first indian i have ever shoot and as i be not then more than eleven year of age my exploit create quite a sensation the other indian upon learn what have happen to they advance guard set up a terrible howling and fire several volley at we but without do any injury as we be so well protect by the bank we resume we journey down the river and travel all night long just before daylight frank mccarthy crawl out over the bank and discover that we be only five mile from fort kearney which post we reach in safety in about two hour -- shortly after _ reveille _ -- bring the wounded man with we it be indeed a relief to we all to feel that once more we be safe frank mccarthy immediately report to the commanding officer and inform he of all that have happen the commandant at once order a company of cavalry and one of infantry to proceed to plum creek on a forced march -- take a howitzer with they -- to endeavor to recapture the cattle from the indian the firm of russell major & waddell have a division agent at kearney and this agent mount we on mule so that we could accompany the troops on reach the place where the indian have surprise we we find the body of the three man whom they have kill and scalp and literally cut into piece we of course bury the remains we catch but few of the cattle the most of they have be drive off and stampede with the buffalo there be numerous immense herd of the latter in that section of the country at that time the indian 's trail be discover run south towards the republican river and the troops follow it to the head of plum creek and there abandon it return to fort kearney without have see a single red-skin the company 's agent see that there be no further use for we in that vicinity -- as we have lose we cattle and mule -- send we back to fort leavenworth the company it be proper to state do not have to stand the loss of the expedition as the government hold itself responsible for such depredation by the indian on the day that i get into leavenworth sometime in July i be interview for the first time in my life by a newspaper reporter and the next morning i find my name in print as the youngest indian slayer on the plain i be candid enough to admit that i feel very much elate over this notoriety again and again i read with eager interest the long and sensational account of we adventure my exploit be relate in a very graphic manner and for a long time afterwards i be considerable of a hero the reporter who have thus set I up as i then think on the highest pinnacle of fame be john hutchinson and i feel very grateful to he he now live in wichita kansa chapter v in business in the summer of 1857 russell major & waddell be send a great many train across the plain to salt lake with supplies for general johnston 's army man be in great demand and the company be pay teamster forty dollar per month in gold a old and reliable wagon-master name lewi simpson -- who have take a great fancy to I and who by the way be one of the best wagon-master that ever run a bull train -- be load a train for the company and be about to start out with it for salt lake he ask I to go along as a extra hand the high wages that be be pay be a great inducement to I and the position of a extra hand be a pleasant one all that i would have to do would be to take the place of any man who become sick and drive he wagon until he recover i would have my own mule to ride and to a certain extent i would be a minor boss my mother be very much oppose to my take this long trip as i would be absent nearly a year and there be a possibility that something might arise to prevent I from ever come back as we could not often tell how the mormon difficulty would terminate then again owe to the indian a journey over the plain in those day be a perilous undertaking she say that as i have recently return from the plain and have have a narrow escape from death at the hand of the indian she do not want I to risk my life a second time i tell she that inasmuch as i have determine to follow the plain for a occupation nothing could now stop I from go on this trip and if it become necessary i would run away see that it be impossible to keep I at home she reluctantly give she consent but not until she have call upon mr russell and mr simpson in regard to the matter and have obtain from the latter gentleman he promise that i should be well take care of if we have to winter in the mountain she do not like the appearance of simpson and upon inquiry she learn to she dismay that he be a desperate character and that on nearly every trip he have make across the plain he have kill some one such a man she think be not a fit master or companion for she son and she be very anxious to have I go with some other wagon-master but i still insist upon remain with simpson madam i can assure you that lew simpson be one of the most reliable wagon-master on the plain say mr russell and he have take a great fancy to billy if you boy be bind to go he can go with no better man no one will dare to impose on he while he be with lew simpson whom i will instruct to take good care of the boy upon reach fort laramie billy can if he wish exchange place with some fresh man come back on a return train and thus come home without make the whole trip this seem to satisfy mother and then she have a long talk with simpson himself implore he not to forget he promise to take good care of she precious boy he promise everything that she ask thus after much trouble i become one of the member of simpson 's train before take we departure i arrange with russell major & waddell that when my pay should fall due it should be pay over to mother as a matter of interest to the general reader it may be well in this connection to give a brief description of a freight train the wagon use in those day by russell major & waddell be know as the j murphy wagon make at st loui specially for the plain business they be very large and be strongly build be capable of carry seven thousand pound of freight each the wagon-box be very commodious -- be as large

teamster be know as bull-whacker and the whole train be denominate a bull-outfit everything at that time be call a outfit the man of the plain be always full of droll humor and exciting story of they

wagon 75000 ox and about eight thousand man they business reach to all the government frontier post in the north and west to which they transport supplies and they also carry freight as far south as

the big sandy the next stream of any importance be the little blue along which the trail run for sixty mile then cross a range of sand-hill and strike the platte river ten mile below old fort kearney thence the course lay up the south platte to the old ash hollow cross thence eighteen mile across to the north platte -- near the mouth of the blue water where general harney have he great battle in 1855 with the sioux and cheyenne indian from this point the north platte be follow pass court house rock chimney rock and scott 's bluff and then on to fort laramie where the laramie river be cross

be find thence to the hot spring and the rocky ridge and through the rocky mountain and echo cañon and thence on to the great salt lake valley we have start on we trip with everything in good shape follow the above describe trail during the first week or two out i become well acquaint with most of the train man and with one in particular who become a life-long and intimate friend of mine he real name be jame b hickok he afterwards become famous as wild bill the scout of the plain -- though why he be so call i never could ascertain -- and from this time forward i shall refer to he by he popular nickname he be ten year my senior -- a tall handsome magnificently build and powerful young fellow who could out-run out-jump and out-fight any man in the train he be generally admit to be the best man physically in the employ of russell major & waddell and of he bravery there be not a doubt general custer in he life on the plain thus speak of wild bill : \* \* \* \* \* among the white scout be number some of the most note of they class the most prominent man among they be ` wild bill ' whose highly vary career be make the subject of a illustrated sketch in one of the popular monthly periodical a few year ago ` wild bill ' be a strange character just the one which a novelist might gloat over he be a plains-man in every sense of the word yet unlike any other of he class in person he be about six foot and one inch in height straight as the straightest of the warrior whose implacable foe he be he have broad shoulder well-formed chest and limb and a face strikingly handsome a sharp clear blue eye which stare you straight in the face when in conversation a finely shaped nose incline to be aquiline a well-turned mouth with lip only partially conceal by a handsome moustache he hair and complexion be those of the perfect blonde the former be worn in uncut ringlet fall carelessly over he powerfully form shoulder add to this figure a costume blend the immaculate neatness of the dandy with the extravagant taste and style of the frontiersman and you have wild bill whether on foot or on horseback he be one of the most perfect type of physical manhood i ever saw of he courage there could be no question it have be bring to the test on too many occasion to admit of a doubt he skill in the use of the pistol and rifle be unerr while he deportment be exactly the opposite of what might be expect from a man of he surroundings it be entirely free from all bluster or bravado he seldom speak himself unless request to do so he conversation strange to say never border either on the vulgar or blasphemous he influence among the frontiersman be unbounded he word be law and many be the personal quarrel and disturbance which he have check among he comrade by he simple announcement that ` this have go far enough ' -- if need be follow by the ominous warning that when persist in or renew the quarreler ` must settle it with I ' wild bill be anything but a quarrelsome man yet no one but he could enumerate the many conflict in which he have be engage and which have almost always result in the death of he adversary i have a personal knowledge of at least half a dozen man whom he have at various time kill one of these be at the time a member of my command other have be severely wound yet he always escape unhurt on the plain every man openly carry he belt with its invariable appendage knife and revolver -- often two of the latter wild bill always carry two handsome ivory-handled revolver of the large size he be never see without they yet in all the many affair of this kind in which wild bill have perform a part and which have come to my knowledge there be not a single instance in which the verdict of twelve fair-minded man would not have be pronounce in he favor \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- illustration : wild bill -rrb- such be the faithful picture of wild bill as draw by general custer who be a close observer and student of personal character and under whom wild bill serve as a scout the circumstance under which i first make he acquaintance and learn to know he well and to appreciate he manly character and kind-heartedness be these one of the teamster in lew simpson 's train be a surly overbearing fellow and take particular delight in bully and tyrannize over I and one day while we be at dinner he ask I to do something for he i do not start at once and he give I a slap in the face with the back of he hand -- knock I off a ox-yoke on which i be sit and send I sprawl on the ground jump to my foot i pick up a camp kettle full of boil coffee which be set on the fire and throw it at he i hit he in the face and the hot coffee give he a severe scalding he spring for I with the ferocity of a tiger and would undoubtedly have tear I to piece have it not be for the timely interference of my new-found friend wild bill who knock the man down as soon as he recover himself he demand of wild bill what business it be of he that he should put in he oar it be my business to protect that boy or anybody else from be unmercifully abused kick and cuff and i 'll whip any man who try it on say wild bill and if you ever again lay a hand on that boy -- little billy there -- i 'll give you such a pound that you will not get over it for a month of sunday from that time forward wild bill be my protector and intimate friend and the friendship thus begin continue until he death nothing transpire on the trip to delay or give we any trouble whatever until the train strike the south platte river one day we camp on the same ground where the indian have surprise the cattle herd in charge of the mccarty brother it be with difficulty that we discover any trace of anybody ever have camp there before the only landmark be the single grave now cover with grass in which we have bury the three man who have be kill the country be alive with buffalo vast herd of these monarch of the plain be roam all around we and we lay over one day for a grand hunt besides kill quite a number of buffalo and have a day of rare sport we capture ten or twelve head of cattle they be a portion of the herd which have be stampede by the indian two month before the next day we pull out of camp and the train be string out to a considerable length along the road which run near the foot of the sand-hill two mile from the river between the road and the river we see a large herd of buffalo grazing quietly they have be down to the stream for a drink just at this time we observe a party of return californian come from the west they too notice the buffalo herd and in another moment they be dash down upon they urge they steed to the greatest speed the buffalo herd stampede at once and break for the hill so hotly be they pursue by the hunter that about five hundred of they rush through we train pell-mell frightening both man and oxen some of the wagon be turn clear round and many of the terrify oxen attempt to run to the hill with the heavy wagon attach to they other turn around so short that they break the wagon tongue off nearly all the team get entangled in they gear and become wild and unruly so that the perplexed driver be unable to manage they the buffalo the cattle and the driver be soon run in every direction and the excitement upset nearly everybody and everything many of the cattle break they yoke and stampede one big buffalo bull become entangled in one of the heavy wagon-chain and it be a fact that in he desperate effort to free himself he not only actually snap the strong chain in two but break the ox-yoke to which it be attach and the last see of he he be run towards the hill with it hang from he horn a dozen other equally remarkable incident happen during the short time that the frantic buffalo be play havoc with we train and when they have get through and leave we we outfit be very badly cripple and scatter this cause we to go into camp and spend a day in replace the broken tongue and repair other damages and gather up we scatter ox-team the next day we roll out of camp and proceed on we way towards the setting sun everything run along smoothly with we from that point until we come within about eighteen mile of green river in the rocky mountain -- where we camp at noon at this place we have to drive we cattle about a mile and a half to a creek to water they simpson he assistant george wood and myself accompany by the usual number of guard drive the cattle over to the creek and while on we way back to camp we suddenly observe a party of twenty horseman rapidly approach we we be not yet in view of we wagon as a rise of ground intervene and therefore we could not signal the train-man in case of any unexpected danger befall we we have no suspicion however that we be about to be trap as the stranger be white man when they have come up to we one of the party who evidently be the leader ride out in front and say : how be you mr simpson you have get the best of I sir say simpson who do not know he well i rather think i have coolly reply the stranger whose word convey a double meaning as we soon learn we have all come to a halt by this time and the strange horseman have surround we they be all arm with double-barreled shot gun rifle and revolver we also be arm with revolver but we have have no idea of danger and these man much to we surprise have get the drop on we and have cover we with they weapon so that we be completely at they mercy the whole movement of corrale we be do so quietly and quickly that it be accomplish before we know it i 'll trouble you for you six shooter gentleman now say the leader i 'll give 'em to you in a way you do not want reply simpson the next moment three gun be level at simpson if you make a move you be a dead man say the leader simpson see that he be take at a great disadvantage and think it advisable not to risk the life of the party by any rash act on he part he say : i see now that you have the best of I but who be you anyhow i be joe smith be the reply what the leader of the danites asked simpson you be correct say smith for he it be yes say simpson i know you now you be a spy scoundrel simpson have good reason for call he this and apply to he a much more opprobrious epithet for only a short time before this joe smith have visit we train in the disguise of a teamster and have remain with we two day he suddenly disappear no one know where he have go or why he have come among we but it be all explain to we now that he have return with he mormon danite after they have disarm we simpson ask well smith what be you go to do with we ride back with we and i 'll soon show you say smith we have no idea of the surprise which await we as we come upon the top of the ridge from which we could view we camp we be astonish to see the remainder of the train man disarm and station in a group and surround by another squad of danite while other mormon be search we wagon for such article as they want how be this inquire simpson how do you surprise my camp without a struggle i can not understand it easily enough say smith you man be all asleep under the wagon except the cook who see we come and take we for return californian or emigrant and pay no attention to we until we ride up and surround you train with we arm cover the man we wake they up and tell they that all they have to do be to walk out and drop they pistol -- which they see be the best thing they could do under circumstance over which they have no control -- and you can just bet they do it and what do you propose to do with we now ask simpson i intend to burn you train say he you be load with supplies and ammunition for sidney johnson and as i have no way to convey the stuff to my own people i 'll see that it do not reach the united state troops be you go to turn we adrift here ask simpson who be anxious to learn what be to become of himself and he man no i hardly be as bad as that i 'll give you enough provision to last you until you can reach fort bridger reply smith and as soon as you cook can get the stuff out of the wagon you can start on foot be the laconic inquiry of simpson yes sir be the equally short reply smith that be too rough on we man put yourself in we place and see how you would like it say simpson you can well afford to give we at least one wagon and six yoke of ox to convey we and we clothing and provision to fort bridger you be a brute if you do not do this well say smith after consult a minute or two with some of he company i 'll do that much for you the cattle and the wagon be bring up accord to he order and the clothing and provision be load on now you can go say smith after everything have be arrange joe smith i think you be a mean coward to set we afloat in a hostile country without give we we arm say simpson who have once before ask for the weapon and have have he request deny smith after further consultation with he comrade say : simpson you be too brave a man to be turn adrift here without any means of defense you shall have you revolver and gun we weapon be accordingly hand over to simpson and we at once start for fort bridger know that it would be useless to attempt the recapture of we train when we have travel about two mile we see the smoke arise from we old camp the mormon after take what goods they want and could carry off have set fire to the wagon many of which be load with bacon lard hard-tack and other provision which make a very hot fierce fire and the smoke to roll up in dense cloud some of the wagon be load with ammunition and it be not long before loud explosion follow in rapid succession we wait and witness the burning of the train and then push on to fort bridger arrive at this post we learn that two other train have be capture and destroy in the same way by the mormon this make seventy-five wagon load or 450000 pound of supplies mostly provision which never reach general johnson 's command to which they have be consign chapter vi hard time as it be get very late in the fall we be compel to winter at fort bridger and a long tedious winter it be there be a great many troops there and about four hundred of russell major & waddell 's employee these man be all organize into militia company which be officer by the wagon-master some live in tent other in cabin it be know that we supplies would run short during the winter and so all the man at the post be put on three-quarter ration to begin with before long they be reduce to one-half ration and finally to one-quarter ration we be force to kill we poor worn-out cattle for beef they be actually so poor that we have to prop they up to shoot they down at last we fall back on the mule which be kill and serve up in good style many a poor unsuspecting government mule pass in he chip that winter in order to keep the soldier and bull-whacker from starvation it be really a serious state of affair the wood for the post be obtain from the mountain but have no longer any cattle or mule to transport it the man be oblige to haul it themselves long lariat be tie to the wagon and twenty man man each they be pull to and from the mountain notwithstanding all these hardship the man seem to be contented and to enjoy themselves the winter finally pass away and early in the spring as soon as we could travel the civil employee of the government with the teamster and freighter start for the missourus river the johnson expedition have be abandon on the way down we stop at fort laramie and there meet a supply train bind westward of course we all have a square meal once more consist of hard tack bacon coffee and bean i can honestly say that i think it be the best meal i have ever eat at least i relish it more than any other and i think the rest of the party do the same on leave fort laramie simpson be make brigade wagon-master and be put in charge of two large train with about four hundred extra man who be bind for fort leavenworth when we come to ash hollow instead of take the usual trail over to the south platte simpson conclude to follow the north platte down to its junction with the south platte the two train be travel about fifteen mile apart when one morning while simpson be with the rear train he tell he assistant wagon-master george wood and myself to saddle up we mule as he want we to go with he and overtake the head train we start off at about eleven o'clock and have ride about seven mile when -- while we be on a big plateau back of cedar bluff -- we suddenly discover a band of indian come out of the head of a ravine half a mile distant and charge down upon we at full speed i think that we end have come this time sure simpson however take in the situation in a moment and know that it would be impossible to escape by run we played-out mule he adopt a bolder and much better plan he jump from he own mule and tell we to dismount also he then shoot the three animal and as they fall to the ground he cut they throat to stop they kick he then jerk they into the shape of a triangle and order we inside of the barricade all this be but the work of a few moment yet it be not do any too soon for the indian have get within three hundred yard of we and be still advance and utter they demoniacal yell or war-whoops there be forty of the red-skin and only three of we we be each arm with a mississippus yager and two colt 's revolver get ready for they with you gun and when they come within fifty yard aim low blaze away and bring down you man such be the quick command of simpson the word have hardly escape from he mouth when the three yager almost simultaneously belch forth they contents we then seize we revolver and open a lively fire on the enemy at short range which check they advance then we look over we little barricade to ascertain what effect we fire have produce and be much gratify at see three dead indian and one horse lie on the ground only two or three of the indian it seem have fire-arm it must be remember that in those day every indian do not own a needle gun or a winchester rifle as they now do they principal weapon be they bow and arrow see that they could not take we little fortification or drive we from it they circle around we several time shoot they arrow at we one of the arrow strike george wood in the left shoulder inflict only a slight wound however and several lodge in the body of the dead mule otherwise they do we no harm the indian finally gallop off to a safe distance where we bullet could not reach they and seem to be hold a council this be a lucky move for we for it give we a opportunity to reload we gun and pistol and prepare for the next charge of the enemy during the brief cessation of hostility simpson extract the arrow from wood 's shoulder and put a immense quid of tobacco on the wound wood be then ready for business again -lrb- illustration : hold the fort -rrb- the indian do not give we a very long rest for with another desperate charge as if to ride over we they come dash towards the mule barricade we give they a hot reception from we yager and revolver they could not stand or understand the rapidly repeat fire of the revolver and we again check they they circle around we once more and give we a few parting shot as they ride off leave behind they another dead indian and a horse for two hour afterwards they do not seem to be do anything but hold a council we make good use of this time by digging up the ground inside the barricade with we knife and throw the loose earth around and over the mule and we soon have a very respectable fortification we be not trouble any more that day but during the night the cunning rascal try to burn we out by set fire to the prairie the buffalo grass be so short that the fire do not trouble we much but the smoke conceal the indian from we view and they think that they could approach close to we without be see we be aware of this and keep a sharp look-out be prepare all the time to receive they they finally abandon the idea of surprising we next morning bright and early they give we one more grand charge and again we stand they off they then ride away half a mile or so and form a circle around we each man dismount and sit down as if to wait and starve we out they have evidently see the advance train pass on the morning of the previous day and believe that we belong to that outfit and be try to overtake it they have no idea that another train be on its way after we we hope of escape from this unpleasant and perilous situation now depend upon the arrival of the rear train and when we see that the indian be go to besiege we instead of renew they attack we feel rather confident of receive timely assistance we have expect that the train would be along late in the afternoon of the previous day and as the morning wear away we be somewhat anxious and uneasy at its non-arrival at last about ten o'clock we begin to hear in the distance the loud and sharp report of the big bull-whip which be handle with great dexterity by the teamster and crack like rifle shot these be as welcome sound to we as be the note of the bag-pipe to the beseiged garrison at lucknow when the reinforcement be come up and the piper be hear play the campbell be come in a few moment we see the lead or head wagon come slowly over the ridge which have conceal the train from we view and soon the whole outfit make its appearance the indian observe the approach train and assemble in a group they hold a short consultation they then charge upon we once more for the last time and as they turn and dash away over the prairie we send we farewell shot rattle after they the teamster see the indian and hear the shot come rush forward to we assistance but by the time they reach we the red-skin have almost disappear from view the teamster eagerly ask we a hundred question concern we fight admire we fort and praise we pluck simpson 's remarkable presence of mind in plan the defense be the general topic of conversation among all the man when the team come up we obtain some water and bandage with which to dress wood 's wound which have become quite inflamed and painful and we then put he into one of the wagon simpson and myself obtain a remount bid good-bye to we dead mule which have serve we so well and after collect the ornament and other plunder from the dead indian we leave they body and bone to bleach on the prairie the train move on again and we have no other adventure except several exciting buffalo hunt on the south platte near plum creek we arrive at fort leavenworth about the middle of July 1858 when i immediately visit home i find mother in very poor health as she be suffer from asthma my oldest sister martha have during my absence be marry to john crane and be live at leavenworth during the winter at fort bridger i have frequently talk with wild bill about my family and as i have become greatly attach to he i ask he to come and make a visit at we house which he promise to do so one day shortly after we return from fort bridger he accompany I home from leavenworth my mother and sister who have hear so much about he from I be delighted to see he and he spend several week at we place they do everything possible to repay he for he kindness to I ever afterwards when he be at or near leavenworth wild bill come out to we house to see the family whether i be at home or not and he always receive a most cordial reception he mother and sister live in illinoi and he use to call we house he home as he do not have one of he own i have be home only about a month after return from fort bridger when i again start out with another train go this time as assistant wagon-master under buck bomer we go safely through to fort laramie which be we destination and from there we be order to take a load of supplies to a new post call fort wallach which be be establish at cheyenne pass we make this trip and get back to fort laramie about November 1st i then quit the employ of russell major & waddell and join a party of trapper who be send out by the post trader mr ward to trap on the stream of the chugwater and laramie for beaver otter and other fur animal and also to poison wolf for they pelt we be out two month but as the expedition do not prove very profitable and be rather dangerous on account of the indian we abandon the enterprise and come into fort laramie in the latter part of December be anxious to return to the missourus river i join with two other name scott and charley who be also desirous of go east on a visit buy three pony and a pack-mule and we start out together we make rapid progress on we journey and nothing worthy of note happen until one afternoon along the bank of the little blue river we spy a band of indian hunting on the opposite side of the stream three mile away we do not escape they notice and they give we a lively chase for two hour but they could find no good cross and as evening come on we finally get away from they we travel until late in the night when upon discover a low deep ravine which we think would make a comfortable and safe camping-place we stop for a rest in search for a good place to make we bed i find a hole and i call to my companion that i have find a fine place for a nest one of the party be to stand guard while the other sleep scott take the first watch while charley and i make a bed in the hole while clear out the place we feel something rough but as it be dark we could not make out what it be at any rate we conclude that it be bone or stick of wood we think perhaps it might be the bone of some animal which have fall in there and die these bone for such they really prove to be we push one side and then we lay down but charley be a inveterate smoker could not resist the temptation of indulge in a smoke before go to sleep so he sit up and strike a match to light he old pipe we subterranean bed-chamber be thus illuminate for a moment or two i spring to my foot in a instant for a ghastly and horrifying sight be reveal to we eight or ten human skeleton lay scatter upon the ground the light of the match die out but we have see enough to convince we that we be in a large grave into which perhaps some unfortunate emigrant who have be kill by the indian have be throw or perhaps seek refuge there they have be corrale and then kill on the spot if such be the case they have meet the fate of thousand of other whose friend have never hear of they since they leave they eastern home to seek they fortune in the far west however we do not care to investigate this mystery any further but we hustle out of that chamber of death and inform scott of we discovery most of the plains-man be very superstitious and we be no exception to the general rule we surely think that this incident be a evil omen and that we would be kill if we remain there any longer -lrb- illustration : camping in a sepulchre -rrb- let we dig out of here quicker than we can say jack robinson say scott and we begin to dig out at once we saddle we animal and hurriedly push forward through the darkness travel several mile before we again go into camp next morning it be snow fiercely but we proceed as best we could and that night we succeed in reach oak grove ranch which have be build during the summer we here obtain comfortable accommodation and plenty to eat and drink -- especially the latter scott and charley be great lover and consumer of tanglefoot and they soon get gloriously drunk keep it up for three day during which time they gamble with the ranchman who get away with all they money but little they care for that as they have they spree they finally sober up and we resume we journey urge we jaded animal as much as they could stand until we strike marysville on the big blue from this place to leavenworth we secure first-rate accommodation along the road as the country have become pretty well settle it be in February 1859 that i get home as there be now a good school in the neighborhood teach by mr divinny my mother wish I to attend it and i do so for two month and a half -- the longest period of schooling that i ever receive at any one time in my life as soon as the spring come and the grass begin grow i become uneasy and discontented and again long for the free and open life of the plain the pike 's peak gold excitement be then at its height and everybody be rush to the new gold digging i catch the gold-fever myself and join a party bind for the new town of aurarium on cherry creek afterwards call denver in honor of the then governor of kansa on arrive at aurarium we push on to the gold stream in the mountain pass up through golden gate and over guy hill and thence on to black hawk we prospect for two month but as none of we know anything about mining we meet with very poor success and we finally conclude that prospect for gold be not we forte we accordingly abandon the enterprise and turn we face eastward once more -lrb- illustration : rafting on the platte -rrb- when we strike the platte river the happy thought of construct a small raft -- which would float we clear to the missourus and thence down to leavenworth -- enter we head and we accordingly carry out the plan upon the completion of the raft we stock it with provision and set sail down the stream it be a light craft and a jolly crew and all be smooth sailing for four or five day when we get near old julesburg we meet with a serious mishap we raft run into a eddy and quick as lightning go to piece throw we all into the stream which be so deep that we have to swim ashore we lose everything we have which greatly discourage we and we thereupon abandon the idea of raft it any farther we then walk over to julesburg which be only a few mile distant this ranch which become a somewhat famous spot have be establish by old jule a frenchman who be afterwards kill by the notorious alf slade the great pony express about which so much have be say and write be at that time just be start the line be be stock with horse and put into good run condition at julesburg i meet mr george chrisman the lead wagon-master of russell major & waddell who have always be a good friend to I he have buy out old jule and be then the owner of julesburg ranch and the agent of the pony express line he hire I at once as a pony express rider but as i be so young he think i would not be able to stand the fierce ride which be require of the messenger he know however that i have be raise in the saddle -- that i feel more at home there than in any other place -- and as he see that i be confident that i could stand the racket and could ride as far and endure it as well as some of the older rider he give I a short route of forty-five mile with the station fifteen mile apart and three change of horse i be require to make fifteen mile a hour include the change of horse i be fortunate in get well-broken animal and be so light i easily make my forty-five mile on time on my first trip out and ever afterwards i write to mother and tell she how well i like the exciting life of a pony express rider she reply and beg of I to give it up as it would surely kill I she be right about this as fifteen mile a hour on horseback would in a short time shake any man all to piece and there be but very few if any rider who could stand it for any great length of time nevertheless i stick to it for two month and then upon receive a letter inform I that my mother be very sick i give it up and go back to the old home in salt creek valley chapter vii accident and escape my restless roaming spirit would not allow I to remain at home very long and in November after the recovery of my mother i go up the republican river and its tributary on a trapping expedition in company with dave harrington we outfit consist of one wagon and a yoke of ox for the transportation of provision trap and other necessaries we begin trapping near junction city kansa and then proceed up the republican river to the mouth of prairie dog creek where we find plenty of beaver have see no sign of indian thus far we feel comparatively safe we be catch a large number of beaver and be prosper finely when one of we oxen have become rather poor slip and fall upon the ice dislocate he hip so that we have to shoot he to end he misery this leave we without a team but we care little for that however as we have make up we mind to remain there till spring when and it be decide that one of we should go to the nearest settlement and get a yoke of ox with which to haul we wagon into some place of safety where we could leave it we would probably have pull through the winter all right have it not be for a very serious accident which befall I just at that time spy a herd of elk we start in pursuit of they and creep up towards they as slyly as possible while go around the bend of a sharp bluff or bank of the creek i slip and break my leg just above the ankle notwithstanding the great pain i be suffer harrington could not help laugh when i urge he to shoot I as he have the ox and thus end my misery he tell I to brace up and that he would bring I out all right i be not much of a surgeon say he but i can fix that leg of yours even if i have not get a diploma he succeed in get I back to camp which be only a few yard from the creek and then he set the fracture as well as he know how and make I as comfortable as be possible under the circumstance we then discuss the situation which to say the least look pretty blue know that owe to we mishap we could not do anything more that winter and as i dread the idea of lie there on my back with a broken leg for week and perhaps month i prevail upon harrington to go the nearest settlement -- about 125 mile distant -- to obtain a yoke of cattle and then come back for I this he consent to do but before leave he gather plenty of wood and as the ground be cover with snow i would have no difficulty in get water if i have a fire there be plenty of fresh meat and other provision in the dug-out so that i have no fear of starvation the dugout which we have build immediately after we have determine to remain there all winter be a very cosy hole in the ground cover with pole grass and sod with a fireplace in one end harrington think it would take he twenty day or more to make the round trip but be well provide for -- for this length of time -- i urge he to go at once bid I good-bye he start on foot after he departure each day as it come and go seem to grow longer to I as i lay there helpless and alone i make a note of each day so as to know the time when i might expect he back -lrb- illustration : save by chief rain-in-the-face -rrb- on the twelfth day after harrington leave I i be awaken from a sound sleep by some one touch I upon the shoulder i look up and be astonish to see a indian warrior standing at my side he face be hideously daub with paint which tell I more forcibly than word could have do that he be on the war-path he speak to I in broken english and sioux mixed and i understand he to ask what i be do there and how many there be with I by this time the little dug-out be nearly fill with other indian who have be peep in at the door and i could hear voice of still more outside as well as the stamp of horse i begin to think that my time have come as the say be when into the cabin step a elderly indian whom i readily recognize as old rain-in-the-face a sioux chief from the vicinity of fort laramie i rise up as well as i could and show he my broken leg i tell he where i have see he and ask he if he remember I he reply that he know I well and that i use to come to he lodge at fort laramie to visit he i then manage to make he understand that i be there alone and have break my leg i have send my partner off for a team to take I away i ask he if he young man intend to kill I and he answer that be what they have propose to do but he would see what they have to say the indian then talk among themselves for a few minute and upon the conclusion of the consultation old rain-in-the-face turn to I and give I to understand that as i be yet a papoose or a very young man they would not take my life but one of he man who have no fire-arm want my gun and pistol i implored old rain-in-the-face to be allow to keep the weapon or at least one of they as i need something with which to keep the wolf away he reply that as he young man be out on the war path he have induce they to spare my life but he could not prevent they from take what ever else they want they unsaddle they horse as if to remain there for some time and sure enough they stay the remainder of the day and all night they build a fire in the dug-out and cook a lot of my provision help themselves to everything as if they own it however they be polite enough to give I some of the food after they have cook it it be a sumptuous feast that they have and they seem to relish it as if it be the best lay-out they have have for many a long day they take all my sugar and coffee and leave I only some meat and a small quantity of flour a little salt and some baking powder they also rob I of such cooking utensil as they wish then bidding I good-bye early in the morning they mount they pony and ride off to the south evidently bent on some murder and thieve expedition i be glad enough to see they leave as my life have undoubtedly hang by a thread during they presence i be confident that have it not be for my youth and the timely recognition and interference of old rain-in-the-face they would have kill I without any hesitation or ceremony the second day after they have go it begin snow and for three long and weary day the snow continue to fall thick and fast it block the door-way and cover the dug-out to the depth of several foot so that i become a snowbound prisoner my wood be mostly under the snow and it be with great difficulty that i could get enough to start a fire with my prospects be gloomy indeed i have just face death at the hand of the indian and now i be in danger of lose my life from starvation and cold i know that the heavy snow would surely delay harrington on he return and i fear that he might have perish in the storm or that some other accident might have befall he perhaps some wander band of indian have run across he and kill he i be continually think of all these possibility and i must say that my outlook seem desperate at last the twentieth day arrive -- the day on which harrington be to return -- and i count the hour from morning till night but the day pass away with no sign of harrington the wolf make the night hideous with they howl they gather around the dug-out run over the roof and paw and scratch as if try to get in several day and night thus wear away the monotony all the time become greater until at last it become almost unendurable some day i would go without any fire at all and eat raw frozen meat and melt snow in my mouth for water i become almost convince that harrington have be catch in the storm and have be bury under the snow or be lose many a time during that dreary period of uncertainty i make up my mind that if i ever get out of that place alive i would abandon the plain and the life of a trapper forever i have nearly give up all hope of leave the dug-out alive it be on the twenty-ninth day while i be lie thus despondently think and wonder that i hear the cheerful sound of harrington 's voice as he come slowly up the creek yell whoa haw to he cattle a criminal on the scaffold with the noose around he neck the trap about to be spring and receive a pardon just at the last moment thus give he a new lease of life could not have be more grateful than i be at that time it be useless for I to try to force the door open as the snow have completely blockade it and i therefore anxiously await harrington 's arrival hello billy he sing out in a loud voice as he come up he evidently be uncertain as to my be alive all right dave be my reply well old boy you be alive be you say he yes and that be about all i have have a tough siege of it since you have be away and i come pretty nearly pass in my chip i begin to think you never would get here as i be afraid you have be snow under say i he soon clear away the snow from the entrance and open the door he come in i do not think there ever be a more welcome visitor than he be i remember that i be so glad to see he that i put my arm around he neck and hug he for five minute never shall i forget faithful dave harrington well billy my boy i hardly expect to see you alive again say harrington as soon as i have give he a opportunity to draw he breath i have a terrible trip of it and i do not think i ever would get through i be catch in the snow-storm and be lay up for three day the cattle wander away and i come within a ace of lose they altogether when i get start again the snow be so deep that it prevent I from make much headway but as i have leave you here i be bind to come through or die in the attempt again i flung my arm around dave 's neck and give he a hug that would have do honor to a grizzly bear my gratitude be thus much more forcibly express than it could have be by word harrington understand this and seem to appreciate it the tear of joy roll down my cheek and it be impossible for I to restrain they when my life have be threaten by the indian i have not feel half so miserable as when i lay in the dug-out thinking i be destine to die a slow death by starvation and cold the indian would have make short work of it and would have give I little or no time to think of my fate i question harrington as to he trip and learn all the detail he have pass through hardship which but few man could have endure noble fellow that he be he have risk he own life to save mine after he have finish he story every word of which i have listen to with eager interest i related to he my own experience in which he become no less interested he express great astonishment that the indian have not kill I and he consider it one of the luckiest and most remarkable escape he have ever hear of it amuse I however to see he get very angry when i tell he that they have take my gun and pistol and have use up we provision but never mind billy say he we can stand it till the snow go off which will not be long and then we will pull we wagon back to the settlement a few day afterwards harrington gather up we trap and clean the snow out of the wagon cover it with the sheet which we have use in the dug-out he make a comfortable bed inside and help I into it we have be quite successful in trapping have catch three hundred beaver and one hundred otter the skin of which harrington load on the wagon we then pull out for the settlement make good headway as the snow have nearly disappear have be blow or melt away so that we have no difficulty in find a road on the eighth day out we come to a farmer 's house or ranch on the republican river where we stop and rest for two day and then go on to the ranch where harrington have obtain the yoke of cattle we give the owner of the team twenty-five beaver skin equal to $ 60 for the use of the cattle and he let we have they until we reach junction city send he boy with we to bring they back at junction city we sell we wagon and fur and go with a government mule train to leavenworth -- arrive there in march 1860 i be just able to get around on crutch when i get into leavenworth and it be several month after that before i entirely recover the use of my leg during the winter i have often talk to harrington about my mother and sister and have invite he to go home with I in the spring i now renew the invitation which he accept and accompany I home when i related to mother my adventure and tell she how harrington have save my life she thank he again and again i never see a more grateful woman than she be she ask he to always make he home with we as she never could reward he sufficiently for what he have do for she darling boy as she call I harrington conclude to remain with we through the summer and farm mother 's land but alas the uncertainty of life the come of death when least expect be strikingly illustrate in he case during the latter part of April he go to a nursery for some tree and while come home late at night he catch a severe cold and be take seriously sick with lung fever mother do everything in she power for he she could not have do more have he be she own son but notwithstanding she motherly care and attention and the skill of a physician from leavenworth he rapidly grow worse it seem hard indeed to think that a great strong man like harrington who have brave the storm and endure the other hardship of the plain all winter long should during the warm and beautiful day of spring when surround by friend and the comfort of a good home be fatally stricken down but such be he fate he die one week from the day on which he be take sick we all mourn he loss as we would that of a loved son or brother as he be one of the truest bravest and best of friend amid sorrow and tear we lay he away to rest in a picturesque spot on pilot knob he death cast a gloom over we household and it be a long time before it be entirely dispel i feel very lonely without harrington and i soon wish for a change of scene again chapter viii adventure on the overland road as the warm day of summer approach i long for the cool air of the mountain and to the mountain i determine to go after engage a man to take care of the farm i proceed to leavenworth and there meet my old wagon-master and friend lewi simpson who be fitting out a train at atchison and load it with supplies for the overland stage company of which mr russell my old employer be one of the proprietor simpson be go with this train to fort laramie and point further west come along with I billy say he i 'll give you a good lay-out i want you with I i do not know that i would like to go as far west as that again reply i but i do want to ride the pony express once more there be some life in that yes that be so but it will soon shake the life out of you say he however if that be what you have get you mind set on you have better come to atchison with I and see mr russell who i be pretty certain will give you a situation i reply that i would do that i then go home and inform mother of my intention and as she health be very poor i have great difficulty in obtain she consent i finally convinced she that as i be of no use on the farm it would be better and more profitable for I to return to the plain so after give she all the money i have earn by trapping i bade she good-bye and set out for atchison i meet mr russell there and ask he for employment as a pony express-rider he give I a letter to mr slade who be then the stage agent for the division extend from julesburg to rocky ridge slade have he headquarters at horseshoe station thirty-six mile west of fort laramie and i make the trip thither in company with simpson and he train almost the very first person i see after dismount from my horse be slade i walk up to he and present mr russell 's letter which he hastily open and read with a sweeping glance of he eye he take my measure from head to foot and then say : my boy you be too young for a pony express-rider it take man for that business i ride two month last year on bill trotter 's division sir and fill the bill then and i think i be better able to ride now say i what be you the boy that be ride there and be call the youngest rider on the road i be the same boy i reply confident that everything be now all right for I i have hear of you before you be a year or so older now and i think you can stand it i 'll give you a trial anyhow and if you weaken you can come back to horseshoe station and tend stock that end we first interview the next day he assign I to duty on the road from red butte on the north platte to the three crossing of the sweetwater -- a distance of seventy-six mile -- and i begin ride at once it be a long piece of road but i be equal to the undertaking and soon afterwards have a opportunity to exhibit my power of endurance as a pony express rider one day when i gallop into three crossing my home station i find that the rider who be expect to take the trip out on my arrival have get into a drunken row the night before and have be kill and that there be no one to fill he place i do not hesitate for a moment to undertake a extra ride of eighty-five mile to rocky ridge and i arrive at the latter place on time i then turn back and ride to red butte my start place accomplish on the round trip a distance of 322 mile -lrb- illustration : i immediately change horse -rrb- slade hear of this feat of mine and one day as he be pass on a coach he sing out to I my boy you be a brick and no mistake that be a good run you make when you ride you own and miller 's route and i 'll see that you get extra pay for it slade although rough at time and always a dangerous character -- have kill many a man -- be always kind to I during the two year that i work for he as pony express-rider and stage-driver he never speak a angry word to I as i be leave horse creek one day a party of fifteen indian jump I in a sand ravine about a mile west of the station they fire at I repeatedly but miss they mark i be mount on a roan californium horse -- the fleetest steed i have put spur and whip to he and lie flat on he back i keep straight on for sweetwater bridge -- eleven mile distant -- instead of try to turn back to horse creek the indians come on in hot pursuit but my horse soon get away from they and run into the station two mile ahead of they the stock-tender have be kill there that morning and all the stock have be drive off by the indian and as i be therefore unable to change horse i continue on to ploutz 's station -- twelve mile further -- thus make twenty-four mile straight run with one horse i tell the people at ploutz 's what have happen at sweetwater bridge and with a fresh horse go on and finish the trip without any further adventure -lrb- illustration : attack on stage coach -rrb- about the middle of September the indian become very troublesome on the line of the stage road along the sweetwater between split rock and three crossing they rob a stage kill the driver and two passenger and badly wound lieut flower the assistant division agent the red-skinned thief also drive off the stock from the different station and be continually lie in wait for the pass stage and pony express-rider so that we have to take many desperate chance in run the gauntlet the indian have now become so bad and have steal so much stock that it be decide to stop the pony express for at least six week and to run the stage but occasionally during that period in fact it would have be almost impossible to have run the enterprise much longer without restock the line while we be thus nearly all lie idle a party be organize to go out and search for steal stock this party be compose of stage-drivers express-rider stock-tender and ranchman -- forty of they altogether -- and they be well-armed and well-mounted they be mostly man who have undergo all kind of hardship and brave every danger and they be ready and anxious to tackle any number of indian wild bill -lrb- who have be drive stage on the road and have recently come down to we division -rrb- be elect captain of the company it be suppose that the steal stock have be take to the head of powder river and vicinity and the party of which i be a member start out for that section in high hope of success twenty mile out from sweetwater bridge at the head of horse creek we find a indian trail run north towards powder river and we could see by the track that most of the horse have be recently shod and be undoubtedly we steal stage stock push rapidly forward we follow this trail to powder river thence down this stream to within about forty mile of the spot where old fort reno now stand here the trail take a more westerly course along the foot of the mountain lead eventually to crazy woman 's fork -- a tributary of powder river at this point we discover that the party whom we be trail have be join by another band of indian and judge from the fresh appearance of the trail the unite body could not have leave this spot more than twenty-four hour before be aware that we be now in the heart of the hostile country and that we might at any moment find more indian than we have lose we advance with more caution than usual and keep a sharp lookout as we be approach clear creek another tributary of powder river we discover indian on the opposite side of the creek some three mile distant at least we see horse grazing which be a sure sign that there be indian there the indian think themselves in comparative safety -- never before have be follow so far into they own country by white man -- have neglect to put out any scout they have no idea that there be any white man in that part of the country we get the lay of they camp and then hold a council to consider and mature a plan for capture it we know full well that the indian would outnumber we at least three to one and perhaps more upon the advice and suggestion of wild bill it be finally decide that we should wait until it be nearly dark and then after creep as close to they as possible make a dash through they camp open a general fire on they and stampede the horse this plan at the proper time be most successfully execute the dash upon the enemy be a complete surprise to they they be so overcome with astonishment that they do not know what to make of it we could not have astonish they any more if we have drop down into they camp from the cloud they do not recover from the surprise of this sudden charge until after we have ride pell-mell through they camp and get away with we own horse as well as theirs we at once circle the horse around towards the south and after get they on the south side of clear creek some twenty of we man -- just as the darkness be come on -- ride back and give the indian a few parting shot we then take up we line of march for sweetwater bridge where we arrive four day afterwards with all of we own horse and about one hundred capture indian pony the expedition have prove a grand success and the event be celebrate in the usual manner -- by a grand spree the only store at sweetwater bridge do a rush business for several day the return stock-hunter drink and gamble and fight the indian pony which have be distribute among the captor pass from hand to hand at almost every deal of the card there seem to be no limit to the rioting and carousing revelry reign supreme on the third day of the orgie slade who have hear the news come up to the bridge and take a hand in the fun as it be call to add some variation and excitement to the occasion slade get in to a quarrel with a stage-driver and shoot he kill he almost instantly -lrb- illustration : alf slade kill the driver -rrb- the boy become so elated as well as elevated over they success against the indian that most of they be in favor of go back and clean out the whole indian race one old driver especially dan smith be eager to open a war on all the hostile nation and have the drinking be continue another week he certainly would have undertake the job single-handed and alone the spree finally come to a end the man sober down and abandon the idea of again invade the hostile country the recover horse be replace on the road and the stage and pony express be again run on time slade have take a great fancy to I say : billy i want you to come down to my headquarters and i 'll make you a sort of supernumerary rider and send you out only when it be necessary i accept the offer and go with he down to horseshoe where i have a comparatively easy time of it i have always be fond of hunting and i now have a good opportunity to gratify my ambition in that direction as i have plenty of spare time on my hand in this connection i will relate one of my bear-hunting adventure one day when i have nothing else to do i saddle up a extra pony express horse and arm myself with a good rifle and pair of revolver strike out for the foot hill of laramie peak for a bear-hunt ride carelessly along and breathe the cool and brace autumn air which come down from the mountain i feel as only a man can feel who be roam over the prairie of the far west well armed and mount on a fleet and gallant steed the perfect freedom which he enjoy be in itself a refreshing stimulant to the mind as well as to the body such indeed be my feeling on this beautiful day as i ride up the valley of the horseshoe occasionally i scare up a flock of sage-hen or a jack-rabbit antelope and deer be almost always in sight in any direction but as they be not the kind of game i be after on that day i pass they by and keep on towards the higher mountain the further i ride the rougher and wilder become the country and i know that i be approach the haunt of the bear i do not discover any however although i see plenty of track in the snow about two o'clock in the afternoon my horse have become tired and myself be rather weary i shoot a sage-hen and dismounting i unsaddled my horse and tie he to a small tree where he could easily feed on the mountain grass i then build a little fire and broil the chicken and season it with salt and pepper which i have obtain from my saddle-bag i soon sit down to a genuine square meal which i greatly relish after rest for a couple of hour i remount and resume my upward trip to the mountain have make up my mind to camp out that night rather than go back without a bear which my friend know i have go out for as the day be grow short night soon come on and i look around for a suitable camping place while thus engage i scare up a flock of sage-hens two of which i shoot intend to have one for supper and the other for breakfast by this time it be become quite dark and i ride down to one of the little mountain stream where i find a open place in the timber suitable for a camp i dismount and after unsaddle my horse and hitch he to a tree i prepare to start a fire just then i be startle by hear a horse whinny further up the stream it be quite a surprise to I and i immediately run to my animal to keep he from answer as horse usually do in such case i think that the strange horse might belong to some roaming band of indian as i know of no white man be in that portion of the country at that time i be certain that the owner of the strange horse could not be far distant and i be very anxious to find out who my neighbor be before let he know that i be in he vicinity i therefore re-saddled my horse and leave he tie so that i could easily reach he i take my gun and start out on a scout expedition up the stream i have go about four hundred yard when in a bend of the stream i discover ten or fifteen horse grazing on the opposite side of the creek a light be shine high up the mountain bank approach the mysterious spot as cautiously as possible and when within a few yard of the light -- which i discover come from a dug-out in the mountain side -- i hear voice and soon i be able distinguish the word as they prove to be in my own language then i know that the occupant of the dug-out whence the voice proceed be white man think that they might be a party of trapper i boldly walk up to the door and knock for admission the voice instantly cease and for a moment a deathlike silence reign inside then there seem to follow a kind of hurry whispering -- a sort of consultation -- and then some one call out : who be there a friend and a white man i reply the door open and a big ugly-looking fellow step forth and say : come in i accept the invitation with some degree of fear and hesitation which i endeavor to conceal as i see that it be too late to back out and that it would never do to weaken at that point whether they be friend or foe upon enter the dug-out my eye fall upon eight as rough and villainous look man as i ever see in my life two of they i instantly recognize as teamster who have be drive in lew simpson 's train a few month before and have be discharge they be charge with the murder and rob of a ranchman and have steal he horse it be suppose that they have leave the country i give they no sign of recognition however deem it advisable to let they remain in ignorance as to who i be it be a hard crowd and i conclude that the sooner i could get away from they the better it would be for I i feel confident that they be a band of horse-thief where be you go young man and who be with you ask one of the man who appear to be the leader of the gang i be entirely alone i leave horseshoe station this morning for a bear hunt and not find any bear i have determine to camp out for the night and wait till morning say i and just as i be go into camp a few hundred yard down the creek i hear one of you horse whinnying and then i come up to you camp -lrb- illustration : the horse thief ' den -rrb- i be thus explicit in my statement in order if possible to satisfy the cut-throat that i be not spy upon they but that my intrusion be entirely accidental where 's you horse demand the boss thief i leave he down the creek i answer they propose go after the horse but i think that that would never do as it would leave I without any means of escape and i accordingly say in hope to throw they off the track captain i 'll leave my gun here and go down and get my horse and come back and stay all night i say this in as cheerful and as careless a manner as possible so as not to arouse they suspicion in any way or lead they to think that i be aware of they true character i hate to part with my gun but my suggestion of leave it be a part of the plan of escape which i have arrange if they have the gun think i they would surely believe that i intend to come back but this little game do not work at all as one of the desperado speak up and say : jim and i will go down with you after you horse and you can leave you gun here all the same as you 'll not need it all right i reply for i could certainly have say nothing else it become evident to I that it would be better to trust myself with two man than with the whole party it be apparent that from this time on i would have to be on the alert for some good opportunity to give they the slip come along say one of they and together we go down the creek and soon come to the spot where my horse be tie one of the man unhitch the animal and say : i 'll lead the horse very well say i i have get a couple of sage-hen here lead on i pick up the sage-hen which i have kill a few hour before and follow the man who be lead the horse while he companion bring up the rear the nearer we approach the dug-out the more i dread the idea of go back among the villainous cut-throat my first plan of escape have fail i now determine upon another -lrb- illustration : my escape from the horse thief -rrb- i have both of my revolver with I the thief not have think it necessary to search I it be now quite dark and i purposely drop one of the sage-hen and ask the man behind I to pick it up while he be hunting for it on the ground i quickly pull out one of my colt 's revolver and strike he a tremendous blow on the back of the head knock he senseless to the ground i then instantly wheel around and see that the man ahead who be only a few foot distant have hear the blow and have turn to see what be the matter he hand upon he revolver we face each other at about the same instant but before he could fire as he try to do i shoot he dead in he track then jump on my horse i ride down the creek as fast as possible through the darkness and over the rough ground and rock the other outlaw in the dug-out have hear the shot which i have fire know there be trouble and they all come rush down the creek i suppose by the time they reach the man whom i have knock down that he have recover and hurriedly tell they of what have happen they do not stay with the man whom i have shoot but come on in hot pursuit of I they be not mount and be make better time down the rough canõn than i be on horseback from time to time i hear they gradually gain on I at last they have come so near that i see that i must abandon my horse so i jump to the ground and give he a hard slap with the butt of one of my revolver which start he on down the valley while i scramble up the mountain side i have not ascend more than forty foot when i hear my pursuer come closer and closer i quickly hide behind a large pine tree and in a few moment they all rush by I be lead on by the rattle footstep of my horse which they hear ahead of they soon i hear they firing at random at the horse as they no doubt suppose i be still seat on he back as soon as they have pass I i climb further up the steep mountain and know that i have give they the slip and feeling certain that i could keep out of they way i at once strike out for horseshoe station which be twenty-five mile distant i have hard travel at first but upon reach lower and better ground i make good headway walk all night and get into the station just before daylight -- foot-sore weary and generally play out i immediately wake up the man of the station and tell they of my adventure slade himself happen to be there and he at once organize a party to go out and hunt up the horse-thief shortly after daylight twenty well-armed stage-driver stock-tender and ranchman be gallop in the direction of the dug-out of course i go along with the party notwithstanding i be very tired and have have hardly any rest at all we have a brisk ride and arrive in the immediate vicinity of the thief ' rendezvous at about ten o'clock in the morning we approach the dug-out cautiously but upon get in close proximity to it we could discover no horse in sight we could see the door of the dug-out standing wide open and we then march up to the place no one be inside and the general appearance of everything indicate that the place have be desert -- that the bird have fly such indeed prove to be the case we find a new-made grave where they have evidently bury the man whom i have shoot we make a thorough search of the whole vicinity and finally find they trail go southeast in the direction of denver as it would have be useless to follow they we ride back to the station and thus end my eventful bear-hunt we have no more trouble for some time from horse-thief after that during the winter of 1860 and the spring of 1861 i remain at horseshoe occasionally ride pony express and take care of stock chapter ix fast drive it be in the spring of 1861 while i be at horseshoe that the eastern-bound coach come in one day load down with passenger and baggage and stop for dinner horseshoe be a regular dinner station as well as a home station the passenger consist of six englishman and they have be continually grumble about the slow

they caw not stage in this country as we do in hingland you know say another they remark be overhear by bob scott who be to drive the coach from horseshoe to fort laramie and he determine to give they satisfaction before they get over he route scott be know to be the best reinsman and the most expert driver on the whole line of the road he be a very gentlemanly fellow in he general appearance and conduct but at time he would become a reckless dare-devil and would take more desperate chance than any other driver he delight in drive wild team on the darkest night over a mountain road and have thus become the hero of many a thrilling adventure it happen on this day he be to drive a team of six pony express horse which have be only partially break in as a stage team as the stock-tender be hitch they up bob who be stand by say i 'll show they englishman that we ` blarsted heathen ' do know something about staging in this country we all know from bob 's look that something be up it

remark another be you the lad who be go to drive to-day ask another of bob yes gentleman answer bob i 'll show you how we stage it in this country bob mount the box gather the line and pull the horse strongly by the bit he sing out to the englishman all aboard bob 's companion on the box be capt cricket a little fellow who be the messenger of the coach after everybody be seat bob tell the stock-tender to turn 'em loose we who be stand around to see the stage start out expect it would go off at a lively rate we be considerably surprised therefore when after the horse have make a few lively jump bob put on the big californium brake and bring they down to a walk the road for a distance of four mile gradually rise to the top of a hill and all the way up this ascent bob hold the impatient team in check blarst you heye driver why do not you let they go exclaimed one of the passenger who have all along be expect a very brisk ride every once in a while they would ask he some such question but he pay no attention to they at last he reach the top of the hill and then he suddenly fling three of the line on the left side of the team and the other three on the right side he then begin play the silk to they -- that be to say he begin to lash they unmercifully the team start off like a streak of lightning so to speak without a single rein be hold by the driver bob cry out to the englishman say hold on gentleman and i 'll give you a lively ride and show you how to stage it in the rocky mountain -lrb- illustration : bob scott 's famous coach ride -rrb- he next movement be to pull the lamp out of the socket and throw they at the leader the glass break upon they back and nearly set they wild but be so accustomed to run the road they never once leave the track and go fly on down the grade towards the next station eight mile distant the coach bounce over the loose stone and small obstacle and surge from side to side as a eggshell would in the rapid of niagara not satisfy with the break-neck rate at which they be travel bob pull out he revolver and fire in rapid succession at the same time yell in a demoniacal manner by this time the englishman have become thoroughly frighten as they see the line fly wildly in every direction and the team run away they do not know whether to jump out or remain in the coach bob would occasionally look down from he seat and see they frightened face would ask well how do you like staging in this country now the englishman stick to the coach probably think it would be better to do so than to take the chance of break they neck by jump as the fly team be near the station the stock tender see that they be run away and that the driver have no control over they whatever be aware that the pony express horse be accustom to run right into the stable on arrive at the station he throw open the large folding door which would just allow the passage of the team and coach into the stable the horse sure enough make for the open doorway capt cricket the messenger and scott get down in the boot of the coach to save themselves from collide with the top of the stable door the coach would probably have pass through into the stable without any serious damage have it not be for the bar or threshold that be stretch across the ground to fasten the door to this bar be a small log and the front wheel strike it with such force that the coach be throw up high enough to strike the upper portion of the door frame the top of the coach be completely tear off and one of the passenger 's arm be break this be the only serious injury that be do though it be a matter of surprise to all that any of the traveler escape the coach be back out when the run gear be find to be as good as ever the top be soon patch up a change of team be make and bob scott mount the box as if nothing have happen take the rein in hand and shout all aboard the englishman however have have enough of bob scott and not one of the party be willing to risk he life with he again they say that he be drunk or crazy or both and that they would report he and have he discharge for what he have already do bob wait a few minute to give they a opportunity to take they seat in the coach but they tell he most emphatically that he could drive on without they as they intend to wait there for the next stage they trap be take off and bob drive away without a single passenger he make he usual time into fort laramie which be the end of he run the englishman come through on the next day 's coach and proceed on to atchison where they report bob to the superintendent of the line who however pay little or no attention to the matter as bob remain on the road such be the story of the liveliest and most reckless piece of stage-driving that ever occur on the overland stage road chapter x questionable proceedings have be away from home nearly a year and have occasionally hear of my mother 's poor health i determine to make she a visit so procure a pass over the road i go to leavenworth arrive there about June 1st 1861 go from there home the civil war have break out and excitement run high in that part of the country my mother of course be a strong union woman and have such great confidence in the government that she believe the war would not last over six month leavenworth at that time be quite a important outfit post for the west and southwest and the fort there be garrison by a large number of troops while in the city one day i meet several of the old as well as the young man who have be member of the free state party all through the kansas trouble and who have like we family lose everything at the hand of the missourian they now think a good opportunity offer to retaliate and get even with they persecutor as they be all consider to be secessionist that they be all secessionist however be not true as all of they do not sympathize with the south but the free state man myself among they take it for grant that as missourus be a slave state the inhabitant must all be secessionist and therefore we enemy a man by the name of chandler propose that we organize a independent company for the purpose of invade missourus and make war on its people on we own responsibility he at once go about it in a very quiet way and succeed in induce twenty-five man to join he in the hazardous enterprise have a longing and revengeful desire to retaliate upon the missourian for the brutal manner in which they have treat and rob my family i become a member of chandler 's company he plan be that we should leave we home in party of not more than two or three together and meet at a certain point near westport missourus on a fixed day he instruction be carry out to the letter and we meet at the rendezvous at the appoint time chandler have be there some day before we and thoroughly disguise have be look around the country for the whereabouts of all the best horse he direct we to secretly visit certain farm and collect all the horse possible and bring they together the next night this we do and upon reassemble it be find that nearly every man have two horse we immediately strike out for the kansas line which we cross at a indian ferry on the kansas river above wyandotte and as soon as we have set foot upon kansa soil we separate with the understanding that we be to meet one week from that day at leavenworth -lrb- illustration : nearly every man have two horse -rrb- some of the party boldly take they confiscate horse into leavenworth while other ride they to they home this action may look to the reader like horse-stealing and some people might not hesitate to call it by that name but chandler plausibly maintain that we be only get back we own or the equivalent from the missourian and as the government be wage war against the south it be perfectly square and honest and we have a good right to do it so we do not let we conscience trouble we very much we continue to make similar raid upon the missourian off and on during the summer and occasionally we have run fight with they none of the skirmish however amount to much the government official hearing of we operation put detective upon we track and several of the party be arrest my mother upon learn that i be engage in this business tell I it be neither honorable nor right and she would not for a moment countenance any such proceedings consequently i abandon the jay-hawking enterprise for such it really be about this time the government buy from jone and cartwright several ox-train which be send to rolla missourus all be put in charge of my old and gallant friend wild bill who have just become the hero of the day on account of a terrible fight which he have have with a gang of desperado and outlaw who infested the border under the leadership of the then notorious jake mccandless in this fight he have kill mccandless and three of he man the affair occur while wild bill be ride the pony express in western kansa the custom with the express rider when within half a mile of a station be either to begin shout or blow a horn in order to notify the stock tender of he approach and to have a fresh horse already saddle for he on he arrival so that he could go right on without a moment 's delay one day as wild bill near rock creek station where he be to change horse he begin shout as usual at the proper distance but the stock-tender who have be marry only a short time and have he wife live with he at the station do not make he accustomed appearance wild bill gallop up and instead of find the stock-tender ready for he with a fresh horse he discover he lie across the stable door with the blood ooze from a bullet-hole in he head the man be dead and it be evident that he have be kill only a few moment before in a second wild bill jump from he horse and look in the direction of the house he see a man come towards he the approach man fire on he at once but miss he aim quick as lightning wild bill pull he revolver and return the fire the stranger fall dead shot through the brain bill bill help help save I such be the cry that bill now hear it be the shrill and pitiful voice of the dead stock-tender 's wife and it come from a window of the house she have hear the exchange of shot and know that wild bill have arrive he dash over the dead body of the villain whom he have kill and just as he spring into the door of the house he see two powerful man assault the woman one of the desperado be in the act of striking she with the butt end of a revolver and while he arm be still raise bill send a ball crash through he skull kill he instantly two other man now come rush from a adjoining room and bill see that the odds be three to one against he jump into a corner and then firing he kill another of the villain before he could shoot again the remain two man close in upon he one of whom have draw a large bowie knife bill wrench the knife from he grasp and drive it through the heart of the outlaw -lrb- illustration : wild bill and the outlaw -rrb- the fifth and last man now grab bill by the throat and hold he at arm 's length but it be only for a moment as bill raise he own powerful right arm and strike he antagonist 's left arm such a terrible blow that he break it the disabled desperado see that he be no longer a match for bill jump through the door and mount a horse he succeed in make he escape -- be the sole survivor of the jake mccandless gang wild bill remain at the station with the terrify woman until the stage come along and he then consign she to the care of the driver mount he horse he at once gallop off and soon disappear in the distance make up for lose time this be the exploit that be on everybody 's tongue and in every newspaper it be one of the most remarkable and desperate hand to hand encounter that have ever take place on the border i happen to meet wild bill at leavenworth as he be about to depart for rollum he wish I to take charge of the government train as a sort of assistant under he and i gladly accept the offer arrive at rollum we load the train with freight and take they to springfield missourus on we return to rolla we hear a great deal of talk about the approach fall race at st loui and wild bill have bring a fast run horse from the mountain determine to take he to that city and match he against some of the high-flyer there and down to st loui we go with this run horse place we hope very high on he wild bill have no difficulty in make up a race for he all the money that he and i have we put up on the mountain runner and as we think we have a sure thing we also bet the horse against $ 250 i ride the horse myself but nevertheless we sure thing like many another sure thing prove a total failure and we come out of that race minus the horse and every dollar we have in the world before the race it have be make or break with we and we get break we be bust in the largest city we have ever be in and it be no exaggeration to say that we feel mighty blue on the morning after the race we go to the military headquarters where bill succeed in secure a engagement for himself as a government scout but i be so young fail in obtain similar employment wild bill however raise some money by borrow it from a friend and then buy I a steamboat ticket he send I back to leavenworth while he go to springfield

become involve in a quarrel with dave tutt a professional gambler about a watch which he have win from tutt who would not give it up bill tell he he have win it fairly and that he propose to have it furthermore he declare he intention of carry the watch across the street next morning to military headquarters at which place he have to report at nine o'clock tutt reply that he would himself carry the watch across the street at nine o'clock and no other man would do it bill then say to tutt that if he attempt anything of the kind he would kill he a challenge to a duel have virtually be give and accept and everybody know that the two man mean business at nine o'clock the next morning tutt start to cross the street wild bill who be stand on the opposite side tell he to stop at that moment tutt who be carry he revolver in he hand fire at bill but miss he bill quickly pull out he revolver and return the fire hit tutt squarely in the forehead and kill he instantly quite a number of tutt 's friend be stand in the vicinity have assemble to witness the duel and bill as soon as tutt fall to the ground turn to they and ask if any one of they want to take it up for tutt if so he would accommodate any of they then and there but none of they care to stand in front of wild bill to be shoot at by he nothing of course be ever do to bill for the killing of tutt chapter xi a soldier in

that he reply i be get so much valuable information that i propose to stay a little while longer in this disguise thereupon we shake hand and part it be not necessary to say much concern price 's raid in general as that event be a matter of recorded history i be only relate the incident in which i be personally interested either as one of the actor or as a observer another interesting and i may say exciting episode happen to I a day or two after my unexpected meeting with wild bill i be ride with the advance guard of we army and wish a drink of water i stop at a farmhouse there be no man about the premise and no one except a very fine and intellectual look lady and she two daughter they seem to be almost frighten to death at see I -- a yank -- appear before they i quiet they fear somewhat and the mother then ask I how far back the army be when i tell she it would be along shortly she express she fear that they would take everything on the premise they set I out a lunch and treat I rather kindly so that i really begin to sympathize with they for i know that the soldier would ransack they house and confiscate everything they could lay they hand on at last i resolve to do what i could to protect they after the general and the staff officer have pass by i take it upon myself to be a sentry over the house when the command come along some of the man rush up with the intention of enter the place and carry off all the desirable plunder possible and then tear and break everything to piece as they usually do along the line of march halt i shout i have be place here by the commanding officer as a guard over this house and no man must enter it this stop the first squad and see that my plan be a success i remain at my post during the passage of the entire command and keep out all intruder it seem as if the lady could not thank I sufficiently for the protection i have afford they they be perfectly aware of the fact that i have act without order and entirely on my own responsibility and therefore they feel the more grateful they urgently invite I to remain a little while longer and partake of a excellent dinner which they say they be prepare for I i be pretty hungry about that time as we ration have be rather slim of late and a good dinner be a temptation i could not withstand especially as it be to be serve up by such elegant lady while i be eat the meal i be most agreeably entertain by the young lady and before i have finish it the last of the rear-guard must have be at least two mile from the house suddenly three man enter the room and i look up and see three double-barreled shot-gun level straight at I before i could speak however the mother and she daughter spring between the man and I father boy lower you gun you must not shoot this man and similar exclamation be the cry of all three the gun be lower and then the man who be the father and brother of the young lady be inform of what i have do for they it appear that they have be conceal in the wood near by while the army be pass and on come into the house and find a yankee there they determine to shoot he upon learn the fact the old man extend he hand to I say : i would not harm a hair of you head for the world but it be best that you stay here no longer as you command be some distance from here now and you might be cut off by bushwhacker before reach it bid they all good-bye and with many thanks from the mother and daughter i mount my horse and soon overtake the column happy in the thought that i have do a good deed and with no regret that i have save from pillage and destruction the home and property of a confederate and he family we command keep crowd against price and he army until they be push into the vicinity of kansas city where they further advance be check by united state troops from kansa and then be begin they memorable and extraordinary retreat back into kansa while both army be draw up in skirmish line near fort scott kansa two man on horseback be see rapidly leave the confederate line and suddenly they make a dash towards we instantly quick volley be discharge from the confederate who also begin a pursuit and some five hundred shot be fire at the fly man it be evident that they be try to reach we line but when within about a quarter of a mile of we one of they fall from he horse to rise no more he have be fatally shoot he companion gallop on unhurt and seven company of we regiment charge out and meet he and check he pursuer the fugitive be dress in confederate uniform and as he ride into we line i recognize he as wild bill the union scout he immediately seek general pleasanton and mcniel with whom he hold a consultation he tell they that although price make a bold showing on the front by bring all he man into view yet he be really a great deal weaker than the appearance of he line would indicate and that he be then try to cross a difficult stream four mile from fort scott it be late in the afternoon but general pleasanton immediately order a advance and we charge in full force upon the rear of price 's army and drive it before we for two hour if wild bill could have make he successful dash into we line earlier in the day the attack would have be make sooner and greater result might have be expect the confederate have suspect he of be a spy for two or three day and have watch he too closely to allow a opportunity to get away from they sooner he unfortunate companion who have be shoot be a scout from springfield missourus whose name i can not now remember from this time on wild bill and myself continue to scout together until price 's army be drive south of the arkansa river and the pursuit abandon we then return to springfield missourus for a rest and for supplies and wild bill and myself spend two week there in have a jolly good time as some people would express it chapter xii a wedding it be during the winter of 1864-65 while i be on detach service at military headquarters at st loui that i become acquaint with a young lady name louisa fredericus whom i greatly admire and in whose charming society i spend many a pleasant hour the war closing in 1865 i be discharge and after a brief visit at leavenworth i return to st loui have make up my mind to capture the heart of miss fredericus whom i now adore above any other young lady i have ever see she lovely face she gentle disposition and she graceful manners win my admiration and love and i be not slow in declare my sentiment to she the result be that i obtain she consent to marry I in the near future and when i bade she good-bye i consider myself one of the happiest of man meantime i drive a string of horse from leavenworth to fort kearney where i meet my old friend bill trotter who be then division stage agent he employ I at once to drive stage between kearney and plum creek the road run near the spot where i have my first indian fight with the mccarthy brother and where i kill my first indian nearly nine year before i drive stage over this route until February 1866 and while bound over the cold dreary road day after day my thought turn continually towards my promise bride until i at last determine to abandon staging forever and marry and settle down immediately after come to this conclusion i go to st loui where i be most cordially receive by my sweetheart it be arrange between we that we wedding should take place on the 6th day of march follow at last the day arrive and the wedding ceremony be perform at the residence of the bride 's parent in the presence of a large number of invite friend whose hearty congratulation we receive i be certainly to be congratulate for i have become possess of a lovely and noble woman and as i gazed upon she as she stand beside I array in she wedding costume i indeed feel proud of she and from that time to this i have always think that i make a most fortunate choice for a life partner a hour after the ceremony we -- my bride and myself -- be on board of a missourus river steamboat bind for we new home in kansas my wife 's parent have accompany we to the boat and have bid we a fond farewell and a god-speed on we journey during the trip up the river several very amusing yet awkward incident occur some of which i can not resist relate there happen to be on board the boat a excursion party from lexington missourus and those comprise it seem to shun I for some reason which i could not then account for they would point at I and quietly talk among themselves and eye I very closely they action seem very strange to I after the boat have proceed some little distance i make the acquaintance of several family from indiana who be _ en route _ to kansa a gentleman who seem to be the leader of these colonist say to I the people of this excursion party do not seem to have any great love for you what do it mean i ask what be they say it be all a mystery to I they say that you be one of the kansas jay-hawker and one of jennison 's house burner reply the gentleman i be from kansa -- that be true and be a soldier and a scout in the union army say i and i be in kansa during the border ruffian war of 1856 perhaps these people know who i be and that explain they hard look i have a lengthy conversation with this gentleman -- for such he seem to be -- and entertain he with several chapter of the history of the early kansa trouble and tell he the experience of my own family in the evening the lexington folk get up a dance but neither the indiana people my wife or myself be invite to join they my new-found friend thereupon come to I and say : mr cody let we have a dance of we own very well be my reply we have some musician along with we so we can have plenty of music remark the gentleman good enough say i and i will hire the negro barber to play the violin for we he be a good fiddler as i hear he play only a little while ago the result be that we soon organize a good string band and have a splendid dance keep it up as long as the lexington party do theirs the second day out from st loui the boat stop to wood up at a wild-looking landing suddenly twenty horseman be see gallop up through the timber and as they come nearer the boat they fire on the negro deckhand against whom they seem to have a special grudge and who be engage in throw wood on board the negro all quickly jump on the boat and pull in the gang plank and the captain have only just time to get the steamer out into the stream before the bushwhacker -- for such they prove to be -- appear on the bank where be the black abolition jay-hawker shout the leader show he to we and we 'll shoot he yell another but as the boat have get well out in the river by this time they could not board we and the captain order a full head of steam pull out and leave they i afterwards ascertain that some of the missourian who be with the excursion party be bushwhacker themselves and have telegraph to they friend from some previous landing that i be on board tell they to come to the landing which we have just leave and take I off have the villain capture I they would have undoubtedly put a end to my career and the public would never have have the pleasure of be bore by this autobiography i notice that my wife feel grieve over the manner in which these people have treat I just marry she be go into a new country and see how she husband be regard how he have be shun and how he life have be threaten i be afraid she might come to the conclusion too soon that she have wed a hard customer so when the boat land at kansa city i telegraph to some of my friend in leavenworth that i would arrive there in the evening my object be to have my acquaintance give I a reception so that my wife could see that i really do have some friend and be not so bad a man as the bushwhacker try to make out just as i expect when the boat reach leavenworth i find a general round-up of friend at the landing to receive we there be about sixty gentleman and lady they have a band of music with they and we be give a fine serenade take carriage we all drive to south leavenworth to the home of my sister eliza who have marry george myer and there we be give a very handsome reception all this cheer up my wife who conclude that i be not a desperado after all have promise my wife that i would abandon the plain i rent a hotel in salt creek valley -- the same house by the way which my mother have formerly keep but which be then own by dr jj crook late surgeon of the 7th kansa this hotel i call the golden rule house and i keep it until the next September people generally say i make a good landlord and know how to run a hotel -- a business qualification which it be say be possess by comparatively few man but it prove too tame employment for I and again i sigh for the freedom of the plain believe that i could make more money out west on the frontier than i could at salt creek valley i sell out the golden rule house and start alone for saline kansa which be then the end of the track of the kansas pacific railway which be at that time be build across the plain on my way i stop at junction city where i again meet my old friend wild bill who be scout for the government he headquarters be at fort ellsworth afterwards call fort harker he tell I that they need more scout at this post and i accordingly accompany he to that fort where i have no difficulty in obtain employment during the winter of 1866-67 i scout between fort ellsworth and fort fletcher in the spring of 1867 i be at fort fletcher when general custer come out to go on a indian expedition with general hancock i remain at this post until it be drown out by the heavy flood of big creek on which it be located the water rise about the fortification and render the place unfit for occupancy so the government abandon the fort and move the troops and supplies to a new post -- which have be name fort hay -- located further west on the south fork of big creek it be while scout in the vicinity of fort hay that i have my first ride with the dashing and gallant custer who have come up to the post from fort ellsworth with a escort of only ten man he want a guide to pilot he to fort larn a distance of sixty-five mile across the country i be order by the commanding officer to guide general custer to he desire destination and i soon receive word from the general that he would start out in the morning with the intention of make the trip in one day early in the morning after a good night 's rest i be on hand mount on my large mouse-colored mule -- a animal of great endurance -- and ready for the journey when the general saw I he say : cody i want to travel fast and go through as quickly as possible and i do not think that mule of yours be fast enough to suit I general never mind the mule say i he 'll get there as soon as you horse that mule be a good one as i know that the animal be better than most horse very well go ahead then say he though he look as if he think i would delay the party on the road for the first fifteen mile until we come to the smoky hill river which we be to cross i could hardly keep the mule in advance of the general who ride a frisky impatient and ambitious thoroughbred steed in fact the whole party be finely mount the general repeatedly tell I that the mule be no good and that i ought to have have a good horse but after cross the river and strike the sand-hill i begin let my mule out a little and put the persuader to he he be soon out-traveling the horse and by the time we have make about half the distance to fort larned i occasionally have to wait for the general or some of he party as they horse be begin to show sign of fatigue general how about this mule anyhow i ask at last cody you have a better vehicle than i think you have be he reply from that time on to fort larned i have no trouble in keep ahead of the party we ride into the fort at four o'clock in the afternoon with about half the escort only the rest have lag far behind general custer thank I for have bring he straight across the country without any trail and say that if i be not engage as post scout at fort hay he would like to have I accompany he as one of he scout during the summer and he add that whenever i be out of employment if i would come to he he would find something for I to do this be the beginning of my acquaintance with general custer whom i always admire as a man and as a officer -lrb- illustration : general custer -rrb- a few day after my return to fort hay the indian make a raid on the kansas pacific railroad kill five or six man and run off about one hundred horse and mule the news be bring to the commanding officer who immediately order major arm of the tenth cavalry -- which by the way be a negro regiment -- with he company and one mountain howitzer to go in pursuit of the red-skin and i be send along with the expedition as scout and guide on the second day out we suddenly discover on the opposite side of the saline river about a mile distant a large body of indian who be charge down upon we major arm place the cannon on a little knoll limber it up and leave twenty man to guard it and then with the rest of the command he cross the river to meet the indian just as he have get the man over the stream we hear a terrific yell and shout in we rear and look back to the knoll where the cannon have be station we see the negro who have be leave there to guard the gun fly towards we be pursue by about one hundred indian while another large party of the latter be dance around the capture cannon as if they have get hold of a elephant and do not know what to do with it major arm turn he command back and drive the indian from the gun the troops then dismount and take position there quite a severe fight ensue last about two hour five or six of the soldier as well as major arm be wound and several of the horse be shoot the indian seem to grow thicker and thicker as if receive reinforcement from some large party the color troops who have be brag all the way that if they could only see some indian dey would blow 'em off de farm -- which be a favorite expression of theirs -- be now sing a different tune every time the indian would make a charge at we the darkey would cry out : heah dey cum dey must be ten thousand ob 'em de whole country be alive wid 'em massa bill do you tink we be eber agoin ' to get out o ' heah and many other similar expression major arm who be wound and lie under the cannon -- which by the way have become useless -- call I up and ask if i think there be any show of get back to the fort i reply that there be order be accordingly give by major arm for a retreat the cannon be leave behind during the movement several of we man be kill but as night come and dense darkness prevail we succeed in make good headway and get into fort hay just at daylight next morning in a very played-out condition during we absence the cholera have break out at the post and five or six man be die daily it be difficult to tell which be the greater danger -- fight indian on the prairie or face the cholera in camp but the former be decidedly the more invite chapter xiii a millionaire soon after return to fort hay i be send with dispatch to fort harker after deliver the message i visit the town of ellsworth about three mile west of fort harker and there i meet a man name william rise a contractor on the kansas pacific railroad who have a contract for grading near fort hay he have have he stock steal by the indian and have come to ellsworth to buy more during the course of we conversation mr rise incidentally remark that he have some idea of lay out a town on the west side of big creek about one mile from the fort where the railroad be to cross he ask my opinion of the contemplated enterprise and i tell he that i think it be a big thing he then propose take I as a partner in the scheme and suggest that after we get the town lay out and throw open to the public we should establish a store and saloon there think it would be a grand thing to be half-owner of a town i at once accept he proposition we buy a stock of such article as be usually find in a frontier store and transport they to the place on big creek where we be to find we town we hire a railroad engineer to survey the site and stake it off into lot and we give the new town the ancient and historical name of rome to a starter we donate lot to any one who would build on they but reserve the corner lot and other which be best located for ourselves these reserve lot we value at fifty dollar each we modern rome like all mushroom town along the line of a new railroad spring up as if by magic and in less than one month we have two hundred frame and log house three or four store several saloon and one good hotel rome be loom up and rise and i already consider ourselves millionaire and think we have the world by the tail but one day a fine-looking gentleman call himself dr we webb appear in town and drop into we store introduce himself in a very pleasant way gentleman you have get a very flourishing little town here would not you like to have a partner in you enterprise no thank you say i we have too good a thing here to whack up with anybody my partner agree with I but the conversation be continue and at last the stranger say : gentleman i be the agent or prospector of the kansas pacific railroad and my business be to locate town for the company along the line we think we have the only suitable town-site in this immediate locality say mr rise and as a town be already start we have save the company considerable expense you know as well as i do say dr webb that the company expect to make money by sell land and town lot and as you be not dispose to give the company a show or share with I i shall probably have to start another town near you competition be the life of trade you know start you town if you want to we have get the ` bulge ' on you and can hold it say i somewhat provoke at he threat but we act too independently and too indiscreetly for we own good dr webb the very next day after he interview with we begin haul material to a spot about one mile east of we where he stake out a new town which he call hay city he take great pain to circulate in we town the story that the railroad company would locate they round-house and machine shop at hay city and that it be to be _ the _ town and a splendid business center a ruinous stampede from we place be the result people who have build in rome come to the conclusion that they have build in the wrong place they begin pull down they building and move they over to hay city and in less than three day we once flourish city have dwindle down to the little store which rise and i have build it be on a bright summer morning that we sit on a pine box in front of we crib moodily view the demolition of the last building three day before we have consider ourselves millionaire on that morning we look around and see that we be reduce to the ragged edge of poverty we sanguine expectation of realize immense fortune be dash to the ground and we feel pretty blue the new town of hay have swallow rome entirely mr rise facetiously remark that he feel like the last rose of summer with all he lovely companion fade and go and _ he _ leave bloom alone i tell he i be still there staunch and true but he reply that that do not help the matter much thus end the brief history of the rise decline and fall of modern rome it have become evident to I that there be very little hope of rome ever regain its former splendor and prosperity i send my wife and daughter arta -- who have be bear at leavenworth in the latter part of December 1866 -- to st loui on a visit they have be live with I for some little time in the rear part of we store at this time mr rise and myself have a contract under schumacher miller & co constructor of the kansas pacific for grade five mile of track westward from big creek and run through the site of rome notwithstanding we have be desert we have some small hope that they would not be able to get water at the new town and that the people would all soon move back to rome as we really have the best location we determine therefore to go on with we grade contract and wait for something better to turn up it be indeed hard for we who have be millionaire to come down to the level of common railroad contractor -- but we have to do it all the same we visit the new town of hay almost daily to see how it be progress and in a short time we become much better acquaint with dr webb who have reduce we from we late independent to we present dependent position we find he a perfect gentleman -- a whole-souled genial-hearted fellow whom everybody like and respect nearly every day doc and i would take a ride over the prairie together and hunt buffalo on one occasion have venture about ten mile from the town we spy a band of indian not over two mile distant who be endeavor to get between we and the town and thus cut we off i be mount on my celebrated horse brigham the fleetest steed i ever own on several subsequent occasion he save my life and he be the horse that i ride when i kill sixty-nine buffalo in one day dr webb be ride a beautiful thoroughbred bay which he have bring with he from the east have such splendid horse we laugh at the idea of a band of indian overtake we on a square run no matter how well they might be mount but not care to be cut off by they we run we steed about three mile towards home thus get between the brave and the town the indian be then about three-quarter of a mile distant and we stop and wave we hat at they and fire some shot at long range there be thirteen in the party and as they be get pretty close to we we strike out for hay they come on in pursuit and send several scatter shot after we but we easily leave they behind they finally turn and ride off towards the saline river the doctor think this glorious sport and want to organize a party to go in pursuit of they but i induce he to give up this idea although he do so rather reluctantly the doctor soon become quite a expert hunter and before he have remain on the prairie a year there be but few man in the country who could kill more buffalo on a hunt than he be aware that rise and myself feel rather downheart over we desert village the doctor one day say that as he have make the proprietor of rome howl he would give we two lot each in hay and do so we finally come to the conclusion that we old town be dead beyond redemption or revival and we thereupon devoted we undivided attention to we railroad contract one day we be push for horse to work on we scraper -- so i hitch up brigham to see how he would work he be not much use to that kind of labor and i be about give up the idea of make a work-horse of he when one of the man call to I that there be some buffalo come over the hill as there have be no buffalo see anywhere in the vicinity of the camp for several day we have become rather short of meat i immediately tell one of we man to hitch he horse to a wagon and follow I as i be go out after the herd and we would bring back some fresh meat for supper i have no saddle as mine have be leave at the camp a mile distant so take the harness from brigham i mount he bareback and start out after the game be arm with my celebrated buffalo-killer lucretium borgium -- a newly-improved breech-loading needle gun which i have obtain from the government while i be ride toward the buffalo i observe five horseman come out from the fort who have evidently see the buffalo from the post and be go out for a chase they prove to be some newly-arrived officer in that part of the country and when they come up closer i could see by the shoulder strap that the senior officer be a captain while the other be lieutenant hello may friend sing out the captain i see you be after the same game we be yes sir i see those buffalo come over the hill and as we be about out of fresh meat i think i would go and get some say i they scan my cheap-looking outfit pretty closely and as my horse be not very prepossessing in appearance have on only a blind bridle and otherwise look like a work-horse they evidently consider I a green hand at hunting do you expect to catch those buffalo on that gothic steed laughingly ask the captain i hope so by push on the rein hard enough be my reply you 'll never catch they in the world my fine fellow say the captain it require a fast horse to overtake the animal on these prairie do it ask i as if i do not know it yes but come along with we as we be go to kill they more for pleasure than anything else all we want be the tongue and a piece of tender loin and you may have all that be leave say the generous man i be much oblige to you captain and will follow you i reply there be eleven buffalo in the herd and they be not more than a mile from we the officer dash ahead as if they have a sure thing on kill they all before i could come up with they but i have notice that the herd be make towards the creek for water and as i know buffalo nature i be perfectly aware that it would be difficult to turn they from they direct course thereupon i start towards the creek to head they off while the officer come up in the rear and give chase the buffalo come rush past I not a hundred yard distant with the officer about three hundred yard in the rear now think i be the time to get my work in as they say and i pull the blind-bridle from my horse who know as well as i do that we be out for buffalo -- as he be a trained hunter the moment the bridle be off he start at the top of he speed run in ahead of the officer and with a few jump he bring I alongside of the rear buffalo raise old lucretium borgium to my shoulder i fire and kill the animal at the first shot my horse then carry I alongside the next one not ten foot away and i drop he at the next fire as soon as one buffalo would fall brigham would take I so close to the next that i could almost touch it with my gun in this manner i kill the eleven buffalo with twelve shot and as the last animal drop my horse stop i jump to the ground know that he would not leave I -- it must be remember that i have be ride he without bridle rein or saddle -- and turn round as the party of astonished officer ride up i say to they : now gentleman allow I to present to you all the tongue and tender-loin you wish from these buffalo -lrb- illustration : tongue and tender loin -rrb- captain graham for such i soon learn be he name reply : well i never see the like before who under the sun be you anyhow my name be cody say i one of the lieutenant thompson by name who have meet I at fort harker then recognize I and say : why that be bill cody we old scout he then introduce I to the other officer who be captain graham of the tenth cavalry and lieutenant reed emmick and ezekiel captain graham who be considerable of a horseman greatly admire brigham and say : that horse of yours have run point yes sir he have not only get the point he be a runner and know how to use the point say i so i notice say the captain they all finally dismount and we continue chat for some little time upon the different subject of horse buffalo indian and hunting they feel a little sore at not get a single shot at the buffalo but the way i have kill they have they say amply repay they for they disappointment they have read of such feat in book but this be the first time they have ever see anything of the kind with they own eye it be the first time also that they have ever witness or hear of a white man run buffalo on horseback without a saddle or a bridle i tell they that brigham know nearly as much about the business as i do and if i have have twenty bridle they would have be of no use to I as he understand everything and all that he expect of I be to do the shooting it be a fact that brigham would stop if a buffalo do not fall at the first fire so as to give I a second chance but if i do not kill the buffalo then he would go on as if to say you be no good and i will not fool away time by give you more than two shot brigham be the best horse i ever own or see for buffalo chase we conversation be interrupt in a little while by the arrival of the wagon which i have order out i load the hind-quarter of the youngest buffalo on it and then cut out the tongue and tender loin and present they to the officer after which i ride towards the fort with they while the wagon return to camp captain graham tell I that he expect to be station at fort hay during the summer and would probably be send out on a scout expedition and in case he be he would like to have I accompany he as scout and guide i reply that notwithstanding i be very busy with my railroad contract i would go with he if he be order out i then leave the officer and return to we camp that very night the indian unexpectedly make a raid on the horse and run off five or six of we very best work-teams leave we in a very cripple condition at daylight i jump on old brigham and ride to fort hay when i report the affair to the commanding officer captain graham and lieutenant emmick be at once order out with they company of one hundred color troops to pursue the indian and recover we stock if possible in a hour we be under way the darky have never be in a indian fight and be anxious to catch the band we be after and sweep de red debel from off de face ob de earth captain graham be a brave dash officer eager to make a record for himself and it be with difficulty that i could trail fast enough to keep out of the way of the impatient soldier every few moment captain graham would ride up to see if the trail be freshen and how soon we should be likely to overtake the thief at last we reach the saline river where we find the indian have only stop to feed and water the animal and have then push on towards the solomon after cross the saline they make no effort to conceal they trail think they would not be pursue beyond that point -- consequently we be able to make excellent time we reach the soloman before sunset and come to a halt we surmise that if the indian be camp on this river that they have no suspicion of we be in the neighborhood i advise captain graham to remain with the company where it be while i go ahead on a scout to find the indian if they be in the vicinity after ride some distance down the ravine that lead to the river i leave my horse at the foot of a hill then creep to the top i look cautiously over the summit upon the solomon below i at once discover in plain view not a mile away a herd of horse grazing we lose one among they very shortly i make out the indian camp note its lay and how we could best approach it report to captain graham whose eye fairly dance with delight at the prospect of surprising and whipping the redskin we conclude to wait until the moon rise then get into the timber so as to approach the indian as closely as possible without be discover and finally to make a sudden dash into they camp and clean they out we have everything cut and dry as we think but alas just as we be near the point where we be to take the open ground and make we charge one of the color gentleman become so excited that he fire off he gun we immediately commence the charge but the firing of the gun and the noise of we rush through the crackling timber alarm the indian who at once spring to they horse and be away from we before we reach they late camp captain graham call out follow I boy which we do for awhile but in the darkness the indian make good they escape the bugle then give the re-call but some of the darky do not get back until morning have in they fright allow they horse to run away with they whithersoever it suit the animal 's pleasure to go -lrb- illustration : the indian horse thief -rrb- we follow the trail the next day for awhile but as it become evident that it would be a long chase to overtake the enemy and as we have ration only for the day we commence the return captain graham be bitterly disappoint in not be able to get the fight when it seem so near at one time he roundly curse the nigger who fire the gun and as a punishment for he carelessness he be compel to walk all the way back to fort hay chapter xiv earn a title it be about this time that the end of the kansas pacific track be in the heart of the buffalo country and the company be employ about twelve hundred man in the construction of the road as the indian be very troublesome it be difficult to obtain fresh meat for the workman and the company therefore conclude to engage the service of hunter to kill buffalo have hear of my experience and success as a buffalo hunter messr goddard brother who have the contract for board the employee of the road meet I in hay city one day and make I a good offer to become they hunter and i at once enter into a contract with they they say that they would require about twelve buffalo per day that would be twenty-four ham as we take only the hind-quarter and hump of each buffalo as this be to be dangerous work on account of the indian who be ride all over that section of the country and as i would be oblige to go from five to ten mile from the road each day to hunt the buffalo accompany by only one man with a light wagon for the transportation of the meat i of course demand a large salary they could afford to remunerate I well because the meat would not cost they anything they agree to give I five hundred dollar per month provide i furnish they all the fresh meat require leave my partner rise to complete we grade contract i immediately begin my career as a buffalo hunter for the kansas pacific railroad and it be not long before i acquire considerable notoriety it be at this time that the very appropriate name of buffalo bill be confer upon I by the road-hand it have stick to I ever since and i have never be ashamed of it during my engagement as hunter for the company -- a period of less than eighteen mouth -- i kill 4280 buffalo and i have many exciting adventure with the indian as well as hair-breadth escape some of which be well worth relate one day in the spring of 1868 i mount brigham and start for smoky hill river after gallop about twenty mile i reach the top of a small hill overlook the valley of that beautiful stream as i be gaze on the landscape i suddenly see a band of about thirty indian nearly half a mile distant i know by the way they jump on they horse that they have see I as soon as i come into sight the only chance i have for my life be to make a run for it and i immediately wheel and start back towards the railroad brigham seem to understand what be up and he strike out as if he comprehend that it be to be a run for life he cross a ravine in a few jump and on reach a ridge beyond i draw rein look back and see the indian come for I at full speed and evidently well-mounted i would have have little or no fear of be overtake if brigham have be fresh but as he be not i feel uncertain as to how he would stand a long chase -lrb- illustration : buffalo bill -rrb- my pursuer seem to be gain on I a little and i let brigham shoot ahead again when we have run about three mile farther some eight or nine of the indian be not over two hundred yard behind and five or six of these seem to be shorten the gap at every jump brigham now exert himself more than ever and for the next three or four mile he get right down to business and do some of the prettiest run i ever see but the indian be about as well-mounted as i be and one of they horse in particular -- a spotted animal -- be gain on I all the time nearly all the other horse be string out behind for a distance of two mile but still chase after I -lrb- illustration : down go he horse -rrb- the indian who be ride the spotted horse be arm with a rifle and would occasionally send a bullet whistle along sometimes strike the ground ahead of I i see that this fellow must be check or a stray bullet from he gun might hit I or my horse so suddenly stop brigham and quickly wheeling he around i raise old lucretium to my shoulder take deliberate aim at the indian and he horse hope to hit one or the other and fire he be not over eighty yard from I at this time and at the crack of my rifle down go he horse not wait to see if he recover i turn brigham and in a moment we be again fairly fly towards we destination we have urgent business about that time and be in a hurry to get there the other indian have gain on we while i be engage in shooting at they leader and they send several shot whiz past I but fortunately none of they hit the intended mark to return they compliment i occasionally wheel myself in the saddle and fire back at they and one of my shot break the leg of one of they horse which leave its rider _ hors -lrb- e -rrb- de combat _ as the french would say only seven or eight indian now remain in dangerous proximity to I and as they horse be begin to lag somewhat i check my faithful old steed a little to allow he a opportunity to draw a extra breath or two i have determine if it should come to the worst to drop into a buffalo wallow where i could stand the indian off for a while but i be not compel to do this as brigham carry I through most nobly the chase be keep up until we come within three mile of the end of the railroad track where two company of soldier be station for the purpose of protect the workman from the indian one of the outpost see the indian chase I across the prairie and give the alarm in a few minute i see greatly to my delight man come on foot and cavalryman too come gallop to we rescue as soon as they could mount they horse when the indian observe this they turn and run in the direction from which they have come in a very few minute i be meet by some of the infantryman and trackman and jump to the ground and pull the blanket and saddle off of brigham i tell they what he have do for I they at once take he in charge lead he around and rub he down so vigorously that i think they would rub he to death captain nolan of the tenth cavalry now come up with forty of he man and upon learn what have happen he determine to pursue the indian he kindly offer I one of the cavalry horse and after put my own saddle and bridle on the animal we start out after the fly indian who only a few minute before have be make it so uncomfortably lively for I we horse be all fresh and of excellent stock and we soon begin shorten the distance between ourselves and the redskin before they have go five mile we overtake and kill eight of they number the other succeed in make they escape on come up to the place where i have kill the first horse -- the spotted one -- on my home run i find that my bullet have strike he in the forehead and kill he instantly he be a noble animal and ought to have be engage in better business when we get back to camp i find old brigham grazing quietly and contentedly on the grass he look up at I as if to ask if we have get away with any of those fellow who have chase we i believe he read the answer in my eye another very exciting hunting adventure of mine which deserve a place in these reminiscence occur near saline river my companion at the time be a man call scotty a butcher who generally accompany I on these hunting expedition to cut up the buffalo and load the meat into a light wagon which he bring to carry it in he be a brave little fellow and a most excellent shot i have kill some fifteen buffalo and we have start for home with a wagon-load of meat when within about eight mile of we destination we suddenly run on to a party of at least thirty indian who come ride out of the head of a ravine on this occasion i be mount on a most excellent horse belong to the railroad company and could easily have make my escape but of course i could not leave scotty who be drive a pair of mule hitch to the wagon to think be to act in those day and as scotty and i have often talk over a plan of defense in case we be ever surprise by indian we instantly proceed to carry it out we jump to the ground unhitch the mule quicker than it have ever be do before and tie they and my horse to the wagon we throw the buffalo ham upon the ground and pile they around the wheel in such a shape as to form a breastwork all this be do in a shorter time than it take to tell it and then with we extra box of ammunition and three or four extra revolver which we always carry along with we we creep under the wagon and be fully prepare to give we visitor the warmest kind of a reception the indians come on pell-mell but when they be within one hundred yard of we we open such a sudden and galling fire upon they that they hold up and begin to circle around the wagon instead of ride up to take tea with we they however charge back and forth upon we several time and they shot kill the two mule and my horse but we give it to they right and left and have the satisfaction of see three of they fall to the ground not more than fifty yard away on see how well we be fortify and protect by we breastwork of ham they probably come to the conclusion that it would be a difficult undertaking to dislodge we for they draw off and give we a rest but only a short one this be the kind of fight we have be expect for a long time as we know that sooner or later we would be jump by indian while we be out buffalo hunting i have a understanding with the officer who command the troops at the end of the track that in case they picket should at any time notice a smoke in the direction of we hunting ground they be to give the alarm so that assistance might be send to we for the smoke be to indicate that we be in danger i now resolve to signal to the troops in the manner agree on and at the first opportunity set fire to the grass on the windward side of the wagon the fire spread over the prairie at a rapid rate cause a dense smoke which i know would be see at the camp the indian do not seem to understand this strategic movement they get off from they horse and from behind a bank or knoll again pepper away at we but we be well fortified and whenever they show they head we let they know that we could shoot as well as they -lrb- illustration : the fire signal -rrb- after we have be coop up in we little fort for about a hour we discover cavalry come toward we at full gallop over the prairie we signal of distress have prove a success the indian see the soldier at about the same time that we do and think that it would not be healthy for they to remain much longer in that vicinity they mount they horse and disappear down the cañons of the creek when the soldier come up we have the satisfaction of show they five _ good _ indian that be dead one two hour later we pull into camp with we load of meat which be find to be all right except that it have a few bullet and arrow stick in it while i be hunting for the kansas pacific railway i have the pleasure in the fall of 1867 of meet the celebrated kit carson one of if not the oldest and most note scout guide and hunter that we western country have ever produce he be on he way to washington i also meet he on he return from the east and invite he to be my guest for a few day at hay city which invitation he accept he then proceed to fort lyon colorado near which place he son-in-law mr bogg and family reside at this time he health be fail and shortly afterwards he die at mr bogg ' residence on the picket wire creek -lrb- illustration : kit carson -rrb- chapter xv champion buffalo killer shortly after the adventure mention in the precede chapter i have my celebrated buffalo hunt with billy comstock a note scout guide and interpreter who be then chief of scout at fort wallace kansa comstock have the reputation for a long time of be a most successful buffalo hunter and the officer in particular who have see he kill buffalo be very desirous of back he in a match against I it be accordingly arrange that i should shoot he a buffalo-killing match and the preliminary be easily and satisfactorily agree upon we be to hunt one day of eight hour begin at eight o'clock in the morning and closing at four o'clock in the afternoon the wager be five hundred dollar a side and the man who should kill the greater number of buffalo from on horseback be to be declare the winner the hunt take place about twenty mile east of sheridan and as it have be pretty well advertise and noised abroad a large crowd witness the interesting and exciting scene a excursion party mostly from st loui consist of about a hundred gentleman and lady come out on a special train to view the sport and among the number be my wife with little baby arta who have come to remain with I for a while the buffalo be quite plenty and it be agree that we should go into the same herd at the same time and make a run as we call it each one killing as many as possible a referee be to follow each of we on horseback when we enter the herd and count the buffalo kill by each man the st loui excursionist as well as the other spectator ride out to the vicinity of the hunting grounds in wagon and on horseback keep well out of sight of the buffalo so as not to frighten they until the time come for we to dash into the herd when they be to come up as near as they pleased and witness the chase we be fortunate in the first run in get good ground comstock be mount on one of he favorite horse while i ride old brigham i feel confident that i have the advantage of comstock in two thing -- first i have the best buffalo horse that ever make a track and second i be use what be know at that time as the needle-gun a breech-loading springfield rifle -- calibre 50 -- it be my favorite old lucretium which have already be introduce to the notice of the reader while comstock be arm with a henry rifle and although he could fire a few shot quicker than i could yet i be pretty certain that it do not carry powder and lead enough to do execution equal to my calibre 50 at last the time come to begin the match comstock and i dash into a herd follow by the referee the buffalo separate comstock take the left bunch and i the right my great _ forte _ in kill buffalo from horseback be to get they circle by ride my horse at the head of the herd shoot the leader thus crowd they follower to the left till they would finally circle round and round on this morning the buffalo be very accommodate and i soon have they run in a beautiful circle when i drop they thick and fast until i have kill thirty-eight which finish my run comstock begin shoot at the rear of the herd which he be chase and they keep straight on he succeed however in kill twenty-three but they be scatter over a distance of three mile while mine lay close together i have nurse my buffalo as a billiard-player do the ball when he make a big run after the result of the first run have be duly announce we st loui excursion friend -- who have approach to the place where we have stop -- set out a lot of champagne which they have bring with they and which prove a good drink on a kansas prairie and a buffalo hunter be a good man to get away with it while take a short rest we suddenly spy another herd of buffalo come toward we it be only a small drive and we at once prepare to give the animal a lively reception they prove to be a herd of cow and calf -- which by the way be quicker in they movement than the bull we charge in among they and i conclude my run with a score of eighteen while comstock kill fourteen the score now stand fifty-six to thirty-seven in my favor again the excursion party approach and once more the champagne be tap after we have eat a lunch which be spread for we we resume the hunt strike out for a distance of three mile we come up close to another herd as i be so far ahead of my competitor in the number kill i think i could afford to give a extra exhibition of my skill i have tell the lady that i would on the next run ride my horse without saddle or bridle this have raise the excitement to fever heat among the excursionist and i remember one fair lady who endeavor to prevail upon I not to attempt it that be nothing at all say i i have do it many a time and old brigham know as well as i what i be do and sometimes a great deal better so leave my saddle and bridle with the wagon we ride to the windward of the buffalo as usual and when within a few hundred yard of they we dash into the herd i soon have thirteen lay out on the ground the last one of which i have drive down close to the wagon where the lady be it frighten some of the tender creature to see the buffalo come at full speed directly toward they but when he have get within fifty yard of one of the wagon i shoot he dead in he track this make my sixty-ninth buffalo and finish my third and last run comstock have kill forty-six as it be now late in the afternoon comstock and he backer give up the idea that he could beat I and thereupon the referee declare I the winner of the match as well as the champion buffalo-hunter of the plain -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : poor billy comstock be afterwards treacherously murder by the indian he and sharpe grover visit a village of indian suppose to be peaceably incline near big spring station in western kansa and after spend several hour with the redskin in friendly conversation they prepare to depart have decline a invitation to pass the night there it appear that comstock 's beautiful white-handled revolver have attract the attention of the indian who overtake he and he companion when they have go about half a mile after surround the two man they suddenly attack they they kill scalped and rob comstock but grover although severely wound make he escape owe to the fleetness of the excellent horse which he be ride this sad event occur August 27 1868 -rrb- on we way back to camp we take with we some of the choice meat and finest head in this connection it will not be out of place to state that during the time i be hunting for the kansas pacific i always bring into camp the best buffalo head and turn they over to the company who find a very good use for they they have they mount in the best possible manner and send they to all the principal city and railroad center in the country have they place in prominent position at the lead hotel dépôts and other public building as a sort of trade-mark or advertisement of the kansas pacific railroad and to-day they attract the attention of the traveler almost everywhere whenever i be travel over the country and see one of these trade-mark i feel pretty certain that i be the cause of the death of the old fellow whose body it once ornament and many a wild and exciting hunt be thus call to mind the end of the track finally reach sheridan in the month of may 1868 and as the road be not to be build any farther just then my service as a hunter be not any longer require at this time there be a general indian war rage all along the western border general sheridan have take up he headquarters at fort haye in order to be in the field to superintend the campaign in person as scout and guide be in great demand i conclude once more to take up my old avocation of scout and guide for the army have no suitable place in which to leave my old and faithful buffalo-hunter brigham and not wish to kill he by scout i determine to dispose of he i be very reluctant to part with he but i console myself with the thought that he would not be likely to receive harder usage in other hand than he have in mine i have several good offer to sell he but at the suggestion of some gentleman in sheridan all of whom be anxious to obtain possession of the horse i put he up at a raffle in order to give they all a equal chance of become the owner of the famous steed there be ten chance at thirty dollar each and they be all quickly take old brigham be win by a gentleman -- mr ike bonham -- who take he to wyandotte kansa where he soon add new laurel to he already brilliant record although i be get ahead of my story i must now follow brigham for a while a grand tournament come off four mile from wyandotte and brigham take part in it as have already be state he appearance be not very prepossessing and nobody suspect he of be anything but the most ordinary kind of a plug the friend of the rider laugh at he for be mount on such a dizzy-looking steed when the exercise -- which be of a very tame character be more for style than speed -- be over and just as the crowd be about to return to the city a purse of $ 250 be make up to be give to the horse that could first reach wyandotte four mile distant the arrangement be carry out and brigham be enter as one of the contestant for the purse everybody laugh at mr bonham when it become know that he be to ride that poky-looking plug against the five thoroughbred which be to take part in the race when all the preliminary have be arrange the signal be give and off go the horse for wyandotte for the first half-mile several of the horse lead brigham but on the second mile he begin pass they one after the other and on the third mile he be in advance of they all and be show they all the road at a lively rate on the fourth mile he rider let he out and arrive at the hotel -- the home-station -- in wyandotte a long way ahead of he fastest competitor everybody be surprise as well as disgusted that such a homely critter should be the winner brigham of course have already acquire a wide reputation and he name and exploit have often appear in the newspaper and when it be learn that this critter be none other than the identical buffalo-hunting brigham nearly the whole crowd admit that they have hear of he before and have they know he in the first place they certainly would have rule he out i finally lose track of brigham and for several year i do not know what have become of he three year ago while i be at memphi tennessee i meet a mr wilcox who have be one of the superintendent of construction of the kansas pacific railroad and he inform I that he own brigham and that he be at that time on he farm only a few mile out of town the next day i ride out with mr wilcox and take a look at the gallant old horse he be comfortably care for in mr wilcox 's stable and look the same clever pony that he always be it seem as if he almost remember I and i put my arm around he neck as though he have be a long-lost child mr wilcox buy the horse at wyandotte from the gentleman who have win he at the raffle and he intend to keep he as long as he live i be grateful that he be in such good hand and whenever i again visit memphi i shall surely go and see brigham if he be still alive but to return to the thread of my narrative from which i have wander have receive the appointment of guide and scout and have be order to report at fort larned then command by captain dangerfield parker i see it be necessary to take my family -- who have remain with I at sheridan after the buffalo-hunting match -- to leavenworth and there leave they this i do at once and after provide they with a comfortable little home i return and report for duty at fort larned chapter xvi a courier the scout at fort larn when i arrive there be command by dick curti -- a old guide frontiersman and indian interpreter there be some three hundred lodge of kiowa and comanche indian camp near the fort these indian have not as yet go upon the war-path but be restless and discontented and they leading chief satanta lone wolf kick bird satank sittamore and other note warrior be rather saucy the post at the time be garrison by only two company of infantry and one of cavalry general hazen who be at the post be endeavor to pacify the indian and keep they from go on the war-path i be appoint as he special scout and one morning he notify I that he be go to fort harker and wish I to accompany he as far as fort zarah thirty mile distant the general usually travel in a ambulance but this trip he be to make in a six-mule wagon under the escort of a squad of twenty infantryman so early one morning in August we start arrive safely at fort zarah at twelve o'clock general hazen think it unnecessary that we should go farther and he proceed on he way to fort harker without a escort leave instruction that we should return to fort larn the next day after the general have go i go to the sergeant in command of the squad and tell he that i be go back that very afternoon instead of wait till the next morning and i accordingly saddle up my mule and set out for fort larn i proceed uninterruptedly until i get about half-way between the two post when at pawnee rock i be suddenly jump by about forty indian who come dash up to I extend they hand and say how how they be some of the same indian who have be hang around fort larn in the morning i see that they have on they war-paint and be evidently now out on the war-path -lrb- illustration : a big joke -rrb- my first impulse be to shake hand with they as they seem so desirous of it i accordingly reach out my hand to one of they who grasp it with a tight grip and jerk I violently forward another pull my mule by the bridle and in a moment i be completely surround before i could do anything at all they have seize my revolver from the holster and i receive a blow on the head from a tomahawk which nearly render I senseless my gun which be lie across the saddle be snatch from its place and finally the indian who have hold of the bridle start off towards the arkansa river lead the mule which be be lash by the other indian who be follow the savage be all singing yell and whoop as only indian can do when they be have they little game all they own way while look towards the river i see on the opposite side a immense village move down along the bank and then i become convinced that the indian have leave the post and be now start out on the war-path my captor cross the stream with I and as we wade through the shallow water they continue to lash the mule and myself finally they bring I before a important look body of indian who prove to be the chief and principal warrior i soon recognize old satanta among they as well as other whom i know and i suppose it be all over with I the indian be jabber away so rapidly among themselves that i could not understand what they be say satanta at last ask I where i have be and as good luck would have it a happy thought strike I i tell he i have be after a herd of cattle or whoa-haw as they call they it so happen that the indian have be out of meat for several week as the large herd of cattle which have be promise they have not yet arrive although expect by they the moment that i mention that i have be search for the whoa-haws old satanta begin question I in a very eager manner he ask I where the cattle be and i reply that they be back only a few mile and that i have be send by general hazen to inform he that the cattle be come and that they be intend for he people this seem to please the old rascal who also want to know if there be any soldier with the herd and my reply be that there be thereupon the chief hold a consultation and presently satanta ask I if general hazen have really say that they should have the cattle i reply in the affirmative and add that i have be direct to bring the cattle to they i follow this up with a very dignified inquiry ask why he young man have treat I so the old wretch intimate that it be only a freak of the boy that the young man have want to see if i be brave in fact they have only mean to test my bravery and that the whole thing be a joke the veteran liar be now beat I at my own game of lie but i be very glad of it as it be in my favor i do not let he suspect that i doubt he veracity but i remark that it be a rough way to treat friend he immediately order he young man to give I back my arm and scold they for what they have do of course the sly old dog be now play it very fine as he be anxious to get possession of the cattle with which he believe there be a heap of soldier come he have conclude it be not best to fight the soldier if he could get the cattle peaceably another council be hold by the chief and in a few minute old satanta come and ask I if i would go over and bring the cattle down to the opposite side of the river so that they could get they i reply of course that be my instruction from general hazen satanta say i must not feel angry at he young man for they have only be act in fun he then inquire if i wish any of he man to accompany I to the cattle herd i reply that it would be better for I to go alone and then the soldier could keep right on to fort larn while i could drive the herd down on the bottom so wheeling my mule around i be soon re-cross the river leave old satanta in the firm belief that i have tell he a straight story and be go for the cattle which only exist in my imagination i hardly know what to do but think that if i could get the river between the indian and myself i would have a good three-quarter of a mile the start of they and could then make a run for fort larn as my mule be a good one thus far my cattle story have pan out all right but just as i reach the opposite bank of the river i look behind and see that ten or fifteen indian who have begin to suspect something crooked be follow I the moment that my mule secure a good foothold on the bank i urge he into a gentle lope towards the place where accord to my statement the cattle be to be bring upon reach a little ridge and ride down the other side out of view i turn my mule and head he westward for fort larn i let he out for all that he be worth and when i come out on a little rise of ground i look back and see the indian village in plain sight my pursuer be now on the ridge which i have pass over and be look for I in every direction presently they spy I and see that i be run away they strike out in swift pursuit and in a few minute it become painfully evident that they be gain on I they keep up the chase as far as ash creek six mile from fort larned i still lead they half a mile as they horse have not gain much during the last half of the race my mule seem to have get he second wind and as i be on the old road i have play the whip and spur on he without much cessation the indian likewise have urge they steed to the utmost finally upon reach the divide ridge between ash greek and pawnee fork i see fort larn only four mile away it be now sundown and i hear the evening gun at the fort the troops of the garrison little dream that there be a man fly for he life from the indian and try to reach the post the indian be once more gain on I and when i cross the pawnee fork two mile from the post two or three of they be only a quarter of a mile behind I just as i have gain the opposite bank of the stream i be overjoy to see some soldier in a government wagon only a short distance off i yell at the top of my voice and ride up to they tell they that the indian be after I -lrb- illustration : ambush the indian -rrb- denver jim a well-known scout ask how many there be and upon my inform he that there be about a dozen he say : let 's drive the wagon into the tree and we 'll lay for 'em the team be hurriedly drive in among the tree and low box-elder bush and there secrete we do not have to wait long for the indian who come dash up lash they horse which be pant and blow we let two of they pass by but we open a lively fire on the next three or four kill two at the first crack the other follow discover that they have run into a ambush and whirling off into the brush they turn and run back in the direction whence they have come the two who have pass hear the firing and make they escape we scalp the two that we have kill and appropriate they arm and equipment and then catch they horse we make we way into the post the soldier have hear we firing and as we be approach the fort the drum be be beat and the bugler be sound the call to fall in the officer have think that satanta and he indian be come in to capture the fort it seem that on the morning of that day two hour after general hazen have take he departure old satanta drive into the post in a ambulance which he have receive some month before as a present from the government he appear to be angry and bent on mischief in a interview with captain parker the commanding officer he ask why general hazen have leave the post without supply the beef cattle which have be promise to he the captain tell he that the cattle be surely on the road but he could not explain why they be detain the interview prove to be a stormy one and satanta make numerous threat say that if he wish he could capture the whole post with he warrior captain parker who be a brave man give satanta to understand that he be reckon beyond he power and would find it a more difficult undertaking than he have any idea of as they be prepare for he at any moment the interview finally terminate and satanta angrily leave the officer presence go over to the sutler 's store he sell he ambulance to mr tappan the past trader and with a portion of the proceeds he secretly manage to secure some whisky from some bad man around the fort there be always to be find around every frontier post some man who will sell whisky to the indian at any time and under any circumstance notwithstanding it be a flagrant violation of both civil and military regulation satanta mount he horse and take the whisky with he he ride rapidly away and proceed straight to he village he have not be go over a hour when he return to the vicinity of the post accompany by he warrior who come in from every direction to the number of seven or eight hundred it be evident that the irate old rascal be on he ear so to speak and it look as if he intend to carry out he threat of capture the fort the garrison at once turn out and prepare to receive the red-skin who when within half a mile circle around the fort and fire numerous shot into it instead of try to take it by assault while this circular movement be go on it be observe that the indian village in the distance be pack up preparatory to leave and it be soon under way the mount warrior remain behind some little time to give they family a opportunity to get away as they fear that the troops might possibly in some manner intercept they finally they encircle the post several time fire some farewell round and then gallop away over the prairie to overtake they fast depart village on they way thither they surprise and kill a party of wood-chopper down on the pawnee fork as well as some herder who be guard beef cattle some seven or eight man in all be kill and it be evident that the indian mean business the soldier with the wagon -- whom i have meet at the cross of the pawnee fork -- have be out for the body of the man under the circumstance it be no wonder that the garrison upon hear the report of we gun when we fire upon the party whom we ambush should have think the indian be come back to give they another turn we find that all be excitement at the post double guard have be put on duty and captain parker have all the scout at he headquarters he be endeavor to get some one to take some important dispatch to general sheridan at fort hay i report to he at once and state where i have meet the indian and how i have escape from they you be very fortunate cody in thinking of that cattle story but for that little game you hair would now be a ornament to a kiowa 's lodge say he just then dick curti speak up and say : cody the captain be anxious to send some dispatch to general sheridan at fort hay and none of the scout here seem to be very willing to undertake the trip they say they be not well enough acquaint with the country to find the way at night as a storm be come up it be quite dark and the scout fear that they would lose the way besides it be a dangerous ride as a large party of indian be know to be camp on walnut creek on the direct road to fort hay it be evident that curti be try to induce I to volunteer i make some evasive answer to curti for i do not care to volunteer after my long day 's ride but curti do not let the matter drop say he : i wish bill that you be not so tired by you chase of to-day for you know the country better than the rest of the boy and i be certain that you could go through as far as the ride to fort hay be concern that alone would matter but little to I i say but it be a risky piece of work just now as the country be full of hostile indian still if no other scout be willing to volunteer i will chance it i 'll go provide i be furnish with a good horse i be tire of be chase on a government mule by indian at this captain nolan who have be listen to we conversation say : bill you may have the best horse in my company you can take you choice if you will carry these dispatch although it be against regulation to dismount a enlist man i have no hesitancy in such a case of urgent necessity as this be in tell you that you may have any horse you may wish captain you first sergeant have a splendid horse and that be the one i want if he 'll let I ride that horse i 'll be ready to start in one hour storm or no storm say i good enough bill you shall have the horse but be you sure you can find you way on such a dark night as this i have hunt on nearly every acre of ground between here and fort hay and i can almost keep my route by the bone of the dead buffalo i confidently reply never fear captain about cody not find the way he be as good in the dark as he be in the daylight say curti a orderly be send for the horse and the animal be soon bring up although the sergeant kick a little against let he go after eat a lunch and fill a canteen with brandy i go to headquarters and put my own saddle and bridle on the horse i be to ride i then get the dispatch and by ten o'clock be on the road to fort hay which be sixty-five mile distant across the country the scout have all bid I a hearty good-bye and wish I success not know when if ever they would again gaze upon my warlike form as the poet would say it be dark as pitch but this i rather like as there be little probability of any of the red-skin see I unless i stumble upon they accidentally my greatest danger be that my horse might run into a hole and fall down and in this way get away from I to avoid any such accident i tie one end of my rawhide lariat to the bridle and the other end to my belt i do not propose to be leave on foot alone out on the prairie -lrb- illustration : whoa there -rrb- it be indeed a wise precaution that i have take for within the next three mile the horse sure enough step into a prairie-dog 's hole and down he go throw I clear over he head spring to he foot before i could catch hold of the bridle he gallop away into the darkness but when he reach the full length of the lariat he find that he be picket to bison william i bring he up standing and after find my gun which have drop to the ground i go up to he and in a moment be in the saddle again and go on my way rejoice keep straight on my course until i come to the ravine lead into walnut creek twenty-five mile from fort larn where the country become rougher require I to travel slower and more carefully as i fear the horse might fall over the bank it be difficult to see anything five foot ahead as a good horse be not very apt to jump over a bank if leave to guide himself i let mine pick he own way i be now proceed as quietly as possible for i be in the vicinity of a band of indian who have recently camp in that locality i think that i have pass somewhat above the spot have make a little circuit to the west with that intention but as bad luck would have it this time when i come up near the creek i suddenly ride in among a herd of horse the animal become frightened and run off in every direction i know at once that i be among indian horse and have walk into the wrong pew so without wait to apologize i back out as quickly as possible at this moment a dog not fifty yard away set up a howl and then i hear some indian engage in conversation -- they be guard the horse and have be sleep hearing my horse 's retreat footstep toward the hill and thus become aware that there have be a enemy in they camp they mount they steed and start for I i urge my horse to he full speed take the chance of he fall into hole and guide he up the creek bottom the indian follow I as fast as they could by the noise i make but i soon distance they and then cross the creek when i have travel several mile in a straight course as i suppose i take out my compass and by the light of a match see that i be bear two point to the east of north at once change my course to the direct route i push rapidly on through the darkness towards smoky hill river at about three o'clock in the morning i begin travel more cautiously as i be afraid of run into another band of indian occasionally i scare up a herd of buffalo or antelope or coyote or deer which would frighten my horse for a moment but with the exception of these slight alarm i get along all right after cross smoky hill river i feel comparatively safe as this be the last stream i have to cross ride on to the northward i strike the old santa fe trail ten mile from fort hay just at break of day my horse do not seem much fatigued and be anxious to make good time and get as near the post as possible before it be fairly daylight as there might be band of indian camp along big creek i urge he forward as fast as he could go as i have not lose any indian i be not now anxious to make they acquaintance and shortly after _ reveille _ ride into the post i proceed directly to general sheridan 's headquarters and be meet at the door by colonel moore _ aid-de-camp _ on general sheridan 's staff who ask I on what business i have come i have dispatch for general sheridan and my instruction from captain parker command fort larn be that they shall be deliver to the general as soon as possible say i colonel moore invite I into one of the office and say he would hand the dispatch to t h e general as soon as he get up -lrb- illustration : deliver dispatch to sheridan -rrb- i prefer to give these dispatch to general sheridan myself and at once be my reply the general who be sleep in the same building hear we voice call out send the man in with the dispatch i be usher into the general 's presence and as we have meet before he recognize I and say : hello cody be that you yes sir i have some dispatch here for you from captain parker say i as i hand the package over to he he hurriedly read they and say they be important and then he ask I all about general hazen and where he have go and about the break out of the kiowa and comanch i give he all the information that i possess and relate the event and adventure of the previous day and night bill say he you must have have a pretty lively ride you certainly have a close call when you run into the indian on walnut creek that be a good joke that you play on old satanta i suppose you be pretty tire after you long journey i be rather weary general that be a fact as i have be in the saddle since yesterday morning be my reply but my horse be more tired than i be and need attention full as much if not more i add thereupon the general call a orderly and give instruction to have my animal well take care of and then he say cody come in and have some breakfast with I no thank you general say i hays city be only a mile from here and i prefer ride over there as i know about every one in the town and want to see some of my friend very well do as you please and come to the post afterwards as i want to see you say he bid he good-morning and tell he that i would return in a few hour i ride over to hay city and at the perry house i meet many of my old friend who be of course all glad to see I i take some refreshment and a two hour nap and afterward return to fort hay as i be request as i ride up to the headquarters i notice several scout in a little group evidently engage in conversation on some important matter upon inquiry i learn that general sheridan have inform they that he be desirous of send a dispatch to fort dodge a distance of ninety-five mile the indian have recently kill two or three man while they be carry dispatch between fort hay and fort dodge and on this account none of the scout seem at all anxious to volunteer although a reward of several hundred dollar be offer to any one who would carry the dispatch they have learn of my experience of the previous day and ask I if i do not think it would be a dangerous trip i give it as my opinion that a man might possibly go through without see a indian but that the chance be ten to one that he would have a exceedingly lively run and a hard time before he reach he destination if he ever get there at all leave the scout to decide among themselves as to who be to go i report to general sheridan who also inform I that he wish some one to carry dispatch to fort dodge while we be talk he chief of scout dick parr enter and state that none of the scout have yet volunteer upon hear this i get my brave up a little and say : general if there be no one ready to volunteer i 'll carry you dispatch myself i have not think of ask you to do this duty cody as you be already pretty hard work but it be really important that these dispatch should go through say the general well if you do not get a courier by four o'clock this afternoon i 'll be ready for business at that time all i want be a fresh horse say i meantime i 'll take a little more rest it be not much of a rest however that i get for i go over to hay city again and have a time with the boy i come back to the post at the appoint hour and finding that no one have volunteer i report to general sheridan he have select a excellent horse for I and on hand I the dispatch he say : you can start as soon as you wish -- the sooner the better and good luck go with you my boy in about a hour afterwards i be on the road and just before dark i cross smoky hill river i have not yet urge my horse much as i be save he strength for the latter end of the route and for any run that i might have to make in case the wild-boy should jump I so far i have not see a sign of indian and as evening come on i feel comparatively safe i have no adventure worth relate during the night and just before daylight i find myself approach saw-log cross on the pawnee fork have then ridden about seventy mile a company of color cavalry command by major cox be station at this point and i approach they camp cautiously for fear that the picket might fire upon I -- as the darkey soldier be liable to shoot first and cry halt afterwards when within hear distance i yell out at the top of my voice and be answer by one of the picket i tell he not to shoot as i be a scout from fort hay and then call the sergeant of the guard i go up to the vidette of the post who readily recognize I i enter the camp and proceed to the tent of major cox to whom i hand a letter from general sheridan request he to give I a fresh horse he at once comply with the request after i have sleep a hour and have eat a lunch i again jump into the saddle and before sunrise i be once more on the road it be twenty-five mile to fort dodge and i arrive there between nine and ten o'clock without have see a single indian after deliver the dispatch to the commanding officer i meet johnny austin chief of scout at this post who be a old friend of mine upon he invitation i take a nap at he house and when i awake fresh for business once more he inform I that the indian have be all around the post for the past two or three day run off cattle and horse and occasionally kill a stray man it be a wonder to he that i have meet with none of the red-skin on the way there the indian he say be also very thick on the arkansa river between fort dodge and fort larn and make considerable trouble fort dodge be located sixty-five mile west of fort larn the latter post be on the pawnee fork about five mile from its junction with the arkansa river the commanding officer at fort dodge be anxious to send some dispatch to fort larned but the scout like those at fort hay be rather backward about volunteer as it be consider a very dangerous undertaking to make the trip as fort larn be my post and as i want to go there anyhow i say to austin that i would carry the dispatch and if any of the boy wish to go along i would like to have they for company 's sake austin report my offer to the commanding officer who send for I and say he would be happy to have I take he dispatch if i could stand the trip on top of all that i have already do all i want be a good fresh horse sir say i i be sorry to say that we have not a decent horse here but we have a reliable and honest government mule if that will do you say the officer trot out you mule say i that be good enough for I i be ready at any time sir the mule be forthcoming and at dark i pull out for fort larned and proceed uninterruptedly to coon creek thirty mile out from dodge i have leave the main wagon road some distance to the south and have travel parallel with it think this to be a safer course as the indian might be lie in wait on the main road for dispatch bearer and scout at coon creek i dismounted and lead the mule by the bridle down to the water where i take a drink use my hat for a dipper while i be engage in get the water the mule jerk loose and strike out down the creek i follow he in hope that he would catch he foot in the bridle rein and stop but this he seem to have no idea of do he be make straight for the wagon road and i do not know what minute he might run into a band of indian he finally get on the road but instead of go back toward fort dodge as i naturally expect he would do he turn eastward toward fort larned and keep up a little jog trot just ahead of I but would not let I come up to he although i try it again and again i have my gun in my hand and several time i be strongly tempt to shoot he and would probably have do so have it not be for fear of bring indian down upon I and besides he be carry the saddle for I so i trudge on after the obstinate critter and if there ever be a government mule that deserve and receive a good round cursing it be that one i have neglect the precaution of tie one end of my lariat to he bit and the other to my belt as i have do a few night before and i blame myself for this gross piece of negligence mile after mile i keep on after that mule and every once in a while i indulged in strong language respect the whole mule fraternity from coon creek to fort larn it be thirty-five mile and i finally conclude that my prospects be good for hoof the whole distance we -- that be to say the confound mule and myself -- be make pretty good time there be nothing to hold the mule and i be all the time try to catch he -- which urge he on i make every step count for i want to reach fort larn before daylight in order to avoid if possible the indian to whom it would have be pie to have catch I there on foot the mule stick to the road and keep on for larn and i do the same thing just as day be begin to break we -- that be the mule and myself -- find ourselves on a hill look down into the valley of the pawnee fork in which fort larn be located only four mile away and when the morning gun belch forth we be within half a mile of the post now say i mr mule it be my turn and raise my gun to my shoulder in dead earnest this time i blaze away hit the animal in the hip throw a second cartridge into the gun i let he have another shot and i continue to pour the lead into he until i have he completely lay out like the great majority of government mule he be a tough one to kill and he cling to life with all the tenaciousness of he obstinate nature he be without doubt the toughest and meanest mule i ever see and he die hard the troops hear the report of the gun come rush out to see what be the matter they find that the mule have pass in he chip and when they learn the cause they all agree that i have serve he just right take the saddle and bridle from the dead body i proceed into the post and deliver the dispatch to captain parker i then go over to dick curti ' house which be headquarters for the scout and there put in several hour of solid sleep during the day general hazen return from fort harker and he also have some important dispatch to send to general sheridan i be feel quite elated over my big ride and see that i be get the best of the other scout in regard to make a record i volunteer to carry general hazen 's dispatch to fort hay the general accept my service although he think it be unnecessary for I to kill myself i tell he that i have business at fort hay and wish to go there anyway and it would make no difference to the other scout for none of they appear willing to undertake the trip accordingly that night i leave fort larn on a excellent horse and next morning at daylight find myself once more in general sheridan 's headquarters at fort hay the general be surprise to see I and still more so when i tell he of the time i have make in ride to fort dodge and that i have take dispatch from fort dodge to fort larned and when in addition to this i mention my journey of the night previous general sheridan think my ride from post to post take as a whole be a remarkable one and he say that he do not know of its equal i can safely say that i have never hear of its be beat in a country infested with hostile indian to recapitulate : i have ride from fort larn to fort zarah -lrb- a distance of sixty-five mile -rrb- and back in twelve hour include the time when i be take across the arkansa by the indian in the succeed twelve hour i have go from fort larn to fort hay a distance of sixty-five mile in the next twenty-four hour i have go from fort hay to fort dodge a distance of ninety-five mile the following night i have travel from fort dodge thirty mile on muleback and thirty-five mile on foot to fort larned and the next night sixty-five mile more to fort hay altogether i have ride -lrb- and walk -rrb- 355 mile in fifty-eight ride hour or a average of over six mile a hour of course this may not be regard as very fast ride but take into consideration the fact that it be mostly do in the night and over a wild country with no road to follow and that i have to be continually on the look out for indian it be think at the time to be a big ride as well as a most dangerous one chapter xvii a appointment general sheridan highly compliment I for what i have do and inform I that i need not report back to general hazen as he have more important work for I to do he tell I that the fifth cavalry -- one of the finest regiment in the army -- be on its way to the department of the missourus and that he be go to send it on a expedition against the dog soldier indian who be infest the republican river region cody continue he i have decide to appoint you as guide and chief of scout with the command how do that suit you first-rate general and i thank you for the honor i reply as gracefully as i know how the dog soldier indian be a band of cheyenne and unruly turbulent member of other tribe who would not enter into any treaty or keep a treaty if they make one and who have always refuse to go upon a reservation they be a warlike body of well-built daring and restless brave and be determine to hold possession of the country in the vicinity of the republican and solomon river they be call dog soldier because they be principally cheyenne -- a name derive from the french _ chien _ a dog after my conversation with the general i go over to hay city where i meet some of general forsyth 's scout who have just return from one of the severest battle ever fight with the indian as it will not be out of place in this connection i will here give a brief history of that memorable event -lrb- illustration : general phil sheridan -rrb- the indian have become quite troublesome and general sheridan have select general george a forsyth to go out on a expedition and punish they for they recent depredation there be a scarcity of troops at fort hay at that time so general forsyth recruit a company of frontiersman who could move rapidly as they be to carry no luggage and be to travel without the ordinary transportation thirty of these frontiersman come from fort harker and twenty from fort hay it be certainly a small body of man but nearly every one of they be a experienced hunter guide scout and indian-fighter and they could fight the red-skin in they own way in four day they be prepare to take the field and on the morning of the 29th of August 1868 they ride out of fort hay to meet the indian lieutenant fh beecher of the third infantry nephew of henry ward beecher be second in command brevet major-general whh mccall who have be in the volunteer army act as first sergeant dr john mower of hay city who have be a volunteer army surgeon be the surgeon of the expedition and sharpe grover be the chief guide rest at fort wallace they start September 10th for the town of sheridan thirteen mile distant where a band of indian have attack a train kill two teamster and steal some cattle arrive at sheridan they easily find the indian trail and follow it for some distance on the eighth day out from fort wallace the command go into camp late in the afternoon on the arickaree which be then not more than eight or nine foot wide at that point and only two or three inch deep it be evident to the man that they be not far from the indian and it be decide that the next day they would find they and give they a fight early next morning September 19th the cry of indian startle the command every man jump for he horse a half-dozen red-skin yell and whoop and make a hideous racket and firing they gun ride up and attempt to stampede the horse several of which together with the four pack-mule be so frightened that they break loose and get away the indian then ride off follow by a few shot in a minute afterwards hundred of indian warrior -- it be estimate that there be nearly one thousand -- come gallop down upon the command from every quarter completely hem they in act under the order of general forsyth the man retreat to a small island tie they horse in a circle to the bush and then throw themselves upon the ground they begin the defense by firing at the approach enemy who come pretty close and give they a rake fire the besiege scout at the first opportunity throw up a small breastwork with they knife the firing however continue back and forth and early in the fight forsyth be twice seriously wound -- once in the right thigh and once in the left leg dr mower be also wound in the head and soon die two other man have be kill and several wound all the horse of the command be kill by nine o'clock in the morning shortly afterwards over three hundred dog-soldier indian command by old roman nose charge down upon the little band of hero give they volley after volley but finally the scout at a favorable opportunity return they fire with tell effect roman nose and medicine man be kill and fall from they horse when within less than one rod of the scout who thereupon send up a triumphant shout the charge brave now weaken and in a few moment they be drive back it be a brilliant charge and be most nobly and bravely repulse the scout have again suffer severely have several man wound among the number be lieutenant beecher who die that night the indian too have have quite a number kill several of whom have fall close to the earthwork the dismounted indian warrior still continue firing but as the scout have throw up they intrenchment sufficiently to protect themselves by closely hug the ground little or no damage be do a second charge be make by the mount indian about two o'clock in the afternoon and they be again repulse with a severe loss darkness finally come on and then ensue a cessation of hostility two of the scout have be kill four fatally wound and fourteen other be wound more or less severely there be just twenty-eight able-bodied man leave out of the fifty the supplies have run out and as dr mower have be mortally wound and the medical store capture the wound man could not be properly care for although they be entirely surround and one hundred and ten mile from the nearest post the man do not despair they have a abundance of ammunition plenty of water under ground only a short distance and for food they have they horse and mule at night two of the scout tradeau and stillwell steal through the line of the indian and start swiftly for fort wallace to obtain relief it be a dangerous undertaking but they be brave and experience scout stillwell be only nineteen or twenty year old but he be in every sense of the word a thoroughbred frontiersman during the night the besiege scout throw up they breastwork considerably higher and pile the dead animal on top they dig down to water and also store away a lot of horse and mule meat in the sand to keep it fresh as long as possible the indian renew they firing next morning and keep it up all day do but little injury however as the scout be now well entrenched but many a indian be send to he happy hunting ground -lrb- illustration : battle on the arickaree -rrb- night come again and the prospects be indeed gloomy a attempt be make by two more of the scout to creep through the indian line but they be detect by the enemy and have to return to they comrade the next morning the indian renew hostility as usual they woman and child begin to disappear about noon and then the indian try to draw the scout out by display a white flag for a truce they appear to want to have a talk with general forsyth but as they treachery be well-known the scout do not fall into this trap the indian have apparently become tired of fight especially as they find that they have a most stubborn foe to deal with night once more throw its mantle over the scene and under the cover of the darkness donovan and plyley two of the best scout stealthily make they way out of the camp and start for fort wallace with a dispatch from general forsyth who give a brief summary of the situation and state that if necessary he could hold out for six day longer when the day dawn again only a small number of warrior could be see and they probably remain to watch the scout and keep they corrale the uninjured man attend to the wound as well as they could under the adverse circumstance but from want of proper treatment evidence of gangrene appear in some of the wound on the sixth day the mule and horse meat become totally unfit for use but they have nothing else to eat and have to eat it or starve under these try circumstance the general tell the man that any who wish to go might do so and take they chance but they all resolve to remain and die together if need be relief come at last tradeau and stillwell have safely reach fort wallace and on the morning of the 25th of September colonel carpenter and a detachment of cavalry arrive with supplies this assistance to the besiege and starve scout come like a vessel to ship-wrecked man drift and starve on a raft in mid-ocean it be with the survivor of this terrible fight that i spend the few day at hay city prior to the arrival of the fifth cavalry chapter xviii scout on the third day of October the fifth cavalry arrive at fort hay and i at once begin make the acquaintance of the different officer of the regiment i be introduce by general sheridan to colonel william royal who be in command of the regiment he be a gallant officer and a agreeable and pleasant gentleman he be now station at omaha as inspector general in the department of the platte i also become acquaint with major wh brown major walker captain sweetman quartermaster em hay and in fact all the officer of the regiment general sheridan be anxious to punish the indian who have lately fight general forsyth do not give the regiment much of a rest and accordingly on the 5th of October it begin its march for the beaver creek country the first night we camp on the south fork of big creek four mile west of hay city by this time i have become pretty well acquaint with major brown and captain sweetman who invite I to mess with they on this expedition and a jolly mess we have there be other scout in the command besides myself and i particularly remember tom renahan hank field and a character call nosey on account of he long nose on the morning of the 6th we pull out to the north and during the day i be very favorably strike with the appearance of the regiment it be a beautiful command and when string out on the prairie with a train of seventy-five six-mule wagon ambulance and pack mule i feel very proud of my position as guide and chief of scout of such a warlike expedition just as we be about to go into camp on the saline river that night we run on to a band of about fifteen indian who see we dash across the creek follow by some bullet which we send after they but as the small band prove to be a scout party we pursue they only a mile or two when we attention be direct to a herd of buffalo -- they be very plenty -- and we succeed in kill ten or fifteen for the command the next day we march thirty mile and late in the afternoon we go into camp on the south fork of the solomon at this encampment colonel royal ask I to go out and kill some buffalo for the boy all right colonel send along a wagon or two to bring in the meat i say i be not in the habit of send out my wagon until i know that there be something to be haul in kill you buffalo first and then i 'll send out the wagon be the colonel 's reply i say no more but go out on a hunt and after a short absence return and ask the colonel to send he wagon over the hill for the half dozen buffalo i have kill the follow afternoon he again request I to go out and get some fresh buffalo meat i do not ask he for any wagon this time but ride out some distance and come up with a small herd i manage to get seven of they head straight for the encampment and instead of shoot they just then i run they at full speed right into the camp and then kill they all one after the other in rapid succession colonel royal witness the whole proceeding which puzzle he somewhat as he could see no reason why i have not kill they on the prairie he come up rather angrily and demand a explanation i can not allow any such business as this cody say he what do you mean by it i do not care about ask for any wagon this time colonel so i think i would make the buffalo furnish they own transportation be my reply the colonel see the point in a moment and have no more to say on the subject -lrb- illustration : bring meat into camp -rrb- no indian have be see in the vicinity during the day and colonel royal have carefully post he picket suppose everything be serene for the night but before morning we be rouse from we slumber by hear shot fire and immediately afterwards one of the mount picket come gallop into camp say that there be indian close at hand the company all fall into line and be soon prepared and anxious to give the red-skins battle but as the man be yet new in the indian country a great many of they be considerably excite no indian however make they appearance and upon go to the picket-post where the picket say he have see they none could be find nor could any trace of they be discover the sentinel -- who be a irishman -- insist that there certainly have be red-skin there -lrb- illustration : indian -rrb- but you must be mistake say colonel royal upon I sowl colonel i be not as shure ez I name 's pat maloney one of thim rid divil hit I on the head wid a club so he do say pat and so when morning come the mystery be further investigate and be easily solve elk track be find in the vicinity and it be undoubtedly a herd of elk that have frighten pat as he have turn to run he have go under a limb of a tree against which he hit he head and suppose he have be strike by a club in the hand of a indian it be hard to convince pat however of the truth a three day uninteresting march bring we to beaver creek where we camp and from which point scout party be send out in different direction neither of these party discover indian they all return to camp about the same time find it in a state of great excitement it have be attack a few hour previous by a party of indian who have succeed in kill two man and in make off with sixty horse belong to co h that evening the command start on the trail of these indian horse-thief major brown with two company and three day ration push ahead in advance of the main command be unsuccessful however in overtake the indian and get nearly out of provision -- it be we eighteenth day out the entire command march towards the nearest railroad point and camp on the saline river distant three mile from buffalo tank while wait for supplies we receive a new commanding officer brevet major-general ea carr who be the senior major of the regiment and who rank colonel royal he bring with he the now celebrated forsyth scout who be command by lieutenant pepoon a regular army officer -lrb- illustration : gen ' l ea carr -rrb- it be also while wait in this camp that major brown receive a new lieutenant to fill a vacancy in he company on the day that this officer be to arrive major brown have he private ambulance bring out and invite I to accompany he to the railroad station to meet he lieutenant whose name be ab bache he prove to be a fine gentleman and a brave dash officer on the way to the dépôt major brown have say now cody when we come back we 'll give bache a lively ride and shake he up a little major brown be a jolly good fellow but sometimes he would get a little off and as this be one of he off day he be bind to amuse himself in some original and mischievous way reach the dépôt just as the train come in we easily find the lieutenant and give he the back seat in the ambulance we be soon head for camp pretty soon major brown take the rein from he driver and at once begin whipping the mule after get they into a lively gallop he pull out he revolver and fire several shot the road be terribly rough and the night be so dark that we could hardly see where we be go it be a wonderful piece of luck that we be not tip over and we neck break finally bache say good-humoredly : be this the way you break in all you lieutenant major oh no i do not do this as a regular thing but it be the way we frequently ride in this country say the major just keep you seat mr bache and we 'll take you through on time the major appropriate the reply of the old californium stage driver hank monk to horace greely we be now rattle down a steep hill at full speed and just as we reach the bottom the front wheel strike a deep ditch over which the mule have jump we be all bring up standing by the sudden stoppage of the ambulance major brown and myself be nearly pitch out on the wheel while the lieutenant come fly headlong from the back seat to the front of the vehicle take a back seat lieutenant coolly say major brown major i have just leave that seat say bache we soon lift the wagon out of the ditch and then resume we drive run into camp under full headway and create considerable amusement every one recognize the ambulance and know at once that major brown and i be out on a lark and therefore there be not much say about we exploit halt with a grand flourish in front of he tent major brown jump out in he most gallant style and politely ask he lieutenant in a very pleasant evening be spend there quite a number of the officer call to make the acquaintance of the new officer who entertain the visitor with a amusing account of the ride from the dépôt next morning at a early hour the command start out on a hunt for indian general carr have a pretty good idea where he would be most likely to find they direct I to guide he by the nearest route to elephant rock on beaver creek upon arrive at the south fork of the beaver on the second day 's march we discover a large fresh indian trail which we hurriedly follow for a distance of eight mile when suddenly we see on the bluff ahead of we quite a large number of indian general carr order lieutenant pepoon 's scout and company m to the front this company be command by lieutenant schinosky a frenchman by birth and a reckless dare-devil by nature who be anxious to have a hair-lifting match have advance he company nearly a mile ahead of the main command about four hundred indian suddenly charge down upon he and give he a lively little fight until he be support by we full force the indians keep increase in number all the while until it be estimate that we be fight from eight hundred to one thousand of they the engagement become quite general and several be kill and wound on each side the indian be evidently fight to give they family and village a chance to get away we have undoubtedly surprised they with a larger force than they have expect to see in that part of the country we fight they until dark all the time drive they before we at night they annoy we considerably by firing down into we camp from the higher hill and several time the command be order out to dislodge they from they position and drive they back after have return from one of these little sally major brown captain sweetman lieutenant bache and myself be take supper together when whang come a bullet into lieutenant bache 's plate break a hole through it the bullet come from the gun of one of the indian who have return to the high bluff over-looking we camp major brown declare it be a crack shot because it break the plate we finish we supper without have any more such close call at daylight next morning we strike out on the trail and soon come to the spot where the indian have camp the day before we could see that they village be a very large one consist of about five hundred lodge and we push forward rapidly from this point on the trail which run back toward prairie dog creek about two o'clock we come in sight of the retreat village and soon the warrior turn back to give we battle they set fire to the prairie grass in front of we and on all side in order to delay we as much as possible we keep up a run fight for the remainder of the afternoon and the indian repeatedly attempt to lead we off the track of they fly village but they trail be easily follow as they be continually drop tepee pole camp kettle robe fur and all heavy article belong to they they be evidently scatter and it finally become difficult for we to keep on the main trail when darkness set in we go into camp it be useless to try to follow the indian after nightfall next morning we be again on the trail which lead north and back towards the beaver creek which stream it cross within a few mile of the spot where we have first discover the indian they have make nearly a complete circle in hope of mislead we late in the afternoon we again see they go over a hill far ahead of we and towards evening the main body of warrior come back and fight we once more but we continue to drive they until darkness set in when we camp for the night the indian soon scatter in every direction but we follow the main trail to the republican river where we make a cut-off and then go north towards the platte river we find however that the indian by travel night and day have get a long start and the general conclude that it be useless to follow they any further as we have push they so hard and give they such a scare that they would leave the republican country and go north across the union pacific railroad most of the indian as he have predict do cross the platte river near ogallalum on the union pacific and thence continue northward that night we return to the republican river and camp in a grove of cottonwood which i name carr 's grove in honor of the commanding officer the general tell I that the next day 's march would be towards the head-water of the beaver and he ask I the distance i reply that it be about twenty-five mile and he say we would make it the next day get a early start in the morning we strike out across the prairie my position as guide be ahead of the advance guard about two o'clock general carr overtake I and ask how far i suppose it be to water i think it be about eight mile although we could see no sign or indication of any stream in we front pepoon 's scout say that you be go in the wrong direction say the general and in the way you be bear it will be fifteen mile before you can strike any of the branch of the beaver and that when you do you will find no water for the beaver be dry at this time of the year at that point general i think the scout be mistake say i for the beaver have more water near its head than it have below and at the place where we will strike the stream we will find immense beaver dam large enough and strong enough to cross the whole command if you wish well cody go ahead say he i 'll leave it to you but remember that i do not want a dry camp no danger of that say i and then i ride on leave he to return to the command as i have predict we find water seven or eight mile further on where we come upon a beautiful little stream -- a tributary of the beaver -- hide in the hill we have no difficulty in select a good halt place and obtain fresh spring water and excellent grass the general upon learn from I that the stream -- which be only eight or nine mile long -- have no name take out he map and located it and name it cody 's creek which name it still bear we pull out early next morning for the beaver and when we be approach the stream i ride on ahead of the advance guard in order to find a cross just as i turn a bend of the creek bang go a shot and down go my horse -- myself with he i disentangled myself and jump behind the dead body look in the direction whence the shot have come i see two indian and at once turn my gun loose on they but in the excitement of the moment i miss my aim they fire two or three more shot and i return the compliment wound one of they horse on the opposite side of the creek go over the hill i observe a few lodge move rapidly away and also some mount warrior who could see I and who keep blaze away with they gun the two indian who have fire at I and have kill my horse be retreat across the creek on a beaver dam i send a few shot after they to accelerate they speed and also fire at the one on the other side of the stream i be undecided as to whether it be best to run back to the command on foot or hold my position i know that within a few minute the troops would come up and if they hear the firing they would come rapidly the indian see that i be alone turn and charge down the hill and be about to re-cross the creek to corral I when the advance guard of the command put in a appearance on the ridge and dash forward to my rescue the red-skin whirl and make off when general carr come up he order company i to go in pursuit of the band i accompany lieutenant brady who command and we have a run fight with the indian last several hour we capture several head of they horse and most of they lodge at night we return to the command which by this time have cross the creek on the beaver dam we scout for several day along the river and have two or three lively skirmish finally we supplies begin to run low and general carr give order to return to fort wallace which we reach three day afterwards and where we remain several day while the regiment be wait here for order i spend most of the time in hunting buffalo and one day while i be out with a small party we be jump by about fifty indian we have a severe fight of at least a hour when we succeed in drive the enemy they lose four of they warrior and probably conclude that we be a hard crowd i have some excellent marksman with I and they do some fine work send the bullet thick and fast where they would do the most good two or three of we horse have be hit and one man have be wound we be ready and willing to stay with the red-skin as long as they wish -- but they finally give it up however as a bad job and ride off we finish we hunt and go back to the post load down with plenty of buffalo meat and receive the compliment of the general for we little fight -lrb- illustration : a hard crowd -rrb- chapter xix a tough time general carr soon receive order from general sheridan that he be to make a winter 's campaign in the canadian river country and that we be to proceed to fort lyon on the arkansa river in colorado and there fit out for the expedition leave fort wallace in November 1868 we arrive at fort lyon in the latter part of the month and outfit for the come expedition general penrose have leave this post three week previously with a command of some three hundred man he have take no wagon with he and he supply train be compose only of pack mule general carr be order to follow with supplies on he trail and overtake he as soon as possible i be particularly anxious to catch up with penrose 's command as my old friend wild bill be among he scout we follow the trail very easily for the first three day and then we be catch in freeze-out canyon by a fearful snow storm which compel we to go into camp for a day the ground now be cover with snow we find that it would be almost impossible to follow penrose 's trail any further especially as he have leave no sign to indicate the direction he be go general carr send for I and say that as it be very important that we should not lose the trail he wish that i would take some scout with I and while the command remain in camp push on as far as possible and see if i could not discover some trace of penrose or where he have camp at any time -lrb- illustration : camping in the snow -rrb- accompany by four man i start out in the blinding snow storm take a southerly direction we ride twenty-four mile and upon reach a tributary of the cimarron we scout up and down the stream for a few mile and finally find one of penrose 's old camp it be now late in the afternoon and as the command would come up the next day it be not necessary for all of we to return with the information to general carr so ride down into a sheltered place in a bend of the creek we build a fire and broil some venison from a deer which we have shoot during the day and after eat a substantial meal i leave the four man there while i return to bring up the troops it be eleven o'clock at night when i get back to the camp a light be still burn in the general 's tent he have remain awake anxiously await my return he be glad to see I and be overjoy at the information i bring for he have great fear concern the safety of general penrose he rouse up he cook and order he to get I a good hot supper all of which i greatly appreciate i pass the night in the general 's tent and next morning rise refresh and prepare for a big day 's work the command take up its march next day for the cimarron and have a hard tramp of it on account of the snow have drift to a great depth in many of the ravine and in some place the teamster have to shovel they way through we arrive at the cimarron at sundown and go into a nice warm camp upon look around next morning we find that penrose have be unencumbered by wagon have keep on the west side of the cimarron and the country be so rough that it be impossible for we to stay on he trail with we wagon but know that he would certainly follow down the river general carr conclude to take the best wagon route along the stream which i discover to be on the east side before we could make any headway with we wagon train we have to leave the river and get out on the divide we be very fortunate that day in find a splendid road for some distance until we be all at once bring up standing on a high table-land overlook a beautiful wind creek that lay far below we in the valley the question that trouble we be how we be to get the wagon down we be now in the foot-hill of the rattoon mountain and the bluff we be on be very steep cody we be in a nice fix now say general carr oh that be nothing be my reply but you can never take the train down say he never you mind the train general you say you be look for a good camp how do that beautiful spot down in the valley suit you i ask he that will do i can easily descend with the cavalry but how to get the wagon down there be a puzzler to I say he by the time you have located you camp you wagon shall be there say i all right cody i 'll leave it to you as you seem to want to be boss reply he pleasantly he at once order the command to dismount and lead the horse down the mountain-side the wagon train be a mile in the rear and when it come up one of the driver ask : how be we go down there run down slide down or fall down -- any way to get down say i we never can do it it be too steep the wagon will run over the mule say another wagon-master i guess not the mule have get to keep out of the way be my reply tell wilson the chief wagon-master to bring on he mess-wagon which be at the head of the train i say i would try the experiment at least wilson drive the team and wagon to the brink of the hill and follow my direction he bring out some extra chain with which we lock both wheel on each side and then rough-lock they we then start the wagon down the hill the wheel-horse -- or rather the wheel-mule -- be good on the hold-back and we get along finely until we nearly reach the bottom when the wagon crowd the mule so hard that they start on a run and gallop down into the valley and to the place where general carr have located he camp three other wagon immediately follow in the same way and in half a hour every wagon be in camp without the least accident have occur it be indeed a exciting sight to see the six-mule team come straight down the mountain and finally break into a full run at time it look as if the wagon would turn a somersault and land on the mule this prove to be a lucky march for we as far as gain on penrose be concern for the route he have take on the west side of the stream turn out to be a bad one and we go with we immense wagon train as far in one day as penrose have in seven he command have march on to a plateau or high table-land so steep that not even a pack mule could descend it and he be oblige to retrace he step a long way thus lose three day time as we afterwards learn while in this camp we have a lively turkey hunt the tree along the bank of the stream be literally alive with wild turkey and after unsaddle the horse between two and three hundred soldier surround a grove of timber and have a grand turkey round-up kill four or five hundred of the bird with gun club and stone of course we have turkey in every style after this hunt -- roast turkey boil turkey fry turkey turkey on toast and so on and we appropriately call this place camp turkey from this point on for several day we have no trouble in follow penrose 's trail which lead we in a southeasterly direction towards the canadian river no indian be see nor any sign of they find one day while ride in advance of the command down san francisco creek i hear some one call my name from a little bunch of willow brush on the opposite bank and upon look closely at the spot i see a negro sake alive massa bill be dat you ask the man whom i recognize as one of the color soldier of the tenth cavalry i next hear he say to some one in the brush : come out o ' heah dar 's massa buffalo bill then he sing out massa bill be you get any hawd tack nary a hard tack but the wagon will be along presently and then you can get all you want say i dat 's de best news i ` se heerd foah sixteen long day massa bill say he where 's you command where 's general penrose i ask i dunno say the darkey we get lose and we be be a starvin ' eber since by this time two other negro have emerge from they place of concealment they have desert penrose 's command -- which be out of ration and nearly in a starve condition -- and be try to make they way back to fort lyon general carr conclude from what they could tell he that general penrose be somewhere on polladora creek but we could not learn anything definite from the starve moke for they know not where they be themselves have learn that general penrose 's troops be in such bad shape general carr order major brown to start out the next morning with two company of cavalry and fifty pack-mule load with provision and to make all possible speed to reach and relieve the suffering soldier i accompany this detachment and on the third day out we find the half-famished soldier camp on the polladora the camp present a pitiful sight indeed for over two week the man have have only quarter ration and be now nearly starve to death over two hundred horse and mule be lie dead have die from fatigue and starvation general penrose have fear that general carr would not find he have send back a company of the seventh cavalry to fort lyon for supplies but no word as yet have be hear from they the ration which major brown bring to the command come none too soon and be the means of save many a life -lrb- illustration : a welcome visitor -rrb- about the first man i see after reach the camp be my old true and try friend wild bill that night we have a jolly reunion around the camp-fire general carr upon arrive with he force take command of all the troops he be the senior officer and ranking general penrose after select a good camp he unloaded the wagon and send they back to fort lyon for fresh supplies he then pick out five hundred of the best man and horse and take he pack-train with he he start south for the canadian river distant about forty mile leave the rest of the troops at the supply camp i be order to accompany this expedition we strike the south fork of the canadian river or rio colorado at a point a few mile above the old _ adobe _ wall which at one time have compose a fort and be the place where kit carson once have a big indian fight we be now within twelve mile of a new supply dépôt call camp evan which have be establish for the third cavalry and evan 's expedition from new mexico the scout who have bring in this information also report that they expect the arrival at camp evan of a bull-train from new mexico with a large quantity of beer for the soldier this news be pie for wild bill and myself and we determine to lie low for that beer outfit that very evening it come along and the beer that be destine for the soldier at camp evan never reach its destination it go straight down the thirsty throat of general carr 's command it appear that the mexican live near fort union have manufacture the beer and be take it through to camp evan to sell to the troops but it strike a lively market without go so far it be sell to we boy in pint cup and as the weather be very cold we warm the beer by put the end of we picket-pin heat red-hot into the cup the result be one of the biggest beer jollification i ever have the misfortune to attend one evening general carr summon I to he tent and say he wish to send some scout with dispatch to camp supply which be to be forward from there to sheridan he order I to call the scout together at once at he headquarters and select the man who be to go i ask he if i should not go myself but he reply that he wish I to remain with the command as he could not spare I the distance to camp supply be about two hundred mile and owe to the very cold weather it be anything but a pleasant trip consequently none of the scout be anxious to undertake it it be finally settle however that wild bill a half-breed call little geary and three other scout should carry the dispatch and they accordingly take they departure next day with instruction to return to the command as soon as possible for several day we scout along the canadian river but find no sign of indian general carr then go back to he camp and soon afterwards we wagon train come in from fort lyon with a fresh load of provision we animal be in poor condition we remain in different camp along san francisco creek and the north fork of the canadian until wild bill and he scout return from camp supply among the scout of penrose 's command be fifteen mexican and between they and the american scout there have exist a feud when general carr take command of the expedition -- unite it with he own -- and i be make chief of all the scout this feud grow more intense and the mexican often threaten to clean we out but they postpone the undertaking from time to time until one day while we be all at the sutler 's store the long-expected fight take place and result in the mexican get severely beaten general carr upon hearing of the row send for wild bill and myself he have conclude from the various statement which have be make to he that we be the instigator of the affair but after listen to what we have to say he think that the mexican be as much to blame as we be it be not to be deny that wild bill and myself have be partake too freely of tanglefoot that evening and general carr say to I : cody there be plenty of antelope in the country and you can do some hunting for the camp while we stay here all right general i 'll do it after that i put in my time hunting and with splendid success killing from fifteen to twenty antelope a day which keep the man well supply with fresh meat at length we horse and mule have become sufficiently recruit to travel we return to fort lyon arrive there in march 1869 where the command be to rest and recruit for thirty day before proceed to the department of the platte whither it have be order chapter xx a exciting chase general carr at my request kindly grant I one month 's leave of absence to visit my family in st loui and order captain hay we quartermaster to let I ride my mule and horse to sheridan distant 140 mile where i be to take the car i be instruct to leave the animal in the quartermaster 's corral at fort wallace until i should come back but instead of do this i put they both in the care of my old friend perry the hotel-keeper at sheridan after a twenty day absence in st loui pleasantly spend with my family i return to sheridan and there learn that my mule and horse have be seize by the government it seem that the quartermaster 's agent at sheridan have report to general bankhead command fort wallace and to captain laufer the quartermaster that i have leave the country and have sell a government horse and mule to mr perry and of course captain laufer take possession of the animal and threaten to have perry arrest for buy government property perry explain to he the fact in the case and say that i would return in a few day but the captain would pay no attention to he statement i immediately go over to the office of the quartermaster 's agent and have perry point he out to I i at once lay hold of he and in a short time have treat he to just such a thrashing as he contemptible lie deserve he then mount a horse ride to fort wallace and report I to general bankhead and captain laufer and obtain a guard to return with and protect he the next morning i secure a horse from perry and proceed to fort wallace demand my horse and mule from general bankhead on the ground that they be quartermaster hay ' property and belong to general carr 's command and that i have obtain permission to ride they to sheridan and back general bankhead in a gruff manner order I out of he office and off the reservation say that if i do not take a hurry departure he would have I forcibly put out i tell he to do it and be hang i might have use a stronger expression and upon second thought i believe i do i next interview captain laufer and demand of he also the horse and mule as i be responsible for they to quartermaster hay captain laufer intimate that i be a liar and that i have dispose of the animal hot word ensue between we and he too order I to leave the post i reply that general bankhead have command I to do the same thing but that i have not yet go and that i do not propose to obey any order of a inferior officer see that it be of no use to make any further effort to get possession of the animal i ride back to sheridan and just as i reach there i meet the quartermaster 's agent come out from supper with he head tie up it occur to I that he have not receive more than one half the punishment justly due he and that now would be a good time to give he the balance -- so i carry the idea into immediate execution after finish the job in good style i inform he that he could not stay in that town while i remain there and convinced he that sheridan be not large enough to hold we both at the same time he accordingly leave the place and again go to fort wallace this time report to general bankhead that i have drive he away and have threaten to kill he that night while sleep at the perry house i be awaken by a tap on the shoulder and upon look up i be considerably surprise to see the room fill with armed negro who have they gun all point at I the first word i hear come from the sergeant who say : now look a-heah massa bill ef you make a move we 'll blow you off de farm shuah just then captain ezekiel enter and order the soldier to stand back captain what do this mean i ask i be sorry bill but i have be order by general bankhead to arrest you and bring you to fort wallace say he that be all right say i but you could have make the arrest alone without have bring the whole thirty-eighth infantry with you i know that bill reply the captain but as you have not be in very good humor for the last day or two i do not know how you would act i hastily dress and accompany captain ezekiel to fort wallace arrive there at two o'clock in the morning bill i be really sorry say captain ezekiel as we alight but i have order to place you in the guard-house and i must perform my duty very well captain i do not blame you a bit say i and into the guard-house i go as a prisoner for the first and only time in my life the sergeant of the -- guard who be a old friend of mine belong to captain graham 's company which be station there at the time -- do not put I into a cell but kindly allow I to stay in he room and occupy he bed and in a few minute i be snore away as if nothing unusual have occur shortly after _ reveille _ captain graham call to see I he think it be a shame for I to be in the guard-house and say that he would interview general bankhead in my behalf as soon as he get up the captain have a nice breakfast prepare for I and then depart at guard-mount i be not send for contrary to my expectation and thereupon i have word convey to captain graham who be officer of the day that i want to see general bankhead the captain inform I that the general absolutely refuse to hold any conversation whatever with I at this time there be no telegraph line between fort wallace and fort lyon and therefore it be impossible for I to telegraph to general carr and i determine to send a dispatch direct to general sheridan i accordingly write out a long telegram inform he of my difficulty and have it take to the telegraph office for transmission but the operator instead of send it at once as he should have do show it to general bankhead who tear it up and instruct the operator not to pay any attention to what i might say as he be run that post think it very strange that i receive no answer during the day i go to the telegraph office accompany by a guard and learn from the operator what he have do see here my young friend say i this be a public telegraph line and i want my telegram send or there 'll be trouble i re-wrote my dispatch and hand it to he accompany with the money to pay for the transmission say as i do so : young man i wish that telegram send direct to chicago you know it be you duty to send it and it must go he know very well that he be compel to transmit the message but before do so he call on general bankhead and inform he of what i have say and tell he that he would certainly have to send it for if he do not he might lose he position the general see that the telegram would have to go summon I to he headquarters and the first thing he say after i get into he presence be : if i let you go sir will you leave the post at once and not bother my agent at sheridan again no sir i reply i 'll do nothing of the kind i 'll remain in the guard-house until i receive a answer from general sheridan if i give you the horse and mule will you proceed at once to fort lyon no sir i have some bill to settle at sheridan and some other business to transact reply i well sir will you at least agree not to interfere any further with the quartermaster 's agent at sheridan i shall not bother he any more sir as i have have all i want from he be my answer general bankhead thereupon send for captain laufer and order he to turn the horse and mule over to I in a few minute more i be on my way to sheridan and after settle my business there i proceed to fort lyon arrive two day afterwards i related my adventure to general carr major brown and other officer who be greatly amuse thereby i be glad you have come bill say general carr as i have be want you for the last two week while we have be at this post several valuable animal as well as a large number of government horse and mule have be steal and we think that the thief be still in the vicinity of the fort but as yet we have be unable to discover they rendezvous i have have a party out for the last few day in the neighborhood of old fort lyon and they have find fresh track down there and seem to think that the stock be conceal somewhere in the timber along the arkansa river bill green one of the scout who have just come up from there can perhaps tell you something more about the matter green who have be summon say that he have discover fresh trail before strike the heavy timber opposite old fort lyon but that in the tall grass he could not follow they he have mark the place where he have last see fresh mule track so that he could find it again now cody you be just the person we want say the general very well i 'll get a fresh mount and to-morrow i 'll go down and see what i can discover say i you have better take two man besides green and a pack mule with eight or ten day ' ration suggest the general so that if you find the trail you can follow it up as i be very anxious to get back this steal property the scoundrel have take one of my private horse and also lieutenant forbush 's favorite little black race mule next morning i start out after the horse-thief be accompany by green jack farley and another scout the mule track mark by green be easily find and with very little difficulty i follow it for about two mile into the timber and come upon a place where as i could plainly see from numerous sign quite a number of head of stock have be tie among the tree and keep for several day this be evidently the spot where the thief have be hide they steal stock until they have accumulate quite a herd from this point it be difficult to trail they as they have take the steal animal out of the timber one by one and in different direction thus show that they be expert at the business and experience frontiersman for no indian could have exhibit more cunning in cover up a trail than do they i abandon the idea of follow they trail in this immediate locality so call my man together i tell they that we would ride out for about five mile and make a complete circuit about the place and in this way we would certainly find the trail on which they have move out while make the circuit we discover the track of twelve animal -- four mule and eight horse -- in the edge of some sand-hill and from this point we have no trouble in trail they down the arkansa river which they have cross at sand creek and then have go up the latter stream in the direction of denver to which place they be undoubtedly bind when near denver they trail become so obscure that we at last lose it but by inquire of the settler along the road which they have take we occasionally hear of they when within four mile of denver -- this be on a Thursday -- we learn that the horse-thief have pass there two day before i come to the conclusion they would attempt to dispose of the animal in denver and be aware that Saturday be the great auction day there i think it best to remain where we be at a hotel and not go into the city until that day it certainly would not have be advisable for I to have go into denver meantime -- because i be well-known there and if the thief have learn of my presence in the city they would at once have suspect my business early Saturday morning we ride into town and stable we horse at the elephant corral i secure a room from ed chase overlook the corral and then take up my post of observation i do not have long to wait for a man whom i readily recognize as one of we old packer ride into the corral mount upon lieutenant forbush 's racing mule and lead another government mule which i also identify it have be recently brand and over the we be a plain db i wait for the man 's companion to put in a appearance but he do not come and my conclusion be that he be secrete outside of the city with the rest of the animal presently the black mule belong to forbush be put up at auction now think i be the time to do my work so walk through the crowd who be bidding for the mule i approach the man who have offer he for sale he recognize I and endeavor to escape but i seize he by the shoulder say : i guess my friend that you 'll have to go with I if you make any resistance i 'll shoot you on the spot he be arm with a pair of pistol which i take away from he then inform the auctioneer that i be a united state detective and show he -- as well as a inquisitive officer -- my commission as such i tell he to stop the sale as the mule be steal property and that i have arrest the thief whose name be williams farley and green who be near at hand now come forward and together we take the prisoner and the mule three mile down the platte river there in a thick bunch of timber we all dismount and make preparation to hang william from a limb if he do not tell we where he partner be at first he deny know anything about any partner or any other stock but when he see that we be in earnest and would hang he at the end of the give time -- five minute -- unless he squeal he tell we that he pal be at a unoccupied house three mile further down the river we immediately proceed to the spot indicate and as we come within sight of the house we see we stock grazing near by just as we ride up to the door another one of we old packer whom i recognize as bill bevin step to the front and i cover he instantly with my rifle before he could draw he revolver i order he to throw up he hand and he obey the command green then disarm he and bring he out we look through the house and find they saddle pack-saddle blanket overcoat lariat and two henry rifle which we take possession of the horse and mule we tie in a bunch and with the whole outfit we return to denver where we lodge william and bevin in jail in charge of my friend sheriff edward cook the next day we take they out and tie each one on a mule we strike out on we return trip to fort lyon at the hotel outside the city where we have stop on Thursday and Friday we be join by we man with the pack-mule that night we camp on cherry creek seventeen mile from denver the weather -- it be in April -- be cold and stormy but we find a warm and cosy camping place in a bend of the creek we make we bed in a row with we foot towards the fire the prisoner so far have appear very docile and have make no attempt to escape and therefore i do not think it necessary to hobble they we make they sleep on the inside and it be so arrange that some one of we should be on guard all the time at about one o'clock in the night it begin snow while i be watch shortly before three o'clock jack farley who be then on guard and sit on the foot of the bed with he back to the prisoner be kick clear into the fire by william and the next moment bevin who have get hold of he shoe -- which i have think be out of he reach -- spring up and jump over the fire and start on a run i send a shot after he as soon as i awake sufficiently to comprehend what be take place william attempt to follow he and as he do so i whirl around and knock he down with my revolver farley by this time have gather himself out of the fire and green have start after bevin firing at he on the run but the prisoner make he escape into the brush in he flight unfortunately for he and luckily for we he drop one of he shoe leave william in the charge of farley and long doc as we call the man with the pack-mule green and myself strike out after bevin as fast as possible we hear he break through the brush but know that it would be useless to follow he on foot we go back to the camp and saddle up two of the fastest horse and at daylight we strike out on he trail which be plainly visible in the snow he have get a hour and a half the start of we he track lead we in the direction of the mountain and the south platte river and as the country through which he be pass be cover with prickly pear we know that he could not escape step on they with he one bare foot and hence we be likely to overtake he in a short time we could see however from the long jump that he be take that he be make excellent time but we frequently notice after we have go some distance that the prickly pear and stone along he route be cut he bare foot as nearly every track of it be spot with blood we have run we horse some twelve mile when we see bevin cross a ridge about two mile ahead urge we horse up to they utmost speed we reach the ridge just as he be descend the divide towards the south platte which stream be very deep and swift at this point it become evident that if he should cross it ahead of we he would have a good chance of make he escape so push we steed as fast as possible we rapidly gain on he and when within a hundred yard of he i cry to he to halt or i would shoot know i be a good shot he stop and coolly sit down wait till we come up bevin you have give we a good run say i yes say he and if i have have fifteen minute more of a start and get across the platte i would have laugh at the idea of you ever catch I bevin 's run be the most remarkable feat of the kind ever know either of a white man or a indian a man who could run bare-footed in the snow eighteen mile through a prickly pear patch be certainly a tough one and that be the kind of a person bill bevin be upon look at he bleed foot i really feel sorry for he he ask I for my knife and i give he my sharp-pointed bowie with which he dig the prickly pear briar out of he foot i consider he as game a man as i have ever meet bevin i have get to take you back say i but as you can not walk with that foot you can ride my horse and i 'll foot it we accordingly start back for we camp with bevin on my horse which be lead either by green or myself as we alternately ride the other horse we keep a close watch on bevin for we have ample proof that he need watch he wounded foot must have pained he terribly but not a word of complaint escape he on arrive at the camp we find william bind as we have leave he and he seem sorry that we have capture bevin -lrb- illustration : the recapture of bevin -rrb- after breakfast we resume we journey and nothing worth of note again occur until we reach the arkansa river where we find a vacant cabin and at once take possession of it for the night there be no likelihood of bevin again try to escape for he foot have swollen to a enormous size and be useless believe that william could not escape from the cabin we unbound he we then go to sleep leave long doc on guard the cabin be comfortably warm and well light by the fire it be a dark stormy night -- so dark that you could hardly see you hand before you at about ten o'clock williams ask long doc to allow he to step to the door for a moment long doc who have he revolver in he hand do not think it necessary to wake we up and believe that he could take care of the prisoner he grant he request william thereupon walk to the outer edge of the door while long doc revolver in hand be watch he from the inside suddenly william make a spring to the right and before doc could even raise he revolver he have dodge around the house doc jump after he and fire just as he turn a corner the report bring we all to we foot and in a instant we know what have happen i at once cover bevin with my revolver but as i see that he could hardly stir and be make no demonstration i lower the weapon just then doc come in swearing a blue streak and announce that william have escape there be nothing for we to do except to gather we horse close to the cabin and stand guard over they for the rest of the night to prevent the possibility of william sneak up and steal one of they that be the last i ever see or hear of william we finally get back to fort lyon with bevin and general carr to whom i immediately report compliment we highly on the success of we trip notwithstanding we have lose one prisoner the next day we take bevin to bogg ' ranch on picket wire creek and there turn he over to the civil authority who put he in a log jail to await he trial he never be try however for he soon make he escape as i expect he would do i hear no more of he until 1872 when i learn that he be skirmish around on laramie plain at he old trick he send word by the gentleman from whom i gain this information that if he ever meet I again he would kill I on sight he finally be arrest and convict for robbery and be confine in the prison at laramie city again he make he escape and soon afterwards he organize a desperate gang of outlaw who infested the country north of the union pacific railroad and when the stage begin to run between cheyenne and deadwood in the black hill they rob the coach and passenger frequently make large haul of plunder they keep this up for some time till finally most of the gang be catch try convict and send to the penitentiary for a number of year bill bevin and nearly all of he gang be now confine in the nebraska state prison to which they be transfer from wyome -lrb- illustration : rob a stage coach -rrb- chapter xxi a military expedition a day or two after my return to fort lyon the fifth cavalry be order to the department of the platte and take up they line of march for fort mcpherson nebraska we lay over one day at fort wallace to get supplies and while there i have occasion to pass general bankhead 's headquarters he orderly call to I and say the general wish to see I as i enter the general 's office he extend he hand and say : i hope you have no hard feeling toward I cody for have you arrest when you be here i have just have a talk with general carr and quartermaster hay and they inform I that you have they permission to ride the horse and mule and if you have state this fact to I there would have be no trouble about the matter whatever that be all right general say i i will think no more of it but i do not believe that you quartermaster 's agent will ever again circulate false story about I no say the general he have not yet recover from the beating that you give he from fort wallace we move down to sheridan where the command halted for we to lay in a supply of forage which be store there i be still mess with major brown with whom i go into the village to purchase a supply of provision for we mess but unfortunately we be in too jolly a mood to fool away money on grub we buy several article however and put they into the ambulance and send they back to the camp with we cook the major and myself do not return until _ reveille _ next morning soon afterwards the general sound boot and saddle and presently the regiment be on its way to mcpherson it be very late before we go into camp that night and we be tired and hungry just as major brown be have he tent put up he cook come to we and ask where the provision be that we have buy the day before why do we not give they to you -- do you not bring they to camp in the ambulance ask major brown no sir it be only a five-gallon demijohn of whiskey a five-gallon demijohn of brandy and two case of old tom-cat gin say the cook the mischief i exclaimed do not we spend any money on grub at all no sir reply the cook well that will do for the present say major brown it seem that we mind have evidently be run on a different subject than provision while we be loitering in sheridan and we find ourselves with a two hundred and fifty mile march ahead of we without anything more invite than ordinary army ration at this juncture captain denny come up and the major apologize for not be able to invite he to take supper with we but we do the next best thing and ask he to take a drink he remark that that be what he be look for and when he learn of we be out of commissary supplies and that we have buy nothing except whiskey brandy and gin he say joyously : boy as we have a abundance you can eat with we and we will drink with you it be a satisfactory arrangement and from that time forward we trade we liquid for they solid when the rest of the officer hear of what brown and i have do they all send we invitation to dine with they at any time we return the compliment by invite they to drink with we whenever they be dry although i would not advise anybody to follow we example yet it be a fact that we get more provision for we whiskey than the same money which we pay for the liquor would have buy so after all it prove a very profitable investment on reach the north fork of the beaver and ride down the valley towards the stream i suddenly discover a large fresh indian trail on examination i find it to be scatter all over the valley on both side of the creek as if a very large village have recently pass down that way judge from the size of the trail i think there could not be less than four hundred lodge or between twenty-five hundred and three thousand warrior woman and child in the band i galloped hack to the command distant about three mile and report the news to general carr who halt the regiment and after consult a few minute order I to select a ravine or as low ground as possible so that he could keep the troops out of sight until we could strike the creek we go into camp on the beaver and the general order lieutenant ward to take twelve man and myself and follow up the trail for several mile and find out how fast the indian be travel i be soon convince by the many camp they have make that they be travel slowly and hunting as they journey we go down the beaver on this scout about twelve mile keep we horse well conceal under the bank of the creek so as not to be discover at this point lieutenant ward and myself leave we horse behind we crawl to the top of a high knoll where we could have a good view for some mile distant down the stream we peep over the summit of the hill and not over three mile away we could see a whole indian village in plain sight and thousand of pony grazing around on the prairie look over to we leave on the opposite side of the creek we observe two or three party of indian come in load down with buffalo meat this be no place for we lieutenant say i i think we have important business at the camp to attend to as soon as possible i agree with you say he and the quicker we get there the better it will be for we we quickly descend the hill and join the man below lieutenant ward hurriedly write a note to general carr and hand it to a corporal order he to make all possible haste back to the command and deliver the message the man start off on a gallop and lieutenant ward say : we will march slowly back until we meet the troops as i think the general will soon be here for he will start immediately upon receive my note in a few minute we hear two or three shot in the direction in which we dispatch courier have go and soon after we see he come fly around the bend of the creek pursue by four or five indian the lieutenant with he squad of soldier and myself at once charge upon they when they turn and run across the stream this will not do say lieutenant ward the whole indian village will now know that soldier be near by lieutenant give I that note and i will take it to the general say i he gladly hand I the dispatch and spur my horse i dash up the creek after have ride a short distance i observe another party of indian also go to the village with meat but instead of wait for they to fire upon I i give they a shot at long range see one man firing at they so boldly it surprise they and they do not know what to make of it while they be thus consider i get between they and we camp by this time they have recover from they surprise and cut they buffalo meat loose from they horse they come after I at the top of they speed but as they steed be tire out it do not take I long to leave they far in the rear i reach the command in less than a hour deliver the dispatch to general carr and inform he of what i have see he instantly have the bugler sound boot and saddle and all the troops -- with the exception of two company which we leave to guard the train -- be soon gallop in the direction of the indian camp we have ride about three mile when we meet lieutenant ward who be come slowly towards we he report that he have run into a party of indian buffalo-hunter and have kill one of the number and have have one of he horse wound we immediately push forward and after march about five mile come within sight of hundred of mount indian advance up the creek to meet we they form a complete line in front of we general carr be desirous of strike they village order the troops to charge break through they line and keep straight on this movement would no doubt have be successfully accomplish have it not be for the rattle-brained and dare-devil french lieutenant schinosky command company b who misunderstand general carr 's order charge upon some indian at the leave while the rest of the command dash through the enemy 's line and be keep straight on when it be observe that schinosky and he company be surround by four or five hundred red-skin the general to save the company be oblige to sound a halt and charge back to the rescue the company during this short fight have several man and quite a number of horse kill all this take up valuable time and night be come on the indian be fight desperately to keep we from reach they village which be inform by courier of what be take place be pack up and get away during that afternoon it be all we could do to hold we own in fight the mount warrior who be in we front and contest every inch of the ground the general have leave word for we wagon train to follow up with its escort of two company but as it have not make its appearance he entertain some fear that it have be surround and to prevent the possible loss of the supply train we have to go back and look for it about 9 o'clock that evening we find it and go into camp for the night next morning we pass down the creek and there be not a indian to be see they have all disappear and go on with they village two mile further on we come to where a village have be located and here we find nearly everything belong or pertain to a indian camp which have be leave in the great hurry to get away these article be all gather up and burn we then push out on the trail as fast as possible it lead we to the northeast towards the republican but as the indian have a night the start of we we entertain but little hope of overtake they that day upon reach the republican in the afternoon the general call a halt and as the trail be run more to the east he conclude to send he wagon train on to fort mcpherson by the most direct route while he would follow on the trail of the red-skin next morning at daylight we again pull out and be evidently gain rapidly on the indian for we could occasionally see they in the distance about 11 o'clock that day while major babcock be ahead of the main command with he company and while we be cross a deep ravine we be surprise by about three hundred warrior who commence a lively fire upon we gallop out of the ravine on to the rough prairie the man dismount and return the fire we soon succeed in drive the enemy before we and be so close upon they at one time that they abandon and throw away nearly all they lodge and camp equipage and everything that have any considerable weight they leave behind they they played-out horse and for mile we could see indian furniture strew along in every direction the trail become divide and the indian scatter in small body all over the prairie as night be approach and we horse be about give out a halt be call a company be detail to collect all the indian horse run loose over the country and to burn the other indian property the command be nearly out of ration i be send to the nearest point old fort kearney about sixty mile distant for supplies shortly after we reach fort mcpherson which continue to be the headquarters of the fifth cavalry for some time we remain there for ten day fitting out for a new expedition to the republican river country and be reinforce by three company of the celebrated pawnee indian scout command by major frank north he officer be captain lute north brother of the major captain cush he brother-in-law captain morse and lieutenant beecher matthew and kislandberry general carr recommend at this time to general augur who be in command of the department that i be make chief of scout in the department of the platte and inform I that in this position i would receive higher wages than i have be get in the department of the missourus this appointment i have not ask for i make the acquaintance of major frank north -lrb- b -rrb- and i find he and he officer perfect gentleman and we be all good friend from the very start the pawnee scout have make quite a reputation for themselves as they have perform brave and valuable service in fight against the sioux whose bitter enemy they be be thoroughly acquaint with the republican and beaver country i be glad that they be to be with the expedition and they do good service -lrb- footnote b : major north be now my partner in a cattle ranch in nebraska -rrb- during we stay at fort mcpherson i make the acquaintance of lieutenant george p belden know as the white chief whose life be write by colonel brisbin we army i find he to be a intelligent dash fellow a splendid rider and a excellent shot a hour after we introduction he challenge I for a rifle match the preliminary of which be soon arrange we be to shoot ten shot each for fifty dollar at two hundred yard off hand belden be to use a henry rifle while i be to shoot my old lucretium this match i win and then belden propose to shoot a one hundred yard match as i be shoot over he distance in this match belden be victorious we be now even and we stop right there while we be at this post general augur and several of he officer and also thoma duncan brevet brigadier and lieutenant colonel of the fifth cavalry pay we a visit for the purpose of review the command the regiment turn out in fine style and show themselves to be well drill soldier thoroughly understand military tactic the pawnee scout be also review and it be very amusing to see they in they full regulation uniform they have be furnish a regular cavalry uniform and on this parade some of they have they heavy overcoat on other they large black hat with all the brass accoutrements attach some of they be minus pantaloons and only wear a breech clout other wear regulation pantaloons but no shirt on and be barehead other again have the seat of the pantaloons cut out leave only leggin some of they wear brass spur but have no boot or moccasin on they seem to understand the drill remarkably well for indian the command of course be give to they in they own language by major north who could talk it as well as any full-blooded pawnee the indian be well mount and feel proud and elated because they have be make united state soldier major north have have for year complete power over these indian and can do more with they than any man living that evening after the parade be over the officer and quite a number of lady visit a grand indian dance give by the pawnee and of all the indian i have see they dance excel those of any other tribe next day the command start when encamp several day after on the republican river near the mouth of the beaver we hear the whoop of indian follow by shot in the vicinity of the mule herd which have be take down to water one of the herder come dash into camp with a arrow sticking into he my horse be close at hand and mount he bare-back i at once dash off after the mule herd which have be stampede i suppose certainly that i would be the first man on the ground i be mistaken however for the pawnee indian unlike regular soldier have not wait to receive order from they officer but have jump on they pony without bridle or saddle and place rope in they mouth have dash off in the direction whence the shot have come and have get there ahead of I it prove to be a party of about fifty sioux who have endeavor to stampede we mule and it take they by surprise to see they inveterate enemy -- the pawnee -- come at full gallop towards they they be not aware that the pawnee be with the command and as they know that it would take regular soldier sometime to turn out they think they would have ample opportunity to secure the herd before the troops could give chase we have a run fight of fifteen mile and several of the enemy be kill during this chase i be mount on a excellent horse which colonel royal have pick out for I and for the first mile or two i be in advance of the pawnee presently a pawnee shot by I like a arrow and i could not help admire the horse that he be ride see that he possess rare run quality i determine if possible to get possession of the animal in some way it be a large buckskin or yellow horse and i take a careful view of he so that i would know he when i return to camp after the chase be over i ride up to major north and inquire about the buckskin horse oh yes say the major that be one of we favorite steed what chance be there to trade for he i ask it be a government horse say he and the indian who be ride he be very much attach to the animal i have fall in love with the horse myself say i and i would like to know if you have any objection to my trading for he if i can arrange it satisfactorily with the indian he say : none whatever and i will help you to do it you can give the indian another horse in he place a few day after this i persuade the indian by make he several present to trade horse with I and in this way i become the owner of the buckskin steed not as my own property however but as a government horse that i could ride i give he the name of buckskin joe and he prove to be a second brigham that horse i ride on and off during the summer of 1869 1870 1871 and 1872 and he be the horse that the grand duke alexi ride on he buffalo hunt in the winter of 1872 after i have leave fort mcpherson buckskin joe be condemn and sell at public sale and be buy by dave perry at north platte who in 1877 present he to I and i still own he he be now at my ranch on the dismal river stone blind but i shall keep he until he die the command scout several day up the beaver and prairie dog river occasionally have run fight with war party of indian but do not succeed in get they into a general battle at the end of twenty day we find ourselves back on the republican hitherto the pawnee have not take much interest in I but while at this camp i gain they respect and admiration by show they how i kill buffalo although the pawnee be excellent buffalo killer for indian i have never see one of they who could kill more than four or five in one run a number of they generally surround the herd and then dash in upon they and in this way each one kill from one to four buffalo i have go out in company with major north and some of the officer and see they make a surround twenty of the pawnee circle a herd and succeed in kill only thirty-two while they be cut up the animal another herd appear in sight the indian be prepare to surround it when i ask major north to keep they back and let I show they what i could do he accordingly inform the indian of my wish and they readily consent to let I have the opportunity i have learn that buckskin joe be a excellent buffalo horse and feel confident that i would astonish the native gallop in among the buffalo i certainly do so by kill thirty-six in less than a half-mile run at nearly every shot i kill a buffalo string the dead animal out on the prairie not over fifty foot apart this manner of killing be greatly admire by the indian who call I a big chief and from that time on i stand high in they estimation chapter xxii a desperate fight on leave camp the command take a westward course up the republican and major north with two company of he pawnee and two or three company of cavalry under the command of colonel royal make a scout to the north of the river shortly after we have go into camp on the black tail deer fork we observe a band of indian come over the prairie at full gallop singing and yell and wave they lance and long pole at first we suppose they to be sioux and all be excitement for a few moment we notice however that we pawnee indian make no hostile demonstration or preparation towards go out to fight they but begin swing and yell themselves captain lute north step up to general carr and say : general those be we man who be come and they have have a fight that be the way they act when they come back from a battle and have take any scalp the pawnee come into camp on the run captain north call to one of they -- a sergeant -- soon find out that they have run across a party of sioux who be follow a large indian trail these indian have evidently be in a fight for two or three of they have be wound and they be convey the injured person on _ travoi _ the pawnee have jump they and have kill three or four more of they next morning the command at a early hour start out to take up this indian trail which they follow for two day as rapidly as possible it become evident from the many camp fire which we pass that we be gain on the indian wherever they have encamp we find the print of a woman 's shoe and we conclude that they have with they some white captive this make we all the more anxious to overtake they and general carr accordingly select all he best horse which could stand a hard run and give order for the wagon train to follow as fast as possible while he push ahead on a forced march at the same time i be order to pick out five or six of the best pawnee and go on in advance of the command keep ten or twelve mile ahead on the trail so that when we overtake the indian we could find out the location of they camp and send word to the troops before they come in sight thus afford ample time to arrange a plan for the capture of the village after have go about ten mile in advance of the regiment we begin to move very cautiously as we be now evidently near the indian we look carefully over the summit of the hill before expose ourselves to plain view and at last we discover the village encamp in the sand-hill south of the south platte river at summit spring here i leave the pawnee scout to keep watch while i go back and inform general carr that the indian be in sight the general at once order he man to tighten they saddle and otherwise prepare for action soon all be excitement among the officer and soldier every one be anxious to charge the village i now change my horse for old buckskin joe who have be lead for I thus far and be comparatively fresh act on my suggestion the general make a circuit to the north believe that if the indian have they scout out they would naturally be watch in the direction whence they have come when we have pass the indian and be between they and the platte river we turn to the left and start toward the village by this manoeuver we have avoid discovery by the sioux scout and we be confident of give they a complete surprise keep the command wholly out of sight until we be within a mile of the indian the general halted the advance guard until all close up and then issue a order that when he sound the charge the whole command be to rush into the village as we halt on the top of the hill overlook the camp of the unsuspecting indian general carr call out to he bugler : sound the charge the bugler for a moment become intensely excite and actually forget the note the general again sing out : sound the charge and yet the bugler be unable to obey the command quartermaster hay -- who have obtain permission to accompany the expedition -- be ride near the general and comprehend the dilemma of the man rush up to he jerk the bugle from he hand and sound the charge himself in clear and distinct note as the troops rush forward he throw the bugle away then draw he pistol be among the first man that enter the village the indian have just drive up they horse and be prepare to make a move of the camp when they see the soldier come down upon they a great many of they succeed in jump upon they pony and leave every thing behind they advance out of the village and prepare to meet the charge but upon second thought they quickly conclude that it be useless to try to check we and those who be mount rapidly ride away while the other on foot flee for safety to the neighbor hill we go through they village shooting right and left at everything we see the pawnee the regular soldier and the officer be all mix up together and the sioux be fly in every direction general carr have instruct the command that when they enter the village they must keep a sharp look out for white woman as he be confident the indian have some captive the company which have be order to take possession of the village after its capture soon find two white woman one of whom have just be kill and the other wound they be both swede and the survivor could not talk english a swedish soldier however be soon find who could talk with she the name of this woman be mrs weichel and she story as tell to the soldier be that as soon as the indian see the troops come down upon they a squaw -- tall bull 's wife -- have kill mr alderdice the other captive with a hatchet and then wound she this squaw have evidently intend to kill both woman to prevent they from tell how cruelly they have be treat -lrb- illustration : indian village -rrb- the attack last but a short time and the indian be drive several mile away the soldier then gather in the herd of indian horse which be run at large over the country and drive they back to the camp after take a survey of what we have accomplish it be find that we have kill about one hundred and forty indian and capture one hundred and twenty squaw and papoose two hundred lodge and eight hundred horse and mule the village prove to be one of the richest i have ever see the red-skin have everything pertain to a indian camp besides numerous article belong to the white settlers whom they have kill on the saline the pawnee as well as the soldier ransack the camp for curiosity and find enough to start twenty museum besides a large amount of gold and silver this money have be steal from the swedish settler whom they have murder on the saline general carr order that all the tepee the indian lodge buffalo robe all camp equipage and provision include dry buffalo meat amount to several ton should be gather in pile and burn a grave be dig in which the dead swedish woman mr alderdice be bury captain kane a religious officer read the burial service as we have no chaplain with we while this be go on the sioux warrior have recover from they surprise have come back and a battle take place all around the camp i be on the skirmish line and i notice a indian who be ride a large bay horse and give order to he man in he own language -- which i could occasionally understand -- tell they that they have lose everything that they be ruin and he entreat they to follow he and fight until they die he horse be a extraordinary one fleet as the wind dashing here and there and i determine to capture he if possible but i be afraid to fire at the indian for fear of kill the horse i notice that the indian as he ride around the skirmish line pass the head of a ravine not far distant and it occur to I that if i could dismount and creep to the ravine i could as he pass there easily drop he from he saddle without danger of hit the horse accordingly i creep into and secrete myself in the ravine reach the place unseen by the indian and i wait there until mr chief come ride by when he be not more than thirty yard distant i fire and the next moment he tumble from he saddle and the horse keep on without he rider instead of run toward the indian however he gallop toward we man by one of whom he be catch lieutenant mason who have be very conspicuous in the fight and who have kill two or three indian himself single-handed come gallop up to the ravine and jump from he horse secure the fancy war bonnet from the head of the dead chief together with all he other accoutrements we both then rejoin the soldier and i at once go in search of the horse i find he in the possession of sergeant mcgrath who have catch he the sergeant know that i have be try to get the animal and have see I kill he rider he hand he over to I at once little do i think at that time that i have capture a horse which for four year afterwards be the fastest runner in the state of nebraska but such prove to be the fact -lrb- illustration : the killing of tall bull -rrb- i jump on he back and ride he down to the spot where the prisoner be corrale one of the squaw among the prisoner suddenly begin cry in a pitiful and hysterical manner at the sight of this horse and upon inquiry i find that she be tall bull 's wife the same squaw that have kill one of the white woman and wound the other she state that this be she husband 's favorite war-horse and that only a short time ago she have see tall bull ride he i give she to understand that she liege lord have pass in he mortal chip and that it would be sometime before he would ride he favorite horse again and i inform she that henceforth i should call the gallant steed tall bull in honor of she husband late in the evening we wagon train arrive and place the wounded woman mr weichel in the ambulance -- she have be kindly attend to by the surgeon -- and gather up the prisoner -- the squaw and papoose -- and capture stock we start at once for the south platte river eight mile distant and there go into camp next morning general carr issue a order that all the money find in the village should be turn over to the adjutant about one thousand dollar be thus collect and the entire amount be give to mr weichel the command then proceed to fort sedgwick from which point the particulars of we fight which take place on Sunday July 11th 1869 be telegraph to all part of the country we remain at this post for two week during which general augur of the department of the platte pay we a visit and highly compliment the command for the gallant service it have perform for this fight at summit spring general carr and he command be compliment not only in general order but receive a vote of thanks from the legislature of nebraska and colorado -- as tall bull and he indian have long be a terror to the border settlement -- and the resolution of thanks be elegantly engross and send to general carr the wound white woman be care for in the hospital at this post and after she recovery she soon marry the hospital steward she former husband have be kill by the indian we prisoner be send to the whetstone agency on the missourus river where spotted tail and the friendly sioux be then live the capture horse and mule be distribute among the officer scout and soldier among the animal that i thus obtain be my tall bull horse and a pony which i call powder face and which afterwards become quite celebrate as he figure prominently in the story of ned buntline one day while we be lie at fort sedgwick general carr receive a telegram from fort mcpherson state that the indian have make a dash on the union pacific railroad and have kill several section-man and run off some stock near o'fallon 's station also that a expedition be go out from fort mcpherson to catch and punish the red-skin if possible the general order I to accompany the expedition and accordingly that night i proceed by rail to mcpherson station and from thence ride on horseback to the fort two company under command of major brown have be order out and next morning just as we be about to start major brown say to I : by the way cody we be go to have quite a important character with we as a guest on this scout it be old ned buntline the novelist just then i notice a gentleman who be rather stoutly build and who wear a blue military coat on the left breast of which be pin about twenty gold medal and badge of secret society he walk a little lame as he approach we and i at once conclude that he be ned buntline he have a good mark to shoot at on the left breast say i to major brown but he look like a soldier as he come up major brown say : cody allow I to introduce you to colonel ebo judson otherwise know as ned buntline colonel judson i be glad to meet you say i the major tell I that you be to accompany we on the scout yes my boy so i be say he i be to deliver a temperance lecture to-night but no lecture for I when there be a prospect for a fight the major have kindly offer I a horse but i do not know how i 'll stand the ride for i have not do any ride lately but when i be a young man i spend several year among the fur company of the northwest and be a good rider and a excellent shot the major have give you a fine horse and you 'll soon find yourself at home in the saddle say i the command soon pull out for the south platte river which be very wide and high owe to recent mountain rain and in cross it we have to swim we horse in some place buntline be the first man across we reach o'fallon 's at eleven o'clock and in a short time i succeed in find the indian trail the party seem to be a small one which have come up from the south we follow they track to the north platte but as they have a start of two day major brown abandon the pursuit and return to fort mcpherson while i go back to fort sedgwick accompany by buntline during this short scout buntline have ask I a great many question and he be determine to go out on the next expedition with I provide he could obtain permission from the commanding officer i introduce he to the officer -- except those he already know -- and invite he to become my guest while he remain at the post and give he my pony powder face to ride by this time i have learn that my horse tall bull be a remarkably fast runner and therefore when lieutenant mason who be quite a sport and own a racer challenge I to a race i immediately accept it we be to run we horse a single dash of half a mile for one hundred dollar a side several of the officer and also reub wood the post-trader banter I for side bet and i take they all until i have put up my last cent on tall bull the ground be measure off the judge be select and all other preliminary be arrange we ride we horse ourselves and come up to the score nicely we let they go i see from the start that it would be mere play to beat the lieutenant 's horse and therefore i hold tall bull in check so that none could see how fast he really could run i easily win the race and pocket a snug little sum of money of course everybody be now talk horse major north remark that if tall bull could beat the pawnee ' fast horse i could break he whole command the next day the troops be pay off the pawnee with the rest and for two or three day they do nothing but run horse-race as all the recently capture horse have to be test to find out the swiftest among they finally the pawnee want to run they favorite horse against tall bull and i accordingly arrange a race with they they raise three hundred dollar and bet it on they horse while of course i back tall bull with a equal amount and in addition take numerous side bet the race be a single dash of a mile and tall bull win it without any difficulty i be ahead on this race about seven hundred dollar and the horse be fast get a reputation heretofore nobody would bet on he but now he have plenty of backer i also make a race for my pony powder face against a fast pony belong to captain lute north i select a small boy living at the post to ride powder face while a indian boy be to ride the other pony the pawnee as usual want to bet on they pony but as i have not yet fully ascertain the run quality of powder face i do not care about risk very much money on he have i know he as well then as i do afterwards i would have back he for every dollar i have for he prove to be one of the swiftest pony i ever see and have evidently be keep as a racer the race be to be four hundred yard and when i lead the pony over the track he seem to understand what he be there for north and i finally put the rider on and it be all i could do to hold the fiery little animal after the boy become seat on he back he jump around and make such quick movement that the boy be not at all confident of be able to stay on he the order to start be at last give by the judge and as i bring powder face up to the score and the word go be give he jump away so quickly that he leave he rider sit on the ground notwithstanding he run through and win the race without he it be a easy victory and after that i could get up no more race thus pass the time while we be at fort sedgwick general carr have obtain a leave of absence colonel royal be give the command of a expedition that be order to go out after the indian and in a few day -- after have rest a couple of week -- we set out for the republican have learn that there be plenty of indian in that section of the country at frenchman 's fork we discover a indian village but do not surprise it for its people have notice we approach and be retreat when we reach they camping-place we chase they down the stream and they finally turn to the left go north and cross the south platte river five mile above ogallalum we push rapidly after they follow they across the north platte and on through the sand-hill towards the niobrara but as they be make much better time than we the pursuit be abandon while we be in the sand-hills scout the niobrara country the pawnee indian bring into camp one night some very large bone one of which a surgeon of the expedition pronounce to be the thigh-bone of a human be the indian claim that the bone they have find be those of a person belong to a race of people who a long time ago live in this country that there be once a race of man on the earth whose size be about three time that of a ordinary man and they be so swift and powerful that they could run along-side of a buffalo and take the animal in one arm could tear off a leg and eat the meat as they walk these giant deny the existence of a great spirit and when they hear the thunder or see the lightning they laugh at it and say that they be greater than either this so displeased the great spirit that he cause a great rain-storm to come and the water keep rise higher and higher so that it drive those proud and conceited giant from the low grounds to the hill and thence to the mountain but at last even the mountain top be submerge and then those mammoth man be all drown after the flood have subside the great spirit come to the conclusion that he have make man too large and powerful and that he would therefore correct the mistake by create a race of man of smaller size and less strength this be the reason say the indian that modern man be small and not like the giant of old and they claim that this story be a matter of indian history which have be hand down among they from time immemorial as we have no wagon with we at the time this large and heavy bone be find we be oblige to leave it chapter xxiii administer justice on return to fort mcpherson we find that brevet major general wh emory colonel of the fifth cavalry and brevet brigadier general thoma duncan lieutenant colonel of the regiment have arrive there during we absence general emory have be appoint to the command of the district of the republican with headquarters at fort mcpherson as the command have be continually in the field it be generally think that we be to have a long rest and it look as if this post be to be my home and headquarters for some time to come i accordingly send to st loui for my wife and daughter to join I there general emory promise to build a house for I but before the building be complete my family arrive during the fall of 1869 there be two or three scout expedition send out but nothing of very great importance be accomplish by they i find fort mcpherson to be a lively and pleasant post to be station at especially as there be plenty of game in the vicinity and within a day 's ride there be large herd of deer antelope and elk during the winter of 1869-70 i spend a great deal of time in pursuit of game and during the season we have two hunting party of englishman there one party be that of mr flynn and the other that of george boyd houghton of london -- the well know caricaturist among they amusement be several horse race which i arrange and in which tall bull and powder face be invariably the winner tall bull by this time have such a reputation as a run horse that it be difficult to make a race for he i remember one however in which he run against a horse in captain spaulding 's company of the second cavalry this race be rather a novel affair i have make a bet that tall bull would beat the second cavalry horse around a one mile track and during the time that he be run i would jump off and on the horse eight time i ride the horse bareback seize he mane with my left hand rest my right on he withers and while he be go at full speed i jump to the ground and spring again upon he back eight time in succession such feat i have see perform in the circus and i have practice considerably at it with tall bull so that i be certain of win the race in the manner agree upon early one morning in the spring of 1870 the indian who have approach during the night steal some twenty-one head of horse from mr john burke -- a government contractor -- ben gallagher and jack waite they also run off some horse from the post among the number be my pony powder face the commandant at once order out lieutenant thoma with company i of the fifth cavalry and direct I to accompany they as trailer we discover the trail after some little difficulty as the indian be continually try to hide it and follow it sixty mile when darkness set in we be now within about four mile of red willow creek and i feel confident the indian would camp that night in that vicinity advise lieutenant thoma to halt he company and lay low i proceed on to the creek where move around cautiously i suddenly discover horse feed in a bend of the stream on the opposite side i hurry back to the troops with the information and lieutenant thoma move he company to the bank of the creek with the intention of remain there until daylight and then if possible surprise the indian just at break of day we mount we horse and after ride a short distance we ascend a slight elevation when not over one hundred yard distant we look down into the indian camp the indian prepare to make a early start have drive up they horse and be in the act of mount when they see we charge down upon they in a moment they spring upon they pony and dash away have it not be for the creek which lay between we and they we would have get they before they could have mount they horse but as it be rather miry we be unexpectedly delay the indian fire some shot at we while we be cross but as soon as we get across we go for they in hot pursuit a few of the red-skin have not have time to mount and have start on foot down the creek toward the brush one of these be kill a number of we soldier who have be detail before the charge to gather up any of the indian horse that would be stampede succeed in capture thirty-two i hurriedly look over they to see if powder face be among they but he be not there start in pursuit of the fugitive i finally espy a indian mount on my favorite dash away and lead all the other we continue the chase for two or three mile overtake a couple who be mount upon one horse come up behind they i fire my rifle when about thirty foot distant the ball pass through the back of both and they fall headlong to the ground but i make no stop however just then for i have my eye on the gentleman who be ride powder face it seem to be fun for he to run away from we and run away he do for the last i saw of he be when he go over a divide about three mile away i bade he adieu on my way back to the indian camp i stop and secure the war bonnet and accoutrements of the pair i have kill and at the same time gently raise they hair we be feel rather tired and hungry as we have start out on the trail thirty-six hour before without a breakfast or take any food with we but not a murmur or complaint be hear among the man in the abandon indian camp however we find enough dry buffalo meat to give we all a meal and after remain there for two hour to rest we animal we start on we return to fort mcpherson where we arrive at night have travel 130 mile in two day this be the first fight lieutenant thoma have ever command in he feel highly elate over he success and hope that he name would be mention in the special order for gallantry sure enough when we return both he myself and the whole command receive a complimentary mention in a special order this he certainly deserve for he be a brave energetic dash little officer the war bonnet which i have capture i turn over to general carr with the request that he present they to general augur whose daughter be visit at the post at the time shortly after this another expedition be organize at fort mcpherson for the republican river country it be command by general duncan who be a jolly bluster old fellow and the officer who know he well say that we would have a good time as he be very fond of hunting he be a good fighter and one of the officer say that a indian bullet never could hurt he as he have be shoot in the head with a cannon ball which have not injure he in the least another say the ball glance off and kill one of the toughest mule in the army the pawnee scout who have be muster out of service during the winter of 1869 and '70 be reorganize to accompany this expedition i be glad of this as i have become quite attach to one of the officer major north and to many of the indian the only white scout we have at the post besides myself at that time be john y nelson whose indian name be cha-sha-cha-opoyeo -lrb- c -rrb- which interpret means red-willow-fill-the-pipe this man be a character in he way he have a sioux squaw for a wife and consequently a half-breed family john be a good fellow though as a liar he have but few equal and no superior -lrb- footnote c : since travel with I in my dramatic combination as interpreter for sioux indian -rrb- we start out from the post with the regimental band play the lively air of the girl i leave behind I we make but a short march that day and camp at night at the head of fox creek next morning general duncan send I word by he orderly that i be to bring up my gun and shoot at a mark with he but i can assure the reader that i do not feel much like shooting anything except myself for on the night before i have return to fort mcpherson and spend several hour in interview the sutler 's store in company with major brown i look around for my gun and find that i have leave it behind the last i could remember about it be that i have it at the sutler 's store i inform major brown of my loss who say that i be a nice scout to start out without a gun i reply that that be not the worst of it as general duncan have send for I to shoot a match with he and i do not know what to do for if the old gentleman discover my predicament he would very likely severely reprimand I well cody say he the best you can do be to make some excuse and then go and borrow a gun from some of the man and tell the general that you lend yours to some man to go hunting with to-day while we be wait here i will send back to the post and get you rifle for you i succeed in obtain a gun from john nelson and then march up to the general 's headquarters i shoot the desire match with he which result in he favor this be the first scout the pawnee have be out on under command of general duncan and in station he guard around the camp he post they in a manner entirely different from that of general carr and colonel royal and he insist that the different post should call out the hour of the night thus : post no 1 nine o'clock all be well post no 2 nine o'clock all be well etc the pawnee who have they regular turn at stand upon guard be order to call the hour the same as the white soldier this be very difficult for they to do as there be but few of they who could express themselves in english major north explain to they that when the man on post next to they should call out the hour they must call it also as near like he as possible it be very amusing to hear they do this they would try to remember what the other man have say on the post next to they for instance a white soldier would call out : post no i half-past nine o'clock all be well the indian standing next to he know that he be bind to say something in english and he would sing out something like the following : poss number half pass five cent -- go to -- i do not care this system be really so ridiculous and amusing that the general have to give it up and the order be accordingly countermand nothing of any great interest occur on this march until one day while proceed up prairie dog creek -lrb- d -rrb- major north and myself go out in advance of the command several mile and kill a number of buffalo night be approach and i begin to look around for a suitable camping ground for the command major north dismount from he horse and be rest while i ride down to the stream to see if there be plenty of grass in the vicinity i find a excellent camping spot and return to major north tell he that i would ride over the hill a little way so that the advance guard could see I this i do and when the advance come in sight i dismount and lay down upon the grass to rest -lrb- footnote d : near the lonely camp where i have so long be lay up with a broken leg when trapping year before with dave harrington -rrb- suddenly i hear three or four shot and in a few moment major north come dash up towards I pursue by eight or ten indian i instantly spring into my saddle and fire a few shot at the indian who by this time have all come in sight to the number of fifty we turn we horse and run the bullet fly after we thick and fast -- my whip be shoot from my hand and daylight be put through the crown of my hat we be in close quarter when suddenly lieutenant valkmar come gallop up to we relief with several soldier and the indian see they whirl and retreat as soon as major north get in sight of he pawnee he begin ride in a circle this be a sign to they that there be hostile indian in front and in a moment the pawnee break rank pell-mell and with major north at they head start for the fly warrior the rest of the command push rapidly forward also and chase the enemy for three or four mile kill three of they but this be a wrong move on we part as they village be on prairie dog creek while they lead we in a different direction one indian only keep straight on up the creek -- a messenger to the village some of the command who have follow he stir up the village and accelerate its departure we finally get back to the main force and then learn that we have make a great mistake now commence another stern chase the second day that we have be follow these indian we come upon a old squaw whom they have leave on the prairie to die she people have build for she a little shade or lodge and have give she some provision sufficient to last she on she trip to the happy hunting grounds this the indian often do when pursue by a enemy and one of they number become too old and feeble to travel any longer this squaw be recognize by john nelson who say that she be a relative of he wife from she we learn that the fly indian be know as pawnee killer 's band and that they have lately kill buck 's survey party consist of eight or nine man the massacre have occur a few day before on beaver creek we know that they have have a fight with surveyor as we find quite a number of survey instrument which have be leave in the abandon camp we drive these indian across the platte river and then return to fort mcpherson bring the old squaw with we from there she be send to the spotted tail agency during my absence my wife have give birth to a son and he be several week old when i return no name have yet be give he and i select that of elmo judson in honor of ned buntline but this the officer and scout object to major brown propose that we should call he kit carson and it be finally settle that that should be he name during the summer we make one or two more scout and have a few skirmish with the indian : but nothing of any great importance transpire in the fall of 1870 while i be a witness in a court martial at fort da russell i wake up one morning and find that i be dead break -- this be not a unusual occurrence to a frontiersman or a author i may add especially when he be endeavor to kill time -- to raise necessary fund i sell my race horse tall bull to lieutenant mason who have long want he in the winter of 1870 and 1871 i first meet george watt garland a english gentleman and a great hunter whom i have the pleasure of guide on several hunt and with whom i spend some week during the winter i also take several party out on the loupe river country hunting and trapping although i be still chief of scout i do not have much to do as the indian be comparatively quiet thus give I plenty of time for sport in the spring of 1871 several short scout expedition be send out from fort mcpherson but all with minor result about this time general emory be considerably annoy by petty offens commit in the vicinity of the post and as there be no justice of the peace in the neighborhood he be anxious to have such a officer there to attend to the civilian one day he remark to I that i would make a excellent justice general you compliment I rather too highly for i do not know any more about law than a government mule do about book-keeping say i that do not make any difference say he for i know that you will make a good ` squire he accordingly have the county commissioner appoint I to the office of justice of the peace and i soon receive my commission one morning a man come rush up to my house and state that he want to get out a writ of replevin to recover possession of a horse which a stranger be take out of the country i have no blank form and have not yet receive the statute of nebraska to copy from so i ask the man : where be the fellow who have get you horse he be go up the road and be about two mile away reply he very well say i i will get the writ ready in a minute or two i saddle up my horse and then take my old reliable gun lucretium i say to the man : that be the best writ of replevin that i can think of come along and we 'll get that horse or know the reason why we soon overtake the stranger who be drive a herd of horse and as we come up to he i say : hello sir i be a officer and have a attachment for that horse and at the same time i point out the animal well sir what be you go to do about it he inquire i propose to take you and the horse back to the post say i you can take the horse say he but i have not the time to return with you you 'll have to take the time or pay the cost here and now say i how much be the cost twenty dollar here 's you money say he as he hand I the greenback i then give he a little friendly advice and tell he that he be release from custody he go on he way a wiser and a poorer man while the owner of the horse and myself return to the fort i pocket the twenty dollar of course some people might think it be not a square way of do business but i do not know any better just then i have several little case of this kind and i become better post on law in the course of time be assist by lieutenant burr reilly of the fifth cavalry who have be educate for a lawyer one evening i be call upon to perform a marriage ceremony the bridegroom be one of the sergeant of the post i have brace up for the occasion by imbibe rather freely of stimulant and when i arrive at the house with a copy of the statute of nebraska which i have recently receive i feel somewhat confused whether my bewilderment be owe to the importance of the occasion and the large assembly or to the effect of loui woodin 's tanglefoot i can not now distinctly remember -- but my suspicion have always be that it be due to the latter cause i look carefully through the statute to find the marriage ceremony but my effort be unsuccessful finally the time come for the knot to be tie i tell the couple to stand up and then i say to the bridegroom : do you take this woman to be you lawful wed wife to support and love she through life i do be the reply then address myself to the bride i say do you take this man to be you lawful wed husband through life to love honor and obey he -lrb- illustration : a wedding ceremony -rrb- i do be she response then join hand say i to both of they i now pronounce you to be man and wife and whomsoever god and buffalo bill have join together let no man put asunder may you live long and prosper aman this conclude the interesting ceremony which be follow by the usual festivity on such occasion i be highly compliment for the elegant and eloquent manner in which i have tie the matrimonial knot during the summer of 1871 professor marsh of yale college come out to mcpherson with a large party of student to have a hunt and to look for fossil professor marsh have hear of the big bone which have be find by the pawnee in the niobrara country and he intend to look for that as well as other bone he accordingly secure the service of major frank north and the pawnee as a escort i be also to accompany the bone-hunter and would have do so have it not be for the fact that just at that time i be order out with a small scout party to go after some indian -lrb- illustration : a ride for life -rrb- the day before the professor arrive at the fort i have be out hunting on the north side of the north platte river near pawnee spring with several companion when we be suddenly attack by indian who wound one of we number john weister we stand the indian off for a little while and weister get even with they by kill one of they party the indian however outnumber we and at last we be force to make a run for we life in this we succeed and reach the fort in safety the general want to have the indian pursue and say he could not spare I to accompany professor marsh however i have the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the eminent professor whom i find to be not only a well-posted person but a very entertaining gentleman he give I a geological history of the country tell I in what section fossil be to be find and otherwise entertain I with several scientific yarn some of which seem too complicated and too mysterious to be believe by a ordinary man like myself but it be all clear to he i ride out with he several mile as he be start on he bone-hunting expedition and i greatly enjoy the ride he party have be provide with government transportation and he student be all mount on government horse as we ride along he deliver a scientific lecture and he convince I that he know what he be talk about i finally bid he good-bye and return to the post while the fossil-hunter be out on they expedition we have several lively little skirmish with the indian after have be absent some little time professor marsh and he party come back with they wagon load down with all kind of bone and the professor be in he glory he have evidently strike a bone-yard and gad -lrb- e -rrb- be not he happy but they have fail to find the big bone which the pawnee have unearth the year before -lrb- footnote e : a favorite expression of the professor 's -rrb- chapter xxiv

major browa lieutenant haye and myself a hearty good-bye and express themselves as greatly please with they hunt and the manner in which they have be escort and guide it will be proper and fair to state here that general davy afterwards write a interesting account of this hunt and publish it in a neat volume of sixty-eight page under the title of ten day on the plain i would have insert the volume bodily in this book be it not for the fact that the general have speak in a rather too complimentary manner of I however i have take the liberty in this chapter to condense from the little volume and in some place i have use the identical language of general davy without quote the same in fact to do the general justice i ought to close this chapter with several line of quotation mark to be pretty generally distribute by the reader throughout my account of we ten day ' hunt soon after the departure of general sheridan 's party we return to fort mcpherson and find general carr about to start out on a twenty day ' scout not so much for the purpose of find indian but more for the object of take some friend on a hunt he guest be a couple of englishman -- whose name i can not now

tell general carr that the indian have jump he and that the general would soon start out with the troops so as soon as the pawnee ride up to I i tell they to remain there while i go after my friend i ride after he as fast as possible but he have arrive at the command some time before I and when i get there the general have as i have suspect he would do order out two company of cavalry to go in pursuit of the indian i tell the general that the indian be only some pawnee who have be out hunting and that they have merely play a joke upon we i forget to inform he that i have put up the trick but as he be always fond of a good joke himself he do not get very angry i have pick up mccarthy 's hat and gun which i return to he and it be some time afterwards before he discover who be at the

general custer who be one of the hunting party carry on a mild flirtation with one of spotted tail 's daughter who have accompany she father thither and it be notice also that the duke alexi pay considerable attention to another handsome red-skin maiden the night pass pleasantly and all retire with great expectation of have a most enjoyable and successful buffalo hunt the duke alexi ask I a great many question as to how we shoot buffalo and what kind of a gun or pistol we use and if he be go to have a good horse i tell he that he be to have my celebrated buffalo horse buckskin joe and when we go into a buffalo herd all he would have to do be to sit on the horse 's back and fire away at nine o'clock next morning we be all in we saddle and in a few minute be gallop over the prairie in search of a buffalo herd we have not go far before we observe a herd some distance ahead of we cross we way after that we proceed cautiously so as to keep out of sight until we be ready to make a charge of course the main thing be to give alexis the first chance and the best shot at the buffalo and when all be in readiness we dash over a little knoll that have hide we from view and in a few minute we be among they alexi at first prefer to use he pistol instead of a gun he fire six shot from this weapon at buffalo only twenty foot away from he but as he shoot wildly not one of he bullet take effect ride up to he side and see that he weapon be empty i exchange pistol with he he again fire six shot without drop a buffalo see that the animal be bind to make they escape without he kill one of they unless he have a better weapon i ride up to he give he my old reliable lucretium and tell he to urge he horse close to the buffalo and i would then give he the word when to shoot at the same time i give old buckskin joe a blow with my whip and with a few jump the horse carry the grand duke to within about ten foot of a big buffalo bull now be you time say i he fire and down go the buffalo the grand duke stop he horse drop he gun on the ground and commence wave he hat when he _ suite _ come gallop up he begin talk to they in a tongue which i could not understand presently general sheridan join the group and the ambulance be bring up very soon the cork begin to fly from the champagne bottle in honor of the grand duke alexi who have kill the first buffalo it be report in a great many of the newspaper that i shoot the first buffalo for alexi while in some it be state that i hold the buffalo while he royal highness kill it but the way i have relate the affair be the correct version it be think that we have have about sport enough for one day and accordingly i be direct by general sheridan to guide the party back to camp and we be soon on we way thither several of the party however conclude to have a little hunt on they own account and presently we see they gallop over the prairie in different direction in pursuit of buffalo while we be cross a deep ravine on we way to camp we run into a small band of buffalo that have be frighten by some of the hunter as they rush past we not more than thirty yard distant alexi raise he pistol fire and kill a buffalo cow it be either a extraordinary good shot or a scratch -- probably the latter for it surprise the grand duke as well as everybody else we give he three cheer and when the ambulance come up we take a pull at the champagne in honor of the grand duke 's success i be in hope that he would kill five or six more buffalo before we reach camp especially if a basket of champagne be to be open every time he drop one general sheridan direct I to take care of the hide and head of the buffalo which alexis have kill as the duke wish to keep they as souvenir of the hunt i also cut out the choice meat from the cow and bring it into camp and that night at supper alexi have the pleasure of dining on broil buffalo steak obtain from the animal which he have shoot himself we remain at this camp two or three day during which we hunt most of the time the grand duke himself kill eight buffalo one day alexi desire to see how the indian hunt buffalo and kill they with bow and arrow so spotted tail select some of he best hunter have they surround a herd and bring the animal down not only with arrow but with lance the grand duke be tell to follow upon the heel of one celebrated indian hunter whose name be two lance and watch he bring down the game for this chief have the reputation of be able to send a arrow through and through the body of a buffalo upon this occasion he do not belie he reputation for he send a arrow _ through _ a buffalo which fall dead at the shot and the arrow be give to alexi as a souvenir of he hunt on the american plain -lrb- illustration : two lance kill a buffalo -rrb- when the grand duke be satisfy with the sport order be give for the return to the railroad the conveyance provide for the grand duke and general sheridan be a heavy double-seated open carriage or rather a irish dog-cart and it be draw by four spirited cavalry horse which be not much use to the harness the driver be bill reed a old overland stage driver and wagon master on we way in the grand duke frequently express he admiration of the skillful manner in which reed handle the rein general sheridan inform the duke that i also have be a stage-driver in the rocky mountain and thereupon he royal highness express a desire to see I drive i be in advance at the time and general sheridan sing out to I : cody get in here and show the duke how you can drive mr reed will exchange place with you and ride you horse all right general say i and in a few moment i have the rein and we be rattle away over the prairie when we be approach medicine creek general sheridan say : shake 'em up a little bill and give we some old-time stage-driving i give the horse a crack or two of the whip and they start off at a very rapid gait they have a light load to pull and keep increase they speed at every jump and i find it difficult to hold they they fairly fly over the ground and at last we reach a steep hill or divide which lead down into the valley of the medicine there be no brake on the wagon and the horse be not much on the hold-back i see that it would be impossible to stop they all i could do be to keep they straight in the track and let they go it down the hill for three mile which distance i believe be make in about six minute every once in a while the hind wheel would strike a rut and take a bind and not touch the ground again for fifteen or twenty foot the duke and the general be keep rather busy in hold they position on the seat and when they see that i be keep the horse straight in the road they seem to enjoy the dash which we be make i be unable to stop the team until they run into the camp where we be to obtain a fresh relay and there i succeed in check they the grand duke say he do not want any more of that kind of drive as he prefer to go a little slower on arrive at the railroad the duke invite I into he car and make I some valuable present at the same time give I a cordial invitation to visit he if ever i should come to he country general sheridan take occasion to remind I of a invitation to visit new york which i have receive from some of the gentleman who accompany the general on the hunt from fort mcpherson to hay city in September of the previous year say he : you will never have a better opportunity to accept that invitation than now i have have a talk with general ord concern you and he will give you a leave of absence whenever you be ready to start write a letter to general stager of chicago that you be now prepare to accept the invitation and he will send you a pass thank the general for he kindness i then bid he and the grand duke good-bye and soon they train be out of sight chapter xxvi sight-seeing general ord command the department of the platte at the time and who have be out on the alexi hunt have some business to attend to at fort mcpherson and i accept he invitation to ride over to the post with he in a ambulance on the way thither he ask I how i would like to have a officer 's commission in the regular army he say that general sheridan and himself have have some conversation about the matter and if i want a commission one could easily be procure for I i thank general ord for he kindness and say that although a officer 's commission in the regular army be a tempting prize yet i prefer to remain in the position i be then hold he conclude by state that if at any time i should wish a commission all that i would

the merry and motley throng present a brilliant scene move gracefully beneath the bright gas-light to the inspiriting music to I it be a novel and entertaining sight and in many respects remind I greatly of a indian war-dance act upon the suggestion of mr bennett i have dress myself in my buckskin suit and i naturally attract considerable attention especially when i take part in the dancing and exhibit some of my backwoods step which although not as graceful as some be a great deal more emphatic but when i undertake to do artistic dancing i find i be decidedly out of place in that crowd and i accordingly withdraw from the floor i occasionally pass a evening at niblo 's garden view the many beauty of the black crook which be then have its long run under the management of jarrett & palmer whose acquaintance i have make and who extend to I the freedom of the theater ned buntline and fred maeder have dramatize one of the story which the former have write about I for the _ new york

be reserve for I the theater be packed every seat be occupy as well as the standing-room the drama be play smoothly and create a great deal of enthusiasm the audience upon learn that the real buffalo bill be present give several cheer between the act and i be call on to come out on the stage and make a speech mr freleigh the manager insist that i should comply with the request and that i should be introduce to mr studley i finally consent and the next moment i find myself stand behind the footlights and in front of a audience for the first time in my life i look up then down then on each side and everywhere i see a sea of human face and thousand of eye all stare at I i confess that i feel very much embarrassed -- never more so in my life -- and i know not what to say i make a desperate effort and a few word escape I but what they be i could not for the life of I tell nor could any one else in the house my utterance be inaudible even to the leader of the orchestra mr dean who be sit only a few foot in front of I bow to the audience i beat a hasty retreat into one of the cañons of the stage i never feel more relieved in my life than when i get out of the view of that immense crowd that evening mr freleigh offer to give I five hundred dollar a week to play the part of buffalo bill myself i think that he be certainly joking especially as he have witness my awkward performance but when he assure I that he be in earnest i tell he that it would be useless for I to attempt anything of the kind for i never could talk to a crowd of people like that even if it be to save my neck and that he might as well try to make a actor out of a government mule i thank he for the generous offer which i have to decline owe to a lack of confidence in myself or as some people might express it i do not have the requisite cheek to undertake a thing of that sort the play of buffalo bill have a very successful run of six or eight week and be afterwards produce in all the principal city of the country everywhere be receive with genuine enthusiasm i have be in new york about twenty day when general sheridan arrive in the city i meet he soon after he get into town in answer to a question how

and a excellent hunter it be while i be out with the earl that a chicago party -- friend of general sheridan -- arrive at fort mcpherson for the purpose of go out on a hunt they too have a letter from the general request I to go with they the earl have not yet finish he hunt but as i have be out with he for several week and he have by this time learn where to find plenty of elk and other game i

manufacturer -- alexander sample mr milligan of the firm of heath & milligan of chicago and several other whose name i do not now remember mr milligan be a man full of life and be continually boil over with fun he be a regular velocipede so to speak and be here there and everywhere he be exceedingly desirous of have a indian fight on the trip not that he be naturally a blood-thirsty man but just for variety he want a little indian pie he be in every respect the life of the party during the entire time that we be out one day while he be hunting with sample and myself we come in sight of a band of thirty mount indian milligan here 's what you have be want for some time say i for yonder be a war party of indian and no mistake and they 'll come for we you bet i do not believe this be one of my fighting day reply milligan and it occur to I that i have urgent business at the camp we camp be five or six mile distant on the dismal river and we escort consist of a company of cavalry command by captain russell the soldier be in camp and milligan think that captain russell ought to be at once notify of the appearance of these indian know that we could reach the camp in safety for we be well mount i continue to have considerable amusement at milligan 's expense who finally say : cody what be make my hat raise up so i can hardly keep it on my head sample who be as cool as a cucumber say to milligan : there must be something wrong with you hair it must be try to get on end it be all very fine for you fellow to stand here and talk reply milligan but i be not do justice to my family by remain sample i think we be a couple of old fool to have come out here and i never would have do so if it have not be for you by this time the indian have discover we and be hold a consultation and milligan turn he horse in the direction of the camp i never believe that he be half as scare as he seem to be but that he be merely pretend so that we could enjoy we joke however we do not wait any longer but ride into camp and notify captain russell who immediately start with he company to pursue the band while we be ride along with the company milligan say to sample : now alick let they come on we may yet go back to chicago cover with glory we strike the trail go north but as we have not come out on a scout for indian we conclude not to follow they although milligan be now very anxious to proceed and clean they out the hunt come to a end in a day or two and we escort the visit hunter to north platte where they take the train for chicago before they departure they extend to I a very cordial invitation to come to they city on a visit promise that i should be well take care of soon after this i have the pleasure of guide a party of gentleman from omaha on a buffalo hunt among the number be judge dundy colonel watson b smith and we district attorney neville we leave fort mcpherson in good trim i be greatly amuse at the style of mr neville who wear a stove-pipe hat and a swallow-tail coat which make up a very comical rig for a buffalo hunter as we gallop over the prairie he jam he hat down over he ear to keep it from be shake off he head and in order to stick to he horse he cling to the pommel of he saddle he be not much of a rider and he go bounce up and down with he swallow-tail flop in the air the sight i shall never forget for it be enough to make a horse laugh and i actually believe old buckskin joe do laugh however we have a splendid hunt and on the second day i lariated or rope a big buffalo bull and tie he to a tree -- a feat which i have often perform and which the gentleman request I to do on this occasion for they benefit as they have hear of my skill with the lariat i capture several other buffalo in the same way the gentleman return to omaha well please with they hunt in the fall of the year 1872 a convention be hold at grand island when some of my friend make I they candidate to represent the twenty-sixth district in the legislature of nebraska but as i have always be a democrat and the state be largely republican i have no idea of be elect in fact i care very little about it and therefore make no effort whatever to secure a election however i be elect and that be the way in which i acquire my title of honorable chapter xxviii a actor during the summer and fall of 1872 i receive numerous letter from ned buntline urge I to come east and go upon the stage to represent my own character there be money in it he write and you will prove a big card as you character be a novelty on the stage at time i almost determine to make the venture but the recollection of that night when i stand on the stage of the bowery theater and be unable to utter a word above a whisper would cause I to stop and think and become irresolute i fear that i would be a total failure and write buntline to that effect but he insist that i would soon get over all that embarrassment and become accustomed to the stage so that i would think no more of appear before five thousand people than i would before half a dozen he propose to organize a good company and wish I to meet he in chicago where the opening performance would be give i remain undecided as to what i ought to do the officer at the fort as well as my family and friend to whom i have mention the matter laugh at the idea of my ever become a actor that i a old scout who have never see more than twenty or thirty theatrical performance in my life should think of go upon the stage be ridiculous in the extreme -- so they all say a few day after my election to the legislature a happy event occur in my family circle in the birth of a daughter whom we name os about the same time i receive another letter from buntline in which he request I to appear on the stage for a few month as a experiment and he say that if i make a failure or do not like the business i could easily return to my old life my two sister who have be live with we have marry -- nellie to a c jester a cattle man and may to ed bradford a railroad engineer -- and consequently leave we and my wife have be wish for a long time to visit she parent in st loui take these and other thing into consideration i finally resolve to resign my seat in the legislature and try my luck behind the footlights i inform general reynold of my determination tell he at the same time that at the end of the month November i would resign my position under he the general regret to hear this and advise I not to take the step for i be leave a comfortable little home where i be sure of make a good living for my family while on the other hand i be embark upon a sea of uncertainty have once make up my mind however nothing could change it while i be sell my horse and other effect preparatory to leave the fort one of my brother scout texa jack say that he would like to accompany I now as jack have also appear as the hero in one of ned buntline 's story i think that he would make as good a star as myself and it be accordingly arrange that jack should go with I on we way east we stop in omaha a day or two to visit general augur and other officer and also the gentleman who be out on the judge dundy hunt judge dundy and he friend give a dinner party in my honor at the lead restaurant and entertain I very handsomely during my stay in the city at omaha i part with my family who go to st loui while jack and myself proceed to chicago ned buntline and mr milligan have be apprise of we come by a telegram meet we at the dépôt mr milligan accompany we to the sherman house where he have make arrangement for we to be he guest while we remain in the city i do not see much of buntline that evening as he hurry off to deliver a temperance lecture in one of the public hall the next day we meet he by appointment and the first thing he say be : boy be you ready for business i can not answer that reply i for we do not know what we be go to do it be all arrange say he and you 'll have no trouble whatever come with I we 'll go and see nixon manager of the amphitheatre that be the place where we be to play we 'll open there next Monday night jack and myself accordingly accompany he to manager nixon 's office without say a word as we do not know what to say here we be mr nixon say buntline here be the star for you here be the boy and they be a fine pair to draw too now nixon i be prepare for business nixon and buntline have evidently have a talk about the term of we engagement buntline it seem be to furnish the company the drama and the pictorial printing and be to receive sixty per cent of the gross receipt for he share while nixon be to furnish the theater the _ attachés _ the orchestra and the local printing and receive forty per cent of the gross receipt i be ready for you buntline have you get you company yet ask nixon no sir but there be plenty of idle theatrical people in town and i can raise a company in two hour be he reply you have not much time to spare if you open on Monday night say nixon if you will allow I to look at you drama to see what kind of people you want i 'll assist you in organize you company i have not yet write the drama say buntline what the deuce do you mean this be Wednesday and you propose to open on next Monday night the idea be ridiculous here you be at this late hour without a company and without a drama this will never do buntline i shall have to break my contract with you for you can not possibly write a drama cast it and rehearse it properly for Monday night furthermore you have no pictorial printing as yet these two gentleman whom you have with you have never be on the stage and they certainly must have time to study they part it be preposterous to think of open on Monday night and i 'll cancel the engagement this little speech be deliver in rather a excited manner by mr nixon buntline say that he would write the drama that day and also select he company and have they at the theater for rehearsal next morning nixon laugh at he and say that there be no use of try to undertake anything of the kind in so short a time -- it be utterly impossible to do it buntline whose ire be rise say to nixon : what rent will you ask for you theater for next week six hundred dollar be the reply well sir i 'll take you theater for next week at that price and here be half of the amount in advance say buntline as he throw down three hundred dollar on the stand nixon take the money give a receipt for it and have nothing more to say now come with I boy say buntline and away we go to the hotel buntline immediately obtain a supply of pen ink and paper and then engage all the hotel clerk as penman in less than a hour after he have rent the theater he be dash off page after page of he proposed drama -- the work be do in he room at the hotel he then set he clerk at copying for he and at the end of four hour he jump up from the table and enthusiastically shout : hurrah for ` the scout of the plain ' that be the name of the play the work be do hurrah the part be then all copy off separately by the clerk and hand we we respective portion buntline say : now boy go to work and do you level best to have this dead-letter perfect for the rehearsal which take place to-morrow morning at ten o'clock prompt i want to show nixon that we 'll be ready on time -lrb- illustration : study the part -rrb- i look at my part and then at jack and jack look at he part and then at I then we look at each other and then at buntline we do not know what to make of the man how long will it take you to commit you part to memory bill ask jack about six month as near as i can calculate how long will it take you answer i it will take I about that length of time to learn the first line say jack nevertheless we go to we room and commence study i think it be the hardest work i have ever do this be dry business finally remark jack that be just what it be i answer jerk the bell jack the bell-boy soon appear we order refreshment after partake thereof we resume we task we study hard for a hour or two but finally give it up as a bad job although we have succeed in commit a small portion to memory buntline now come into the room and say : boy how be you get along i guess we 'll have to go back on this study business as it be not we _ forte _ say i do not weaken now bill you 'll come out on the top of the heap yet let I hear you recite you part say buntline i begin spout what i have learn but be interrupt by buntline : tut tut you be not say it right you must stop at the cue cue what the mischief do you mean by the cue i never see any cue except in a billiard room say i buntline thereupon explain it to I as well as to jack who be ignorant as myself concern the cue business jack i think we have better back out and go to hunting again say i see here boy it will not do to go back on I at this stage of the game stick to it and it may be the turn point in you life and lead you on to fortune and to fame a fortune be what we be after and we 'll at least give the wheel a turn or two and see what luck we have say i this satisfied buntline but we do not study any more after he leave we the next morning we appear at rehearsal and be introduce to the company the first rehearsal be hardly a success and the succeed one be not much better the stage manager do he best to teach jack and myself what to do but when Monday night come we do not know much more about it than when we begin the clock strike seven and then we put on we buckskin suit which be the costume we be to appear in the theater be be rapidly fill and it be evident that we be go to make we _ début _ before a packed house as the minute pass by jack and i become more and more nervous we occasionally look through the hole in the curtain and see that the people be continue to crowd into the theater we nervousness increase to a uncomfortable degree when at length the curtain arise we courage have return so that we think we could face the immense crowd yet when the time come for we to go on we be rather slow in make we appearance as we step forth we be receive with a storm of applause which we acknowledge with a bow -lrb- illustration : behind the footlights -rrb- buntline who be take the part of cale durg appear and give I the cue to speak my little piece but for the life of I i could not remember a single word buntline see i be stick and a happy thought occur to he he say -- as if it be in the play : where have you be bill what have keep you so long just then my eye happen to fall on mr milligan who be surround by he friend the newspaper reporter and several military officer all of whom have hear of he hunt and indian fight -- he be a very popular man and widely know in chicago so i say : i have be out on a hunt with milligan this prove to be a big hit the audience cheer and applaud which give I greater confidence in my ability to get through the performance all right buntline who be a very versatile man see that it would be a good plan to follow this up and he say : well bill tell we all about the hunt i thereupon proceed to relate in detail the particulars of the affair i succeed in make it rather funny and i be frequently interrupt by round of applause whenever i begin to weaken buntline would give I a fresh start by ask some question in this way i take up fifteen minute without once speak a word of my part nor do i speak a word of it during the whole evening the prompter who be stand between the wing attempt to prompt I but it do no good for while i be on the stage i chip in anything i thought of the scout of the plain be a indian drama of course and there be between forty and fifty super dress as indian in the fight with they jack and i be at home we blaze away at each other with blank cartridge and when the scene end in a hand-to-hand encounter -- a general knock-down and drag-out -- the way jack and i kill indian be a caution we would kill they all off in one act but they would come up again ready for business in the next finally the curtain drop the play be end and i congratulate jack and myself on have make such a brilliant and-successful _ début _ there be no back out after that the next morning there appear in the chicago papers some very funny criticism on we first performance the papers give we a better send-off than i expect for they do not criticise we as actor the _ chicago time _ say that if buntline have actually spend four hour in write that play it be difficult for any one to see what he have be do all the time buntline as cale durg be kill in the second act after a long temperance speech and the _ inter-ocean _ say that it be to be regret that he have not be kill in the first act the company however be very good and mdlle morlacchus as pale dive particularly fine while miss cafarno spout a poem of some seven hundred and three verse more or less of which the reader will be glad to know that i only recall the word i be bear in march we engagement prove a decide success financially if not artistically nixon be greatly surprise at the result and at the end of the week he induce buntline to take he in as a partner in the company the next week we play at debar 's opera house in st loui do a immense business the follow week we be at cincinnatus where the theater be so crowded every night that hundred be unable to obtain admission we meet with equal success all over the country theatrical manager upon hearing of this new and novel combination which be draw such tremendous house be all anxious to secure we and we receive offer of engagement at all the lead theater we play one week at the boston theater and the gross receipt amount to $ 16200 we also appear at niblo 's garden new york the theater be crowd to its utmost capacity every night of the engagement at the arch street theater philadelphium it be the same way there be not a single city where we do not have crowd house we close we tour on the 16th of June 1873 at port jervi new york and when i count up my share of the profit i find that i be only about $ 6000 ahead i be somewhat disappointed for judge from we large business i certainly have expect a greater sum texa jack and myself long for a hunt on the western prairie once more and on meeting in new york a party of gentleman who be desirous of go with we we all start westward and after a pleasant trip arrive at fort mcpherson chapter xxix star texa jack and i spend several week in hunting in the western part of nebraska and at the end of we vacation we feel greatly re-invigorated and ready for another theatrical campaign we accordingly proceed to new york and organize a company for the season of 1873-74 thinking that wild bill would be quite a acquisition to the troupe we write to he at springfield missourus offer he a large salary if he would play with we that winter he be do nothing at the time and we think that he would like to take a trip through the state as he have never be east wild bill accept we offer and come on to new york though he tell we from the start that we could never make a actor out of he although he have a fine stage appearance and be a handsome fellow and possess a good strong voice yet when he go upon the stage before a audience it be almost impossible for he to utter a word he insist that we be make a set of fool of ourselves and that we be the laughing-stock of the people i reply that i do not care for that as long as they come and buy ticket to see we wild bill be continually play trick upon the member of the company and it be he especial delight to torment the super quite frequently in we sham indian battle he would run up to the indian -lrb- the super -rrb- and put he pistol close to they leg would fire at they and burn they with the powder instead of shooting over they head this would make they dance and jump so that it be difficult to make they fall and die -- although they be pay twenty-five cent each for perform the die business the poor super often complain to I about this and threaten not to go on the stage and be kill again if that man wild bill do not stop shoot and burn they leg i would order wild bill to stop he mischief he would laugh and then promise not to do it any more but it would not be long before he be at he old trick again my company know as the buffalo bill combination do a fine business all through the east wild bill continue he prank which cause we considerable annoyance but at the same time greatly amuse we one day at titusville pennsylvanium while burke the business agent be register we name and make arrangement for we accommodation several of we start for the billiard room but be meet by the landlord who stop I and say that there be a party of rough from the lower oil region who be spree and have boast that they be stay in town to meet the buffalo bill gang and clean they out the landlord beg of I not to allow the member of the troupe to enter the billiard room as he do not wish any fight in he house to please the landlord and at he suggestion i call the boy up into the parlor and explain to they the situation wild bill want to go at once and fight the whole mob but i persuade he to keep away from they during the day in order to entirely avoid the rough the member of the company enter the theater through a private door from the hotel as the two building join each other while i be stand at the door of the theater take the ticket the landlord of the hotel come rush up and say that wild bill be have a fight with the rough in the bar-room it seem that bill have not be able to resist the temptation of go to see what kind of a mob it be that want to test the pluck of the buffalo bill party and just as he step into the room one of the bruiser put he hand on he shoulder and say : hello buffalo bill we have be look for you all day my name be not buffalo bill you be mistake in the man be the reply you be a liar say the bruiser bill instantly knock he down and then seize a chair he lay out four or five of the crowd on the floor and drive the rest out of the room all this be do in a minute or two and by the time i get down stair bill be come out of the bar-room whistle a lively tune well say he i have be interview that party who want to clean we out i think you promise to come into the opera house by the private entrance i do try to follow that trail but i get lose among the cañons and then i run in among the hostile say he but it be all right now they will not bother we any more i guess those fellow have find we and sure enough they have we hear no more of they after that another incident occur one night at portland maine bill find it impossible to go to sleep at the hotel on account of the continue talking of some party who be engage in a game of card in a adjoining room he call to they several time to make less noise but they pay little or no attention to he he finally get up and go to the room with the intention of clean out the whole crowd he knock and be admit greatly to he surprise he find the party to be some merchant of the city whom he have meet the previous day they be play poker and invite he to take a hand bill sit down at the table and say that inasmuch as they would not let he sleep he would not mind play for a while provide they would post he a little in the game for he do not know much about it at first he do not play very well intentionally make many blunder and ask numerous question but when morning come he be about seven hundred dollar ahead bill put the money in he pocket and just as he be leave the room he advise they never to wake a man up and invite he to play poker -lrb- illustration : learn the game -rrb- wild bill remain with I until we reach rochester i meet my family there and have buy some property in that city with the intention of make the place my home i ask bill not to cut up any of he caper for i want the performance to go off smoothly as i expect a large audience that evening he of course promise to behave himself when the curtain rise the house be crowd the play proceed finely until the indian fight in the second act when bill amuse himself by he old trick of singe the leg of the super after the curtain drop the super complain to I about it bill 's conduct make I angry and i tell he that he must either stop shoot the super or leave the company he make no reply but go to the dressing-room and change he buckskin suit for he citizen 's dress and during one of my scene i look down in front and see he elbow he way through the audience and out of the theater when i have finish the scene and have retire from the stage the stage-carpenter come up and say : that long-haired gentleman who pass out a few minute ago request I to tell you that you could go to thunder with you old show that be the last time that wild bill and i ever perform together on the stage after the evening 's entertainment i meet he at the osborn house by this time he have recover from he mad fit and be in as good humor as ever he have make up he mind to leave for the west the next day i endeavor to persuade he to remain with I till spring and then we would go together but it be of no use i then pay he the money due he and jack and myself make he a present of $ 1000 besides bill go to new york the next day intend to start west from there several day afterwards i learn that he have lose all he money in new york by play faro also that a theatrical manager have engage he to play a company be organize and start out but as a star wild bill be not a success the further he go the poorer he get this do not suit bill by any means and he accordingly retire from the stage the company however keep on the road use bill 's name and employ a actor to represent he not only on the stage but on the street and elsewhere bill hear of this deception and send word to the manager to stop it but no attention be pay to he message finally bill resolve to have satisfaction and he proceed to a town where the company be to play he enter the theater and take a seat near the stage and watch the performance until the bogus wild bill appear he then spring upon the stage knock the actor clear through one of the scene and grab the manager by the shoulder he throw he over the foot-light into the orchestra -lrb- illustration : get satisfaction -rrb- the other actor scream and yell police the audience could not at first understand what it all mean some of they suppose the affair to be a part of the play wild bill retire from the stage in good order resume he seat and tell they to go on with they show a policeman now appear bill be point out as the disturber of the peace the officer tap he on the shoulder say : i 'll have to arrest you sir how many of you be there ask bill only myself say the policeman you have better get some help say bill the officer then call up another policeman and bill again ask : how many of you be there now two be the reply then i advise you to go out and get some more reinforcement say bill very coolly the policeman thereupon speak to the sheriff who be dress in citizen 's clothes the sheriff come up and say he would have to take he into custody all right sir reply bill i have no objection to walk out with you but i will not go with any two policeman at the court next morning bill state he reason for have act as he have do and the judge fine he only three dollar and cost this be the last time that wild bill appear on the stage he shortly afterwards return to the west and on arrive at cheyenne he visit boulder 's gambling room and sit down at a faro table no one in the room recognize he as he have not be in cheyenne for several year after lose two or three bet he throw down a fifty dollar bill and lose that also boulder quietly rake in the money bill place a second fifty dollar note on another card when boulder inform he that the limit be twenty-five dollar you have just take in a fifty dollar bill which i lose say bill well you need not make any more such bet as i will not go above my limit reply boulder i 'll just play that fifty dollar bill as it lay if it lose it be yours if it win you 'll pay I fifty dollar or i 'll know the reason why i be run this game and i want no talk from you sir say boulder one word bring on another until boulder threaten to have bill put out of the house bill be carry the butt end of a billiard cue for a cane and bend over the table he say : you would rob a blind man then he suddenly tap boulder on the head with the cane with such force as to knock he over with another sweep of the cane he tumble the look-out from he chair and then reach over into the money drawer he grab a handful of greenback and stick they in he pocket at this stage of the game four or five man -- who be employ as bouncer for the establishment to throw out the noisy person -- rush up to capture bill but he knock they right and leave with he cane and see the whole crowd be now close in on he he jump into a corner and with each hand draw a revolver and face the enemy at this moment the bar-keeper recognize he and sing out in a loud voice : look out boy -- that be wild bill you have run against that settle the matter for when they hear the name of wild bill they turn and beat a hasty retreat out of the door and window and in less time than it take to tell it wild

in the black hill in a cowardly manner by a desperado who sneak up behind he while he be play a game of card in a saloon and shoot he through the back of the head without the least provocation the murderer jack mccall be try and hang at yankton dakotah for the crime thus end the career of a life-long friend of mine who in spite of he many fault be a noble man ever brave and generous hearted

because i be anxious to take part in the sioux war which be then break out colonel hill have write I several letter say that general crook be anxious to have I accompany he command and i promise to do so intend to overtake he in the powder river country but when i arrive at chicago on my way west i learn that my old regiment the gallant fifth cavalry be on its way back from arizona to join general crook and that my old commander general carr be in command he have write to military headquarters at chicago to learn my whereabouts as he wish to secure I as he guide and chief of scout i then give up the idea of overtake general crook and hasten on to cheyenne where the fifth cavalry have already arrive i be meet at the dépôt by lieutenant king adjutant of the regiment he have be send down from fort d a russell for that purpose by general carr who have learn by a telegram from military headquarters at chicago that i be on the way i accompany the lieutenant on horseback to the camp and as we ride up one of the boy shout here 's buffalo bill soon after there come three hearty cheer from the regiment officer and man all be glad to see I and i be equally delighted to meet they once more the general at once appoint I he guide and chief of scout the next morning the command pull out for fort laramie and on reach that post we find general sheridan there accompany by general frye and general forsyth _ en route _ to red cloud agency as the command be to remain here a few day i accompany general sheridan to red cloud and back take a company of cavalry as escort the indian have recently commit a great many depredation on the black hill road the fifth cavalry be send out to scout the country between the indian agency and the hill the command operate on the south fork of the cheyenne and at the foot of the black hill for about two week have several small engagement with rove band of indian during the time general wesley merritt -- who have lately receive he promotion to the colonelcy of the fifth cavalry -- now come out and take control of the regiment i be sorry that the command be take from general carr because under he it have make its fighting reputation however upon become acquaint with general merritt i find he to be a excellent officer the regiment by continue scout soon drive the indian out of that section of the country as we suppose and we have start on we way back to fort laramie when a scout arrive at the camp and report the massacre of general custer and he band of hero on the little big horn on the 25th of June 1876 and he also bring order to general merritt to proceed at once to fort fetterman and join general crook in the big horn country colonel stanton who be with the fifth cavalry on this scout have be send to red cloud agency two day before and that same evening a scout arrive bring a message from he that eight hundred cheyenne warrior have that day leave the red cloud agency to join sit bull 's hostile force in the big horn region notwithstanding the instruction to proceed immediately to join general crook by the way of fort fetterman colonel merritt take the responsibility of endeavor to intercept the cheyenne and as the sequel show he perform a very important service he select five hundred man and horse and in two hour we be make a forced march back to hat or war-bonnet creek -- the intention be to reach the main indian trail run to the north across that creek before the cheyenne could get there we arrive there the next night and at daylight the follow morning July 17th 1876 i go out on a scout and find that the indian have not yet cross the creek on my way back to the command i discover a large party of indian which prove to be the cheyenne come up from the south and i hurry to the camp with this important information the cavalryman quietly mount they horse and be order to remain out of sight while general merritt accompany by two or three _ aide _ and myself go out on a little tour of observation to a neighbor hill from the summit of which we see that the indian be approach almost directly towards we presently fifteen or twenty of they dash off to the west in the direction from which we have come the night before and upon closer observation with we field glass we discover two mount soldier evidently carry dispatch for we push forward on we trail the indian be evidently endeavor to intercept these two man and general merritt fear that they would accomplish they object he do not think it advisable to send out any soldier to the assistance of the courier for fear that would show to the indian that there be troops in the vicinity who be wait for they i finally suggest that the best plan be to wait until the courier come closer to the command and then just as the indian be about to charge to let I take the scout and cut they off from the main body of the cheyenne who be come over the divide all right cody say the general if you can do that go ahead i rush back to the command jump on my horse pick out fifteen man and return with they to the point of observation i tell general merritt to give we the word to start out at the proper time and presently he sing out : go in now cody and be quick about it they be go to charge on the courier the two messenger be not over four hundred yard from we and the indian be only about two hundred yard behind they we instantly dash over the bluff and advance on a gallop towards the indian a run fight last several minute during which we drive the enemy some little distance and kill three of they number the rest of they ride off towards the main body which have come into plain sight and halt upon see the skirmish that be go on we be about half a mile from general merritt and the indian whom we be chase suddenly turn upon we and another lively skirmish take place one of the indian who be handsomely decorate with all the ornament usually worn by a war chief when engage in a fight sing out to I in he own tongue : i know you pa-he-haska if you want to fight come ahead and fight I the chief be ride he horse back and forth in front of he man as if to banter I and i conclude to accept the challenge i galloped towards he for fifty yard and he advance towards I about the same distance both of we ride at full speed and then when we be only about thirty yard apart i raise my rifle and fire he horse fall to the ground have be kill by my bullet almost at the same instant my own horse go down he have step into a hole the fall do not hurt I much and i instantly spring to my foot the indian have also recover himself and we be now both on foot and not more than twenty pace apart we fire at each other simultaneously my usual luck do not desert I on this occasion for he bullet miss I while mine strike he in the breast he reel and fall but before he have fairly touch the ground i be upon he knife in hand and have drive the keen-edged weapon to its hilt in he heart jerk he war-bonnet off i scientifically scalp he in about five seconds the whole affair from begin to end occupied but little time and the indian see that i be some little distance from my company now come charge down upon I from a hill in hope of cut I off general merritt have witness the duel and realize the danger i be in order colonel mason with company k to hurry to my rescue the order come none too soon for have it be give one minute later i would have have not less than two hundred indian upon I as the soldier come up i swing the indian chieftain 's top-knot and bonnet in the air and shout : _ the first scalp for custer _ general merritt see that he could not now ambush the indian order the whole regiment to charge upon they they make a stubborn resistance for a little while but it be of no use for any eight hundred or even sixteen hundred indian to try and check a charge of the gallant old fifth cavalry and they soon come to that conclusion and begin a run retreat towards red cloud agency for thirty-five mile we drive they push they so hard that they be oblige to abandon they loose horse they camp equipage and everything else we drive they into the agency and follow in ourselves notwithstanding the possibility of we have to encounter the thousand of indian at that point we be uncertain whether or not the other agency indian have determine to follow the example of the cheyenne and strike out upon the war-path but that make no difference with the fifth cavalry for they would have fight they all if necessary it be dark when we ride into the agency where we find thousand of indian collect together but they manifest no disposition to fight -lrb- illustration : a duel with chief yellow hand -rrb- while at the agency i learn the name of the indian chief whom i have kill in the morning it be yellow hand a son of old cut-nose -- a lead chief of the cheyenne cut-nose have learn that i have kill he son send a white interpreter to I with a message to the effect that he would give I four mule if i would turn over to he yellow hand 's war-bonnet gun pistol ornament and other paraphernalia which i have capture i send back word to the old gentleman that it would give I pleasure to accommodate he but i could not do it this time the next morning we start to join general crook who be camp near the foot of cloud peak in the big horn mountain await the arrival of the fifth cavalry before proceed against the sioux who be somewhere near the head of the little big horn -- as he scout inform he we make rapid march and reach general crook 's camp on goose creek about the 3d of August at this camp i meet many old friend among whom be colonel royal who have receive he promotion to the lieutenant colonelcy of the third cavalry he introduce I to general crook whom i have never meet before but of whom i have often hear he also introduce I to the general 's chief guide frank grouard a half breed who have live six year with sit bull and know the country thoroughly we remain in this camp only one day and then the whole troop pull out for the tongue river leave we wagon behind but take with we a large pack train we march down the tongue river for two day thence in a westerly direction over to the rosebud where we strike the main indian trail lead down this stream from the size of the trail which appear to be about four day old we estimate that there must have be in the neighborhood of seven thousand indian who have make the broad trail at this point we be overtake by jack crawford familiarly know as captain jack the poet scout of the black hill and right here i will insert the follow line write by he just after the custer massacre upon receive from I the follow dispatch : jack old boy have you hear of the death of custer custer 's death do i hear the news from custer well i reckon i do old pard it come like a streak of lightnin ' and you bet it hit I hard i be not no hand to blubber and the briny be not run for year but chalk I down for a lubber if i do not shed regular tear what for now look you here bill you be a bully boy that be true as good as e'er wear buckskin or fight with the boy in blue but i 'll bet my bottom dollar ye have no trouble to muster a tear or perhaps a hundred at the news of the death of custer he always think well of you pard and have it be heaven 's will in a few more day you would meet he and he would welcome he old scout bill for if ye remember at hat creek i meet ye with general carr we talk of the brave young custer and recount he deed of war but little we know even then pard -lrb- and that be just two week ago -rrb- how little we dream of disaster or that he have meet the foe -- that the fearless reckless hero so loved by the whole frontier have die on the field of battle in this we centennial year i serve with he in the army in the darkest day of the war : and i reckon ye know he record for he be we guide star and the boy who gather round he to charge in the early morn war just like the brave who perish with he on the little horn and where be the satisfaction and how will the boy get square by give the red more rifle invite they to take more hair we want no scout no trapper nor man who know the frontier phil old boy you be mistaken _ we must have the volunteer _ never mind that two hundred thousand but give we a hundred instead send five thousand man towards reno and soon we will not leave a red it will save uncle sam lot of money in fortress we need not invest jest wollup the devil this summer and the miner will do all the rest the black hill be fill with miner the big horn will soon be as full and which will show the most danger to crazy horse and old sit bull a band of ten thousand frontier man or a couple of fort with a few of the boy in the east now enlist -- friend cody i leave it with you they talk of peace with these demon by feed and clothing they well : i would as soon think a angel from heaven would reign with contentment in h -- l and one day the quaker will answer before the great judge of we all for the death of daring young custer and the boy who round he do fall perhaps i be judge they harshly but i mean what i be tell ye pard i be let they down mighty easy perhaps they may think it be hard but i tell you the day be approach -- the boy be begin to muster -- that day of the great retribution the day of revenge for we custer and i will be with you friend cody my weight will go in with the boy i share all they hardship last winter i share all they sorrow and joy tell they i be come friend william i trust i will meet you ere long regard to the boy in the mountain yours ever in friendship still strong jack be a new man in the country but evidently have plenty of nerve and pluck as he have bring dispatch from fort fetterman a distance of 300 mile through a dangerous indian country the dispatch be for general crook and notify he that general terry be to operate with a large command south of the yellowstone and that the two command would probably consolidate somewhere on the rosebud jack at once hunt I up and give I a letter from general sheridan inform I that he have appoint he -lrb- jack -rrb- as one of the scout while we be converse jack inform I that he have bring I a present from colonel jone of cheyenne and that he have it in he saddle-pocket ask the nature of the gift he reply that it be only a bottle of good whiskey i place my hand over he mouth and tell he to keep still and not to whisper it even to the wind for there be too many dry man around we and only when alone with he do i dare to have he take the treasure from he saddle-pocket in this connection i may remark that jack crawford be the only man i have ever know that could have bring that bottle of whiskey through without _ accident _ befall it for he be one of the very few teetotal scout i ever meet not wish to have a game of whiskey _ solitaire _ i invite general carr to sample the bottle with I we soon find a secluded spot and dismount we think we be go to have a nice little drink all by ourselves when who should ride up but mr lathrop the reporter of the associated press of the pacific slope -- to whom we have give the name of the death rattler -- and who be also know in san francisco as the man with the iron jaw he have with the true nose of a reporter smell the whiskey from afar off and have come to interview it he be a good fellow withal and we be glad to have he join we now to resume : for two or three day we push on but we do not seem to gain much on the indian as they be evidently make about the same march that we be on the fourth or fifth morning of we pursuit i ride ahead of the command about ten mile and mount a hill i scan the country far and wide with my field glass and discover a immense column of dust rise about ten mile further down the creek and soon i notice a body of man march towards I that at first i believe to be the indian of whom we be in pursuit but subsequently they prove to be general terry 's command i send back word to that effect to general crook by a scout who have accompany I but after he have depart i observe a band of indian on the opposite side of the creek and also another party directly in front of I this lead I to believe that i have make a mistake but shortly afterwards my attention be attract by the appearance of a body of soldier who be form into a skirmish line and then i become convinced that it be general terry 's command after all and that the red-skin whom i have see be some of he friendly indian scout who have mistake I for a sioux and flee back to they command terribly excited shout the sioux be come general terry at once come to the post and order the seventh cavalry to form line of battle across the rosebud he also order up he artillery and have they prepare for action doubtless dread another custer massacre i afterwards learn the indian have see the dust raise by general crook 's force and have report that the sioux be come these maneuver i witness from my position with considerable amusement think the command must be badly demoralize when one man could cause a whole army to form line of battle and prepare for action have enjoy the situation to my heart 's content i gallop down towards the skirmish line wave my hat and when within about one hundred yard of the troops colonel weir of the seventh cavalry gallop out and meet I he recognize I at once and accompany I inside the line then he sing out boy here 's buffalo bill some of you old soldier know he give he a cheer thereupon the regiment give three rousing cheer and it be follow up all along the line colonel weir present I to general terry and in answer to he question i inform he that the alarm of indian which have be give be a false one as the dust see by he scout be cause by general crook 's troops general terry thereupon ride forward to meet general crook and i accompany he at he request that night both command go into camp on the rosebud general terry have he wagon train with he and everything to make life comfortable on a indian campaign he have large wall tent and portable bed to sleep in and large hospital tent for dining-room he camp look very comfortable and attractive and present a great contrast to that of general crook who have for he headquarters only one small fly tent and whose cooking utensil consist of a quart cup -- in which he make he coffee himself -- and a stick upon which he broil he bacon when i compare the two camp i come to the conclusion that general crook be a indian fighter for it be evident that he have learn that to follow and fight indian a body of man must travel lightly and not be detain by a wagon train or heavy luggage of any kind that evening general terry order general mile to take he regiment the fifth infantry and return by a forced march to the yellowstone and proceed down that river by steamboat to the mouth of powder river to intercept the indian in case they attempt to cross the yellowstone general mill make a forced march that night of thirty-five mile which be splendid travel for a infantry regiment through a mountainous country general crook and terry spend that evening and the next day in council and on the follow morning both command move out on the indian trail although general terry be the senior officer he do not assume command of both expedition but leave general crook in command of he own troops although they operate together we cross the tongue river to powder river and proceed down the latter stream to a point twenty mile from its junction with the yellowstone where the indian trail turn to the southeast in the direction of the black hill the two command now be nearly out of supplies the trail be abandon and the troops keep on down powder river to its confluence with the yellowstone and remain there several day here we meet general mill who report that no indian have as yet cross the yellowstone several steamboat soon arrive with a large quantity of supplies and once more the boy in blue be make happy chapter xxxi dangerous work one evening while we be in camp on the yellowstone at the mouth of powder river i be inform that the commanding officer have select loui richard a half breed and myself to accompany general mill on a scout expedition on the steamer far west down the yellowstone as far as glendive creek we be to ride on the pilot house and keep a sharp lookout on both side of the river for indian trail that might have cross the stream the idea of scout on a steamboat be indeed a novel one to I and i anticipate a pleasant trip at daylight next morning we report on board the steamer to general mill who have with he four or five company of he regiment we be somewhat surprise when he ask we where we horse be as we have not suppose that horse would be need if the scout be to be do on the steamer he say we might need they before we get back and thereupon we have the animal bring on board in a few minute we be boom down the river at the rate of about twenty mile a hour the steamer far west be command by captain grant marsh whom i find to be a brick i have often hear of he for he be and be yet one of the best know river captain in the country he it be who with he steamer the far west transport the wound man from the battle of the little big horn to fort abraham lincoln on the missourus river and on that trip he make the fastest steamboat time on record he be a skillful and experienced pilot handle he boat with remarkable dexterity while richard and myself be at we station on the pilot house the steamer with a full head of steam go fly past island around bend over sand bar at a rate that be exhilarating presently i think i could see horse grazing in a distant bend of the river and i report the fact to general mill who ask captain marsh if he could land the boat near a large tree which he point out to he -lrb- illustration : scout on a steamboat -rrb- yes sir i can land she there and make she climb the tree if necessary say he on reach the spot designate general mill order two company ashore while richard and myself be order to take we horse off the boat and push out as rapidly as possible to see if there be indian in the vicinity while we be get ashore captain marsh remark that if there be only a good heavy dew on the grass he would shoot the steamer ashore and take we on the scout without the trouble of leave the boat it be a false alarm however as the object we have see prove to be indian grave quite a large number of brave who have probably be kill in some battle have be bury on scaffold accord to the indian custom and some of they clothing have be tear loose from the body by the wolf and be wave in the air on arrive at glendive creek we find that colonel rice and he company of the fifth infantry who have be send there by general mill have build quite a good little fort with they trowel-bayonet -- a weapon which colonel rice be the inventor of and which be by the way a very useful implement of war as it can be use for a shovel in throw up intrenchment and can be profitably utilize in several other way on the day previous to we arrival colonel rice have a fight with a party of indian and have kill two or three of they at long range with he rodman cannon the far west be to remain at glendive over night and general mill wish to send dispatch back to general terry at once at he request i take the dispatch and ride seventy-five mile that night through the bad land of the yellowstone and reach general terry 's camp next morning after have nearly broken my neck a dozen time or more there be but little prospect of any more fighting i determine to go east as soon as possible to organize a new dramatic combination and have a new drama write for I base upon the sioux war this i know would be a pay investment as the sioux campaign have excite considerable interest so i start down the river on the steamer yellowstone _ en route _ to fort beauford on the same morning general terry and crook pull out for powder river to take up the old indian trail which we have recently leave the steamer have proceed down the stream about twenty mile when it be meet by another boat on its way up the river have on board general whistler and some fresh troops for general terry 's command both boat land and almost the first person i meet be my old friend and partner texa jack who have be send out as a dispatch carrier for the _ new york herald _ general whistler upon learn that general terry have leave the yellowstone ask I to carry to he some important dispatch from general sheridan and although i object he insist upon my perform this duty say that it would only detain I a few hour longer as a extra inducement he offer I the use of he own thorough-bred horse which be on the boat i finally consent to go and be soon speed over the rough and hilly country towards powder river and i deliver the dispatch to general terry that same evening general whistler 's horse although a good animal be not use to such hard ride and be far more exhaust by the journey than i be after i have take a lunch general terry ask I if i would carry some dispatch back to general whistler and i reply that i would captain smith general terry 's aid-de-camp offer I he horse for the trip and it prove to be a excellent animal for i ride he that same night forty mile over the bad land in four hour and reach general whistler 's steamboat at one o'clock during my absence the indian have make they appearance on the different hill in the vicinity and the troops from the boat have have several skirmish with they when general whistler have finish read the dispatch he say : cody i want to send information to general terry concern the indian who have be skirmish around here all day i have be try all the evening long to induce some one to carry my dispatch to he but no one seem willing to undertake the trip and i have get to fall back on you it be ask a great deal i know as you have just ridden eighty mile but it be a case of necessity and if you 'll go cody i 'll see that you be well pay for it never mind about the pay say i but get you dispatch ready and i 'll start at once in a few minute he hand I the package and mount the same horse which i have ride from general terry 's camp i strike out for my destination it be two o'clock in the morning when i leave the boat and at eight o'clock i ride into general terry 's camp just as he be about to march -- have make one hundred and twenty mile in twenty-two hour general terry after read the dispatch halt he command and then ride on and overtake general crook with whom he hold a council the result be that crook 's command move on in the direction which they have be pursue while terry 's force march back to the yellowstone and cross the river on steamboat at the urgent request of general terry i accompany the command on a scout in the direction of the dry fork of the missourus where it be expect we would strike some indian the first march out from the yellowstone be make in the night as we wish to get into the hill without be discover by the sioux scout after march three day a little to the east of north we reach the buffalo range and discover fresh sign of indian who have evidently be kill buffalo general terry now call on I to carry dispatch to colonel rice who be still camp at the mouth of glendive creek on the yellowstone -- distant about eighty mile from we night have set in with a storm and a drizzling rain be fall when at ten o'clock i start on this ride through a section of country with which i be entirely unacquainted i travel through the darkness a distance of about thirty-five mile and at daylight i ride into a secluded spot at the head of a ravine where stand a bunch of ash tree and there i conclude to remain till night for i consider it a dangerous undertaking to cross the wide prairie in broad daylight -- especially as my horse be a poor one -lrb- illustration : close quarter -rrb- i accordingly unsaddled my animal and eat a hearty breakfast of bacon and hard tack which i have store in the saddle-pockets then after take a smoke i lay down to sleep with my saddle for a pillow in a few minute i be in the land of dream after sleep some time -- i can not tell how long -- i be suddenly awaken by a roar rumble sound i instantly seize my gun spring to my horse and hurriedly secrete he in the brush then i climb up the steep side of the bank and cautiously look over the summit in the distance i see a large herd of buffalo which be be chase and fire at by twenty or thirty indian occasionally a buffalo would drop out of the herd but the indian keep on until they have kill ten or fifteen they then turn back and begin to cut up they game i saddle my horse and tie he to a small tree where i could reach he conveniently in case the indian should discover I by find my trail and follow it i then crawl carefully back to the summit of the bluff and in a conceal position watch the indian for two hour during which time they be occupy in cut up the buffalo and pack the meat on they pony when they have finish this work they ride off in the direction whence they have come and on the line which i have propose to travel it appear evident to I that they camp be located somewhere between I and glendive creek but i have no idea of abandon the trip on that account i wait till nightfall before resume my journey and then i bear off to the east for several mile and by make a semi-circle to avoid the indian i get back on my original course and then push on rapidly to colonel rice 's camp which i reach just at daylight colonel rice have be fight indian almost every day since he have be encamp at this point and he be very anxious to notify general terry of the fact of course i be request to carry he dispatch after remain at glendive a single day i start back to find general terry and on the third day out i overhaul he at the head of deer creek while on he
