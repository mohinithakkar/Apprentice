alexander nikolayevich ostróvsky -lrb- 1823-86 -rrb- be the great russian dramatist of the central decade of the nineteenth century of the year when the realistic school be all-powerful in russian literature of the period when turgénev dostoyevsky and tolstoy create a literature of prose fiction that have have no superior in the world 's history he work in the drama take its place beside theirs in the novel obviously inferior as it be in certain way it yet shed light on a important side of russian life that they leave practically untouched turgénev and tolstoy be gentleman by birth and write of the fortune of the russian nobility or of the peasant whose village border on the noble ' estate dostoyevsky though not of this landed-proprietor school still deal with the nobility albeit with its waif and stray none of these master more than touch the russian merchant that homespun moneyed class crude and coarse grasp and mean without the idealism of they educate neighbor in the city or the homely charm of the peasant from whom they themselves spring yet gifted with a rough force and determination not often find among the cultivate aristocracy this be the field that ostróvsky make peculiarly he own with this merchant class ostróvsky be familiar from he childhood bear in 1823 he be the son of a lawyer do business among the moscow tradesman after finish he course at the gymnasium and spending three year at the university of moscow he enter the civil service in 1843 as a employee of the court of conscience in moscow from which he transfer two year later to the court of commerce where he continue until he be discharge from the service in 1851 hence both by he home life and by he professional training he be bring into contact with type such as bolshóv and rizpolozhensky in it be a family affair -- we 'll settle it ourselves as a boy of seventeen ostróvsky have already develop a passion for the theater he literary career begin in the year 1847 when he read to a group of moscow man of letter he first experiment in dramatic composition in this same year he print one scene of a family affair which appear in complete form three year later in 1850 and establish its author 's reputation as a dramatist of undoubted talent unfortunately by its mordant but true picture of commercial moral it arouse against he the most bitter feeling among the moscow merchant discussion of the play in the press be prohibit and representation of it on the stage be out of the question it be reprint only in 1859 and then at the instance of the censorship in a altered form in which a police officer appear at the end of the play as a _ deus ex machina _ arrest podkhalyúzin and announce that he will be send to siberia in this mangled version the play be act in 1861 in its original text it do not appear on the stage until 1881 besides all this the drama be the cause of the dismissal of ostróvsky from the civil service in 1851 the whole episode illustrate the difficulty under which the great writer of russium have constantly labor under a despotic government begin with 1852 ostróvsky give he whole strength to literary work he be exceptional among russian author in devote himself almost exclusively to the theater the latest edition of he work contain forty-eight piece write entirely by he and six produce in collaboration with other author it omit he translation from foreign dramatist which be of considerable importance include for example a version of shakespeare 's tame of the shrew the play of ostróvsky be of varied character include dramatic chronicle base on early russian history and a fairy drama little snowdrop he real strength lay however in the drama of manners give realistic picture of russian life among the russian city class and the minor nobility here he be recognize from the time of the appearance on the stage of he first piece in 1853 and the follow year as without a rival among russian author for the theater of this realistic drama the present volume give four characteristic example the tone of poverty be no crime -lrb- 1854 -rrb- write only four year after a family affair be in sharp contrast with that of its predecessor in the earlier play ostróvsky have adopt a satiric tone that prove he a worthy disciple of gógol the great founder of russian realism not one lovable character appear in that gloomy picture of merchant life in moscow even the old mother repel we by she stupidity more than she attract we by she kindliness no ray of light penetrate the realm of darkness -- to borrow a famous phrase from a russian critic -- conjure up before we by the young dramatist in poverty be no crime we see the other side of the medal ostróvsky have now be affect by the slavophile school of writer and thinker who find in the tradition of russian society treasure of kindliness and love that they contrast with the superficial glitter of western civilization life in russium be vary as elsewhere and ostróvsky could change he tone without do violence to realistic truth the tradesman have not wholly lose the patriarchal charm of they peasant father a poor apprentice be the hero of poverty be no crime and a wealthy manufacturer the villain of the piece good-heartedness be the touchstone by which ostróvsky try character and this may be hide beneath even a drunken and degraded exterior the scapegrace lyubím tortsóv have a sound russian soul and at the end of the play rouse he hard grasp brother who have be infatuate by a passion for ape foreign fashion to he native russian worth just as poverty be no crime show the influence of the slavophile movement a protégée of the mistress -lrb- 1859 -rrb- be inspire by the great liberal movement that bear fruit in the emancipation of the serf in 1861 ostróvsky here depart from town to a typical country manor and produce a work kindred in spirit to turgénev 's sportsman 's sketch or mumu in a short play instinct with simple poetry he show the suffer bring about by serfdom : the petty tyranny of the land proprietor which be the more galling because it be practice with a full conviction of virtue on the part of the tyrant and the crushed nature of the human cattle under he charge the master grim the lowly serf that till he land with lordly pride the first send forth command the second cringe like a slave -- _ nekrasov _ despite the unvarying success of he drama on the stage ostróvsky for a long time derive little financial benefit from they discouragement and overwork wreck he health and be undoubtedly responsible for the gloomy tone of a series of play write in the year follow 1860 of which sin and sorrow be common to all -lrb- 1863 -rrb- be a typical example here the dramatist sketch a tragic incident arise from the conflict of two social class the petty tradesman and the nobility from the coarse environment of the first emerge honest upright nature like krasnóv from the superficial dawdle culture of the second come weak-willed trifler like babáyev the sordid plot sweep on to its inevitable conclusion with true tragic force towards the end of he life ostróvsky gain the material prosperity that be he due there be no theater in russium in which he play be not act -lrb- skabichévsky -rrb- from 1874 to he death he be the president of the society of russian dramatic author in 1885 he receive the important post of artistic director of the moscow government theater the harassing duty of the position prove too severe for he weak constitution and he pass away in the next year as a dramatist ostróvsky be above all else a realist no more thoroughly natural drama than he be ever compose yet as a master of realistic technique he must not be compare with ibsen or even with many less note man among modern dramatist he play have not the neat concise construction that we prize to-day page of dialogue sometimes serve no purpose except to make a trifle clearer the character of the actor or perhaps slightly to heighten the impression of commonplace reality even in sin and sorrow and a protégée whole passage merely illustrate the background against which the plot be set rather than help forward the action itself many play such as a family affair end with relatively unimportant piece of dialogue of other we be leave to guess even the conclusion of the main action : will nádya in a protégée submit to she degrading fate or will she seek refuge in the pond ostróvsky rarely use the drama to treat of great moral or social problem he be not a revolutionary thinker or a opponent of exist society he ideal like that of he predecessor gógol be of honesty kindliness generosity and loyalty in a broad general way to the tradition of the past he attack serfdom not as a isolate leader of a forlorn hope but as a adherent of a great party of moderate reformer thus ostróvsky 's strength lie in a sedate rather commonplace realism one of the most national of author he lose much in translation -lrb- 1 -rrb- he style be racy smacking of the street or the counting-house he be one of the greatest master of the russian vernacular to translate he moscow slang into the equivalent dialect of new york would be merely to transfer broadway association to the ilyínka a translator can only strive to be colloquial and familiar give up the effort to render the vary atmosphere of the different play and ostróvsky 's character be as natural as he language pig-headed merchant apprentice knavish or honest as the case may be young girl with a touch of poetry in they nature who sober down into kindly housewife tyrannical serf-owner and weak-willed son of noble family : such be the material of which he build he entertaining wholesome mildly thoughtful drama man and woman live and love trade and cheat in ostróvsky as they do in the world around we now and then a murder or a suicide appear in he page as it do in those of the daily papers but hardly more frequently in he we can study the life of russium as he know it crude and coarse and at time cruel yet full of homely virtue and aspiration of he complex panorama the present volume give a brief glimpse -lrb- footnote 1 : ostróvsky it may be remark

prolong you dear mamma 's day leon d then i sha not enter the service potápych i shall come directly to the country and here i shall live pot pych you must enter the service sir leon d what be that you say much i must they 'll make I a copying clerk -lrb- _ he sit down upon a bench _ pot pych no sir why should you work yourself that be not the way to do thing they 'll find a position for you -- of the most gentlemanly delicate sort you clerk will work but you 'll be they chief over all of they and promotion will come to you of themselves leon d perhaps they will make I vice-governor or elect I marshal of the nobility pot pych it be not improbable leon d well and when i be vice-governor shall you be afraid of I pot pych why should i be afraid let other cringe but for we it be all the same you be we master : that be honor enough for we leon d -lrb- _ not hear _ -rrb- tell I potápych have we many pretty girl here pot pych why really sir if you think it over why should not there be girl there be some on the estate and among the house servant only it must be say that in these matter the household be very strictly run we mistress owe to she strict life and she piety look after that very carefully now just take this : she herself marry off the protégées and housemaid whom she like if a man please she she marry the girl off to he and even give she a dowry not a big one -- needless to say there be always two or three protégées on the place the mistress take a little girl from some one or other and bring she up and when she be seventeen or eighteen year old then without any talk she marry she off to some clerk or townsman just as she take a notion and sometimes even to a nobleman ah yes sir only what a existence for these protégées sir misery leon d but why pot pych they have a hard time the lady say : i have find you a prospective husband and now she say the wedding will be on such and such a day and that be a end to it and do not one of you dare to argue about it it be a case of get along with you to the man you be tell to because sir i reason this way : who want to see disobedience in a person he be bring up and sometimes it happen that the bride do not like the groom nor the groom the bride : then the lady fall into a great rage she even go out of she head she take a notion to marry one protégée to a petty shopkeeper in town but he a unpolished individual be go to resist the bride do not please I he say and besides i do not want to get marry yet so the mistress complain at once to the town bailiff and to the priest : well they bring the blockhead round leon d you do not say pot pych yes sir and even if the mistress see a girl at one of she acquaintance ' she immediately look up a husband for she we mistress reason this way : that they be stupid that if she do not look after they closely now they 'll just waste they life and never amount to anything that be the way sir some people because of they stupidity hide girl from the mistress so that she may never set eye on they because if she do it be all up with the girl leon d and so she treat other people 's girl the same way pot pych other people 's too she extend she care to everybody she have such a kind heart that she worry about everybody she even get angry if they do anything without she permission and the way she look after she protégées be just a wonder she dress they as if they be she own daughter sometimes she have they eat with she and she do not make they do any work let everybody look say the mistress and see how my protégées live i want every one to envy they she say leon d well now that be fine potápych pot pych and what a touch little sermon she read they when they be marry you she say have live with I in wealth and luxury and have have nothing to do now you be marry a poor man and will live you life in poverty and will work and will do you duty and now forget she say how you live here because not for you i do all this i be merely divert myself but you must never even think of such a life always remember you insignificance and of what station you be and all this so feelingly that there be tear in she own eye leon d well now that be fine pot pych i do not know how to describe it sir somehow they all get tired of married life later they mostly pine away leon d why do they pine away potápych pot pych must be they do not like it if they pine away leon d that be queer pot pych the husband mostly turn out ruffian leon d be that so pot pych everybody hope to get one of we protégées because the mistress right away become he patroness now in the case of these she marry to government clerk there be a good living for the husband because if they want to drive he out of the court or have do so he go at once to we mistress with a complaint and she be a regular bulwark for he she 'll bother the governor himself and then the government clerk can get drunk or anything else and not be afraid of anybody unless he be insubordinate or steal a lot leon d but say potápych why be it that the girl run away from I pot pych how can they help run they must run sir leon d why must they pot pych hm why why because as you be still under age the mistress want to watch over you as she ought to well and she watch over they too leon d she watch we ha ha ha pot pych yes sir that be the truth she be talk about that you be a child just like a dive but well -- the girl be

they ride in carriage with easy spring they live in three-storied house one of they will build a belvedere with pillar in which he be ashamed to show he ugly phiz and that be the end of he and you can not get anything out of he these carriage will roll away lord know where all he house be mortgage and all the creditor will get out of it 'll be three pair of old boot that be the whole story and who be it that he 'll fool just some poor beggar whom he 'll send out into the world in nothing but they shirt but my creditor be all rich man what difference will it make to they rispolózhensky naturally why samsón sílych all that be in we hand bolshóv i know that it be in we hand but be you equal to handle this affair you see you lawyer be a rum lot oh i know you you be nimble enough in word and then you go and mess thing up rispolózhensky but come now samsón sílych if you please : do you think this be the first time for I as though i do not know that already he he he yes i have do such thing before and they have turn out fine they would have send anybody else long ago for such job to the other side of nowhere bolshóv oho what kind of a scheme will you get up rispolózhensky why we 'll see -- accord to circumstance i 'll just take a thimbleful samsón sílych -lrb- _ drink _ -rrb- now the first thing samsón sílych we must mortgage the house and shop or sell they that be the first thing bolshóv yes that positively must be do right away but on whom shall we shove the stuff shall it be my wife rispolózhensky illegal samsón sílych that be illegal it be state in the law that such sale be not valid it be a easy thing to do but you 'll have to see that there be no hitch afterward if it be to be do it must be do thoroughly samsón sílych bolshóv that be it : there must be no loose end rispolózhensky if you make it over to a outsider there be nothing they can cavil at let 'em try to make a row later and try to dispute good legal papers bolshóv but here be the trouble : when you make over you house to a outsider maybe it 'll stick to he like a flea to a soldier rispolózhensky well samsón sílych you must look for a man who know what conscience be bolshóv but where be you go to find he nowadays everybody be watch he chance these day to grab you by the collar and here you want conscience rispolózhensky here 's my idea samsón sílych whether you want to listen to I or not : what sort of a fellow be you clerk bolshóv which one do you mean lázar rispolózhensky yes lázar elizárych bolshóv all right lázar make it over to he he be a young man with understanding and he have some capital rispolózhensky what do you want samsón sílych a mortgage-deed or a purchase-deed bolshóv whichever you can get at the lowest interest rate 'll suit I but do the thing up brown and i 'll give you such a fee sysóy psoich as 'll fairly make you hair curl rispolózhensky set you mind at rest samsón sílych i know my own business but have you talk to lázar elizárych about this thing or not samsón sílych i 'll just take a thimbleful -lrb- _ drink _ bolshóv not yet we 'll talk it over to-day he be a capable lad only wink at he and he understand and he 'll do the business up so tight that you can not get in a finger well we 'll mortgage the house and then what rispolózhensky then we 'll write out a statement that such and such note be due and that we 'll pay twenty-five kopek on the ruble : well then go see the creditor if anybody be especially stubborn you can add a bit and if a man get real angry pay he the whole bill you 'll pay he on the condition that he write that he accept twenty-five kopek -- just for appearance to show the other that be the way _ he _ do you see and the other see the document will agree bolshóv that be right there be no harm in bargaining : if they do not take it at twenty-five kopek they 'll take it at half a ruble but if they will not take it at half a ruble they 'll grab for it with both hand at seventy kopek we 'll profit anyhow there you can say what you please but i have a marriageable daughter i want to pass she on and get rid of she and then my boy it 'll be time for I to take a rest i 'll have a easy time lie on my back and to the

underhanded gang sir bolshóv -lrb- _ turning over the page _ -rrb- one could not get through read they until to-morrow take it away podkhalyúzin they only dirty the paper what a moral lesson for the whole merchant corporation -lrb- _ silence _ rispolózhensky good-by samsón sílych i 'll run home now i have some little matter to look after bolshóv you might sit a little while longer rispolózhensky no confound it samsón sílych i have not time i 'll come to you as early as possible to-morrow morning bolshóv well as you choose rispolózhensky good-by good-by lázar elizárych -lrb- _ he go out _ scene xii bolshóv _ and _ podkhalyúzin bolshóv now consider lázar what trading 's like : just think about it you think it be get money for nothing money not much they tell you be not see any for a long time take my note they say but what be you go to get from some people on a note here i have about a hundred thousand ruble ' worth of 'em lie around and with protest you do not do anything but add to the heap each year if you want i 'll sell you the whole pile for half a ruble in silver you 'll never catch the man who sign 'em even with bloodhound some have die off some have run away there be not even a single man to put in the pen suppose you do send one there lázar that do not do you any good some of 'em will hold on so that you can not smoke 'em out i be all right here they say you go hang be not that so lázar podkhalyúzin just so that be the way it happen bolshóv always note note but what on earth be a note absolutely nothing but paper if i may say so and if you discount it they do it at a rate that make you belly ache and you pay for it later with you own property -lrb- _ after a brief silence _ -rrb- it be better not to have dealings with provincial : always on credit always on credit and if he ever do bring the money it be in slick small change -- you look and there be neither head nor tail to the coin and the denomination 's rub off long ago but do as you please here you would better not show you goods to the tradesman of this place any one of 'em 'll go into any warehouse and sniff and peck and peck and then clear out it would be all right if there be no goods but what do you expect a man to trade in i have get one apothecary shop one dry goods the third a grocery no use none of they pay you need not even go to the market they cut the price down worse than the devil know what but if you sell a horse-collar you have to throw in trimming and earnest money and treat the fellow and stand all sort of loss through wrong weight that be the way it go do not you realize that podkhalyúzin seem i ought to realize it sir bolshóv there be business for you and that be the way to do it -lrb- _ silence _ -rrb- well lázar what do you think podkhalyúzin what should i think sir that be just as you please my business be that of a subordinate bolshóv what do you mean subordinate just speak out freely i be ask you about the business podkhalyúzin again samsón sílych it be just as you please sir bolshóv you twaddle one thing : as you please but what do you think podkhalyúzin that i can not say sir bolshóv -lrb- _ after a brief silence _ -rrb- tell I lázar on you conscience do you love I -lrb- _ silence _ -rrb- do you love I or not why be you silent -lrb- _ silence _ -rrb- i have give you food and drink set you up in the world have not i podkhalyúzin oh samsón sílych what be the use of talk about it sir do not have any doubt about I only one word : i be just such as you see I bolshóv what do you mean by that podkhalyúzin why if you need anybody or anything whatsoever you can count on I i sha not spare myself bolshóv well then there be nothing more to be say in my opinion lázar now be the most proper time we have a good deal of ready cash and all the note have fall due what be the use of wait you 'll wait if you please until some merchant just like yourself the dirty cur will strip you bare and then you 'll see he 'll make a agreement at ten kopek on the ruble and he 'll wallow in he million and will not think you be worth spit at but you a honorable tradesman must just watch he and suffer -- keep on stare here 's what i think lázar : to offer the creditor such a proposition as this -- will they accept from I twenty-five kopek on the ruble what do you think podkhalyúzin why accord to my notion samsón sílych if you be go to pay at the rate of twenty-five kopek it would be more decent not to pay at all bolshóv why really that be so you will not scare anybody by a bluff but it be better to settle the affair on the quiet then wait for the lord to judge you at the second come only it be a heap of trouble i be go to mortgage my house and shop to you podkhalyúzin impossible to do it without some bother sir you 'll have to get rid of the note for something sir have the merchandise transfer somewhere further off we 'll get busy sir bolshóv just so although a old man i be go to get busy but be you go to help podkhalyúzin good gracious samsón sílych i 'll go through fire and water sir bolshóv what could be better why the devil should i scratch around for penny i 'll make one swoop and that be a end to it only god give we the nerve thanks lázar you have treat I like a friend -lrb- _ he rise _ -rrb- now get busy -lrb- _ he go up to he and tap he on the shoulder _ -rrb- if you get the thing do properly you and i 'll divide the profit i 'll reward you for the rest of you life -lrb- _ he go to the door _ podkhalyúzin i do not need anything samsón sílych except you peace of mind sir i have live with you since my earliest year and i have receive countless favor from you it may be say sir you take I as a little brat to sweep out you shop consequently i simply must be grateful act ii _ office in the house of
