produce by juliet sutherland gerald tejada and the online distribute proofread team towards the great peace by ralph adam cram littd lld 1922 introduction for the course of lecture i be privileged to deliver at this time i desire to take in some sense as a text a prayer that come to my attention at the outset of my preparatory work it be adapt from a prayer by bishop hacket who flourish about the middle of the seventeenth century and be as follow : _ lord lift we out of private-mindedness and give we public soul to work for thy kingdom by daily create that atmosphere of a happy temper and generous heart which alone can bring the great peace _ each thought in this noble aspiration be curiously applicable to each one of we in the time in which we fall : the supersession of narrow and selfish and egotistical private-mindedness by a vital passion for the winning of a kingdom of righteousness consonant with the reveal will of god the lifting of soul from nervous introspection to a height where they become indeed public soul the accomplishing of the kingdom not by great engine of mechanical power but by the daily office of every individual the substitution in place of current hatred fear and jealous covetousness of the unhappy temper and generous heart which be the only fruitful agency of accomplishment finally the great peace as the supreme object of thought and act and aspiration for we and for all the world at this time of crisis which have culminate through the antithesis of great peace which be great war i have try to keep this prayer of bishop hacket 's before I during the preparation of these lecture i can not claim that i have succeed in achieve a happy temper in all thing but i honestly claim that i have strive earnestly for the generous heart even when force by what seem to I the necessity of the case to indulge in condemnation or to bring forward subject which can only be controversial if the great war and the greater war which precede comprehend and follow it be the result of many and varied error it matter little whether these be the result of perversity bad judgment or the most generous impulse as they result in the great war so they be a detriment to the great peace that must follow and therefore they must be cast away consciousness of sin repentance and a will to do better must precede the act of amendment and we must see where we have err if we be to forsake we ill way and make a honest effort to strive for something better for every failure i have make to achieve either a happy temper or a generous heart i hereby express my regret and tender my apology in advance contents lecture introduction i a world at the crossroads ii a work philosophy iii the social organism iv the industrial problem v the political organization of society vi the function of education and art vii the problem of organic religion viii personal responsibility appendix a appendix b towards the great peace i a world at the crossroads for two thousand year christianity have be a operative force in the world for more than a century democracy have be the control influence in the public affair of europe and the america for two generation education free general and comprehensive have be the rule in the west wealth incomparable scientific achievement unexampled in they number and magnitude facile means of swift intercommunication between people have all work together towards a earthly realization of the early nineteenth-century dream of proximate and unescapable millennium with the opening of the second decade of the twentieth century it seem that the stage be set for the last act in a unquestioned evolutionary drama man be master of all thing and the failure of the past be obliterate by the glory of the imminent event the great war be a progressive revelation and disillusionment therein everything so carefully build up during the precede four century be try as by fire and each fail -- save the indestructible quality of personal honor courage and fortitude nothing corporate whether secular or ecclesiastical endure the test nothing of government or administration of science or industry of philosophy or religion the victory be those of individual character the thing that stand the test be not thing but _ man _ the war to end war the war to make the world safe for democracy come to a formal ending and for a few hour the world gaze spellbound on golden hope greater than the disillusionment of war be that of the making of the peace there have never be a war not even the thirty year ' war in germany the hundred year ' war in france or the war of napoleon that be fraught with more horror devastation and dishonor there have never be a peace not even those of berlin vienna and westphalium more cynical or more deeply infect with the poison of ultimate disaster and here it be not thing that fail but _ man _ what of the world since the peace of versaille hatred suspicion selfishness be the dominant note the nation of europe be bankrupt financially and the government of the world be bankrupt politically society be dissolve into class and faction either at open war or manoeuvering for position await the favourable moment law and order be mock at philosophy and religion disregard and of all the varied object of human veneration so loudly acclaimed and loftily exalt by the generation that precede the war not one remain to command a wide allegiance one might put it in a sentence and say that everyone be dissatisfy with everything and be show he feeling after varied but disquieting fashion it be a condition of unstable equilibrium constantly tend by its very nature to a point where dissolution be apparently inevitable it be no part of my task to elaborate this thesis and still less to magnify its peril enough have be say and write on this subject during the last two year more than enough perhaps and in any case no think person be unaware of the condition that exist whatever may be he estimate of they significance he interpenetration of they tendency i have set myself the task of try to suggest some constructive measure that we may employ in lay the foundation for the immediate future they may be wrong in whole or in part but at least my object and motive be not recrimination or invective but regeneration nevertheless as a foundation the case must be state and as a necessary preparation to any work that look forward we must have at least a work hypothesis as to how the condition that need redemption be bring about i state the case thus therefore : that human society even humanity itself be now in a state of flux that at any moment may change into a chaos comparable only with that which come with the fall of classical civilization and from which five century be necessary for the process of recovery christianity democracy science education wealth and the cumulative inheritance of a thousand year have not preserved we from the vain repetition of history how have this be possible what have be the sequence of event that have bring we to this pass it be of course the result of the interaction of certain physical material fact and certain spiritual force out of these spiritual energy come event phenomenon that manifest themselves in political social ecclesiastical transaction and institution in war migration and the reshape of state in code of law the organization of society the development of art literature and science in they turn all these concrete product work on the mind and soul of man modify old spiritual impulse either by exaltation or degradation bring new one into play and again these react on the material fabric of human life cause new combination unloose new force that in they turn play they part in the eternal process of building unbuilding and rebuild we unstable and fluctuant world underlie all the varied material form of ancient society as this develop around the shore of the mediterranean be the great fact of slavery : persium assyrium babylonium egypt greece rome all be small sometimes very small minority of highly develop highly privileged individual exist on a great sub-stratum of slave all the vast contribution of antiquity in government and law in science letter art and philosophy all the building of the culture and civilization that still remain the foundation stone of human society be the work of the few free subsist on the many un-free but freedom liberty be a attribute of the soul and it may exist even when the body be in bondage the slave of antiquity be free neither in body nor in soul but with the come of christianity all this be change for it be one of the great glory of the christian religion that it give freedom to the soul even before the church could give freedom to the body of the slave after the fall of the roman empire and with the infiltration of the free race of the north slavery gradually disappear and between the year 1000 and 1500 a very real liberty exist as the product of christianity and under its protection society be hierarchical : from the serf up through the peasant the guildsman the burgher the knighthood the noble to the king and so to the emperor there be a regular succession of graduation but the line of demarcation be fluid and easily pass and as through the church the school and the cloister there be a open road for the son of a peasant to achieve the papacy so through the guild chivalry war and the court the layman if he possess ability might from a humble beginning travel far a epoch of real liberty of body soul and mind and the more real in that limit difference and degree be recognize accept and enforce this condition exist roughly for five century in its swift rise its long dominion and its slow decline that be to say from 1000 ad to 1500 ad there be still the traditional aristocracy now feudal rather than patriarchal or military there be still a servile class now reduce to a small minority in between be the great body of man of a degree of character ability and intelligence and with a recognize status the like of which have never be see before it be not a bourgeoisie for it be make up of producer -- agricultural artisan craft art mechanic a great free society the proudest product of christian civilization with the sixteenth century begin a process of change that be to overturn all this and bring in something radically different the renaissance and the reformation work in a sense together to build up they own expressive form of society and when this process have be complete we find still a aristocracy though rapidly change in the quality of its personnel and in the sense of its relationship to the rest of society a servile class the proletariat enormously increase in proportion to the other social component and two new class one the bourgeoisie essentially non-producers and subsist largely either on trade usury or management and the pauper a phase of life hitherto little know under the christian regime the great body of free citizen that have make up the majority of society during the precede epoch the small land-holder citizen craftsman and artist of fifty different sort have begin rapidly to dissolve have almost vanish by the middle of the seventeenth century and in another hundred year have practically disappear what have become of they of this great bulk of the population of western europe that with the feudal aristocracy the knighthood and the monk have make mediaevalism some have degenerate into bourgeois trader manager and financeer but the great majority have be crush down and down in the mass of submerged proletariat lose liberty degenerate in character become more and more servile in status and wretched in estate so form a huge inarticulate dully ebullient mass cut off from society cut off almost from life itself i must insist on these three factor in the development of society and its present catastrophe : the great predominant central body of free man during the middle age they supersession during the sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth century by a non-producing bourgeoisie and the creation during the same period of a submerged proletariat they be factor of great significance and potential force towards the end of the eighteenth century the industrial-financial revolution begin within the space of a hundred year come all the revelation of the potential inherent in thermo-dynamics and electricity and the invention of the machine that have change the world during the renaissance and reformation the old social and economic system so laboriously build up on the ruin of roman tyranny have be destroy autocracy have abolish liberty licentiousness have wreck the moral stamen freedom of conscience have obliterate the guide and restrain power of the old religion the field be clear for a new dispensation what happen be interesting and significant coal and iron and they derivative -- steam and machinery -- rapidly reveal they possibility to take advantage of these it be necessary that labor should be available in large quantity and freely subject to exploitation that unlimited capital should be forthcoming that adequate market should be discover or create to absorb the surplus product so enormously greater than the normal demand and finally it be necessary that director and organizer and administrator should be ready at the call the condition of the time make all these possible the land-holding peasantry of england -- and it be here that the revolution be accomplish -- have be largely dispossessed and pauperize under henry viii edward vi and elizabeth while the development of the wool-growing industry have restrict the arable land to a point where it no longer give employment to the mass of field labourer the first blast of factory production throw out of work the whole body of cottage weaver smith craftsman and the result be a great mass of man woman and child without defense void of all rights and give the alternative of submission to the dominance of the exploiter or starvation without capital the new industry could neither begin nor continue the exploit of the joint-stock company invent and perfect in the eighteenth century show how this capital could easily be obtain while the paralyze and dismemberment of the church during the reformation have result in the abrogation of the old ecclesiastical inhibition against usury the necessary capital be forthcoming and the foundation be lay for the great system of finance which be one of the triumphant achievement of the last century the question of market be more difficult it be clear that through machinery the exploitation of labor and the manipulation of finance the product would be enormously greater than the local or national demand until they themselves develop they own industrial system the other nation of europe be available but as this process proceed other market have to be find the result be achieve through advertising ie the stimulating in the mind of the general public of a covetousness for something they have not know of and do not need and the exploit of barbarous or undeveloped race in asia africa oceanica this last task be easily achieve through peaceful penetration and the preëmpting of sphere of influence in the end -lrb- ie ad 1914 -rrb- the whole world have so be divide the stimulate market show sign of repletion and since exaggerated profit mean increase capital demand investment and the improvement in labour-saving device continue unchecked the contest for other ' market become acute and world-politic be concentrate on the vital problem of market line of communication and tariff as for the finding or development of competent organizer and director the history of the world since the end of medievalism have curiously provide for this after a fashion that seem almost miraculous the type require be different from anything that have be develop before whenever the qualitative standard have be operative it be necessary that the leader in any form of creative action should be man of highly develop intellect fine sensibility wide and penetrate vision nobility of instinct passion for righteousness and a consciousness of the eternal force of charity honor and service during the imperial or decadent stage courage dynamic force the passion for adventure unscrupulousness in the matter of method take the place of the quality that mark the earlier period in the first instance the result be the great law-givers philosopher prophet religious leader and artist of every sort in the second the great conqueror something quite different be now demand -- man who possess some of the quality need for the development of imperialism but who be unhamper by the restrictive influence of those who have seek perfection to organize and administer the new industrial-financial-commercial régime the leader must be shrewd ingenious quick-witted thick-skinned unscrupulous hard-headed and avaricious yet daring dominate and gifted with keen prevision and vivid imagination these quality have not be breed under any of the mediterranean civilization or that of central europe in the middle age which have inherit so much therefrom the pursuit of perfection always imply a definite aristocracy which be as much a goal of effort as a noble philosophy a August civil polity or a great art this aristocracy be a accept and indispensable part of society and it be always more or less the same in principle and always the center and source of leadership without which society can not endure it be true that at the hand of christianity it acquire a new quality that of service as contingent on privilege -- one might almost say of privilege as contingent on service -- and the ideal of honor chivalry compassion be establish as its object and method of operation even though these be not always achieve but the result be not a new creation it be a institution as old as society regenerate and transform and play a greater and a nobler part than ever before between the year 1455 and 1795 this old aristocracy be largely exterminate the war of the rose the massacre of the reformation and the civil war in england the thirty year ' war in germany the hundred year ' war the war of religion and the revolution in france have decimate the family old in honor preserve the tradition of culture jealous of they alliance and they breeding -- the natural and actual leader in thought and action england suffer badly enough as the result of war with the persecution of henry viii edward vi and elizabeth and the black death include for full measure france suffer also but germany fare worst of all by the end of the thirty year ' war the older feudal nobility have largely disappear while the class of gentleman have be almost exterminate in france until the fall of napoleon iii and in germany and great britain up to the present moment the recruiting of the formal aristocracy have go on steadily but on a different basis and from a different class from anything know before demonstrate personal ability to gain and maintain leadership distinguished service to the nation in war or statecraft courage honor fealty -- these in general have be the ground for admission to the rank of the aristocracy in general also advancement to the rank of the higher nobility be from the class of gentleman though the church the university and chivalry give during the middle age wide opportunity for personal merit to achieve the highest honor through the wholesale destruction of the representative of a class that from the beginning of history have be the directing and creative force in civilization a process begin which be almost mechanical as the upper stratum of society be plane off by war pestilence civil slaughter and assassination the pressure on the great mass of man -lrb- peasant serf unskilled labourer the so-called lower class -rrb- be increasingly relax and very soon the thin film of aristocracy further weaken by dilution break and through the crumble shell burst to the surface those who have behind they no tradition but that of servility no comprehension of the ideal of chivalry and honor of the gentleman no stored-up result of education and culture but only a age-long rage against the age-long dominate class together with the instinct of craftiness parsimony and almost savage self-interest as a class it be very far from be what it be under the roman empire on the other hand it be equally remove from what it be during the middle age in england france and the rhineland under mediaevalism chattel slavery have disappear and the lot of the peasant be a happier one than he have know before he have achieve definite status and the line that separate he from the gentry be very thin and constantly traverse thanks to the accept system of land tenure the guild chivalry the school and university the priesthood and monasticism the renaissance have rapidly change all this however absolutism in government dispossession of land the abolition of the guild and the collapse of the moral order and of the dominance of the church be fast push the peasant back into the position he have hold under the roman empire and from which christianity have lift he by 1790 he have be for nearly three century under a progressive oppression that have undo nearly all the beneficent work of the middle age and make the peasant class practically outlaw while break down its character degrade its moral increase its ignorance and build up a sullen rage and a invincible hatred of all that stand visible as law and order in the person of the ruling class filter through the impoverished and diluted crust of a dissolve aristocracy come this irruption from below in they own person certain of these people possess the quality and the will which be imperative for the organization of the industry the trade and the finance that be to control the world for four generation and produce that industrial civilization which be the basis and the energize force of modernism immediately and with conspicuous ability they take hold of the problem solve its difficulty develop its possibility and by the end of the nineteenth century have make it master of the world simultaneously a equal revolution and reversal be be effect in government the free monarchy of the middle age beneath which lay the well recognize principle that no authority human or divine could give any monarch the right to govern wrong and that there be such a thing -lrb- frequently exercise -rrb- as lawful rebellion give place to the absolutism and autocracy of renaissance kingship and this which be foster both by renaissance and reformation become at once the ally of the new force in society and so further the growth as well as the misery and the degradation of the proletariat in revolt against this new and very evil thing come the republicanism of the eighteenth century inspire and direct in large measure by member of the fast perish aristocracy of race character and tradition it be a splendid uprising against tyranny and oppression and be best express in the personality and the action of the constitutional convention of the united state in 1787 and the state general of france in 1789 the movement be not to be confound with another that synchronize with it that be to say democracy for the two thing be radically different in they antecedent they protagonist they mode of operation and they object while the one be the aspiration and the creation of the more enlighten and culture the representative of the old aristocracy the other issue out of the same _ milieu _ that be responsible for the new social organism that be to say while certain of the more shrewd and ingenious be organize trade manufacture and finance and develop its autocratic and imperialistic possibility at the expense of the great mass of they blood-brother other of the same social antecedent be devise a new theory and experiment in new scheme of government which would take all power away from the class that have hitherto exercise it and fix it firmly in the hand of the emancipate proletariat this new model be call then and be call now democracy elsewhere i have try to distinguish between democracy of theory and democracy of method perhaps i should have use a more lucid nomenclature if i have simply distinguish between republicanism and democracy for this be what it amount to the former be as old as man and be part of the passion for perfection that characterize all crescent society and be indeed the chief difference between brute and human nature it mean the guaranteeing of justice and may be describe as consist of abolition of privilege equality of opportunity and utilization of ability democracy of method consist in a variable and uncertain sequence of device which be suppose to achieve the democracy of ideal but as a matter of fact have thus far usually work in the opposite direction the activity of this movement synchronize with the press upward of the the mass through the dissolve crust of the class and represent they contribution to the science of political philosophy as the contribution of the latter be current political economy it will be perceive that the reaction of the new social force in the case of industrial organization be fundamentally oppose to that which occur in the political sphere the one be work steadily towards a autocratic imperialism and the servile state the other towards the fluctuate incoherent control of the making and administer of law by the untrained the uncultivated and the generally unfit the issue of which be anarchy the industrial-commercial-financial oligarchy that dominate society for the century precede the great war be the result of the first russium today be a exemplar of the second the work out of these two great device of the new force release by the destructive process of the sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth century simultaneously though in apparent opposition explain why when the war break out imperialism and democracy synchronize so exactly : on the one hand imperial state industry commerce and finance on the other a swiftly accelerate democratic system that be at the same time the effective means whereby the dominant imperialism work and the omnipresent and increase threat to its further continuance a full century elapse before victory become secure or even proximate republicanism rapidly extend itself to all the government of western europe but it could not maintain itself in its primal integrity sooner here later there it surrender to the financial industrial commercial force that be take over the control and direction of society become partner with they and follow they aim connive at they scheme and share in they ever-increasing profit by the end of the first decade of the twentieth century these supposedly free government have become as identify with special privilege and as widely sever from the people as a whole as the autocratic government of the seventeenth and eighteenth century while they fail consistently to match they in effectiveness energy and efficiency of operation for this latter condition democracy be measurably responsible for fifty year it have be slowly filter into the moribund republican system until at last during the same first decade of the present century it have wholly transform the governmental system make it whatever its outward form whether constitutional monarchy or republic essentially democratic so government become shifty opportunist incapable and without the inherent energy to resist beyond a certain point the last great effort of the emergent proletariat to destroy not alone the industrial civilization it justly detest but the very government it have acquire by peaceful penetration and organize and administer along its choose line and indeed the very fabric of society itself now these two remarkable product of the new mentality of a social force be fact but they need a intellectual or philosophical justification just as a low-born profiteer when he have acquire a certain amount of money need a expensive club or a coat of arm to regularize he status protestantism and materialistic philosophy be joint nursing-mother to modernism but when by the middle of the last century it have reach man 's estate they prove inadequate something else be necessary and this be furnish to admiration by evolutionism through its doctrine of the survival of the fittest it appear to justify in the fullest degree the gospel of force as the final test and enlighten self-interest as the new moral law through its lucid demonstration of the strictly physical basis of life the descent of man from primordial slime by way of the lemur or the anthropoid ape and the non-existence of any supernatural power that have devise or could determine a code of morality in which certain thing be eternal by right and other than the variable reaction of very highly develop animal to experience and environment it have give weighty support to the increasingly popular movement towards democracy both in theory and in act its greatest contribution however be its argument that since the invariable law of life be one of progressive evolution therefore the acquire characteristic which form the material of evolution and be heritable could be mechanically increase in number by education hence the body of inheritance -lrb- which unfortunately vary as between man and man because of past discrepancy in environment opportunity and education -rrb- could be equalize by a system of teaching that aim to furnish that mental and physical training hitherto absent whether the case be ever so state in set term do not matter very shortly this become the firm conviction of the great mass of man and the modern democracy of method be base on the belief that all man be equal because they be man and that free compulsory secularized state-controlled education can and do remove the last difference that make possible any discrimination in rights and privilege as between one man and another in another respect however the superstition of mechanical evolution play a important part and with serious result neither the prophet nor the camp-follower seem to realize that evolution while undoubtedly a law of life within certain limit be inseparable from degradation which be its concomitant that be to say that as the rocket rise so must it fall as man be conceive bear and mature even so must he die the wave rise but fall again the state wax to greatness wane and the map know it no more each epoch of human history arise out of dim beginning magnify itself in glory and then yield to internal corruption dilution and adulteration of blood or prodigal dissipation of spiritual force and take its place in the annals of ancient history without recognition of this implacable unescapable fact of degradation sequent on evolution the later become a delusion and a instrument of death for the eye of man be blind to incipient or crescent danger content self-secure lose in a vain dream of manifest destiny they be deaf to warning incapable even of the primary gesture of self-defense such be one of the result of nineteenth-century evolutionism and the generation that see the last year of the nineteenth century and the first part of the new basking in its day dream of self-complacency make no move to avert the danger that threaten it then and now menace it with destruction when therefore modernism achieve its grand climacteric in July 1914 we have on the one hand a imperialism of force in industry commerce and finance express itself through highly develop specialist and dictate the policy and practice of government society and education on the other a democracy of form which deny combate and destroy distinction in personality and authority in thought and discourage constructive leadership in the intellectual spiritual and artistic sphere of activity the opposition be absolute the result catastrophic the lack of competent leadership in every category of life find a sufficient explanation in the two opposed force in they origin and nature and in the fact of they opposition in the somewhat garish light of the war and the peace it would not be difficult to feel a real and even poignant sympathy for two cause that be prominent and popular in the first fourteen year of the present century namely the philosophy that base itself on a mechanical system of evolution which predict unescapable irreversible human progress and that religion which deny the reality of evil in the world the plausibility of each be dissipate by the catastrophic event though both still linger in stubborn unconsciousness of they demise the impulse towards sympathy be mitigate by realization of the unfortunate effect they exert on history this be particularly true of evolutionary philosophy which be hold as a article of faith either consciously or sub-consciously by the greater part of western society not only do it deter man from realize the ominous tendency of event but more unhappily it minimize they power to discriminate between what be good and bad in current society and even reverse they sense of comparative value if man be indeed progress steadily from bad to good and so to better and best then the vivid and even splendid life of the last quarter of the nineteenth century with its headlong conquest of the power of nature its enormous industrial development its vast and ever-increasing wealth in material thing must be not only a amazing advance beyond any former civilization but positively good in itself while the future could only be a progressive magnifying of what then be go on just as to quote mr chesterton 's admirable dr pelkin just as when we see a pig in a litter larger than the other pig we know that by a unalterable law of the inscrutable it will some day be larger than a elephantso we know and reverently acknowledge that when any power in human politics have show for any period of time any considerable activity it will go on until it reach the sky nothing but a grave inability to estimate value base on a pseudo-scientific dogma can explain the lack of any just standard of comparative value that be the essential quality in pre-war society extraordinary as be the material achievement of the time beneficent in certain way and susceptible in part of sometime be use to the advantage of humanity they be largely negatived and even reverse in value just because the sense of proportion have be lose the image which might have stimulate reverence have become a fetish there be voice cry in the wilderness against a worship that have poison into idolatry but they be unheard progressively the real thing of life be blur and forget and the thing that be so obviously real that they be unreal become the object and the measure of achievement it be a unhappy and almost fatal attitude of mind and it be engender not so much by the trend of civilization since the renaissance and reformation nor by the compulsion and cumulative influence of the thing themselves as by the natural temper and inclination and the native standard of this emancipate mass of humanity that oppress outraged and degrade for four hundred year have at last burst out of its prison-house and have assume control of society through industrialism politics and social life the saving grace of the old aristocracy have disappear with the institution itself : between 1875 and 1900 the great single leader so fine in character so brilliant in capacity so surprising in they number that have give a deceptive glory to the so-called victorian age have almost wholly die out and the new condition neither foster the development of adequate successor nor give audience to the few that anomalously appear it be not surprising therefore that the new social element that have play so masterly a part in bring to its perfection the industrial-financial-democratic scheme of life should have develop a apologetic therefor and impose it with all its materialism its narrowness its pragmatism its at time grossness and cynicism on the mind of a society where increasingly they own follower be by sheer energy and efficiency acquire a predominant position i be not unconscious that these be hard saying and that few indeed will accept they they seem too much like attempt that which burke say be impossible viz to bring a indictment against a people i intend nothing of the sort out of this same body of humanity which _ as a whole _ have exert this very unfavourable influence on modern society have come and will come personality of sudden and startling nobility man who have do as great service as any of they contemporary whatever they class or status out of the depths have come those who have ascend to the supreme height for since christianity come into the world to free the soul of man this new liberty have work without limitation of caste or race indeed the very creation of the emergent force industrialism and democracy while they be the betrayal of the many be the opportunity of the few take the place as they do of the older creed of specifically christian society and invite those who would to work they full emancipation and so become the servant of god and mankind by the very bitterness of they antecedent the cruelty of they inheritance they gain a deeper sense of the reality of life a more just sense of right and wrong a clearer vision of thing as they be than happen in the case of those who have no such experience of the deep brutality of the regime of post-renaissance society true as this be it be also true that for one who win through there be many who gain nothing and it be and be the sheer weight of number of those who fail of this that have make they influence on the modern life as pervasive and control as it be what have happen be a certain degradation of character a weakening of the moral stamen of man and against this no mechanical device in government no philosophical or social theory can stand a chance of successful resistance while material progress in wealth and trade and scientific achievement become simply a contributory force in the process of degeneration for this degradation of character we be bind to hold this new social force in a measure responsible even though it have so operate because of its inherent quality and in no material respect through conscious cynicism or viciousness indeed it be safe to say that in so far as it be act consciously it be with good motive which add a element of even greater tragedy to a situation already sufficiently depressing if i be right in hold this to be the effective cause of the situation we have now to meet it be true that it be by no mean the only one the emancipation and deliverance of the downtrodden mass of man who owe they evil estate to the destruction of the christian society of the middle age be a clamourous necessity it be a slavery as bad in some way as any that have exist in antiquity and the number of its victim be greater the ill result of the accomplished fact be largely due to the condition of religion which exist during the period of emancipation no society can endure without vital religion and any revolution effect at a time when religion be moribund or dissipate in contentious fragment be destine to be evacuate of its ideal and its potential and to end in disaster now the free of the slave of the renaissance and the post-reformation and they absorption in the body politic be one of the greatest revolution in history and it come at a time when religion which have be one and vital throughout western europe for six century have be shatter and nullify and its place take in the land that see the great liberation by calvinism lutheranism puritanism and atheism none of which could exert a guide and redemptive influence on the dazed horde that have at last come up into the light of day in point of fact therefore we be bind to trace back the responsibility for the present crisis even to the reformation itself as well as to the tyranny and absolutism of government and the sordid and profligate order of society which follow on the end of mediaevalism so then we stand today confront a situation that be ominous and obscure since the very ideal and device which we have hold be the last word in progressive evolution have fail at the crisis and because we who create they and have work through they have fail in character and chiefly because we have accept low ideal and inferior standard impose upon we by social element betray and abandon by a world that could not aid they or assimilate they since itself have betray the only thing that could give they force unity and coherency that be a vital and pervasive religious faith there be those who hold we case to be desperate to whom the disillusionment of peace after the high optimism engender by the vast heroism and the exalted ideal instigate by the war have bring nothing but a mood of deep pessimism the sentiment be perhaps natural but it be none the less both irrational and wicked if it be persist in if it become widespread it may perfectly well justify itself but only so we no longer accept the calvinistic doctrine of predestination we believe and must highly believe that we fate be of we own make for christianity have make we the heir of free-will what we will that shall we be or rather what we _ be _ that shall we will and if we make of ourselves what by the grace of god we may then the victory rest with we it be true that we be in the last year of a definite period on that decline that precede the opening of a new epoch never in history have any such period overpass its limit of five hundred year and ours which come to birth in the last half of the fifteenth century can not outlast the present but these decline year be precede those wherein all thing be make new and the next two generation will see not alone the passing of what we may call modernism since it be we own age but the prologue of the epoch that be to come it be for we to say what this shall be it be not foreordain true if we will it it may be a reign of disaster a parallel to the well-recognized dark age of history but also if we will it may be a new and a true renaissance a rebirth of old ideal of old honor of old faith only incarnate in new and noble form the vision of a old heaven and a new earth be vouchsafe we during the war when horror and dishonor and degradation be shoot through and through with a epic heroism and chivalry and self-sacrifice what if this all do fade in the miasma of versaille and the cynicism of trade fight to get back to normalcy and the red anarchy out of the east there be no fiat of god that fix these thing as eternal even they also may be make the instrument of revelation and re-creation pari and london rome berlin and washington be mesh in the tangled web of the superannuate who can not escape the incubus of the old way and the old theory that be themselves the cause of the war and of the failure of modern civilization but another generation be take the field and we must believe that this have be burn out of they they may have achieve this great perfection in the field they may have experience it through those susceptible year of life just precede military age it do not matter somehow they have it and those who come much in contact in school or college with boy and man between the age of seventeen and twenty-five know and thankfully confess that if they can control the event the future be secure in the harlequinade of fabulous material success the nation of modern civilization suffer a moral deterioration in themselves and in they individual member by a moral regeneration they may be save how be this to be accomplish how humanly speak be the redemption of society to be achieve not alone by change of heart in each individual though if this could be it would be enough humanly speak there be not time and we dare not hope for the divine miracle whereby in the twinkling of a eye we shall all be change still less by sole reliance on some series of new political social economic and educational device there be no plan however wise and profound that can work effectively under the dead weight of a society that be make up of individual whose moral sense be defective either of these two method put into operation by itself will fail act together they may succeed i repeat what i have say before the material thing and the spiritual force work by inter-action and coördinately the abandonment or reform of some device that have prove evil or inadequate and the substitution of something better change to that extent the environment of the individual and so enable he more perfectly to develop he inherent possibility in character and capacity while every advance in this direction react on the machinery of life and make its improvement more possible with a real sense of my own personal presumption but with a equally real sense of the responsibility that rest on every man at the present crisis i shall venture certain suggestion as to possible change that may well be effect in the material form of contemporary society as well as in its method of think in order that the spiritual energy of the individual may be raise to a higher level through the amelioration of a hamper environment and with even greater diffidence other that may bear more directly on the character-development of the individual in follow out this line of thought i shall in the remain seven lecture speak successively on : a work philosophy the social organism the industrial and economic problem the political organization of society the function of education and art the problem of organic religion and personal responsibility i be only too conscious of the fact that the division of my subject under these categorical head and the necessity of special argument if not indeed of special plead have force I to such particular stress on each subject as may very likely give a impression of undue emphasis if each lecture be to be take by itself such a impression would i fear be unescapable i ask therefore for the courtesy of a suspension of judgment until the series be complete for it be only when take as a whole one paper react upon and modify another that whatever merit the course possess can be make apparent ii a work philosophy -lrb- \* -rrb- -lrb- \* this lecture have be very considerably re-written since it be deliver and much of the matter it then contain have be cut out and be now print in the appendix these excision be purely speculative and while they have a certain bearing on the argument and conclusion in the other lecture might very well be prejudicial to they and for this reason it have seem better to remove they from the general sequence and give they a supplementary place by themselves -rrb- the first reaction of the world war be a great interrogation and the technical peace that have follow bring only reiteration why do these thing come and how the answer be as manifold as the clamourous tongue that ask but none carry conviction and the problem be still unsolved accord to all rational probability we have no right to expect the war that befall accord to all the human indication as we see they reveal amongst the ally we have a right to expect a better peace accord to we abide and abound faith we have a right to expect a great bettering of life after the war and even in spite of the peace it be all a _ non sequitur _ and still we ask the reason and the meaning of it all it may be very long before the full answer be give yet if we be search the way towards the great peace we must establish some work theory if only that we may redeem we grave error and avoid like peril in the future the explanation i assume for myself and on which i must work be that in spite of we intention -lrb- which be of the best -rrb- we be lead into the development acceptance and application of a false philosophy of life which be not only untenable in itself but be vitiate and make noxious through its severance from vital religion in close alliance with this declension of philosophy upon a basis that have be abandon by the christian world for a thousand year perhaps as the ultimate reason for its occurrence be the tendency to void religion of its vital power to cut it out of intimate contact with life and in the end to abandon it altogether as a energize force interpenetrate all existence and control it in certain definite direction and after certain definite method the rather complete failure of we many modern and ingenious institution the failure of institutionalism altogether be due far less to wrong theory underlie they or to radical defect in they technique than it be to this false philosophy and this progressive abandonment of religion the wrong theory be there and the mechanical defect for the machine be condition by the principle that lay behind they but effort at correction and betterment will make small progress unless we first regain the right religion and a right philosophy i say this to henri bergson last year in pari and he reply be significant as come from a philosopher yes he say you be right and of the two the religion be the more important if we have this back and in full measure if society be infuse by it through and through and man live its life and in its life philosophy would take care of itself and the nature of we institution would not matter on the other hand without it no institution can be count safe or will prove efficacious while no philosophy however lofty and magisterial can take its place or even play its own part in the life of man or society i must in these lecture say much about institution themselves but first i shall try to indicate what seem to I the more serious error in current philosophy leave until after a study of the material form which be so largely condition by the philosophical attitude the consideration of that religion both organic and personal which i believe can alone verify the philosophy give the institution life and render they reliable agency for good for a work definition of philosophy in the sense in which i use it here i will take two saying one out of the thirteenth century one from the twentieth they be call wise who put thing in they right order and control they well say st thoma aquina philosophy be the science of the totality of thing say cardinal mercier he greatest contemporary commentator and he continue philosophy be the sum-total of reality philosophy be the body of _ human _ wisdom verify and irradiate by divine wisdom the science of the totality of thing : not the isolation of individual phenomenon or even of group of phenomenon as be the method of the natural science but the setting of all in they varied relationship and value the antithesis of that narrowness and concentration of vision that follow intensive specialization and have issue in infinite delusion and unreality philosophy regard the sum-total of reality and it achieve this consciousness of reality first by establish right relation between phenomenon and then abandon the explicit intellectual process by fall back on divine illumination which enable it to see through those well-ordered phenomenon the divine actuality that lie behind inform they with its own finality and use they both as type and as media of transmission and communication so man be enable by philosophy to put thing in they right order and by religion to control they well thus become indeed worthy to be call wise now from the beginning of conscious life man have find himself surround and besiege by un-calculable phenomenon beat upon by force he could not estimate or predict or control he have seek to solve they sphynx-like riddle to establish some plausible relation between they to erect a logical scheme of thing primitive man as worringer demonstrate in he form problem of the gothic strove to achieve something of certitude and fixity through the crude but definite line and form of neolithic art classical man bring into play the vigor and subtlety and ingenuity of intellect in its primal and most dynamic form express through static proposition of almost mathematical exactness the people of the east reject the intellectual-mathematical method and solution and seek a way out through the mysterious operation of the inner sense that manifest itself in the form of emotion with the revelation of christianity come also and of course enlightenment which be not definite and close at some give moment but progressive and cumulative at once speak philosophically the intellectual method of the west and the intuitive method of the east come together and fuse in a new thing each element limit and at the same time fortify the other while the oppose obscurity of the past be irradiate by the revealing and creative spirit of christ so come the beginning of that definitive christian philosophy which be to proceed from syrium anatolium and constantinople through alexandrium to st augustine and be to find its fullest expression during the middle age and by means of dun scotus albertus magnus hugh of st victor and st thoma aquina it be a interesting fact though apart from my present consideration that this philosophical fusion be parallel in the same place and at the same time by a aesthetic fusion that bring into existence the first great and consistent art of christianity this question be admirably deal with in lisle march phillipp ' form and color this great christian philosophy which lay behind all the civilization of the middle age be positive comprehensive and new it demonstrate divine purpose work consciously through all thing with a result in perfect coherency it give history a new meaning as reveal reality and as a thing forever present and never past and above all it elucidate the nature of both matter and spirit and make clear they operation through the doctrine of sacramentalism in the century that see the consummation of this great philosophical system -- as well as that of the civilization which be its expositor in material form -- there come a separation and a divergence the balanced unity be break and on the one hand the tendency be increasingly towards the exaggerated mysticism that have characterize the eastern moiety of the synthesis on the other towards a exaggerated intellectualism the seed of which be inherent even in st thoma himself the new mysticism withdraw further and further from the common life finding refuge in hidden sanctuary in spain italy the rhineland the old intellectualism become more and more dominant in the mind of man and the affair of the world and with the renaissance it become supreme as do the other quality of paganism in art as well as in every other field of human activity the first fruit of the new intellectualism be the philosophy of dr john calvin -- if we can call it such -- augustinian philosophy misread distorted and make noxious by its reliance on the intellectual process cut off from spiritual energy as the sufficient corrective of philosophical thought it be this false philosophy ally with a equally false theology that mislead for so many century those who accept the new version of christianity that issue out of the reformation the second be the mechanistic system or system the protagonist of which be descarte if as i believe calvinism be un-christian the materialistic philosophy that have go on from the year 1637 be anti-christian as the power of christianity decline through the century that have follow the reformation calvinism play a less and less important part while the new philosophy of mechanism and rationalism correspondingly increase during the nineteenth century they control be absolute and what we be today we have become through this dominance couple with the general devitalizing or abandonment of religion and yet be we not leave comfortless even in the evolutionary philosophy engender by darwin and formulate by herbert spencer and the german with all its mistaken assumption and dubious method already there be visible a tendency to get away from the old pagan static system reborn with the renaissance we can never forget that bergson have avow that the mind of man by its very nature be incapable of apprehend reality after this the return towards the scholastic philosophy of the middle age be not so difficult nor even its recovery if we associate with this process on the part of formal philosophy the very evident if sometimes abnormal and exaggerated progress towards a new mysticism we be far from find ourselves abandon to despair as to the whole future of philosophy now this return and this recovery be i believe necessary as one of the first step towards establish a sound basis for the building up of a new and a better civilization and one that be in fact as well as in name a christian civilization i do not mean that with this restoration of christian philosophy there we should rest both revelation and enlightenment be progressive and once the nexus of we broken life be restore philosophical development would be continuous and we should go on beyond the scholastic even as they proceed beyond patristic theology and philosophy i think a break of continuity be effect in the sixteenth century with disastrous effect and until this break be heal we be cut off from what be in a sense the apostolical succession of philosophical verity before go further i would guard against two possible misconception of one of they i have already speak that be the error so frequent in the past as well as today that would make of philosophy however sound however consonant with the finality of reveal religion a substitute in any degree for religion itself philosophy be the reaction of the intellect of man to the stimulus of life but religion _ be _ life and be therefore in many way a flat contradiction of the concept of the intellect which be only a small portion of life therefore limited partial and -lrb- because of this -rrb- sometimes entirely wrong in its conclusion independently arrive at along these necessarily circumscribed line the second possible error be that philosophy be the affair of a small group of student and specialist quite outside the purview of the great mass of man and that it owe its existence to this same class of delving scholar few in number impractical in they aim and sharply differentiate from they fellow on the contrary it be a vital consideration for all those who desire to see life and see it whole in order that they may establish a true scale of comparative value and a right relationship between those thing that come from the outside and meeting those that come from within establish that plexus of interact force we call life as for the source of philosophic truth friar bacon put it well when he say all the wisdom of philosophy be create by god and give to the philosopher and it be himself that illumine the mind of man in all wisdom it be a whimsical juxtaposition but the first pastor of the puritan in america the rev john robinson testify to the same effect all truth he say be of god wherefore it followeth that nothing true in right reason and sound philosophy can be false in divinity i add though the truth be utter by the devil himself yet it be originally of god there be not two source of truth that of divine revelation on the one hand that of science and philosophy and all the intellectual work of man on the other truth be one and the source be one the channel of communication alone be different but truth in its finality the absolute the _ noumenon _ that be the substance of phenomenon be in itself not a thing that can be directly apprehend by man it lie within the ultra-violet ray of he intellectual spectrum the trammel of the body prevent man from know god in himself say philo he be know only in the divine force in which he manifest himself and st thoma : in the present state of life in which the soul be unite to a passable body it be impossible for the intellect to understand anything actually except by turn to the phantasm religion confess this philosophy constantly tend to forget it therefore true religion speak always through the symbol reject because it transcend the intellectual criterion while philosophy be on safe ground only when it unite itself with religion testing its own conclusion by a higher reality and exist not as a rival but as a coadjutor it be st paul who declare that god have never leave himself without a witness and the witness be explicit however cloud in the philosophy of paganism plato and aristotle know the limitation of man 's mind and the corrective of over-weaning intellectuality in religion but thereafter the wisdom fade and pride oust humility with the result that philosophy become not light but darkness let I quote from the great twelfth century philosopher hugh of st victor who deserve a better fate than sepulture in the ponderous tome of migne : there be a certain wisdom that seem such to they that know not the true wisdom the world find it and begin to be puff up think itself great in this confide in its wisdom it become presumptuous and boast it would attain the highest wisdom and it make itself a ladder of the face of creation then those thing which be see be know and there be other thing which be not know and through those which be manifest they expect to reach those that be hide and they stumble and fall into the falsehood of they own imagine so god make foolish the wisdom of this world and he point out another wisdom which seem foolishness and be not for it preach christ crucify in order that truth might be seek in humility but the world despise it wish to contemplate the work of god which he have make a source of wonder and it do not wish to venerate what he have set for imitation neither do it look to its own disease seek medicine in piety but presume on a false health it give itself over with vain curiosity to the study of alien thing precisely : and this be the destiny that have overtake not only the pagan philosophy of which hugh of st victor be speak but also that which follow after st thoma aquina from descarte to hobbe and kant and comte and herbert spencer and william jame the jealously intellectual philosophy of the nineteenth century the materialistic and mechanistic substitute that be offer and accept with such enthusiasm after the great cleavage between religion and life be but the falsehood of they own imagining of which hugh of st victor speak for they be cut off from the stream of spiritual verity and be lose themselves in the desert they have make meanwhile they have play they part in shape the destiny of the world and it be a ill part if we may judge from the result that show themselves in the event that have be record between the year 1800 and the present moment just what this influence be in determine the nature of society of industrial civilization and of the political organism i shall try to indicate in some of the follow lecture but apart from these concrete happening this influence be i be persuade most disastrous in its bearing on human character neither wealth nor power neither education nor environment not even the inherent tendency of race -- the most powerful of all -- can avail against the degenerative force of a life without religion or what be worse that maintain only a desiccated formulum and the post-renaissance philosophy be one and all definitely anti-religious and self-proclaimed substitute for religion as such they be offer and accept and as such they must take they share of the responsibility for what have happen i believe we must and can retrace we step to that point in time when a right philosophy be abandon and begin again there be no impossibility or even difficulty here history be not a dead thing a thing of the past it be eternally present to man and this be one of the sharp differentiation between man and beast the material monument of man crumble and disappear but the spirit that build the parthenon or reim cathedral that inspire st paul on mar ' hill or forge magna charta or the constitution of the united state be _ because of we quality as man _ just as present and operative with we today if we will as that which send the youth of ten nation into a righteous war five year ago or speak yesterday through some noble action that you or i may have witness it be as easy for we to accept and practice the philosophy of st thoma or the divine humanism of st franci as it be to accept the philosophy of mr well or the theory of sir oliver lodge no spiritual thing die or even grow old nor do it drift backward in the dwindle perspective of ancient history and the foolishest say of man be that you can not turn back the hand of the clock it be simply a question of will and will be simply a question of desire and of faith manifestly i can not be expect to recreate in a few word this philosophy to which i believe we must have recourse in we hour of need i have no ability to do this in any case it begin with st paul be continue through st augustine and find its culmination in the great mediaeval group of dun scotus albertus magnus hugh of st victor and st thoma aquina i do not know of any single book that epitomize it all in vital form though cardinal mercier and dr de wulf have write much that be stimulate and helpful i can not help think that the great demand today be for a compact volume that synthesize the whole magnificent system in term not of history and scientific exegesis but in term of life plato and aristotle be so preserved to man and the philosopher of modernism also it be only the magisterial and dynamic philosophy of christianity that be diffuse through many work some of they still untranslated and all quite without coordination save st thoma aquina alone the magnitude of whose product stagger the human mind and in its profuseness defeat its own end we need no more history of philosophy but we need a epitome of christian philosophy not for student but for man such a epitome i be not fit to offer but there be certain rather fundamental conception and postulate that run counter both to pagan and to modern philosophy the loss of which out of life have i maintain much to do with we present estate and that must be regain before we can go forward with any reasonable hope of betterment these i will try to indicate as well as i can christian philosophy teach in so far as it deal with the relationship between man and these divine force that be forever build unbuilding and rebuild the fabric of life somewhat as follow : the world as we know it man life itself as it work through all creation be the union of matter and spirit and matter be not spirit nor spirit matter nor be one a mode of the other but they be two different creature apart from this union of matter and spirit there be no life in the sense in which we know it and severance be death the body say st thoma be not of the essence of the soul but the soul by the nature of its essence can be unite to the body so that properly speak the soul alone be not the species but the composite and dun scotus make clear the nature and origin of this common essence when he say there be on the one hand god as infinite actuality on the other spiritual and corporeal substance possess a homogeneous common element that be to say matter and spirit be both the result of the divine creative act and though separate and in a sense oppose find they point of origin in the divine actuality the create world be the concrete manifestation of matter through which for its transformation and redemption spirit be active in a constant process of interpenetration whereby matter itself be be eternally redeem what then be matter and what be spirit the question be of sufficient magnitude to absorb all the time assign to these lecture with the strong possibility that even then we should be scarcely wiser than before for my own purpose however i be content to accept the definition of matter formulate by dun scotus which take over the earlier definition of plotinus purge it of its element of pagan error and redeem it by christian insight materium primo prima say the great franciscan be the indeterminate element of contingent thing this do not exist in nature but it have reality in so far as it constitute the term of god 's creative activity by its union with a substantial form it become endowed with the attribute of quantity and become secundo prima subject to the substantial change of nature it become matter as we see it it be this materia primo prima the term of god 's creative activity that be eternally subject to the regenerative process of spiritual interpenetration and the result be organic life what be spirit the creative power of the logo in the sense in which st john interpret and correct the early partial and therefore erroneous theory of the stoic and of philo god the son the eternal word of the father the brightness of he glory and the figure of he substance god of god light of light very god of very god begotten not make be of one substance with the father : by whom all thing be make pure wisdom pure will pure energy unconditioned by matter but create life out of the operation of the holy spirit on and through matter and in the fullness of time become incarnate for the purpose of the final redemption of man now since man be so compact of matter and spirit it must follow that he can not lay hold of pure spirit the absolute that lie beyond and above all material conditioning except through the medium of matter through its figure its symbol its phantasm say st thoma : from material thing we can rise to some kind of knowledge of immaterial thing but not to the perfect knowledge thereof the way of life therefore be the incessant endeavor of man sacramentally to approach the absolute through the lead of the holy spirit so run parallel to the slow perfecting of matter which be be effect by the same operation so matter itself take on a certain sanctity not only as something susceptible and in process of perfection but as the vehicle of spirit and its tabernacle since in matter spirit be actually incarnate from this process follow of necessity the whole sacramental system in theology philosophy and operation of christianity it be of its _ esse _ its great original revolutionary and final contribution to the wisdom that man may have for he own and it follow inevitably from the basic fact of the incarnation and redemption which be also its perfect show forth philosophically this be the great contribution of christianity and for fifteen century it be hold implicitly by christendom yet it be reject either wholly or in part by the protestant organization that come out of the reformation and it fall into such oblivion that outside the catholic church it be not so much ignore or reject as totally forget recently a series of lecture be deliver at king 's college london by various carefully choose authority all specialist in they own field under the general title mediaeval contribution to modern civilization and neither the pious author of the address on the religious contribution of the middle age nor the learn author of that on mediaeval philosophy give evidence of ever have hear of sacramental philosophy it may be that i do they a injustice and that they would offer as excuse the incontestible fact that mediaevalism contribute nothing to modern civilization either in religion or philosophy that it be willing to accept the peril of all philosophy outside that of christianity as it be develop under the catholic dispensation be dualism and many have fall into this grave error now dualism be not only the reversal of truth it be also the destroyer of righteousness sacramentalism be the anthithesis of dualism the sanctity of matter as the potential of spirit and its dwelling-place on earth the humanize of spirit through its condescension to man through the making of he body and all create thing its earthly tabernacle give when carry out into logical development a meaning to life a glory to the world a elucidation of otherwise unsolvable mystery and a impulse toward noble living no other system can afford it be a real philosophy of life a standard of value a criterion of all possible postulate and as its loss mean the world 's peril so its recovery may mean its salvation now as the philosophy of christianity be purely and essentially sacramental so must be the operation of god through the church this body of christ on earth be indeed a fellowship a veritable communion of the faithful whether living or dead but it be also a divine organism which live and in which each member live not by the preaching of the word not even by and through the fellowship in living and worship but through the ordain channel of grace know as the sacrament in accordance with the sacramental system every material thing be proclaim as possess in vary degree sacramental potentiality while seven great sacrament be institute to be each after its own fashion a special channel for the inflowing of the power of the divine actuality each be a symbol just as so many other create thing be or may become symbol but they be also _ reality _ veritable media for the veritable communication of veritable divine grace here be the best definition i know that of hugh of st victor a sacrament be the corporeal or material element set out sensibly represent from its similitude signify from its institution and contain from its sanctification some invisible and spiritual grace this be the unvarying and invariable doctrine of historic christianity and the reason for the existence of the church as a living and function organism the whole sacramental system be in a sense a extension in time of the redemption just as one particular sacrament the holy eucharist be also in a sense a extension of the incarnation as it be also a extension in time of the atonement the sacrifice of calvary the incarnation and the redemption be not accomplished fact complete nineteen century ago they be process that still continue and they term be fix only by the total regeneration and perfecting of matter while the seven sacrament be the chiefest amongst a infinity of sacramental process which be the agency of this eternal transfiguration god the son become incarnate not only to accomplish the redemption of man as yet unborn for endless age through the sacrifice of calvary but also to initiate and forever maintain a new method whereby this result be to be more perfectly attain that be to say the church work through the specific sacramental agency he have ordain or be from time to time to ordain through he everlasting presence in the church he have bring into be at pentecost he do not come to establish in material form a kingdom of heaven on earth or to provide for its ultimate come he indeed establish a spiritual kingdom he church in the world not of it which be a very different matter indeed as the century have prove he kingdom be not of this world nor will it be establish here there have be no _ absolute _ advance in human development since the incarnation nation rise and fall epoch wax and wane civilization grow out of savagery crest and sink back into savagery and oblivion redemption be for the individual not for the race nor yet for society as a whole then and only then and under that form it be sure however long may be the period of its accomplishment time be the ratio of the resistance of matter to the interpenetration of spirit and by this resistance be the duration of time determine when it shall have be wholly overcome then time shall be no more see therefore how perfect be the correspondence between the sacrament and the method of life where they be the agent and which they symbolically set forth there be in each case the material form and the spiritual substance or energy water chrism oil the speak word the touch of hand the sign of the cross and finally and supremely the bread and wine of the holy eucharist each a material thing but each represent signify and contain some gift of the holy spirit real absolute and potent so matter and spirit be link together in every operation of the church from the cradle to the grave and man have ever before he the eternal revelation of this link union of matter and spirit in he life the eternal teaching of the honor of the material thing through its agency and through its existence as the subject for redemption so also through the material association and the divine condescension to he earthly and fallible estate -lrb- limit by association with matter only to inadequate presentation -rrb- he make the spirit of god he own to dwell therewith after the fashion of man and how much this explain and justify : man approach and must always approach spiritual thing not only through material form but by means of material agency the highest and most beautiful thing those where the spirit seem to achieve its loftiest reach be frequently associate with the grossest and most unspiritual form yet the very splendor of the spiritual verity redeem and glorify the material agency while on the other hand the homeliness and even animal quality of the material thing bring to man with a poignancy and a appeal that be incalculable the spiritual thing that in its absolute essence would be so far beyond he ken and he experience and he power of assimilation that it would be inoperative this be the true humanism not the fictitious and hollow thing that be the offspring of neo-paganism and take to itself a title to which it have no claim hold tacitly or consciously by the man of the middle age from the immortal philosopher to the immortal but nameless craftsman it be the force that build up the noble social structure of the time and poise man himself in a sure equilibrium already it have of necessity develop the whole scheme of religious ceremonial and given art a new content and direction through its new service by analogy and association all material thing that could be so use be employ as figure and symbol as well as agency through the sacrament and after a fashion that strike home to the soul through the organ of sense music vestment incense flower poetry dramatic action be link with the major art of architecture painting and sculpture and all become not only minister to the emotional faculty but direct appeal to the intellect through they function as poignant symbol so art receive its soul and be almost a living creature until matter and spirit be again divorce in the death that sever they during the reformation thereafter religion have enter upon a period of slow desiccation and sterilization wherever the symbol be cast away with the sacrament and the faith and the philosophy that have make it live the bitter hostility to the art and the liturgy and the ceremonial of the catholic faith be due far less to ignorance of the meaning and function of art and to a inherit jealousy of its quality and its power than it be to the conscious and determine rejection of the essential philosophy of christianity which be sacramentalism the whole system be of a almost sublime perfection and simplicity and the formal sacrament be both its goal and its type if they have be of the same value and identical in nature they would have fail of perfect exposition in the sense in which they be type and symbol they be not this for while six of the explicit seven be substantially of one mode there be one where the condition that hold elsewhere be transcend and where in addition to the two function it be institute to perform it give through its similitude the clear revelation of the most significant and poignant fact in the vast mystery of life i mean of course the holy eucharist commonly call the mass if matter be _ per se _ forever inert unchangeable indestructible then we fall into the dilemma of a materialistic monism on the one hand manichaean dualism on the other even under the most spiritual interpretation we could offer -- that shall we say of those today who try to run with the hare of religion and hunt with the hound of rationalistic materialism -- matter and spirit unite in man as body and soul and in the sacrament as the vehicle and the essence but temporally and temporarily doom always to ultimate severance by death in the one case by the completion of the sacramental process in the other if on the other hand the object of the universe and of time be the constant redemption and transformation of matter through its interpenetration by spirit in the power of god the holy ghost then we escape the falsity of dualism while in the miracle of the mass we find the type and the show forth of the constant process of life whereby every instant matter itself be be change and glorified and transfer from the plane of matter to the plane of spirit if this be so : if the incarnation and the redemption be not only fundamental fact but also type and symbol of the divine process forever go on here on earth then while the other sacrament be in themselves not only instrument of grace but manifestation of that process whereby in all thing matter be use as the vehicle of spirit the mass transcend they all be not only communion not only a sacrifice acceptable before god it be also the unique symbol of the redemption and transformation of matter since of all the sacrament it be the only one where the very physical quality of the material vehicle be transform and while the accident alone remain the substance finite and perishable become in a instant of time and by the operation of god infinite and immortal it be to sacramentalism then that we must return not only in religion and its practice but in philosophy if we be to establish a firm foundation for that newer society and civilization that be to help we to achieve the great peace antecedent system fail and subsequent system have fail in this alone the philosophy of christianity be there safety for it alone be consonant with the reveal will of god iii the social organism society that be to say the association in life of man woman and child be the fundamental fact of life and this be so whether the association be of the family the school the community industry or government everything else be simply a series of form arrangement and device by which society work either for good or ill man make or mar himself in and through society he be responsible for he own soul but if he see only this and work directly for he soul 's salvation disregard the society of which he be a part he may lose it whereas if he be faithful to society and honourably play he part as a social animal with a soul he will very probably save it even though he may for the time have quite ignore its existence man be a member of a family a pupil under education a worker and a citizen in all these relationship he be a part of a social group he be also a component part of the human race and link in some measure to every other member thereof whether living or dead into every organization or institution in which he be involve during he lifetime -- family school art or craft trade union state church -- enter the social equation if society be ill organize either in theory or in practice in any or all of its manifestation then the engine or device by which it operate will be impotent for good defective society can not produce either a good fundamental law a good philosophy a good art or any other thing conversely these when bring forth under a wholesome society will decay and perish when society degenerate in its large estate that be comprehend all the minor group as a nation a people or a era society be always in a state of unstable equilibrium tend either toward better or worse it may indeed be of the very essence of human life but it be a plant of tender growth and need delicate nurture and jealous care a small thing may work it irreparable injury it may reach very great height of perfection and spread over a continent as during the european middle age it may sink to low depths with a equal dominion as in the second dark age of the nineteenth century sometimes little enclave of high value hide themselves in the midst of degradation as venice and ireland in the dark age always by the grace of god the primary social unit the family may and frequently do achieve and maintain both purity and beauty when the world without riot in ruin and profligacy i have take the problem of the organization of society as the first to be consider for it be fundamental if society be of the wrong shape it do not matter in the least how intelligent and admirable may be the device we construct for the operation of government or industry or education they may be masterly product of human intelligence but they will not work whereas on the other hand a sane wholesome and decent society can so interpret and administer clumsy and defective instrument that they will function to admiration a perfect society would need no such engine at all but a perfect society imply perfect individual and i think we be now persuade that a society of this nature be a purely academic proposition both now and in the calculable future what we have to do be to take mankind as it be make up of infinitely varied personality range from the idiot to the super-man cruel and compassionate covetous and self-sacrificing silly and erudite cynical and emotional vulgar and culture brutal and fastidious shameful in they degradation and splendid in they honor and chivalry and by the franchise of liberty and the binding of law facilitate in every way the process whereby they themselves work out they own salvation you can not impose morality by statute or guarantee either character or intelligence by the perfection of the machine every institution good or bad be the result of growth from many human impulse not the creation of autocratic fiat but growth may be impede hasten or suspend and the most that can be do be to offer incentive to action remove the obstacle to development and establish condition and influence that make more easy the finding of the right way now it seem to I that the two greatest obstacle to the development of a right society have be first the enormous scale in which everything of late have be cast and second that element in modern democracy which deny essential difference in human character capacity and potential and so logically prohibit social distinction and refuse they formal sanction or they recognition through confer honor in question the validity and the value of these two factor imperialism and social democracy and in suggest substitute i be i suppose attack precisely the two institution which be today -- or at all event have be until very recently -- hold in most conspicuous honor by the majority of people but the question be at least debateable and for my own part i have no alternative but to assert they mistaken nature and to offer the best i can in the way of substitute the question of imperialism of a gross and unhuman and therefore absolutely wrong scale be one that will enter into almost all of the matter with which i propose to deal certainly with industrialism with politics with education with religion as well as with the immediate problem of the social organism for not only have it destroy the human scale in human life and therefore bring it into the danger of immediate destruction but it have also be a factor in establish the quantitative standard in all thing in place of the qualitative standard and this in itself be simply the antecedent of well-merited catastrophe in consider the social organism therefore we must have in mind that this be intimately affect by every organic institution which man have develop and into which he enter in common with other of he kind the situation as it confront we today be one in which man by he very energy and the stimulus of those cosmic energy he have so astonishingly master have get far beyond he depth i say man have master these energy yes but this be true only of a brief period in the immediate past they now have master he it be the old story of the frankenstein monster over again man be not omnipotent he be not god there be limit beyond which he can not go without come in peril of death a isolate individual here and there may become super-man perhaps though at grievous peril to he own soul and it be conceivable that to such a one it might be possible to live beyond the human scale though hardly if one could envisage so awful a thing as a community make up entirely of super-men one might concede that here also the human scale might be exceed without danger of catastrophe with society as it be and always will be a welter of defective and genius in small number and a vast majority of just plain man with all that that imply the break through into the imperial scale be simply a let in the jungle wall and paling and stockade the delicate fabric of architecture the clever institution of law the thin red line of the army all melt crumble be overcome by the onrush of primordial thing and where once be the white man 's city be now the eternal jungle and the vine and thrust root and rank herbage blot out the very memory of a futile civilization while the monkey and the jackal and the python come again into they heritage alexander and caesar charle v and loui xiv and napoleon and disraelus and william iii could function for a few brief year beyond the limit of the human scale though even they have a end but you can not link imperialism and democracy without the certainty of a earlier and a more ignominious fall i have already speak of the malignant and pathological quality of the quantitative standard it be indeed not only the nemesis of culture but even of civilization itself out of this same gross scale of thing come many other evil great state subsist on the subjugation and exploitation of small and alien people great city which when they exceed more than 100000 in population be a menace when they exceed 1000000 be a crime division of labor and specialization which degrade man to the level of machine concentration and segregation of industry the factory system high finance and international finance capitalism trades-unionism and the international standardized education metropolitan newspaper pragmatic philosophy and church run on business method and recruit by advertising and publicity agent greater than all however be the social poison that effect society with pernicious anemia through cut man off from he natural social group and making of he a undistinguishable particle in a slide stream of grain man belong to he family he neighborhood he local trade or craft guild and to he parish church : the essence of wholesome association be that a man should work with through and by those whom he know personally -- and preferably so well that he call they all by they first name as a matter of fact today he work with through and by the individual whom he probably have never see and frequently would as a matter of personal taste hesitate to recognize if he do see they he belong to the local of a union which be a part of a labor organization which cover the entire united state and be control in all essential matter from a point from one hundred to two thousand mile away he vote for mayor with a group of man less than one per cent of whom he know personally -lrb- unless he be a professional politician -rrb- with another group for state officer and with the whole voting population of the united state for president if he go to church in a city he find himself amongst people draw from every ward and outlying district if he mix in society he associate with those from everywhere perhaps except he own neighborhood only when he be in college in he club or in he secret society lodge or the quarter of he ward boss do he find himself in intimate social relation with human being of like mind and a similar social status he be a cog in a wheel a thing a point of potential a lonely and numerical unit instead of a gregarious human animal rejoicing in he friend and companion and work playing and quarrel with they as god make he and mean he to be and to do of course the result of this be that man be force into unnatural association many of which be purely artificial and all of which be unsound it be true that the trade union the professional society the club be natural and wholesome expression of common and intimate interest but they acquire a false value when they be not balanced and regulate by a prior and more compelling association which cut not vertically but horizontally through society that be to say the neighborhood or community group the harsh and perilous division into class and caste which be now universal with its development of class consciousness be the direct and inevitable result of this imperial scale in life which have annihilate the social unit of human scale and bring in the gigantic aggregation of people money manufacture and labourer where man can no longer function either as a human unit or a essential factor in a workable society it be hard to see just how we be to re-fashion this impossible society in term even nearly approach the normal and the human it be universal and it be accept by everyone as very splendid and quite the greatest achievement of man it be practically impossible for any one today to conceive of a world where great empire populous city mill and factory and iron-works in they thousand and employ they million through they billion of capitalization where the stock exchange and the great banking house and the insurance company and the department store the nation-wide trade union and professional association and educational foundation and religious corporation do not play they predominant part nevertheless they be a aggregation of false value they influence be anti-social and they inherent weakness be so obviously reveal through the war and the peace that it have generally escape notice there seem but two way in which the true scale of life can be restore either these institution will continue grow greater and more unwieldy with increase speed until they burst in anarchy and chaos and after ruin and long rest we begin all over again -lrb- as once before after the bursting of roman imperialism -rrb- or we shall repeat history -lrb- as we always do -rrb- only after another fashion and learning as we always can from the annals of monasticism build we small community of the right shape and scale in the very midst of the imperial state themselves so become perhaps the leavening of the lump this of course be what the monastery of st benedict do in the sixth century and those of the cluniac and the cistercian in the eleventh and it be what the franciscan and dominican try to do in the fourteenth century and fail because the fall of the cultural and historic wave have already begin the trouble today with nearly all scheme of reform and regeneration be that they be infect with the very imperialism in scale that have produce the condition they would redeem socialism be now as completely materialistic as the old capitalism and as international in its scope and method anarchy be become imperial and magnificent in its operation secular reformer must organize vast committee with intricate ramification and elaborate system support by drive for money which must run into at least seven figure and by vast and efficient bureau for propaganda before they can begin operation and then the chief reliance for success be frequently place on legislation enact by the highest lawmaking body in the land even religion have now surrender to the same obsession of magnitude and efficiency and nothing go -lrb- or try to it do not always succeed -rrb- unless it be conceive in gigantic nation-wide term and be put across by efficiency expert highly pay organizer elaborate team of propagandist and solicitor and plenty of impressive advertising a good deal can be buy this way but it will not stay buy for no reform of any sort can be establish after any such fashion since reform begin in and with the individual and if it succeed at all it will be by the cumulative process i shall speak of this element of scale in every succeed lecture for it vitiate every institution we have here where i be deal with society in itself i can only say that i believe the sane and wholesome society of the future will eliminate great city and great corporation of every sort it will reverse the whole system of specialization and the segregation and unification of industry and the division of labor it will build upward from the primary unit of the family through the neighborhood to the small and closely knit and self-supporting community and so to the state and the final unifying force which link together a federation of state in general it will be a return in principle though not in form to the social organization of a mediaeval europe before the extinction of feudalism on the continent and the suppression of the monastery and the enclosure of the common land in england the grave peril of this false scale in human society have be recognize by many individual ever since the thing itself become operative and every utopia conceive by man during the last two century whether it be theoretical or actually put into ephemeral practice have be couch in term of revolt away from imperialism and towards the unit of human scale in every case however the introduction of some form of communism have be the ruin of those project actually materialize for this in itself be imperialistic in its nature communism imply the standard of the gross aggregate the denial of human differentiation and the quantitative standard as well as the elimination of private property and the negation of sacred individuality its institution imply a almost immediate descent into anarchy with a sequent dictatorship and autocracy for it be the reversal of the foundation law of life such reversal can not last nothing can last that be inimical to flourish life it may triumph for a day but life itself slough it off as a sound body rid itself of some foreign substance through the sore that fester burst and the septic condition do away with heal itself and return to normal now the inhuman scale have produce one set of septic condition in society while what be commonly call democratization have produce another we have a bloated society but also we have one in which a false theory have grow up and be put in practice in accordance with which a uniformity of human kind have be assume which never have exist and do not now and in the effort to enforce this false theory the achievement of distinction have be impede leadership discourage and leader largely eliminate the process of level downward carry to a very dangerous point the sane and vital organization of society bring near to a end and a peculiarly vicious scale and standard of social value establish i have urge the return to human scale in human association but this do not imply any admixture of communism which be its very antithesis still less do it permit the retention of the theoretical uniformity and the unescapable leveling process of so-called democracy before the law all man be equal that be they be entitle to even-handed justice before god all man be equal that be they be grant charity and mercy which transcend the law also they possess immortal soul of equal value here they equality stop in every other respect they vary in character capacity intelligence and potentiality for development along any or all these line almost beyond the limit of computation a sane society will recognize this it will organize itself accordingly it will deny to one what it will concede to another it will foster emulation and reward accomplishment and it will add another category to those in which all man be equal that be the freest scope for advancement and the greatest facility for pass from one social group into another the sole test be demonstrate merit i be prepare at this point to use the word aristocracy for we have the thing even now only in its worst possible form the word itself mean two thing : a government by the best and most able citizen and to quote a standard dictionary person note for superiority in any character or quality take collectively there be no harm here but the harm come and the odium also and justly when a aristocratic government degenerate into a oligarchy of privilege without responsibility and when socially it be not superiority in character or quality but political cunning opulence and sycophancy that be the touchstone to recognition and acceptance the latter be the antithesis of christianity and common sense the former be consonant with both and paradoxical as it may seem it be also the fulfil of the ideal of a real democracy since its honor and distinction imply service its relation with those in other estate be reciprocal it be not a closed caste but the prize of meritorious achievement and it be therefore equality of opportunity utilization of ability and the abolition of privilege without responsibility man be forever and gloriously struggle onward towards better thing but there be always the gravitational pull of original sin which scientist denominate reversion to type the saving grace in the individual be the divine gift of faith hope and charity implant in every soul these every man must guard and cherish for they be the way of advancement in character but society be man in association with man in a sense a new and complex personality and the same quality be as necessary here as in the individual society like man may be say to possess body soul and spirit and it must function vitally along all these line if it be to maintain a normal and wholesome existence somewhere there must be something that achieve high ideal of honor chivalry courtesy that maintain right standard of comparative value and that guard the social organism as a whole from the danger of surrender to false and debased standard to plausible demagogue and to mob-psychology the greater the prevalence of democratic method the greater be the danger of this surrender to propaganda of a thousand sort and to the dominance of the demagogue and the existence of a estate fortify by the inheritance of high tradition measurably free from the necessity of engage too strenuously in the struggle for life guarantee security of status so long as it do not betray the ideal of its order but open to accession from other estate on the basis of conspicuous merit alone such a force operating in society have prove and will prove the best guardian of civilization as a whole and of the interest and liberty of those who may rank in what be know as lower social scale but it may be object such a institution as this have never exist every political or social aristocracy in history have be mixed and adulterated with bad character and recreant representative there never have be and never will be a perfect aristocracy quite true neither have there ever be a perfect democracy or a perfect monarchy for that matter as man we work with imperfection but we live by faith and we sole duty be to establish the highest ideal and to compass they in so far as we may with unfailing courage patience and steadfastness the _ ideal _ of democracy be a great ideal but the _ work _ of democracy have be a failure because amongst other thing it have try to carry on without the aid of true aristocracy if the two can be unite first in ideal and in theory then in operation we present failure may be change into victory what after all do this imply so far as the social organism be concern it seem to I something like this first of all recognition of the fact that there be difference in individual in strain of blood in race that can not be overcome by any power of education and environment and can only be change through very long period of time and that these difference must work corresponding difference in position function and status in the social organism second that since society automatically develop a aristocracy of some sort or other and apparently can not be stop from do this it must be protect from the sort of thing it have produce of late which be base on money political expediency and the unscrupulous cleverness of the demagogue and give a more rational substitute in the shape of a permanent group represent high character and the tradition of honor chivalry and courtesy third that character and service should be foster and reward by that formal and August recognition that secure and unquestioned status and those add opportunity for service that will form a real and significant distinction finally that this order or estate must be able to purge itself of unworthy material and also must be freely open to constant accession from without whatever the source and for proved character and service i fear i must argue this case of the inequality in individual potential that inequality that do not yield to complex education or favourable environment for it be fundamental if it do not exist then my argument for the organization of society along line that recognize and regularize diversity of social status and function fall to the ground i affirm that the doctrine of evolution and modern democratic theory to the contrary it do exist and that the mitigating influence of education environment and inherit acquire character be small at best let we take the most obvious concrete example there be certain ethnic unit or race which for period range from five hundred to two thousand year have produce _ character _ and through character the great contribution that have be make to human culture and have be express through man of distinction dynamic force and vivid personality such amongst many be the greek the jew the roman the norman the frank the anglo-saxon and the celt there be other that in all history have produce nothing there be certain family name which be a guarantee of distinction dynamic force and vivid personality there be thousand of these name and they be to be find amongst all the race that have contribute towards the development of culture and civilization on the other hand there be far more that have produce nothing distinctive and possibly never will what be the reason for this be it the result of blind chance of accident that have leave certain race and family isolate in stagnant eddy from which some sudden current of a whimsical tide might sweep they out into the full flood of progress until they then overtake and pass they hitherto successful rival who in they turn would drift off into progressive incompetence and degeneracy biology do not look with enthusiasm on the method of chance and accident the choice and transmission of the forty-eight chromosome that give to each individual he character-potential be probably in accordance with some obscure biological law through which the unfathomable divine will operate now these chromosome may be select and combine after a fashion and with a persistence of continuity that would guarantee character-potential for good or for ill through many generation or they might be so varied in they combination that no distinct trait would be carry over from one generation to another as a matter of experience all these three process take place and be record in family of distinct quality good bad and indifferent if the character-potential be predetermine then manifestly education and environment can play only the subordinate part of foster its development or retard it in the same way the character and career of the various race of man be determine by the potential inherent in the individual and family that compose they and like they the race themselves be for long period mark by power and capacity or weakness and lack of distinction there be certain race such as the hottentot the malay the american indian and mixed blood as the mexican peon and mongol-slav of a portion of the southeastern europe that so far as recorded history be concern be either static or retrogressive there be family unit poverty-stricken and incompetent in naple canton east side new york or opulent and aggressive in west side new york in birmingham westphalium pittsburgh that be no more subject to the cultural and character-creating influence of education and environment -- beyond a certain definite point -- than be the amphibian of africa or the rampant weed of my garden this be a hard say and a provocative the entire course of democratic theory of humanitarian thought and of the popular type of scientific speculation stand against it and the christian religion as well unless the statement itself be guard by exact definition if the contention of the scientific materialist be correct and the thing that make man and that christian call the immortal soul be but the result of physical process of growth and differentiation then slavery would be justifiable and exploitation a reasonable and inevitable process since however this assumption of materialism be untenable and since all man be possess of immortal soul between which be no distinction in the sight of god the situation regrettable if you like be one which at the same time call for the exercise of a higher humanitarianism than that so popular during the last generation and as well for a very drastic revision of contemporary political and social and educational method the soul of the man be the localization of divinity in a sense each man be a manifestation of the incarnation black or white conspicuous or obscure intelligent or stupid offspring of a creative race or bind by the limitation of one that be static or in process of decay there be no difference in the universal claim to justice charity and opportunity the soul of a cantonese river-man of a congo slave of a east side jew be in itself as essentially precious and worth save as the soul of a bishop of a descendant of a norman viking or a irish king or that of a volunteer soldier in the late army of france or great britain or the united state here lie absolute and final equality and the state the law the church be bind to guard this equality in the one case and the other with equal force indeed those of the lower racial and family type claim even more faithful guardianship than those of the higher for they can accomplish less for themselves and by themselves but the fundamental and inescapable inequality in intellect in character and in capacity which i insist be one of the conditioning factor in life be vociferously deny but ruthlessly enforce by the people that will be the first to denounce any restatement of what be after all no more than a patent fact a little less enthusiasm for shibboleth and a little more intelligent regard for history and palpable condition will show that the assume equality between man on the strength of they manhood alone the sufficiency of education for correct the accidental difference that show themselves and the scheme of life that be work out along democratic line on the basis of this essential -lrb- or potential -rrb- equality be fond thing vainly imagine which must be radically modify before the world can begin a sane and wholesome building-up after the great purgation of war that equality between man which exist by virtue of the presence in each of a immortal soul involve a even distribution of justice and the protection of law without distinction of person and a even measure of charity and compassion but it do not involve the admission of a claim to equality of action or the denial of varied status since race-value both of blood and of the _ gen _ enter in to establish difference in character in intelligence and in capacity which can not be change by education environment or heredity within period which be practical consideration with society if we could still hold the old darwinian dogma of the origin of species through the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest and if the equally August and authoritative dogma of the transmission by inheritance of acquire characteristic be longer tenable then perhaps we might invoke faith hope and patience and continue we generous method of imperil present society while we fix we eye on the vision of that to come when environment education and heredity have accomplish they perfect work unfortunately -- or perhaps fortunately -- science be rapidly reconsider its earlier and somewhat hasty conclusion and the consensus of the most authoritative opinion seem to be that we must believe these thing no longer fail these premise on which we have labor so long and so honestly and so sincerely we be again throw back on the testimony of history and we own observation and with this reversal we also be bind to reconsider both we premise and the constitution of those system and institution we have erect on they as a foundation the existence of a general law do not exclude exception the fact that in the case of human being we have to take into consideration a powerful factor that do not come into play in the domain of zoölogy and botany -- the immortal soul -- make impossible the drawing of exact deduction from precedent therein establish this determine touch of the divine which be no result of biological process but stand outside the limitation of heredity and environment and education may manifest itself quite as well in one class as in another for god be no respecter of person as have be say before there be no difference in degree as between immortal soul the point be however that each be link to a specific congery of tendency limitation effective or defective agency that be what they have be make by the parent of the race these may be such as enable the soul to triumph in its earthly experience and in its bodily housing they may be such as will bring about failure and defeat it be not that the soul build itself more stately mansion it be that these be provide for it by the physical process of life and it be almost the first duty of man to see that they be well build again the soul be single and personal as it be not a plexus of inherit tendency so it be not heritable and a great soul show suddenly in the dusk of a dull race contribute nothing of its essential quality to the issue of the body it have make its house the stew of a mill town may suddenly be illuminate by the radiance of a divine soul to the amazement of profligate parent and the confusion of eugenist but unless the unsolvable mystery of life have determine on a new species and so by a sudden influx of the _ élan vital _ cut off the line of physical succession and establish one that be wholly new then the brightness die away with the passing of the splendid soul and the established tendency resume they sway the bearing of this theory on the action of society be immediate through the complete disregard of race-value that have obtain during the last two or three century and the emergence and complete supremacy in all category of life of human group of low potential civilization have be bring down to a level where it be threaten with disaster if recovery be to be effect and a second era of dark age avoid there must be a entirely new evaluation of thing a new estimate of the principle and method that obtain under modernism and a fearless adventure into field that may prove not to be so unfamiliar as might at first appear specifically we must revise we attitude as to immigration exclude whole class and even race that we have hitherto welcome with open hand from the disinterested office of steamship company : we must control and in some case prohibit the mating of various racial stock finally we must altogether disallow the practice of change by law one race-name for another this process be one for which no excuse exist and unless it can be bring to a end then apart from certain physical differentiation on which nature wisely insist we have no guaranty against the adulteration that have go so far towards substitute the mongrel for the pure racial type while society be bind to suffer still further deception and continue danger along the line that have recently be indicate by the transformation of treibitsch into lincoln braunstein into trotsky and samuel into montague for its fulfillment then and its regeneration the real democracy demand and must achieve the creation and cooperation of a real aristocracy not a aristocracy of material force either military or civil nor one of land owner or money-getter nor one of artificial caste all these substitute have be try from time to time in rome china great britain the united state and all have fail in the end for all have ignore the one essential point of _ character _ without which we shall continue to reproduce what we have at present a thing as insolent offensive and tyrannical as the old aristocracy at they worst with none of the constructive and beneficent quality of the old aristocracy at they best that race-value have much to do with this development of character i believe to be true but of far greater efficiency indeed the actual motive force be the christian religion work directly on and through the individual and use race as only one of its material mean of operation democracy have accomplish its present failure not only because it could not function without the cooperation of aristocracy but chiefly because in its modernist form it have become in fact isolate from christianity all in it of good it derive from that catholic christianity of the middle age which first put it into practice all in it of evil it owe to a fall back on paganism and a denial of its own parentage and rejection of its control i shall deal with this later in more detail i speak of it now just for the purpose of enter a caveat against any deduction from what i have say that any natural force of race or evolution or anything else or any formal institution devise by man ever have or ever can serve in itself as a way of social redemption i be anxious not to overemphasize these thing on which the development of my argument force I to lay particular stress for those who can go with I so far the question will arise : how then be we so to reorganize society that we may gain the end in view it be a question not easy of solution grant the fact of social differentiation and the necessity of its recognition how be we to break down the wholly wrong system that now obtain and substitute another in its place it would be simple enough if within the period allow we by safety -lrb- apparently not any too extend at the present moment -rrb- a work majority of man could achieve in the old and exact phraseology that change of heart that spiritual conversion that would bring back into permanent authority the supernatural virtue of faith hope and charity and that sense of right value in life which together make almost indifferent the nature of the formal device man create for the organization of society certainly this be possible greater miracle have happen in history but fail this what one turn of course by instinct to old model but in this be the danger of a attempt at a archaeological restoration a futile effort at revive dead form that have have they day in principle and in the work as well the old order of chivalry or knighthood strongly commend themselves for here there be in principle both the maintenance of high ideal of honor courtesy and _ noblesse oblige _ and the rendering of chivalrous service chesterton have put it well in the phrase the give thing which can not be demand the avoid thing which can not be punish moreover admission to the order of knighthood be free to all provide there be that cause which come from personal character alone knighthood be the crown of knightly service and it be forfeit for recreancy be there not in this some suggestion of what may again be establish as a incentive and a reward and as well as a vital agency for the reorganization of society knighthood be personal and be for the lifetime of the recipient be there any value in a estate where status be heritable if there be any validity in the theory of vary and persistent race-value it would seem so yet the idea of recognize this excellence of certain family and the reasonable probability of they maintain the established standard unimpaired and so give they a formal status would no doubt be repugnant to the vast majority of man in the united state i think this aversion be base on prejudice natural but ill-founded we resent the idea of privilege without responsibility as we should but this while it be the condition of those aristocracy which be operative at the time of the founding of the republic be oppose to the mediaeval or true idea which link responsibility with privilege the old privilege be go and can not be restore but already we have a new privilege which be be claim and enforce by proletarian group and the legislative representative of the whole people stand in such terror of mass vote that they not only fail to check this astonishing and topsy-turvy movement but actually further its pretension the dictatorship of the proletariat actually mean the restoration of privilege in a form far more tyrannical and monstrous than any ever exercise by the old aristocracy of italy france germany and england much recent legislation in washington exempt certain industrial and agricultural class from the operation of law which bear heavily on other class and some of the claim and pretension of unionize labor tend in precisely the same direction it be not restoration of privilege i have in mind but rather in a sense the prevention of this through the existence of a class or estate that have a fixed status dependent first on character and service and then on a assure position that be not contingent on political favor the bulk of vote or the acquisition of a inordinate amount of money surety of position work towards independence of thought and action and towards strong leadership it establish and maintain certain high ideal of honor chivalry and service as well as of courtesy and manners if the thing for which the gentleman the knighthood and the nobility of europe during the christian dispensation be responsible be stricken from the record there would be comparatively little left of the history of european culture and civilization after all be it merely sentimentalism and a sense of the picturesque that lead we to look backward with some wistfulness to the day of which the record be still leave we in legend and fairy-tale and old romance when ignorance and vulgarity do not sit in high place even if arrogance and pride and tyranny sometimes do and when the profiteer and the oriental financier and the successful politician do not represent the distinction and the chivalry and the courtesy and the honor of the social organism man build for he own habitation the idea of knighthood still stir we and the deed of chivalry and the courtesy and the honor of the social knight of the round table crusader and knight errant the quest of the holy grail rescue and adventure the fight with paynim and power of evil still stir we blood and arouse in we mind strange contrast and antinomy prince and fair chatelaine in they wide domain with castle and chase and delicate pleasaunce liege-man bind to they by more than the feudal tie of service all the varied honor of nobility vitalize by significant ritual and symbolize by splendid and beautiful costume court of love and troubadour and trouvères king who be king indeed with the splendor and courtesy and beneficence of they court -- loui the saint and frederic ii edward iii and king charle -- above all the simple rank and high honor of the gentleman the representative of a long line of honorable tradition no casual and purse-proud upstart but of proud race and unquestioned status proud because it stand for certain high ideal of honor and chivalry and loyalty of courtesy and breeding and compassion all these old thing of long ago still rouse in we answer humor and there be a few of we who can hardly see just why they be inconsistent with liberty and opportunity justice righteousness and mercy somehow the last two generation and especially the last ten year have reveal many thing hitherto hide and as we envisage society as it have come to be estimate it by new-found standard and establish new comparison through a recovery of a more just historical sense the question come whether it be indeed more wholesome more beautiful more normal to man as he be than the older society that in vary form but always the same principle have hold throughout all history until the new model come in now hardly a century ago i do not think this wistful and bewildered look backward be particularly due to a new desire for beauty that comeliness of condition that exist then and have now give place to gross ugliness and ill-conditioned manners and way rather it seem to I it be due to a sense of irrationality and fundamental injustice in the present order couple with a new terror of the proximate issue as this already be reveal itself amongst many people we resent the high estate purchasable and purchase of the cynical intriguer and the vulgar profiteer of the tradesman in big business the cheap prophet and the pathetic progeny of successful man fast revert to type we know we city council and we state legislature and we house of congress we know we newspaper they standard and the motive power behind they and what they record of the character and the doings of what they call society man and woman above all we know that under the ancient regime in spite of manifold failure shortcoming and disloyalty there be such a thing as a standard of honor a principle of chivalry a impulse to unselfish service a criterion of courtesy and good manners we look for these thing now in vain except amongst those little enclave of oblivion where the old character and old breeding still maintain a fading existence and as we consider what we have become we sometimes wonder if the price we have pay for democracy be not too extortionate above all we be tempt to this query when we think of we vanish standard of right and wrong of we progressive reversal of value of we diminish stock of social character we tear down in indignant revolt the rotten fabric of a bad social system when it have so far decline from its ideal and its former estate that it could no longer be endure and we make a new thing full as we be with the fire of desire for a new righteousness and a new system that would compass it perhaps we do well at least we hardly could have do anything else but now we be again in the position of we forefather who see thing as they be and act with force and decision there be as many count against we society of plutocrat politician and proletarian mingle in complete and ineffective confusion as there be against the aristocracy so call of the eighteenth century perhaps there be more at least many of they be different but the indictment be no less sweeping we plan so generous so liberal so high-minded in many way have fail to produce the result we desire while it have work itself out to the point of menace it be for we to see these fact clearly and so to act and so promptly that we may not have to await the destroy force of cataclysm for the correction of we error iv the industrial problem the solution of the industrial and economic problem that now confront the entire world with a insistence that be not to be deny be contingent on the restoration first of all of the holiness and the joy of work labor be not a curse it be rather one of the greatest of the earthly blessing of man provide its sanctity be recognize and its performance be accomplish with satisfaction to the labourer in work man create whether the product be a bushel of potato from a space of once arid ground or whether it be the taj mahal westminster abbey or the constitution of the united state and so work he partake something of the divine power of creation when work be subject to slavery all sense of its holiness be lose both by master and bondman when it be subject to the factory system all the joy in labor be lose ingenuity may devise one clever panacea after another for the salve work and for lift the work class from the intolerable condition that have prevail for more than a century they will be ephemeral in they existence and futile in they result unless sense of holiness be restore and the joy in production and creation give back to those who have be defraud before christianity prevail slavery be universal in civilized community labor as conduct under that regime be a curse and this at length come home to roost on the gaunt wreckage of imperialism thereafter come slowly increase liberty under the feudal system with its small social unit and its system of production for use not profit monasticism with its doctrine and practice of the sanctity of work and the church with its progressive emancipation of the spiritual part of man work be not easy on the contrary it be very hard throughout the dark age and mediaevalism but there be no particular merit in easy work it be virtually free except for the labor and contribution in kind exact by the over-lord -lrb- less in proportion than tax in money have be at several time since -rrb- from the worker on the soil and in the craft of every kind redeem from undue arduousness by the joy that come from do a thing well and produce something of beauty originality and technical perfection the period during which work possess the most honorable status and the joy in work be the greatest extend from the beginning of the twelfth century well into the sixteenth in some century and along certain line of activity it continue much longer notably in england and the united state but social and industrial condition be rapidly change the old aristocracy be become perverted lutheranism calvinism and puritanism be break down the old communal sense of brotherhood so arduously build up during the middle age capitalism be oust the trade and craft guild of free labor and political absolutism be crush ever lower and lower a proletariat that be fast lose the last vestige of old liberty the fact of slavery without the name be gradually impose on the agricultural class and after the suppression of the monastery in england work as work lose its sacred character and fall under contempt with the outbreak of industrialism in the last quarter of the eighteenth century through the institution and introduction of labour-saving machinery and the consequent division of labor the factory system the joint-stock company and capitalism this new slavery be extend to industrial worker and with its establishment disappear the element of joy in labor for fifty year about the blackest half-century civilization have have to record this condition of industrial slavery continue with little amendment very slowly however the worker themselves champion by certain aristocrat like the seventh earl of shaftsbury against professional liberal like cobden bright and gladstone in england begin to loosen the shackle that bind they to infamous condition and after the abrogation of law that make any association of workingman a penal offense the labor union begin to ameliorate certain of the servile condition under which for two generation the workman have suffer since then the process of abolish wage-slavery go slowly forward until at last the war come not only to threaten its destruction altogether but also to place the emancipated worker in a position where they could dictate term and condition to capital to employer to government and to the general public while even now in many part of europe and america besides russium overt attempt be be make to bring back the old slavery only with the former bondsman in supreme dictatorship the former employer and the bourgeoisie in the new serfage the old slavery be go but the joy in work have not be restore instead those who have achieve triumphant emancipation turn from labor itself with the same distaste yes with greater aversion than that which obtain under the old régime with every add liberty and exemption with every shorten of hour and increase of pay production per hour fall off and the quality of the output decline what be the reason for this be it due to the viciousness of the worker to he natural selfishness greed and cruelty i do not think so but rather that the explanation be to be find in the fact that the industrial system of modernism have result in a condition where the joy have be altogether cut out of labor and that until this state of thing have be reverse and the sense of the holiness of work and the joy of work have be restore it be useless to look for workable solution of the labor problem the _ fact _ of industrial slavery have be do away with but the sense of the servile condition that attach to work have be retain therefore the idea of the dignity and holiness of labor have not come back any more than the old joy and satisfaction fail this recovery no reorganization of industrial relation neither profit-sharing nor shop committee neither nationalization nor state socialism neither the abolition of capital nor soviet nor syndicalism nor the dictatorship of the proletariat will get we anywhere it be all a waste of time and through its ultimate failure and disappointment a intensification of a industrial disease why be it that this be so for a answer i must probe deep and it may seem cut wildly i believe it be because we have build up a system that go far outside the limit of human scale transcend human capacity be forbid by the law and condition of life and must be abrogate if it be not to destroy itself and civilization in the process what precisely have take place late in the eighteenth century two thing happen the discovery of the potential inherent in coal and its derivative steam with electricity yet unexploited but ready to hand and the application of this to industrial purpose together with the initiate of a long and astounding series of discovery and invention all applicable to industrial purpose with a sort of vertiginous rapidity the whole industrial process be transform from what it have be during the period of recorded history steam and machinery take the place of brain and hand power directly apply and a revolution greater than any other be effect the new device be hail as labour-saving but they vastly increase labor both in hour of work and in hand employ bulk production through the factory system be inevitable the result be a enormous surplus over the normal and local demand to organize and conduct these process of bulk-production require money greater in amount than individual could furnish so grow up capitalism the joint-stock company credit and cosmopolitan finance to produce profit and dividend market must be find for the huge surplus product this be accomplish by stimulate the covetousness of people for thing they have not think of under normal condition would not in many case need and very likely would be happier without and in dump on supposedly barbarous people in remote part of the world article alien to they tradition and they mode of life and generally pestiferous in they influence and result so come advertising in all its branch direct and indirect from the newspaper and the bill-board to the drummer the diplomatic representative and the commercial missionary every year see some new invention that increase the product per man the development of some new advertising device the conquest of some new territory or the delimitation of some new sphere of influence and the revelation of some new possibility in the covetousness of man profit rise to new height and accumulate dividend clamour for new opportunity for investment competition tend to cut down return therefore labor be more and more sustain through diminish wages and law that savagely prevent any concerted effort towards self-defense improvement in agricultural process and the application of machinery and steam power together with bulk-production and scientific localization of crop throw great quantity of farm-labourer out of work and drive they into the industrial town while advance in medical science and in sanitation raise the proportion of birth to death and soon provide a surplus of potential labor so that the operation of the law of supply and demand extol by a new philosophy and enforce by the new representative or democratic and parliamentary government result in a unfailing supply of cheap labor pay wages just beyond the limit of starvation at last there come evidence that the limit have be reach the whole world have be open up and pre-empt labor be begin to demand and even get more adequate wages competition once hail as the life of trade be become so fierce that dividend be dwindle something have to be do and in self-defense industry begin to coalesce in enormous trust and combine and monopoly capitalization of million now run into billion finance become international in its scope and gargantuan in its proportion and ominousness advertising grow from its original simplicity and naïveté into a vast industry base on all that the most ingenious professor could tell of apply psychology subsidize artist poet man of letter employ army of man along a hundred different line expend million annually in its operation make the modern newspaper possible and ultimately develop the whole system of propaganda which have now become the one great determining factor in the making of public opinion when the twentieth century open that industrialism which have begin just a century before have with its various collateral development financial educational journalistic etc become not only the greatest force in society but as well a thing operate on the largest scale that man have ever essay : beside it the roman empire be parochial the result of this institution conceive on such imperial line be in the field we be now consider the total destruction of the sense of the holiness of labor and of joy in work it extend far beyond the limit of pure industrialism it mould and control society in all its form destroy ideal old as history reverse value confuse issue and wreck man 's power of judgment until the war it seem irresistible now its weakness and the fallacy of its assumption be reveal but it have become so absolutely a part of we life indeed of we nature that we be unable to estimate it by any sound standard of judgment and even when we approximate this we can not think in other term when we try to devise we scheme of redemption even the socialist and the bolshevik think in imperial term when they try to compass the ending of imperialism under this supreme system as i see it the two essential thing i have speak of can not be restore nor could they maintain themselves if by some miracle they be once re-establish the indictment can not be close here the actual condition that have develop from industrialism present certain factor that be not consonant with sane wholesome and christian living not only have the unit of human scale in human society be do away with not only have the sense of the nobility of work and joy in the do be exterminate but as well certain absolutely false principle and method have be adopt which be not susceptible of reform but only of abolition of some of these i have speak already the alarming drift towards city until now in the united state more than one-half the population be urban the segregation of industry in certain city and region the minute division of labor and intensive specialization the abnormal growth of a true proletariat or non-land-holding class the flooding of the country by cheap labor draw from the most backward community and from people of low race-value out of this have arise a bitter class conflict and the ominous beginning of a perilous class consciousness with actual warfare join in several country and threaten in all other where industrial civilization be prevalent with this have grow up a artificially stimulate covetousness for a thousand futile luxury and a standard of live that presuppose a thousand non-essential as basic necessity production for profit not use excess production due to machinery efficient organization and surplus of labor together with the necessity for market the product at a profit have produce a state of thing where at least one-half the available labor in the country be engage in the production and sale of article which be not necessary to physical intellectual or spiritual life while of the remainder hardly more than a half be employ in production the other be devote themselves to distribution and to the war of competition through advertising and the capture of trade by ingenious and capable salesman it be a significant fact that two of the greatest industry in the united state be the making of automobile and move picture it be probably true to say that of the potential labor in the united state about one-fourth be produce those thing which be physically intellectually and spiritually necessary the remain three-fourth be essentially non-producers : they must however be house feed clothe and amuse and the cost of this support be add to the cost of the necessity of life the reason for the present high cost of live lie possibly here lest i be misunderstand let I say here that under the head of necessity of life i do not mean a new model automobile each year move picture mechanical substitute for music or any other art and the thousand catch-trade device that appear each year for the purpose of filch business from another or establish a new desire in the already over-crowded imagination of a over-stimulated populace particularly do i not mean advertising in any sense in which it be now understand and practice if as i believe to be the case production for profit rather than for use the reversal of the ancient doctrine that the demand must produce the supply in favor of the doctrine that the supply must foster the demand be the foundation of we economic error and we industrial ill then it follow that advertising as it be now carry on by billboard circular and newspaper by drummer solicitor and consular agent fall in the same condemnation for except by its office the system could not have succeed or continue to function it be bad in itself as the support and strength of a bad institution but its guilt do not stop here so plausible be it so essential to the very existence of the contemporary régime so knit up with all the commonest affair of life so powerful in its organization and broad in its operation it have poison and continue to poison the mind of man so that the headlong process of lose all sense of comparative value be accelerate while every instinctive effort at recovery and readjustment be nullify how far this process have go may be illustrate by two instance it be only a few month ago that a most respected clergyman publicly declare that missionary be the greatest and most efficient asset to trade because they be unofficial commercial agent who open up new and savage country to western commerce through advertising commodity of which the native have never hear and arouse in they a sense of acquisitiveness that mean more wealth and business for trade and manufacture which should support foreign mission on this ground at least more recently the head of a advertising concern in new york be report to have say : it be principally through advertising that we have arrive at the high degree of civilization which this age enjoy for advertising have teach we the use of book and how to furnish we home with the thousand and one comfort that add so materially to we physical and intellectual well-being the future of the world depend on advertising advertising be the salvation of civilization for civilization can not outlive advertise a century it be tempting to linger over such a delectable morsel as this for even if it be only the absurd and irresponsible output of one poor foolish man it do express more or less what industrial civilization hold to be true though few would avow they faith so whole-heartedly the statement be make as propaganda and propaganda be merely advertise in its most insidious and dangerous form the thing reveal its possibility during the war but the black discredit that be then very justly attach to it could not prevail against its manifest potency and it be now universally use after the most comprehensive and frequently unscrupulous fashion with result that can only be perilous in the extreme the type and calibre of mind that have now be release from long bondage and by weight of number be now fast take over the direction of affair be curiously subservient to the write word and lack a true sense of comparative value without effective leadership either secular or religious be easily sway by every wind of doctrine the force of evil that be ever in conflict with the force of right be notoriously ingenious in make the worse appear the better cause and with every desire for illumination and for follow the right way the multitude whether educate or illiterate fall into the falsehood of other ' imagining money efficiency a acquire knowledge of mob psychology the printing press and the mail service act in alliance and direct by fanatical or cynical energy form a force of enormous potency that be now be use effectively throughout society it be irresponsible anonymous and pervasive through its operation the last barrier be break down between the leadership of character and the leadership of craft while all formal distinction between the valuable and the valueless be sweep away i have speak at some length of this particular element in the present condition of thing because in both its aspect as the support of we present industrial and economic system and as the efficient moulder of a fluid and unstable public opinion it be perhaps the strongest and most subtle force of which we must take account with a system so prevalent as imperial industry so knit up with every phase of life and thought and so determine a factor in all we concept unite as it be with two such invincible ally as advertising and propaganda it be inconceivable that it should be overthrow by any human force from without hold it to be essentially wrong it seem to I providential that it be already show sign of fall by its own weight production of commodity have far exceed production of the means of payment and society be now run on promise to pay on paper obligation on anticipation of future production and sale on credit in a word the war have enormously magnify this condition until a enforced liquidation would mean bankruptcy for all the nation of the earth while the production of utility be decrease in proportion to the production of luxury labor be exact increase pay for decrease hour of work and quality of output and the enormous financial structure elaborately and ingeniously build up through several generation be in grave danger of immediate catastrophe the whole world be in the position of a insolvent debtor who be so deeply involve that he creditor can not afford to let he go into bankruptcy and so keep he out of the poor debtor 's court by dole out support from day to day confidence be the only thing that keep matter go what happen when this be lose be now be demonstrate in many part of europe the optimist claim that increase production couple with enforce economy will produce a satisfactory solution but there be no evidence that labor now have the whip-hand will give up its present advantage sufficiently to make this possible even if it do payment must be in the form of exchange or else in further promise to pay while the capacity of the world for consumption be limited somewhere though thus far big business have fail to recognize this fact at present the interest charge on debt both public and private have reach a point where they come near to consume all possible profit even from a highly accelerate rate of production altogether it be reasonable to assume that the present financial-industrial system be near its term for reason inherent in itself let alone the possibility of a further extension of the drastic and completely effective measure of destruction that be characteristic of bolshevism and its blood-brother assume that this be so two question arise : what be to take the place of imperial industry and how be this substitution to be bring about i think the answer to the first be : a social and industrial system base on small self-contained largely self-sufficing unit where supply follow demand where production be primarily for use not profit and where in all industrial operation some system will obtain which be more or less that of the guild of the middle age i should like to go into this a little more in detail before try to answer the second question the normal social unit be a group of family predominantly of the same race territorially compact of substantially the same ideal as express in religion and the philosophy of life and sufficiently numerous to provide from within itself the major part of those thing which be necessary to physical intellectual and spiritual well-being it should consist of a central nucleus of house each with its garden the church school and public building that be requisite the manufactory and workshop that supply the need of the community the shop for sale of those thing not produce at home and all necessary place of amusement around this residential center should be sufficient agricultural land to furnish all the farm product that will be consume by the community itself the nucleus of habitation and industry together with the surround farm make up the social unit which be to the fullest possible degree self-contained self-sufficient and self-governing certain proposition be fundamental and they be as follow : every family should own enough land to support itself at need the farm include in the unit must produce enough to meet the need of the population industry must be so organize that it will normally serve the resident population along every feasible line only such thing as can not be produce at home on account of climatic or soil limitation should be import from outside all necessary professional service should be obtainable within the community itself all financial transaction such as loan credit banking and insurance should be domestic surplus product whether agricultural industrial or professional should be consider as by-product and in no case should the produce agency acquire such magnitude that home-consumption become a side issue and production for profit take the place of production for use all this be absolutely oppose to we present system but we present system be wasteful artificial illogical unsocial and therefore vicious i have say enough as to the falsity the danger and the failure of bulk-production through the operation of capitalism the factory system and advertising but its concomitant the segregation of industry be equally objectionable to ship hog 1500 mile to be slaughter and pack in food form and then ship this manufacture product back to the source from which the raw material come to feed a great city with grain potato and fruit come from 1000 to 3000 mile away and vegetable from a distance of several hundred mile while the farm within a radius of fifty mile be abandon and barren to make all the shoe for the nation in one small area to spin the wool and cotton and weave the cloth in two or three other to make the greater part of the furniture in one state the automobile in a second and the breakfast food in a third be so preposterous a proposition that it belong in gulliver 's travels not in the annals of a supposedly intelligent people the only benefit be that which for a time accrue to the railway which cart raw material and finish product back and forth over thousand of mile of they line the cost of shipment and reshipment be naturally add to the price to the consumer the penalty for this uneconomic procedure be bear by society at large not only in the increase cost but through the abnormal community each with its ten of thousand of operative all engage in the same work and generally draw from foreign race -lrb- with the active co-operation of the steamship line -rrb- and the permanent dislocation of the labor supply together with the complete disruption of the social synthesis with production for profit and segregation of industry have come a almost infinitesimal division and specialization of labor under a right industrial system this would be reduce not magnify the dignity of labor and the joy of creation demand that in so far as possible each man should carry through one entire operation this be of course now and always have be under any highly develop civilization impossible in practice except along certain line of art and craftsmanship the evil of the exist system can in a measure be do away with the moment production for use be the recognize law for it be only in bulk-production that this intensive specialization can be make to pay bulk-production there will always be until and if the world be reorganize on the basis of a infinite number of self-contained social unit but in the ideal community -- and i be deal now with ideal -- it would not exist ally with this be the whole question of the factory method and the use and misuse of machinery it seem to I that the true principle be that machinery and the factory be admissible only when so employ they actually do produce in bulk operation a better product and with less labor than be possible through hand work weave forge and all work where human action must be more or less mechanical offer a fair field for the machine and the factory but wherever the human element can enter where personality and the skilled craft of the hand be give play the machine and the factory be inadmissible the great city creation of big business segregation of industry advertise salesmanship and a hundred other concomitant of modernism have build up a abnormal and avaricious demand for bulk-production along line where the handicraft should function it become necessary -- let we say -- to provide a million dollar worth of furniture for a ten million dollar hotel -lrb- itself to be supersede and scrap in perhaps ten year -rrb- and naturally only the most intensive and efficient factory system can meet this demand rightly however the furniture of a community should be produce by the local cabinet maker and so it should be in many other industry now entirely take over by the factory system for the future then we must consciously work for the building upward from primary unit so completely reverse we present practice of create the big thing and fight hopelessly to preserve such small and few dole of liberty and personality as may be permit to filter downward from above this be the only true democracy and the thing we call by the name be not this largely because we have bent we best energy to the building up of vast and imperial aggregate which have inevitably assume a complete unity in themselves and become dominate tyrannical and ruthless force that have operate regardless of the sound law and wholesome principle of a right society neither the vital democracy of principle nor the artificial democracy of practice can exist in conjunction with imperialism whether this be establish in government in industry in trade in society or in education if we can assume then the gradual development of a new society in which these principle will be carry out a society that be make up of social unit of human scale self-contained self-supporting and self-governed where production be primarily for use not profit and where bulk-production be practically non-existent the sub-division of labor reduce to the lowest practicable point machinery employ to a much less extent than now and the factory system abolish what organic form will labor take on in place of that which now obtain it be possible to forecast this only in the most general term for life itself must operate to determine the line of development and dictate the consequent form if we can acquire a better standard of comparative value and with a clearer and more fearless vision estimate the rights and wrong of the contemporary system reject the ill thing and jealously preserve or passionately regain the good we shall be able to establish certain broad fundamental and govern principle and do this we can await in confidence the evolution of the organic form that will be the work agency of the new society i have try to indicate some of the basic principle of a new society the operating form so far as industry be concern will i think follow in essential respects the craft-guild of the middle age they will not be a archaeological restoration as some of the english protagonist of this great revolution seem to anticipate they will be variously adapt to the peculiar condition of a new century but the basic principle will be preserve whatever happen i be sure it will not be either a continuation of the present system of capitalism and profit-hunting or nationalization of industry or state socialism in any form or anything remotely resemble bolshevism syndicalism or a dictatorship of the proletariat here as in government education and social relation the power and the authority of the state must decline government itself withdraw more and more from interference with the operation of life and liberty find its way back to the individual and to the social and economic group we live now under a more tyrannical and inquisitorial regime in spite of -lrb- partly perhaps because of -rrb- its democratic form and dogma than be common in historical record nationalization or state socialism would mean so great a magnify of this condition that existence would soon become both grotesque and intolerable we must realize and soon that man may lose even the last semblance of liberty as well under a nominal democracy as under a nominal despotism or theocracy the guild system be the solution of the industrial problem offer and enforce by christianity work through secular life it presuppose the small social and industrial unit and become meaningless if conceive in the gigantic and comprehensive scale of modern institution national guild be a contradiction in term : it take on the same element of error that inhere in the idea of one big union in certain respects the christian guild resemble the modern trade union but it differ from it in more way and it seem to be true that wherever this difference exist the guild be right and the union be wrong community of fellowship and action amongst man of each craft trade or call be essential under any social system good or bad and it would be inseparable from the better society that must sometime grow up on the basis of the unit of human scale for these autonomous group in order to furnish substantially all that they component part could require would have to be of considerable size as compare with the little farming village of new england though in contrast with the great city of modernism they would be small indeed in these new walled town there would be enough man engage in agriculture in the necessary industrial occupation in trade and in the profession to form many guild of workable size and normally these guild would neither contain member of two or more profession or occupation nor those from outside the community itself the guild can not function under intensive method of production or where production be primarily for profit or where the factory system prevail or where capitalism be the established system or under combination trust or other device for the establish and maintenance of great aggregate tend always towards monopoly however much we may admire the guild system and desire its restoration we may as well recognize this fact at once the imperial scale must go and the human scale be restore before the guild can come back in any general sense i be assume that this will happen either through conscious action on the part of the people or as the result of catastrophe that always overtake those who remain wed to the illusion of falsity on this assumption what be these endure principle that will control the guild system of industry in the new state however may be its form the answer be to be find in the old guild altar shrine vestment and sacred vessel be give in incredible quantity for the furnishing and embellishment of the chapel or church fund also for the maintenance of priestly office especially dedicate to the guild closely ally with the religious spirit be that of good-fellowship and merrymaking every sort of feast and game and pageant be a part of the guild system as it be indeed of life generally at this time when man do not have to depend upon hire professional purveyor of amusement for they edification what they want they do themselves and this community in worship and community in merrymaking do more even than the merge of common material interest to knit the whole body together into a living organism in how far the old system can be revive and put into operation be a question certainly it can not be adopt as a fad and impose on a unwilling society as a clever archaeological restoration it will have to grow naturally out of life itself and along line at present hardly predicable there be many evidence that just this spontaneous generation be take place the guild system be be preach widely in england where the defect of the present scheme be more obvious and the result labor situation -- or rather social situation -- be more fraught with danger than elsewhere and already the restoration seem to have make considerable headway i be convinced however that the vital aspect of the case be primarily due to the interior working of a new spirit bear of disillusionment and the undying fire in man that flame always towards regeneration what the ardent preaching of the enthusiastic protagonist of the crusade best accomplish be the creation in the mind of those not directly associate with the movement of a readiness to give sympathy and support to the actual accomplishment when it manifest itself recently i have come in contact here in america with several case where the workman themselves have break away from the old way and have actually establish what be to all intent and purpose craft-guild without in the least realize that they be do this i think the process be bind to continue for the old order have break down and be so thoroughly discredit it can hardly be restore if time be grant we great thing must follow but it be increasingly doubtful if this necessary element of time can be count on daily the situation grow more menacing capital which so long exploit labor to its own fabulous profit be not dispose to sit quiet while the fruit of its labor and all prospects of future emolument be be dissipate and it be hard at work strive to effect a return to normalcy in this it be be unconsciously aid by the bulk of union labor which encourage by the paramount position it achieve during the war influence by a avarice it may well have learn from its former master as narrow in its vision as they and increasingly subservient to a leadership which be frequently cynical and unscrupulous and always of a order of character and intelligence which be tend to lower and lower level be alienate sympathy and bring unionism into disrepute in the united state the tendency be steadily towards a very dangerous reactionism with a corresponding strengthening of the radical element which aim at revolution and that impossible thing a proletarian dictatorship it be this latter which be rampant and at present unchecked in europe and this also be a constant menace to the success of those sane and righteous movement which take they lead from the guild system of the middle age a third danger but one which be constantly on the decline at present partly because of the general disrepute of government and partly because of the enormous accession of power now accrue both to reactionism and radical revolutionism or bolshevism be state socialism or nationalization which leave untouched all the fatal element in industrialism while it change only the agent of administration the complete collapse of able and constructive and righteous leadership which be one of the startling phenomenon of modernism have leave uncontrolled the enormous energy that have be release during the last three generation and this be work blindly but effectively towards a cataclysm so precipitate and comprehensive that it be impossible not to fear that it may determine long before the sober and informed element in society have accomplish very much in the recovery and establishment of sound and righteous principle and method of course we can compass whichever result we will we may shut we eye to the omen and let matter drift to disaster or we may take thought and council and avert the penalty that threaten we the event be in we own hand it be as criminal to foresee and predict only catastrophe as it be to compass this through lethargy selfishness and illusion we be bind to believe that righteousness will prevail even in we own time and believe this what in general term will be the construction of the new system that must take the place of industrialism i have already indicate what seem to I the fundamental idea as : the small social unit that be self-sustaining production primarily for use coöperation in place of competition a revive guild system with the abolition of capitalism exploitation and intensive specialization as we now know these dominant factor in modern civilization in the application of these principle there be certain innovation that will i think take place and these may be list somewhat as follow : land holding will become universal and the true proletariat or landless class will disappear it may be that the holding of land will become a prerequisite to active citizenship industrial production be for use not profit the great city become a thing of the past and life be render simpler through the elimination of a thousand useless and vicious luxury those employ in mechanical industry will be incalculably fewer than now while those that remain will give only a portion of they time to industrial production the remainder be available for productive work on they own garden and farm the handicraft will be restore to they proper place and dignity take over into creative labor large number of those who otherwise would be sacrifice to the factory system where bulk production as in weave and the preparation and manufacturing of metal be economical and unavoidable and carry on by factory method these manufactory will probably be take over by the several community -lrb- not by the state as a whole -rrb- and administer as public institution for the benefit of the community and under condition and regulation which ensure justice and well-being to the employee all those in any community engage in a give occupation as for example building will form one guild make up of master journeyman and apprentice with the same principle and much the same method as prevail under the ancient guild system fluctuate scale of price determine by fluctuate condition of competition supply and demand and power of coercion will give place to the fair price fix by concerted community action and revise from time to time in order to preserve a right balance with the general scale of cost of raw material and cost of live a maximum of return in the shape of profit or dividend will be fix by law the community itself will undertake the furnishing of credit loan and necessary capital for the establish of a new business charge a small rate of interest and maintain a reserve fund to meet these operation private banking insurance and the loaning of money on collateral will cease to exist i dare say this will all sound chimerical and irrational in the extreme i do not see it in that light its avowed object be the supersession of big business in all its phase by something that come down to human scale it aim to reduce labor and divide it more evenly by make the great mass of non-producer -- those engage in distribution salesmanship advertising propaganda and the furnishing of thing unnecessary to the bodily intellectual and spiritual need of man -- actual producer and self-supporting to a very large extent it aim at restore to work some sense of the joy in creation through active mind and hand it aim at the elimination of the parasitic element in society and of that dangerous factor which subsist on wealth it acquire without earn and by sheer force of its own opulence dominate and degrade society it do not strike at private ownership but rather exalt extend and defend this but it _ do _ cut into all the theory and practice of communism and socialism by establish the principle and practice of fellowship and coöperation be this chimerical and irrational meanwhile the walled town do not exist and may not for generation big business be indispose to abrogate itself trade unionism be fight for its life and thereafter for world conquest while the enmity between capital and labor increase with no evidence that a restore guild system be even approximately ready to take its place strike and lockout grow more and more numerous and wider and more menacing in they scope the day of the general strike have only be delay at the eleventh hour in several country and a general strike if it can hold for a sufficient period mean where-ever it occur and whenever it succeed the end of civilization and the loosing of the flood of anarchy there be hardly time for we patiently to await the slow process of individual and corporate enlightenment or the spontaneous development of the autonomous community which if they be sufficient in number would solve the problem through eliminate the danger what then in the premise can we do there be of course certain concrete thing which might help as for instance the further extension and honest try out of the kansas plan for regulate industrial relation the form of consumer league and all possible support and furtherance of coöperative effort of every sort there be further possibility -lrb- perhaps hardly probability -rrb- of control stock issue and stock holding so that dividend do not have to be pay on grossly inflated capitalization and fix the maximum of dividend payable to non-active stockholder equally desirable but equally improbable be the raising of the level of leadership in the labor union so that these valuable institution may no longer stultify themselves and wreck they own cause by they unjust and anti-social regulation as to apprentice control of maximum output and its standard of quality division of labor with ironclad inhibition against one man do another 's work and against one man do what six man can do less well and as to the obligation to strike on order when no local or personal grievance exist most useful of all would be a voluntary renunciation on the part of the purchase public of nine-tenth of the futile luxury they now insanely demand couple with the production by themselves of some of the commodity which be easily producable in other word establish some measure of self-support and so release many man and woman from the curse of existence under factory condition and give they a opportunity of live a normal life under self-supporting circumstance this couple with a foster of the back to the farm movement and the development of condition which would make this process more practicable and the life more attractive would do much though in small way towards produce a more wholesome and less threatening state of affair back of the whole problem however lie a fallacy in we conception of existence that must be eliminate before even the most constructive panacea can possibly work i mean the whole doctrine of natural rights which have become the citadel of capitalism in all its most offensive aspect and of labor in its most insolent assumption the rights of property the right to strike the right to collective bargaining the right to shut down a essential industry or to walk out and then picket the place so that it may not be reopen the right to vote and hold office and do any fool thing you please so long as it be within the law these be application of what i mean when i speak of a gross fallacy that have come into be and have stultify we intelligence while bring near the wreck of we whole system neither man nor he community possess any _ absolute _ rights they be all condition on how they be exercise if they be not so conditioned they become privilege which be a right not subject to condition and privilege be one of the thing republicanism and democracy and every other effort towards human emancipation have set themselves up to destroy even the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness be condition by the manner of use and the same be true of every other and unspecified right i do not propose to speak here of more than one aspect of this self-evident truth but the single instance i cite be one that bear closely on the question of we industrial and economic situation it be the responsibility to society of property or capital on the one hand and of labor on the other when both invoke they rights to justify they in oppress the general public in the pursuit of they own natural interest during the middle age just as the political theory maintain that while a king rule by divine right this right give he no authority to govern wrong so the social theory hold that while a man have a right to private property he have no right to use it against society nor could the labourer use he own rights to the injury of the same institution power property and labor must be use as a _ function _ ie a activity which embody and express the idea of social purpose unless i be mistaken this be at the basis of we common law as mediaevalism give place to the renaissance this christian idea be abandon and increasingly the obligation be sever from the right which so become that odious thing privilege intolerable in its injustice and oppression this privilege which by the middle of the eighteenth century have become the attribute of the aristocracy be completely overthrow in france first of all and a new doctrine of rights be enunciate and put in operation unfortunately the result be in essence simply a transforming of privilege from one body to another for the old conception of social purpose as the necessary concomitant of acknowledged rights do not emerge from the shadow of the middle age it have be too long forget the new rights be exclusively individualistic in practice though in the mind of the idealist who formulate they they have they social aspect they promulgation synchronize with the sudden rise and violent expansion of industrialism and as one country after another follow the lead of england in accept the new system they harden into a iron-clad scheme for the defense of property and the free action of the holder and manipulator of property back by the economic philosophy of locke adam smith bentham and the manchester school generally and the evolutionary theory of the exponent of darwinism and abet by a endless series of statute the idea of the exemption of property holder from any responsibility to society for the use of they property become a fixed part of the mental equipment of modernism precisely the same thing happen politically and socially rights be personal and imply no necessary obligation to society as a whole they be personal attribute and as such to be defend at all cost now the result of this profound error as to the existence nature and limitation of these personal rights have mean simply the destruction of a righteous and unified society which work by coöperation and fellowship and the substitution of individual and corporate body who work by competition strife and mutual aggression towards the attainment of all they can get under the impulse of what be once praise as enlighten self interest in other word -- war the conflict that begin in 1914 be not a war hurl into the midst of a white peace it be only a military war arise in the center of a far greater social war for there be no other word that be descriptive rights that be not contingent on the due discharge of duty and obligation be but hateful privilege privilege have issue in selfishness and egotism which in turn work themselves out in warfare and in the hatred that both precede and follow conflict the net result of a century and a half of industrialism be avarice warfare and hate society can continue even when avariciousness be rampant -- for a time -- and warfare of one sort or another seem inseparable from humanity at all event it have always be so but hatred be another matter for it be the negation of social life and be its solvent anger pass it be sometimes even righteous but hatred be synonymous with death in that it dissolve every unit reduce it to its component part and subject each of these to dissolution in its turn righteous anger rouse the nation into the war that hate have engender but hate have follow after and for the moment be victorious russium seethe with hatred and be perish of its poison while there be not another country in europe of those that be involve in the war where the same be not true in vary degree hatred of race for race of nation for nation of class for class of one social or industrial or economic or political institution for another this above all else be the disintegrate influence and against it no social organism no civilization can stand unless it be abrogate it mean a ending of another epoch of human life a period of darkness and another begin some time after the poison have be work out by misery adversity and force repentance it be this prevalence of hatred reinforce by avarice and perpetuate by incessant warfare that negative all the effort that be make towards effect a correspondence between the divide interest that be the concomitant of industrialism strike and lockout trade union and employer ' association as they be now constitute and as they now operate syndicalism and bolshevism and proletarian dictatorship protective tariff and commercial sphere of influence propaganda and subsidized newspaper be all energize by the principle of hate and no good thing can come of any of they nor be it enough to work for the re-establishment of justice even by those method of righteousness and with the impulse towards righteousness which be so different from those which be function at present along the line of contemporary industrial reform justice be a natural virtue with a real place in society but the only saving force today be a supernatural virtue this amongst other thing christ bring into the world and leave as the save force amongst the race he have redeem and in the society reconstitute in accordance with he will this supernatural virtue be charity sometimes express in the simpler form of love the essence of the social code of christianity and the symbol of the new dispensation as justice be the symbol of the old just in so far as a man or a cult or a interest or a corporation or a state or a generation or a race relinquish charity as its control spirit in so far it relinquish its place in christian society and its claim to the christian name while it be void of all power for good or possibility of continuance where charity be go intellectual capacity effectual power and even justice itself become not energy of good but potent contribution to evil be this supernatural gift of charity a mark of contemporary civilization do it manifest itself with power today in the dealings between class and class between interest and interest between nation and nation if not then we have forfeit the name of christian and betray christian civilization into the hand of its enemy while we effort towards save what be leave to we of a once consistent and righteous society will be without result except as a acceleration of the now headlong process of dissolution i be not charge any class or any interest or any people with exclusive apostacy in the end there be little to choose between one or another labor be not more culpable than capital nor the proletarian than the industrial magnate and the financier nor the nominal secularist than the nominal religionist nor be i charge conscious and willful acceptance of wrong in the place of right it be the institution itself industrialism as it have come to be with all its concomitant and derivative that have betray man to he disgrace and he society to condemnation and so long as this system endure so long will recovery be impossible and regeneration a vain thing vainly imagine charity that be to say fellowship generosity pity self-sacrifice chivalry all that be comprehend in the thing that christ be and preach and promulgate as the fundamental law of life can not come back to the world so long as avarice warfare and hate continue to exist and through charity alone can we find the solution of the industrial and economic problem that _ must _ be solve under penalty of social death v the political organization of society in these essay which look towards a new social synthesis i find myself involve in somewhat artificial subdivision industrial social and political force all react one upon another and the complete social product be the result of the interplay of these force coördinated and vitalize by philosophy education and religion to isolate each factor and consider it separately be apt to result in false value but there seem no other way in which the subject which be essentially one may be divide into the definite part which be consequent on the form of a course of lecture in consider now the political estate of the human social organism it will be evident that i hold that this must be contingent on many element that reveal themselves in a contributory industrial system in the principle that be embody in social relationship and in the general scheme of such a work philosophy of life as may predominate amongst the component part of the synthetic society which be the product of all these vary energy and the organic form through which they operate political organization have always be a powerful preoccupation of mankind and the earliest record testify to its antiquity the regulation of human intercourse the delimiting of rights and privilege protection of life and property the codifying of law vague various and conflict the making of new law and the enforce of those that have take organic form all these and a hundred other governmental function appeal strongly to the mind and touch closely on personal interest it be no wonder that the political history of human society be the most varied voluminous and popular in its appeal at the present moment this problem have in general a even more poignant appeal and no rival except the industrial problem for in both case system that up to ten year ago be question only by a minority -lrb- large in the case of industry small and obscure in the case of government -rrb- have since completely break down and it be probable that a political system which have exist throughout the greater part of europe and the america for a century and a half almost without serious criticism have now as many assailant as industrialism itself the change be startling from the triumphant democracy period a space of time as clearly define and as significant in its characteristic as the victorian era before the war during the war and throughout the earlier year of the even more devastating peace the system which follow the ruin of the renaissance autocracy the essential element in which be a ever-widening suffrage parliamentary government and the universal operation of the quantitative standard of value be never question or criticise except in matter of detail that it be the most perfect governmental scheme ever devise and that it must continue forever be hold to be axiomatic and with few exception the remedy propose for such fault as could not possibly escape detection be a still further extension of the democratic principle even the war itself be hold to be a war to make the world safe for democracy it be significant that the form in which this say now frequently appear be one in which the word from be substitute in place of the word for it be useless to blink the fact that there be now a distrust of parliamentary and representative government which be almost universal and this distrust which be become widespread reach from the bolshevism of russium on the one hand through many intermediate social and intellectual stage to the conservative element in england and the united state and the fast-strengthening royalist bloc in france in many unexpected place there be visible a profound sense that something be so fundamentally wrong that palliative be useless and some drastic reform be necessary a reform that may almost amount to revolution lord bryce still believe in democracy in spite of he keen realization of its grievous defect because as he say hope be a inextinguishable quality of the human soul mr chesterton preach democracy in principle while condemn its mechanism and its workings with he accustomed vigor the adams renounce democracy and all its work while offer no hint as to what could consistently take its place with any better chance of success while the royalist excoriate it in unmeasured term and preach a explicit return to monarchy meanwhile international bolshevism hate the thing as violently as do king in exile substitute a crude and venal autocracy while organize labor as a whole work for the day when a class-conscious proletariat will have take matter into its own hand and establish a new aristocracy of privilege in which the present work class will hold the whip-hand meanwhile the more educate element of the general public withdraw itself more and more from political affair go its own way and make the best of a bad job it think itself teach by experience it can not mend it be useless to deny that government in the character of its personnel the quality of its output the standard of its service and the degree of its beneficence have be steadily deteriorate during the last century and have now reach in nearly every civilized country a deplorably low level popular representative be less and less man of character and ability legislation be absurd in quantity short-sighted frivolous inquisitorial and in a large measure prompt by selfish interest administration be reckless wasteful and inefficient while it be overload in number without any particular aptitude on the part of its member and in a measure control by personal or corporate interest the whole system be in bad odour for it be shoot through and through with the greed for money and influence while the cynicism of the professional politician and the low average of character intelligence and manners of the stratum of society that increasingly be usurp all power work towards produce that general contempt and aversion that have become so evident of late and that be a menace to society no less than that of the decaying institution itself confront by a situation such as this the natural tendency of those who suffer under it either in they material interest or they ideal be to condemn the mechanism perhaps even the very principle for the operation of which the various machine be devise some reject the whole scheme of representative parliamentary government and fail any plausible substitute be drive back on some form of the soviet or even government by industrial group those that go to the limit and reject the whole scheme of democracy be in still worse plight for they have no alternative to offer except a restore monarchy and this the _ terminus ad quem _ of they logic they courage will not permit they to avow it be a dilemma but force i believe by the fatal passion of the man of modernism for the machine the mechanical device the material equivalent for a thing that have no equivalent and that be the personal character of the constituent of society and the work factor in a political organism there be never a more foolish say than that which be so frequently and so boastfully use : a government of law and not of man this be the exact reversal of what should be recognize as a self-evident truth viz that the quality of the man not the nature of the law or of the administrative machine be the determine factor in government you may take any form of government ever devise by man monarchy aristocracy republic democracy yes or soviet and if the community in which this government operate have a work majority of man of character intelligence and spiritual energy it will be a good government whereas if the work majority be deficient in these characteristic or if it make itself negligible by abstention from public affair it will be a bad government there be no one political system which be right while all other be wrong the monarchy of st loui be better than the third republic as this be better than be the monarchy of loui xv the aristocracy of washington be better than the democracy of this year of grace as this in itself be better than the late junker aristocracy of prussium you can not substitute a machine in place of character you can not supersede life by a theory this do not mean that the form of government be of no moment it be of the utmost importance for i can not too often insist that the organic life of society be the resultant of two force spiritual energy work through and upon the material form towards they improvement or -- when this energy be weak or distorted -- they degeneration the material form act as a stimulus towards the development of spiritual energy through association and environment that be favourable or towards its weakening and distortion when these be deterrent because of they own degraded or degrading nature if it be futile to look for salvation through the mechanism it be equally futile to try to act directly and exclusively on the character of the social constituent in the patient hope that they defect may be remedy and the preponderance of character of high value achieve before catastrophe overtake the experiment life be as sacramental as the christian religion and christian philosophy neither the spiritual substance nor the material accident can operate alone but only in a conjunction so intimate that it be to all intent and purpose -- that be for the interest and purpose of god in human life -- a perfect unity however completely and even passionately we may realize the determine factor of spiritual energy as this manifest itself through personal character however deeply we may distrust the machine we be bind to recognize the paramount necessity of the active interplay of both within the limit of life as we know it on the earth and therefore it be very much we concern that the machine whether it be industrial political educational ecclesiastical or social be as perfect in its nature and stimulating in its operation as we be able to compass in the present liquidation of value theory and institution we be bind therefore to scrutinize each operating agency of human society to see wherein it have fail and how it can be better and the problem before we now be the political organism now it appear that in the past there have be just two method whereby a civil polity have come into existence and establish itself for a short period or a long these two method be first unpremeditated and sometimes unconscious growth second calculate and self-conscious revolution the first method have produce community state and empire that frequently work well and last for long period the second have have issue in nothing that have endure for any length of time or have leave a record of beneficence evolution in government be in accord with the process of life even to the extent that it be always after a time follow by degeneration revolution in government be the throwing of a monkey-wrench into the machinery by a disaffected workman with the wreck of the machine the violent stoppage of the work and frequently the sudden death of the worker as a consequence the english monarchy from duke william to henry viii be a case of normal growth by minor change and modification but its subsequent history have be one of revolution six or seven have occur in the last four hundred year the scheme which now hold though precariously be the result of the great democratic revolution accomplish during the reign of queen victorium the free monarchy of europe which begin to take form during the long period of the dark age and pursue they admirable course well through the middle age be also normal and slow growth but the revolution that have follow the great war will meet a different fate several of they indeed have count they existence in month and have already pass into history if we be wise we shall discount revolution for the future for nothing but ill be accomplish by deny life and exalt the ingenious substitute of ambitious and presumptuous frankenstein the result be too often a monster that work cleverly at first and with a semblance of human intelligence but in the end show itself as a destroyer we task be to envisage as clearly as possible the political system establish amongst we note they weakness either in themselves or in they relationship to society as it be and then try to find those remedy that can be apply without any violent method of dislocation or substitution always bear in mind the fact that the energize force that will make they live preserve they from deterioration and adapt they to condition which will ever change be the spiritual force of human personality and that this force come only through the character quality of the individual component of society now in consider we own case in this day and generation there be first of all two matter to be bear in mind one be that we shall do well to confine we inquiry to the united state for while the defect we shall have to point out be common to practically all the contemporary government of europe and the america we own enginery be different in certain way and we trouble be also different between one example and another after all we immediate interest must lie with we own national problem the other point be that in criticise the workings of government in america we be not necessarily criticise its founder or the creator of its original constitution charter and other mechanism the constitution of the united state for example be conceive to meet one series of perfectly definite condition that have now be supersede by other which be radically and even diametrically different the original constitution be a most able instrument of organic law but just because it do fit so perfectly condition as they be four generation ago it apply but indifferently to present circumstance and even less well than the founder hope would be the case for the reason that the amendment which be provide for have seldom take cognizance of these change condition and even when this be do the amendment themselves have not be wisely draw while certain of they have be actually disastrous in they nature other frivolous and yet more the result of ephemeral and hysterical ebullition of a engineer public opinion the same may be say of state constitution and municipal charter which have suffer incessant change mostly unfortunate and ill-judged except during the last few year when a spirit of real wisdom and constructiveness have show itself though sporadically and as yet with some timidity the reform such as they be be largely in the line of palliative the deep-lying factor those that control both success and failure be seldom touch upon the necessary courage -- or perhaps temerity -- be lack what be need be such a clear see of condition and such a approach as manifest themselves in the constitutional convention of the united state for in spite of the many compromise that be in the end necessary to placate a public opinion not untouched by prejudice superstition and selfishness the great document -- and even more the record of the debate -- still brilliantly set forth both the clear-seeing and the lofty attitude that characterize the convention have these man be gather together today even the same man they would frame a very different document for they take condition and man as they be and with a indestructible hope to glorify they common sense they produce a masterpiece it be in the same spirit that we must approach we problem of today now in consider the situation that confront we we find certain respects in which either the method be bad or the result or both there be no unanimity in this criticism indeed i doubt if any two of we would agree on all the item in the indictment though we all might unite on one or two i can only give my own list for what it be worth in the first place we in common with all the nation have drift into imperialism of a gross scale and illiberal even tyrannical work we could hardly do otherwise for such have be the universal tendency for more than a hundred year by constant progression municipal government have absorb into themselves matter that in decency and with any regard for liberty belong to the individual simultaneously we state government have follow the same course infringe even on the just prerogative of the town and city while more than all the national government have rob the state the city and the citizen of what should belong to they until at last we have a imperial autocratic inquisitorial and largely irresponsible government at washington that be the one supreme political fact we be no longer a federal republic but a imperialism in which be centralize all the authority inherent in the one hundred and ten million of we population and from which a constantly diminish stream of what be practically devolve authority trickle down through state and city to the individual in the last instance -- if it get there at all this i believe to be absolutely and fatally wrong in the first place human society can not function at this abnormal scale it be outside the human scale for in spite of we pride and insolence there be limit on every hand to what man can do in the second place i conceive it to be absolutely at variance with any principle of republicanism or democracy or even of free monarchy it be at one only with the imperialism of egypt babylon rome and the late empire of germany in a free monarchy a republic or a democracy the pyramid of political organism stand not on its point but broad-based and four-square taper upward to its final apex a sane and wholesome society begin with the family -- natural or artificial -- which have original jurisdiction over a far greater series of rights and privilege than it now command from the family certain power be delegate to the next higher social unit the village or communal group which in its turn concede certain of its inherent rights to the organic group of community or state and finally the state commit to the last and general authority the national government some of the element of authority that have be delegate to they the principle of this delegation from one organism to another be common interest and welfare only those function which can be perform with more even justice and with greater effectiveness by the community for example than by the family be so delegate in the same way the several group commit to they common government only so much as they can not perform with due justice and equity to the other in the same group in the end the national government exist only that it may provide for a limited number of national necessity as for example defense against extra-national aggression the conduct of diplomatic relation with foreign power the maintain of a national currency and a national postal service the provision of court of last resort and the raising of revenue for the support of these few and explicit function the first step it seem to I towards governmental reform be decentralization with a return to the state the civic community and the individual citizen of nine-tenth of the power and the prerogative that have be take from they in defiance of abstract justice of the principle of free government and of the theory of the workable unit of human scale in a word we must abandon imperialism and all its work and go back to the federal republic the second cause of we trouble lie i believe in the institution of universal suffrage found on the theory -lrb- or dogma -rrb- that the electoral franchise be a inalienable right this doctrine be of recent invention only come into force during the reconstruction period follow the war between the state when it be bring forward by certain leader of the republican party to justify they enfranchisement of the negro in the hope that by this act they could fix they party in power to perpetuity in any case the plan itself have work badly both for the community and for many of the voter it be of course impossible for I to argue the case in detail i can do hardly more than state my own personal belief and this be that the question be wholly one of expediency and that the question of abstract justice and the rights of man do not enter into the consideration i submit that the electoral franchise should again be accept as a privilege involve a duty and not as a right inherent in every adult person of twenty-one year or over and not lunatic or in jail this privilege which in itself should confer honor should be grant to those who demonstrate they capacity to use it honestly and intelligently and take away for cause the acute critic will not be slow to remind I that this proposition be somewhat beside the case and that it possess but a academic interest since we be deal with a _ fait accompli _ this be of course perfectly true the electoral franchise could be so restricted only by the suffrage of the present electorate and it be inconceivable that any large number and far less a majority of voter would even consider the proposition for a moment for good or ill we have unrestricted adult suffrage and there be not the faintest chance of any other basis be establish by constitutional means something however can be do and this be a thing of great value and importance what i suggest be concerted effort towards a measure purification of the electorate through the penalize of law-breaker by temporary disfranchisement it be hardly too much to assume that a man who deliberately break the law be constructively unfit to vote or to hold office at all event conviction for any crime or misdemeanor give a reasonable ground for deprive the offender of these privilege at least for a time the law-breaking element whether it be millionaire or proletarian be one of the dangerous factor in society which would lose nothing if from time to time these gentry be remove from active participation in public affair if for example any one convict of minor offens punishable by fine or imprisonment be disfranchise for a year if of major offens for vary and increase period from five year upward and if a second offense during the period of disfranchisement work a automatic doubling of the time prescribe for a first offense i conceive that the electorate would be measurably purify and that regard for the law would be stimulate in one instance i be persuade that disfranchisement should be for life and that be in the case of give or accept a bribe or otherwise commit a crime against the ballot this together with treason against the state should be sufficient cause for eliminate the offender from all further participation in public affair if the electorate could be purify after this fashion and if more stringent law could be pass in the matter of naturalization of alien together with iron-clad requirement that every voter should be able to speak read and write the english language we should have achieve something towards the safeguard of the suffrage the third weakness in we system and in some respect the most dangerous as it be in all respects the most pestiferous be the insanity of law-making all parliamentary government suffer from this malady but that of the united state most grievously and this be true of the national government the state and the municipality it have become the conviction of legislative body that they must justify they existence by make law and the more law they pass the better they have discharge they duty the thing have become a scandal and a oppression for the liberty of american citizen and the just prerogative of the state and the city as vital human group have be more infringe upon reduce and degrade by free legislation than ever happen in similar community by the action of absolute monarch it be a folly that work its insidious injury in two way first by confuse life by innumerable law ill-advised ill-drawn mutually contradictory ephemeral in they nature inquisitorial in they workings second by create a condition where any personal or factious interest can be serve by due process of law until at last we have reach a point where liberty itself have largely cease to exist and we find ourselves crush under a tyranny of popular government no less oppressive than the tyranny of absolutism nor be this all the mania for make law have breed a complete and ingenious and singularly effective system of get law make by method familiar to the member of all legislative body whether they be city council state legislature or the national congress and this mean opportunity for corruption and method of corruption that be fast degrading government in the united state to a point where there be none so poor as to do it reverence the whole system be preposterous and absurd breeding not only bad law but a widespread contempt of law while the personal freedom for which democracy once fight be fast become a memory the trouble begin as a result of one of the element in the american constitution which be the product not of the sound common sense and the lofty judgment of the framer but of a weak yield to one of the doctrinaire fad of the time that have no relationship to life but be the invention of political theorist and that be the unnatural separation of the executive legislative and judicial function of government the error have work far and the superstition still hold what be need be a initiative in legislation centre in one responsible head or group that while function in all normal and necessary legislative direction still allow individual initiative on the part of the legislator as a supplementary or corrective or protective agency no government function well in fiscal matter without a budget : what we need in legislative matter be a legislative budget and by this phrase i mean that the primary agency for the propose of law should be the chief executive of a city or state or the nation with the advice and consent of he head of department who would form he cabinet or council under this plan the governor and council for example would at the opening of each legislative session present a program or agenda of such law as they believe the condition to demand and in the shape of bill accurately draw by the proper law officer of the government no such government bill could be refer to committee but must be discuss in open session and until the bill so offer have be pass or refuse no private bill could be introduce a procedure such as this would certainly reduce the flood of private bill to reasonable dimension while it would insure a degree of responsibility now utterly lack there be now no way in which the author of a foolish or dangerous bill which have be enact into law by a majority of the legislature can be hold to account and due responsibility impose upon he but the case would be very different if a mayor a governor or the president of the united state make himself responsible for a law or a series of law by offer they for action in he own name certainly if this method be follow we should be preserve in great measure from the hasty confused and frivolous legislation that at present make up the major part of the output of we various legislative body one of the greatest gain would be the reduction of the annual grist to a size where each act could be consider and debate at sufficient length to guarantee as reasonable a conclusion as would be possible to the member of the legislative body the deplorable device of institute committee to each of which certain bunch of bill be refer before they be permit to come before the house would be no longer necessary this system which become necessary in order to deal with the enormous mass of undigested matter which have overwhelm every legislature as a result of the present chaotic and irresponsible procedure be perhaps both the most undemocratic device ever put in practice by a democracy and the most fruitful of venality corruption and injustice it be unnecessary to labor this point for everyone know its grave evil but there seem no way to get rid of it unless some curb be place on the number of bill introduce in any session the british parliament be not necessarily a model of intelligent or capable procedure but where in one session at westminster no more than four hundred bill be introduce at washington for the same period the count run well over twelve thousand manifestly some committee system be inevitable under condition such as this but under the committee system free government and honest legislation be difficult of attainment one would not of course prevent the proposal of a bill by any member of the legislature indeed this free action would be absolutely necessary as a measure of protection against executive oppression but this should be prohibit until after the government program have be dispose of after that task be accomplish the legislature might sit indefinitely or as long as the public would stand it for the purpose of consider private bill and these could be refer to committee as at present the chance be however that the government program would cover the most essential matter and what would remain would be the edifying spectacle of solon solemnly consider such question as the minimum length of sheet on hotel bed the limitation in inch and fraction of the heel of woman 's shoe the amount of flesh that could be legally expose by a bathing suit or the pensioning of a swedish assistant janitor -- all of which be the substance of actual bill introduce in various state legislature during the session last close another grave weakness in we system be the election by popular vote of many judicial and administrative officer couple with the vigorous remnant of the old and degrading spoil system whereby many thousand of strictly non-political office be almost automatically vacate after any partisan victory i can not trust myself to speak of the infamy of a elective judiciary fortunately i live in a state where this worst abuse of democratic practice do not exist and so it touch I only in so far as it offend the sense of decency and justice in the other case it be only a question of efficient and intelligent administration there be a argument for elect the chief executive of a city a state or the nation by popular vote and the same hold in the case of the lower house of the legislature where a bi-cameral system exist but there be no argument for the popular election of the administrative officer of a state there be even less -- if there can be less than nothing -- for the change in personnel that take place after every election civil service reform have do a world of good but as yet it have not go far enough in some direction while its mechanism of examination be defective in principle in that it leave out the personal equation and establish its test only along a very few of the many line that actually exist i would offer it as a proposition that no election should in itself affect the status of any man except the man elect and in the case of a mayor or governor or the president those who be directly responsible to he and to he administration for carry out he policy and further that the voter when he vote should vote once and for one man in he city once and for one man in he state and once and for one man in the nation and that man in each case should be he representative in the lower branch of the legislative body choose administrative official by majority vote and the election of judge for short term by the same method be absurdity of a system fast fall into chaos the maintenance of a bi-cameral legislative organization with the choosing of the member of both house by the same electorate be in the same class a perfectly irrational anomaly which violate the first principle of logic and lead only to legislative incompetence and worse the referendum be of precisely the same nature but this already have become a _ reductio ad absurdum _ and can hardly survive the discredit into which it have fall in any reorganization of government look towards better result these element must disappear as a matter of fact government have come to occupy altogether too large a place in we consciousness naturally for it have come to a point where it pursue we -- and overtake we -- at every turn democracy always govern too much that be one of they great weakness election law-making and get and hold office have become a obsession and they shadow we day so insistent and incessant be the demand so artificial and unreal the issue so barren of vital result all this pandemonium of partisanship and change the more intelligent and scrupulous be lose interest in the whole affair and while they increasingly withdraw to matter of a greater degree of reality those who subsist on the proceeds gain the power and hold it at the very moment when the woman of the united state have be give the vote there be many man -lrb- and woman also -rrb- who begin to think that the vote be a very empty institution and in itself practically void of power to effect anything of really vital moment i be not now defend this position i only assert that it exist and i believe it be due to the degradation of government through the very modification and transformation that have be effect since the time of andrew jackson in a perfectly honest attempt at improvement the best government be that which do the least which leave local matter in the hand of locality and personal matter in the hand of person and which be modestly inconspicuous good government establish or recognize condition which be stable reliable and that may be count on for more than two year or four year at a time it have continuity it preserve tradition and it follow custom and common law such a government be neither hectic in its vicissitude nor inquisitorial in its enactment it be cautious in its expenditure efficient in its administration proud in maintain its standard of honor justice and noblesse oblige good government be August and handsome it surround itself with dignity and ceremony even at time with splendor and pageantry for these thing be sign of self-respect and the outward showing of high ideal -- or may be make so that be what good manners and ceremony and beauty be for finally good government be where the law of christian moral and courtesy and charity that be suppose to hold between christian man hold equally even more forcefully in public relation both domestic and foreign where government of this nature exist whether the form be monarchical republican or democratic there be liberty where these condition do not obtain the form matter not at all for there be a servile state at the risk of be tedious i will try to sketch the rough outline of what in substance i believe to be that form of civil polity which base on what now exist change only along line that would perhaps tend towards establish and maintain those ideal of liberty order and justice which have always be the common aim of those who have strive to reform a condition of thing where they be attain indifferently or not at all the primary and effective social and political unit be the vill or commune that be to say a group of family and individual live in one neighborhood and of a size that would permit all the member to know one another if they wish to do so and also the come together of all those hold the electoral franchise for common discussion and action the average american country town uninvaded by industrialism be the natural type for here the town meeting of we forefather be practicable and this remain the everlasting frame and model of self-government in the case of a city the primary unit would be of approximately the same size and the entire municipality would be divide into ward each contain say about five hundred voter these primary unit would possess a real unity and a very large measure of autonomy but they would be federate for certain common purpose which would vary in number and importance in proportion to the closeness of they common interest from the county make up of a number of small village to the city which would comprise as many ward as might be numerically necessary and whose central government would administer a great many more affair than would the county the city would be in effect a federation of the ward or borough the individual voter would exercise he electoral franchise and perform he political duty only within the primary unit -lrb- the township or ward -rrb- where he have legal residence at a annual town meeting he would vote for the selectman or the ward council who would have in charge the local interest of the primary unit which would be comprehensive in the case of a township necessarily more limited in the case of a ward these local board would elect they own chairman who would also form the legislative body of the county or the municipality at the same town meet the voter would cast he ballot for a representative in the lower legislative body of the state in the smaller commonwealth each township or ward would elect its own representative but in state of excessive population representation would have to be on the basis of county and municipality for no legislative body should contain more than a very few hundred member nomination in the town meeting should be _ viva voce _ election by secret ballot legislation should be primarily on the initiative of the selectman or ward council and voting should be _ viva voce _ with the exercise of he privilege of speaking and voting at the meeting of he primary unit the direct political action of the citizen would cease the secondary unit would be the county or the city here the legislative body would consist of the preside officer of the township or ward government the sheriff of a county or the mayor of a city would be choose by these legislative body from they own number and should hold office for a term of several year while the local government and therefore the legislative body of the county or the city would be choose annually the chief executive of a county or city would appoint all head of department who would form he advisory council and he would also frame and submit annually both a fiscal and a legislative budget the tertiary unit be the state which be a federation of the county and city form some one of the historic division of the united state the legislature would as now be compose of two chamber one make up of representative of the primary unit hold office for a brief term and a second represent the secondary unit and choose by they govern body for a long term the logic of a bi-cameral system demand that the lower house should represent the change will of the people the upper in so far as possible its cumulative wisdom and the continuity of tradition while as already state the whole principle be vitiate if both house be choose by the same electorate the chief executive should be choose by the legislative chamber in joint session from a panel make up of they own membership and the head of the county and city government he should hold office for a long term preferably for a indeterminate period contingent on good behavior in this case he cabinet or council of the head of department would of course be responsible to the legislature and would resign on a formal vote of censure or lack of confidence the governor would have the same power of appointment and the same authority to present fiscal and legislative budget as already specify in the case of a mayor of a city no commission unpaid or otherwise should be permit all the administrative function of government be perform by the various department and they subordinate bureau the national government be the final social and political unit though it be conceivable that with a territory and population as great and diversified as that of the united state and bear in mind the great discrepancy in size between the state something might be gain by the institution of a system of province some five or six in all make up of state group in accordance with they general community of interest as for example all new england new york pennsylvanium new jersey and delaware the state of the old confederacy those of the pacific coast and so on the point need not be press here but there be consideration in its favor in any case the nation as a whole be the final federal unit here the lower legislative house would consist of not more than four hundred member allocate on a basis of population and elect by the representative body of the primary unit -lrb- the township and city ward -rrb- as already describe the member of the upper house would be elect by the legislative body of the several state on nomination by the governor the chief executive of the nation would be choose by the two legislative body in joint session from amongst the then governor of the several state he should certainly hold office for good behavior and he cabinet would be responsible to the legislature as provide for in the case of the state government i do not offer this program with any pride of paternity probably it would not work very well but it could hardly prove less efficacious than we present system under condition as they have come to be this can not continue indefinitely for it be so hopelessly defective that it be bind to bring about its own ruin with the probable substitution of some doctrinaire device engender by the natural revolt against a intolerable abuse if only we could see condition clearly and estimate they at something approach they real value we should rapidly develop a constructive public opinion that even though it represent a minority might by the very force behind it compel the majority to acquiesce in a radical reformation unfortunately we do not do this we be hypnotize by phrase and delude by vain theory as mr chesterton say : so drugged and deaden be the public mind by the conventional public utterance so accustomed have we grow to public man talk this sort of pompous nonsense and no other that we be sometimes quite shock by the revelation of what man really think or else of what they really say we do now and then confess that legislation be as a whole foolish frivolous and opportunist that administration be wasteful incompetent and frequently venal that the governmental personnel legislative administrative and executive be of a low order in point of character intelligence and culture -- and tend lower each day we admit this for the evidence be so conspicuous that to deny it would be hypocrisy but something hold we back from recognize the nexus between effect and cause unrestricted immigration universal suffrage rotation in office the subjection of many office and measure to popular vote the parliamentary system government by political party -- all these custom and habit into which we have fall have arrive at failure which presage disaster they have fail because the character of the people that function through these various engine have fail dilute by the low mentality and character-content of million of immigrant and they offspring degrade by the false value and vicious standard impose by industrial civilization foot-loose from all binding and control of a vital and potent religious impulse or religious organism it be the old vicious circle spiritual energy decline or be divert into wrong channel thereupon the physical form social industrial political slip a degree or two lower out of sympathy with the fail energy and these in they turn exert a degrading influence on the wane spiritual force which decline still further only to be pull lower still by the material agency which continue they progressive declension theory no matter how high-minded and altruistic can not stand before a condition such as this for self-protection decree otherwise even if the higher motive of do right thing and get right thing just because they _ be _ right do not come into effective operation the evil result of the institution i have catalogue above be not to be deny and the institution themselves must be reform or altogether abandon in the face of the loud-mouthed exhortation of those who now make they they means of livelihood and even at the expense of the honest upholder of theory and doctrine that do credit to they humanitarianism but have be weigh and find want i be anxious not to put this plan for the reform in root and branch of we political institution on the low level of mere caution and self-defense the motive power of this be fear and fear be only second to hate in its present position as a control force in society we should have good government not because it be economical and ensure what be know as good business condition and promise a peaceful continuance of society but because it be as worthy a object of creative endeavor as noble art or a great literature or a just and merciful economic system or a life that be full of joy and beauty and wholesome labor the political organism be in a sense the microcosm of life itself and it should be society lift up to a level of dignity majesty and nobility the doctrine that in a democracy the government must exactly express the numerical preponderance in the social synthesis and that if this happen to be ignorant mannerless and corrupt then the government must be after the same fashion be a low and a cowardly doctrine government should be better than the majority better than the minority if this have advantage over the other it should be of the best that man can compass rest above he as in some sort a ideal the visible expression of he better self and the better self of the society of which he be a part if a political system any political system produce any other result if it have issue in a representation of the lowest and basest in society or even of the general average then it be a bad system and it must be redeem or it will bring a end that be couch in term of catastrophe reform be difficult perhaps even impossible of attainment under the exist system where universal unlimited suffrage and the party system be firmly intrench as opponent of vital reform and where representation and legislation take they indelible color from these unfortunate institution it must freely be admit that there be no chance of eliminate or recast either one or the other by the recognize method of platform support and mass action through the ballot it come in the end to a change of viewpoint and of heart on the part of the individual no party no political leader would for a moment endorse any one of the principle or method i have suggest for this would be a suicidal act the newspaper irresponsible anonymous direct by its advertizing interest or by those more sinister still yet for all that the factor that control the opinion of those who hold the balance of power in the community as it be now constitute would reject they with derision while in themselves they be radically oppose to the personal interest of the majority the only hope of lift government to the level of dignity and capacity it should hold lie in the individual it be necessary that we should see thing clearly estimate condition as they be and think through to the end we do not do this we admit in a dull sort of way that matter be not as they should be that legislation be generally silly and oppressive that taxation be excessive that administration be wasteful and reckless and incompetent for we know these thing by experience we accept they however with we national good-nature and easy tolerance assume that they be inseparable from democratic government -- as indeed they be but not for a moment do any large number think of question the principle or even the system that must take the responsibility when disgust and indifference reach a certain point we stop vote that be all at the last presidential election less than one half the qualify voter take the trouble to cast they ballot while in boston -lrb- which be no exception -rrb- it generally happen that at a municipal election the ballot cast be less than one-third the total electorate i wonder how many there be here today who have ever be to a ward meeting or have sit through a legislative session of a city government as of boston for example or have listen to the debate in a state house of representative or analyze the annual grist of legislative bill or have sit for a hour or two in the senate or house at washington such a experience be i assure you illuminate for it show exactly why popular government be what it be while it form a admirable basis for a constructive revision of judgment as to the soundness of accept principle and the validity of accept method we political attitude today be base on a inherit and automatic acceptance of certain perfectly automatic formula we neither see thing clearly estimate condition as they be nor think a proposition through to the end : we be obsess by old formula partisan slogan and newspaper aphorism the which be both unworthy and perilous let we see thing clearly for a moment if we do this anything be possible no matter how idealistic and apparently impracticable it may be be there any one who would confess that character and intelligence be now a helpless minority in this nation such a admission would be almost constructive treason the instinct of the majority be right but it be defective in will and it be subservient to base leadership while its power for good be negative by the persistence of a mass of formula that under radically change condition have cease to be beneficient or even true and have become a clog and a stumble block i may not have indicate better ideal or sounder method of operation but the true ideal exist and it be not beyond we ability to discover a better working system partisanship can not reveal either one or the other nor be they the fruit of organization or the attribute of political leadership they belong to the common citizen to you to the individual and if once superstition be cast out and we fall back on right reason and the eternal principle of the christian ethic and the christian ideal we shall not find they difficult of attainment and once attain they can be put in practice for the ill thing exist only on sufferance the right thing establish itself by force of its very quality of right vi the function of education and art when as on occasion happen some hostile criticism be level against the civilization of modernism or against some one of its many detail the reply be ready and the faultfinder be tell that the defect if it exist will in the end be obviate by the process of popular education press for more explicit detail as to just what may be the nature of this omnipotent and sovereign education the many champion give various answer depend more or less on the point of view and the peculiar predilection of each but the general principle be the same education they say consist of two thing the formal practice and training of the school and the experience that come through the use of certain public rights and privilege such as the ballot the holding of office service on jury and through various experience of the practice of life as the reading of newspaper -lrb- and perhaps book -rrb- the activity of work business and the profession and personal association with other man in social craft and professional club and other organization with the second category of education through experience we need not deal at this time it be a question by itself and of no mean quality the matter i would consider be the more formal and narrow one of scholastic training in so far as it bear on the great peace that though perhaps after many day must follow the great war and the little peace answer along this line the protagonist of salvation through education pretty well agree that the thing itself mean the widest possible extension of we public school system with free state university and technical school and the extension of the educational period with law so rigid and enforcement so pervasive and impartial that no child between the age of six and sixteen can possibly escape this free compulsory and universal education be assume to be scrupulously secular and hedge about with every safeguard against the insidious encroachment of religion it will aim to give a little training in most of the science and much in the practical necessity of business life as for example stenography book-keeping advertising and business science it will cover a broad field of manual training lead to graduate course in special technical school the laboratory method and field practice will be increasingly develop and apply latin greek logic and ancient history will be minimize or do away with altogether and modern language apply psychology and contemporary history will be correspondingly emphasize as for the state university it will allow the widest range of free elective and as a university it will aim to comprise within itself every possible department of practical activity such as business administration journalism banking and finance foreign trade political science psycho-analysis mining sanitary engineering veterinary surgery as well as law medicine agriculture and civil and mechanical engineering i be curious to inquire at this time if education such as this do as a matter of fact educate and how far it my be rely upon as a corrective for present defect in society or rather first of all whether education of this or of any sort may be look on as a sufficient save force and whether general education instead of be extend should not be curtail or rather safeguard and restricted i have already try to indicate in my lecture on the social organism certain doubt that be now arise as to the prophylactic and regenerative power of education whether this be base on the old foundation of the trivium and quadrivium under the supreme dominion of theology or on the new foundation of utilitarianism and apply science under the dominion of scientific pedagogy while the active-minded portion of society believe ardently in progressive evolution in the sufficiency of the intellect the inerrancy of the scientific method and the transmission by inheritance of acquire characteristic this supreme confidence in free secular compulsory education as the cure-all of the profuse and pervasive ill of society be not only natural but inevitable i submit that experience have measurably modify the situation and that we be bind therefore to reconsider we earlier persuasion in the light of somewhat reveal event we may admit that the system of modern education work measurably well so far as intellectual training be concerned _ training _ as distinguish from development it work measurably well also in prepare youth for participation in the life of apply science and for make money in business and finance conscientious hard labor have be give and be be give to make it more effective along these line and almost every year some new scheme be bring forward enthusiastically try out painstakingly and then cast aside ignominiously for some new and even more ingenious device the amount of education be enormous the total of money spend on new foundation course building equipment -- on everything but the pay of the teacher -- be princely the devotion of the teacher themselves in the face of inadequate wages be exemplary and yet somehow the result be disappointing the truth be the development of _ character _ be not in proportion to the development of public and private education the moral standing of the nation take as a whole have be degenerate in business in public affair in private life until the standard of value have be confuse the line of demarcation between right and wrong blur to indistinctness and the old motive of honor duty service charity chivalry and compassion be no longer the control motive or at least the conscious aspiration of active man this be not to say that these do not exist the period that have see the retrogression have record also a reaction and there be now perhaps more who be fire by the ardent passion for active righteousness than for several generation but the average be lower for where many time in the past there have be a broad general average of decency now the disparity be great between the motive that drive society as a whole and its method of operation and the remnant that find itself a unimportant minority newspaper be perhaps hardly a fair criterion of the moral status of a people -- or of anything else for that matter -- but what they record and the way they do it be at least a indication of a condition and after every possible allowance have be make what they record be a very alarming standard of public and private morality both in the happening themselves and in the fashion of they publicity no one would claim that the responsibility for this weakening of moral standard rest predominantly on the shoulder of the educational system of today the cause lie far deeper than this but the point i wish to make be that the process have not be arrest by education in spite of its prevalence and that therefore it be unwise to continue we exclusive faith in its remedial office the faith be never well found education can do much but what it do or can do be to foster and develop _ inherent possibility _ whether these be of character intelligence or aptitude : it can not put into a boy or man what be not there _ in posse _ at birth and humanly speak the diversity of potential in any thousand unit be limit only by the number itself whether we present educational method be those best calculate to foster and develop these inherent possibility so vary in nature and degree be the question and it be a question the answer to which depend largely on whether we look on intelligence capacity or character as the thing of greatest moment for those who believe that character be the thing of paramount importance -- amongst whom i count myself -- the answer must be in the negative nor be a affirmative reply entirely assure when the question be ask as to the result in the case of intellect and capacity there be few who would claim that in either of these direction the general standard be now as high as it be for example in the last half of the last century the great war bring to the front few personality of the first class and the peace that have follow have a even less distinguished record to date we may say with truth i think that the last ten year have provide greater issue and smaller man to meet they in the capacity of leader than any previous crisis of similar moment the art of leadership and the fact of leadership have be lose and without leadership any society particularly a democracy be in danger of extinction here again one can not charge education with we lack of man of character intelligence and capacity to lead as before the cause lie far deeper but the almost fatal absence at this time of the personality of such force and power that they can captain society in its hour of danger from war or peace must give we some basis for estimate the efficiency of we educational theory and practice and again raise doubt as to whether here also we shall be well advise if we rely exclusively upon it as the ultimate savior of society while we be bind to ask whether its method even of develop intelligence and capacity be the best that can be devise another point worth consider be this so long as we could lay the flattering unction to we soul that acquire characteristic be heritable and that therefore if a outcast from posen migrate to america have take advantage of he new opportunity and so have develop he character-potential amass money and acquire a measure of education and culture he would automatically transmit something of this to he offspring who would start so much the further forward and would tend normally to still greater advance and so on _ ad infinitum _ so long we be justify in enforce the widest measure of education on all and sundry and in wait in hope for a future when the cumulative process should have accomplish its perfect work now however we be tell that this hope be vain that acquire characteristic be not transmit by heredity and that the old folk-proverb it be only three generation between shirtsleeve and shirtsleeve be perhaps more scientifically exact than the evolutionary dictum of the nineteenth century which be what experience and history have be teach lo these many year the question then seem to divide itself into three part -lrb- a -rrb- be we justified in pin we faith in ultimate social salvation to free secular and compulsory education carry to the furthest possible limit -lrb- b -rrb- if not then what precisely be the function of formal education and -lrb- c -rrb- this be determine be we present method adequate and if not how should it be modify it be unwise to speak dogmatically along any of these line they be too blur and uncertain i can only express a individual opinion it seem to I that life unvaryingly testify to the extreme disparity of potential in individual and in family and in racial strain though in the two latter the difference be not necessarily absolute and permanent but variable in point of both time and degree in individual the limit of this potentiality be inherent and it can neither be completely inhibit by adverse education and environment nor measurably extend by favourable education and environment characteristic acquire _ outside _ inherent limitation be personal and non-heritable however intimately they may have become a part of the individual himself if this be true then the question of education become personal also that be to say we educate for the individual and with a eye to the part he himself be to play in society we do not look for cumulative result but in a sense deal with each personality in regard to itself alone i think this have a bear both on the extent to which education should be enforce and on the quality and method of education itself and though the contention will receive little but ridicule i be bind to say that i hold that _ general _ education should be reduce in quantity and considerably change in nature if the limit of development be substantially determine in each individual and can not be extend by human agency -lrb- i say human because god in he wisdom and by he power can raise up a prophet or a saint out of the lowest depths and frequently do so -rrb- then the quantity and extent of general education should be determine not by a period of year and the facility offer by a government liberal in its expenditure but entirely by the demonstrate or indicate capacity of the individual we educational system should so far as it be free and compulsory normally end with the high school grade free college university and technical training should not be provide except for those who have give unmistakable evidence that they could and probably would use it to advantage this would be provide for by non-competitive scholarship limit in number only by the number of capable candidate and determination of this capacity would be not on the basis of test examination but on a average record cover a considerable period of time it be doubtful if even these scholarship should be wholly free some responsibility should be recognize for a good half of the value of a thing -lrb- perhaps all its value -rrb- lie in work for it a grant without service a favor accept without obligation privilege without function both cheapen and degrade let we now turn to the second question ie what precisely be the function of formal education for my own part i can answer this in a sentence it be primarily the foster and development of the character-potential inherent in each individual in this process intellectual training and expansion and the further of natural aptitude have a part but this be secondary to the major object which be the development of character this be not in accordance with the practice or the theory of recent time and in this fact lie one of the prime cause of failure the one thing man exist to accomplish be character not worldly success and eminence in any line not the conquest of nature -lrb- though some have hold otherwise -rrb- not even adaptation to environment in the _ argot _ of last century science but _ character _ the assimilation and fix in personality of high and noble quality of thought and deed the furtherance in a word of the eternal sacramental process of redemption of matter through the operation of spiritual force without this social and political system imperial dominion wealth and power a favourable balance of trade avail nothing with it form and method and the enginery of living will look out for themselves and yet this thing which comprise the whole duty of man have of late fall into a singular disregard while the constructive force that count have either be discredit and largely abandon as in the case of religion or like education turn into other channel or reverse altogether as have happen with the idea and practice of obedience discipline self-denial duty honor and unselfishness surely the most fantastic issue of the era of enlightenment of liberty and of freedom of conscience as a matter of fact character as the chief end of man and the sole guaranty of a decent society have be neglect it be not disregard by any conscious process but the headlong event that have follow since the fifteenth century have steadily distort we judgment and confuse we standard of value even to reversal by a imperceptible process other matter have come to engage we interest and control we action until at last we be confront by the nemesis of we own unwisdom and we entertain the threat of a dissolve civilization just because the force we have engender or set loose have not be curb or direct by that vigorous and potent personal character inform a people and a society that we have forget in we haste and that alone could give we safety formal education be but one of the factor that may be employ towards the development of character you can not so easily separate one force in life from another assign a specific duty here a definite task there that be one of the weakness of we time the water-tight compartment plan of high specialization the cellular theory of efficiency life must be see as a whole organize as a whole live as a whole every thought every emotion every action work for the building or the unbuilding of character and this synthesis of live must be reestablish before we can hope for social regeneration nevertheless formal education may be make a powerful factor even now and not only in this one specific direction but through this for the accomplishing of that unification of life that already be indicate as the next great task that be set before we and this bring I to a consideration of the last of the question i have propose for answer viz : be we present system of education adequate to the sufficient development of character and if not how should it be modify i do not think it adequate and experience seem to I to prove the point it have not maintain the sturdy if sometimes acutely unpleasant character of the new england stock or the strong and handsome character of the race that dwell in the thirteen original colony as this manifest itself well into the last century and it have in general breed no new thing in the million of immigrant and they descendant who have flood the country since 1840 and from whom the public school and some of the college be largely recruit it be not a question of expand brain power or apply aptitude but of character and here there be a larger measure of failure than we have a right to expect and yet have we this right the avowed object of formal education be mental and vocational training and by no stretch of the imagination can we hold these to be synonymous with character we have deal with and through one thing alone and that be the intellect whereas character be rather the product of emotion judiciously stimulate balanced -lrb- not control -rrb- by intellect and apply through active and vary experience deliberately have we cut out every emotional and spiritual factor not only religion and the fine art but also the study and the method of study and the type of text-book that might have help in the process of spiritual and emotional development we have eliminate latin and greek or teach they as a branch of philology we have make english a technical exercise in analysis and composition disregard the moral and spiritual significance of the work of the great master of english we minimize ancient history and concentrate on european history since the french revolution and on the history of the united state and because of the sensitiveness of we endless variety of religionist -lrb- pro forma -rrb- text book be write which leave religion out of history altogether -- and frequently economics and politics as well when these can not be make to square with popular conviction philosophy and logic be already pretty well discard except for special elective and post-graduate course and as for art in its multifarious form we know it not unless it be in the rudimentary and devitalized form of free-hand drawing and occasional concerted singing the only thing that be leave in the line of emotional stimulus be competitive athletics and for this reason i sometimes think it one of the most valuable factor in public education it have however another function and that be the coordination of training and life it be in a sense a _ école d'application _ and through it the student for once in a way try out he acquire mental equipment and he expand character -- as well as he physical prowess -- against the circumstance of active vitality it be just this sort of thing that for so long make the public school of england however limited or defective may have be the curriculum a vital force in the development of british character at best however this seem to I but a indifferent substitute a inadequate extra do limitedly the real work of education by indirection what we need -lrb- grant my assumption of character as the _ terminus ad quem _ -rrb- be a educational system so recast that the formal study and the collateral influence and the school life shall be more coordinate in themselves and with life and that the result stimulus shall be equally operative along intellectual emotional and creative line it be sufficiently easy to make suggestion as to how this be to be accomplish to lay out program and lay down curriculum but here as elsewhere this do not amount to much the change must come and the institution develop as the result of the operation of life if we can change we view of the object of education the very force of life work through experience will adequately determine the form it be not therefore as a meticulous and mechanical system that i make the follow suggestion as to certain desirable change but rather to indicate more exactly what i mean by a scheme of education that will work primarily towards the development of character now in the first place i must hold that there can be no education which work primarily for character building that be not interpenetrate at every point by definite concrete religion and the practice of religion as i shall try to show in my last two lecture religion be the force or factor that link action with life it be the only power available to man that make possible a sound standard of comparative value and with philosophy teaching man how to put thing in they right order it enter to show he how to control they well while it offer the great constructive energy that make the world a orderly unity rather than a type of chaos until the reformation there be no question as to this and even after in the nation that accept the great revolution the point be for a time maintain thereafter the centrifugal tendency in protestantism result in such a wealth of mutually antagonistic sect that the application of the principle become impracticable and for this as well as for more fundamental reason it fall into desuetude the condition be as difficult today for the process of denominational fission have go steadily forward and as this energy of the religious influence weaken the strenuosity of maintenance strengthen with we 157 variety of protestantism confront catholicism hebraism and a mass of frank rationalism and infidelity as large in amount as all other combine it would seem at first sight impossible to harmonize free public education with concrete religion in any intimate way so it be but if the principle be recognize and accept way and means will offer themselves and ultimately the principle will be embody in a workable scheme for example there be one thing that can be do anywhere and whenever enough vote can be assemble to carry through the necessary legislation at present the law regard with a austere disapproval that reflect a popular opinion -lrb- now happily tend towards decay -rrb- what be know as denominational school and other institution of learn those that maintain the necessity of a intimate union between religion and education as for example the great majority of roman catholic and a increase number of episcopalian and presbyterian be tax for the support of secular public school which they do not use while they must maintain at additional and very great expense parochial and other private school where they child may be teach after a fashion which they hold to be necessary from they own point of view again state support be refuse to such school or college as may be under specific religious control while pension fund for the teacher establish by generous benefaction be explicitly reserve for those who be on the faculty of institution which formally dissociate themselves from any religious influence i maintain that this be both unjust and against public policy under we present system of religious individualism and ecclesiastical multiplicity approximation only be possible but i believe the wise and just plan would be for the state to fix certain standard which all school receive financial support from the public fund must maintain and then this condition be carry out distribute the fund receive from general taxation to public and private school alike this would enable episcopalian let we say or roman catholic or jew when in any community they be numerous enough to provide a sufficiency of scholar for any primary grammar or high school to establish such a school in as close a relationship to they own religion as they desire and have this school maintain out of the fund of the city this be not a purely theoretical proposition after a agitation lasting nearly half a century holland have this year put such a law in force from every point of view we should do well to recognize this plan as both just and expedient one virtue it would have apart from those already note be the variation it would permit in curriculum text book personnel and scholastic life as between one school and another there be no more fatal error in education than that standardization which have recently become a fad and which find its most mechanistic manifestation in france of course this need for the fortifying of education by religion be recognize even now but the only plan devise for put it into effect be one whereby various minister of religion be allow a certain brief period each week in which they may enter the public school and give denominational instruction to those who desire they particular ministration this be one of the compromise like the older method of bible read without commentary or exposition which avail nothing and be apt to be worse than frank and avowed secularism it be put religion on exactly the same plane as analytical chemistry psychoanalysis or salesmanship -lrb- the latter i be tell be about to be introduce in the massachusett high school -rrb- or any other elective whereas if it be to have any value whatever it must be a ever-present force permeate the curriculum the mind of the teacher and the school life from end to end and there be no way in which this can be accomplish except by a policy that will permit the maintenance of school under religious domination at the expense of the state provide they comply with certain purely educational requirement establish and enforce by the state i have already point out what seem to I the desirability of a considerable variation between the curriculum of one school and another this would be possible and probably certain under the scheme propose but bar this it be surely a open question whether the pretty thoroughly standardized curriculum now in operation would not be considerably modify to advantage if it be recognize that the prime object of education be character rather than mental training and the fitting of a pupil to obtain a pay job on graduation from my own point of view the answer be in a vociferous affirmative i suggest the drastic reduction of the very superficial science course in all school up to and include the high school certainly in chemistry physics and biology but perhaps with some add emphasis on astronomy geology and botany history should become one of the fundamental subject and english both be teach for they humanistic value and not as exercise in memory or for the purpose of make a student a sort of dictionary of date this would require a considerable rewrite of history text book as well as a corresponding change in the method of teaching but after all be not these both consummation devoutly to be wish there be few history like mr chesterton 's short history of england unfortunately one would perhaps hardly commend this stimulate book as a sufficient statement of english history for general use in school but its approach be wholly right and it possess the singular virtue of interest another thing that commend it be the fact that while it run from caesar to mr lloyd george it contain i believe only seven specific date three of which be possibly wrong this be as it should be -- not the inaccuracy but the commendable frugality in point of number date apart from a few key year be of small historical importance so be the detail of palace intrigue and military campaign history be or should be life express in term of romance and it be of little moment whether the narrated incident be establish by documentary evidence or whether they be contemporary legend quite unsubstantiated by what be know -lrb- and overestimate -rrb- as fact there be more of the real middle age in mallory 's mort d'arthur than there be in all hallam and the same antithesis can be establish for nearly all other period of history the history of man be one great dramatic romance and so use it may be make perhaps the most stimulating agency in education as character development i do not mean romance in the sense in which mr well take it that be to say the dramatic assemble and clever coördination of unsubstantiated theory personal preference prejudice and aversion under the guise of solemn and irrefutable truth attest by all the exact science know to man but romance which aim like any other art at communicate from one person to another something of the inner and essential quality of life as it have be live even if the material use be textually doubtful or even probably apocryphal the deadly enemy of good sound history be scientific historical criticism the true history be romantic tradition the stimulate thing the tale that make the blood leap the pictorial incident that raise up in a instant the luminous vision of some great thing that once be i would not exchange kit marlowe 's _ be this the face that launch a thousand ship and burn the topless tower of ilium _ for all the critical commentary of teutonic pedant on the character and attribute of helen of troy as these have -lrb- to they -rrb- be reveal by archaeological investigation i dare say that bishop st remus of reim never say in so many word bow thy proud head sicambrian destroy what thou hast worship worship what thou hast destroy and that the meroving monarch do not go thence to issue a order of the day that the army should forthwith march down to the river and be baptize by battalion but _ there _ be the clear unforgettable picture of the time and the man and it will remain after the world have forget that some one have prove that st remus never meet clovi and that he himself be probably only a variant of the great and original sun-myth closely ally with the teaching of history and form a link as it be with the teaching of english be a branch of study at present unformulated and unknown but i be convince of great importance in education as a method of character development life have always focus in great personality and formal history have recognize the fact while show little discretion and sometimes very defective judgment in the choice it have make a past period become we own in so far as we translate it through its personality and its art the original document matter little except when they become misleading as they frequently do when read through contemporary spectacles now the great figure of a time be not only prince and politician conqueror and conspirator they be quite as apt to be the knight and hero and brave gentleman who hold no conspicuous position in church or state i think we need what might be call the golden book of knighthood -- or a series of text book adapt to elementary and advanced school -- make up of the life and deed -lrb- whether attest by original document or legendary or even fabulous do not matter -rrb- of those in all time and amongst all people who be the glory of knighthood the parfait gentyl knyghte without fear and without reproach such for example to go no farther back than the christian era as st george and st martin king arthur and launcelot and galahad charle martel and roland st loui godfrey de bouillon and saladin the earl of strafford montrose and claverhouse the chevalier bayard don john of austrium washington and robert lee and george wyndham these be but a few name remember at random there be score besides and i think that they should be hold up to honor and emulation throughout the formative period of youth after all they become during the year when these quality be exalt the personification of the ideal of honor and chivalry of compassion and generosity of service and self-sacrifice and courtesy and these the qualification of a gentleman and a man or honor be with the religion that foster they and the practice of that religion the just objective of education much of all this can even now be teach through a judicious use of the opportunity offer instructor in english whether this be through the grade reader of elementary education or the more extended course in college and university very frequently these opportunity be ignore and will be until we achieve something of a new orientation in the matter of teaching english now it may be i hold a vain and untenable view of this subject but i be willing to confess that i believe the object of teaching english be the unlocking of the treasure of think character and emotion preserve in the write record of the tongue and the arouse of a desire to know and assimilate these treasure on the part of the pupil i be very sure that english should not be teach as a thing end in ology not as a intricate science with all sort of law and rule and exception not as a system whereby the little child of the ghetto and the offspring of pittsburgh millionaire and the spectacled infant elect of beacon hill may all be raise to the point where they can write with acceptable fluency the chiseled phrase of matthew arnold the cadenced latinity of sir thoma browne the sonorous measure of bolingbroke or the distinguished and resonant period of the king jame bible such a aim as this will always result in failure the english language be the great storehouse of the rich thought and the burning emotion of the english race and all this as it have issue out of character work towards the development of character when it be make operative in new generation there be no other language but latin that have preserve so great a wealth of invaluable thing and english be teach in order that it all may be more available through that appreciation that come from familiarity there be no nobler record in the world : from chaucer down to the modern be one splendid sequence of character-revelation through a perfect but varied art for literature be also a fine art and one of the greatest of all be it not fair to say that the chief duty of the teacher of english be to lead the student to like great literature to find it and enjoy it for himself and through it to come to the liking of great idea in the old day there be a historical or rather archaeological method that be popular also a analytical and grammarian method there be also the philological method which be quite the worst of all and have almost as devastating result as in the case of latin it almost seem as though english be be teach for the production of a community of highly specialize teacher no one would now go back to any of those quaint and archaic way dig up out of the dim and remote past of the xixth century we should all agree i think that for general education specialize technical knowledge be unimportant and scientific intensive method unjustifiable for one student who will turn out a teacher there be five hundred that will be just simple voter wage-earner reader of the Saturday evening post and the new republic member of the fourth presbyterian church or the ethical society and respectable head of family the school of pedagogy have its own method -lrb- i be give to understand -rrb- but under correction i submit they be not those of general education shall i put the whole thing in a phrase and say that the object of teaching english be to get young people to like good thing you may say this be english literature not english be the two so very far apart english as a language be teach to make literature available example be better than precept reading good literature for the love of it will bring in the habit of grammatical speaking and write far more effectively than what be know as a thorough grounding in the principle of english grammar i doubt if the knowledge of and facility in english can be build up on such a basis rather the law should be deduce from example philology etymology syntax be derivative not foundation practice make perfect be a say that need to be follow by the old scholastic defensive _ distinguo _ practice in reading rather than practice in write make good english composition possible the daily theme may be overdo it be of little use unless _ thought _ keep ahead of the pen i would plead then for the teaching of english after a fashion that will reveal great thought and stimulate to greater life through the noble art of english literature and the perfectly illogical but altogether admirable english language the function of education be to make student feel think and act after a fashion that increasingly reveal and utilize the best that be in they and increasingly serve the use of society and both history and english can be so teach as to help towards the accomplishment of these end there be another factor that may be so used but i confess i shall speak of it with some hesitation it be at present and have be for age entirely outside the possibility even of consideration and in a sense that go beyond the general ignore of religion for while catholic who form the great majority of christian still hold to religion as a prime element in education there be none -- or only a minority so small as to be negligible -- who give a think to art in this connection i bring forward the word and the thing it represent with diffidence even apologetically : indeed it be perhaps better to renounce the word altogether and substitute the term beauty for during the nineteenth century art get a bad name not altogether undeservedly and the disrepute linger so long as beauty be a instinct native to man -lrb- and it be this except for very brief and periodic interval until hardly more than a century ago though latterly in a vanish form -rrb- it be wholesome stimulating and indispensable but when it become self-conscious when it find itself the possession of a few highly differentiate individual instead of the attribute of man as such then it tend to degenerate into something abnormal and in its last estate both futile and unclean in its good estate as for example in greece byzantium the middle age and in oriental country until the last few decade beauty be so natural a object of endeavor and a mode of expression and its universality result in so characteristic a environment it be unnecessary to talk about it very much or to give any particular thought to the educational value of the art which be its manifestation through and to man or how this be to be apply the thing be there everywhere at hand the temple and church the painting and the sculpture and the work of handicraft the music and poetry and drama the ceremonial and costume of daily life both secular and religious the very city in which man congregate and the village in which they be disperse beauty in all its concrete form of art be highly value almost as highly as religion or liberty or bodily health but then it be a part of normal life and therefore take for grant now all be change for just a hundred year -lrb- the process definitely begin here in america between 1820 and 1823 -rrb- we have be eliminate beauty as a attribute of life and living until during the last two generation it be true to say that the instinctive impulse of the race as a whole be towards ugliness in those category of creation and appreciation where formerly it have be towards beauty of course the corollary of this be the driving of the unhappy man in whom be bear some belated impulse towards the apprehending of beauty and its visible expression in some art back upon himself until conscious of he isolation and confident of he own superiority he not only make he art a form of purely personal expression -lrb- or even of exposure -rrb- but hold himself to be and so conduct himself as a be apart for whom the law of the herd be not and to whom all man should bow the separation of art from life be only less disastrous in its result than the separation of religion from life particularly since with the former go the separation of art -lrb- and therefore of beauty -rrb- from its immemorial alliance with religion it be bad for art it be bad for religion and it be worst of all for life itself beyond a certain point man can not live in and with and through ugliness nor can society endure under such condition and the fact be that however it come to pass modern civilization have function through explicit ugliness and the environment it have make for its votary and its rebel indifferently be unique in its palpable hideousness from the clothes it wear and the motive it extol to the city it build and the structure therein and the scheme of life that romp along in its ruthless career within the sordid suburb that take the place of the once enclose wall and the defiant and segregate artist mortuary art museum the expose statue and hidden picture the opera subsidize by high society and the art and craft society and the art magazine and art school and club and city beautiful committee only seem to make the contrast more apparent and the desperate nature of the situation more profound it be a new situation altogether and nowhere in history be there any record precedent to which we can return for council and example for nothing quite of the same sort ever happen before it be also a problem of which formal education must take cognizance for the lack be one which must somehow be supply while it reveal a astonishing _ lacuna _ in life that mean a new deficiency in the unconscious education of man that render he ineffective in life defective even it may be unless from some source he can acquire something of what in the past life itself could afford indeed it be not merely a negative influence we deal with but a positive for to paraphrase a little ugly association corrupt good moral youth be beat upon at many point by thing that not only look ugly but be and as in compassion we be bind to offer some new agency to fill a lack so in self-defence we must take think as to how the evil influence of contemporaneousness be to be nullify and its result correct i confess the method seem to I to lean more closely to the indirect influence rather than the direct it be doubtful if art can really be teach in any sense the inherent sense of beauty can be foster and a inherent aptitude develop but that be about all as for the building up of a non-professional passion for art i be quite sure it can not be do and should hardly be attempt and very likely the same be true of the application of beauty text book on how to understand this art or that be interesting venture into abstract theory but they be little more we must always remember that art be a result not a product and that sense of beauty be a natural gift and not a accomplishment on the other hand much can be accomplish by indirection and by this i mean the building and the grounds and the cultural adjunct that be offer by any school or college the ordinary type of school-house -- primary grammar or high school -- be in its barren ugliness and its barbarous efficiency a very real outrage on decency and a few braun photograph and plaster cast and potted plant avail nothing private school and some college -- by no means all -- be apt to be somewhat better and here the improvement during the last ten year have be amazing one or two university have acquire single building or group of the most astonishing architectural beauty in no case however have as yet complete unity be achieve while the art of painting sculpture music and the drama as vital and operative and pervasive influence lag far behind and formal religion with its liturgy and ceremonial its constant and vary service and its fine and appealing pageantry -- religion which be the greatest vitalize and stimulate force in beauty be hardly touch at all bad art of any kind be bad anywhere but in any type of educational institution from the kindergarten to the post graduate college it be worse and less excusable than it be elsewhere unless it be in association with religion while the absence of beauty at the instigation of parsimony or efficiency be just as bad i be firmly persuade that we need not more course of study but more beautiful environment for scholar under instruction i have touch cursorily on certain element in education which need either a new emphasis or a altogether new interpretation religion history art but this do not mean that the same treatment should not be accord elsewhere there be certain study that should be revive such as formal logic there be other that need immediate and complete restoration as latin for example there be many chiefly along scientific and vocational line that could well be minimize or in some case dispense with altogether : one might go on indefinitely on this line however weigh and test study in relation to they character-value but certainly enough have already be say to indicate the point of view i would urge for consideration before i close however i want to touch on two point that arise in connection with college education if even for the sake of argument we admit that the primary object of all formal education be the education of the character-capacity in each individual of these two the first have to do with the college curriculum but i need to devote little time to this for the principle have already be develop and apply in a singularly stimulate and lucid book call the liberal college by president meiklejohn of amherst to which i beg to refer you the scheme be a remarkable blending of the prescribe and the elective system and provide for the freshman year five compulsory study viz : social and economic institution mathematics and formal logic science english and foreign language for the sophomore year european history philosophy science literature and one elective for the junior year american history history of thought and two elective and for the senior year one require study intellectual and moral problem and one elective the latter which take two-third of the student 's time must be a continuation of one of the four subject include in the junior year it seem to I that this be a singularly wise program since it not only determine the few study which be fundamental and impose they on the student in diminish number as he advance in he work but it also provide for that freedom of choice which permit any student to find out and continue the particular line along which he inclination lead he to travel until he senior year be chiefly give over to the fullest possible development of the special subject the fad for free elective all along the line be one of those curious phenomenon both humorous and tragic that grow out of the evolutionary philosophy and the empirical democracy of the nineteenth century and it work disaster while the ironclad curriculum that precede it be almost as bad along a opposite line this project of dr meiklejohn 's seem to I to recognize life as a force and to base itself on this sure foundation instead of on the shift sand of doctrinaire theory and if this be so then it be right for after all there be such a thing as life and it be more potent than theory as it also have a way of disregard or even smash the machine it be this force of life that should be more regard in education and more rely upon it be the living in a school or a college that count more than a curriculum the association with other student and teacher the communal life the common adventure and scrape the common sport yes and as it will be sometime the common worship it be through these that life work and character develop and to this development and instigation of life the school and college should work more assiduously minimize for the moment the problem of curriculum and pedagogic method if i be right in this there be no place for the correspondence school while the college or university that number its student by thousand become at least of doubtful value and perhaps impossible in any case it seem to I self-evident that a college whatever its number must have as its primal and essential unit self-contained group of not more than 150 student segregate in they own residential quad with its common-room refectory and chapel and with a certain number of faculty member in residence the whole be unite under one head there may be perhaps no reason why grant this unit system these should not be multiply in number until the whole student body be as great as that of a western state university today but to I the idea be abhorrent of a university with five or ten thousand student all jostle together in one inchoate mass eating in numerical mob assemble in social union as large as a metropolitan hotel and almost as homelike or take refuge for safety from mere number in club fraternity and secret society a college such as this be a mob not a organism and as a mob it ought to be put down i say at the outset of this lecture that we could not lay the present failure of civilization to the door of education however great its shortcoming for the cause lay deeper than this i maintain that this be true and yet formal education can not escape scatheless for it have fail to admit this decline while acknowledge the claim set up for it that it could and would achieve this end certainly it will incur a heavy responsibility if it do not at once recognize the fact that while it can not do the half that have be claim for it it can do far more than it be do now and that in a very large degree the future do depend for its honor or its degradation on the part formal education be to perform at the present crisis to do this it must execute a _ volte face _ and confess that it can only develop inherent potential not create capacity and that the primary object of its activity must be not the stall-feeding of intellect and the practical preparation for a business career but the foster and the building up of the personal character that denote the christian gentleman i do not think that i can do better for a conclusion than to quote from the philosophy of education by the late dr thoma edward shield the unchanging aim of christian education be and always have be to put the pupil into possession of a body of truth derive from nature and from divine revelation from the concrete work of man 's hand and from the content of human speech in order to bring he conduct into conformity with christian ideal and with the standard of the civilization of he day christian education therefore aim at transform native instinct while preserve and enlarge they power it aim at bring the flesh under the control of the spirit it draw upon the experience and the wisdom of the race upon divine revelation and upon the power of divine grace in order that it may bring the conduct of the individual into conformity with christian ideal and with the standard of the civilization of the day it aim at the development of the whole man at the preservation of unity and continuity in he conscious life it aim at transform man 's native egotism to altruism at develop the social side of he nature to such a extent that he may regard all man as he brother share with they the common fatherhood of god in one word it aim at transform a child of the flesh into a child of god vii the problem of organic religion if philosophy be the science of the totality of thing and they be call wise who put thing in they right order and control they well then it be religion above all other factor and potency that enter in to reveal the right relationship and standard of value and to contribute the redemptive and energize force that make possible the adequate control which be the second factor in the conduct of the man that be call wise philosophy and religion be not to be confound religion be sufficient in itself and develop its own philosophy but the latter be not sufficient in itself and when it assume the function and prerogative of religion it bring disaster religion be the force that relate action to life of course it have other aspect higher in essence and more impalpable in quality but it be this first aspect i shall deal with because i be not now speak of religion as a purely spiritual power but only of its quality as the great coordinator of human action the power that establish a right ratio of value and give the capacity for right control whether we accept the religion of the middle age or not whether we look on the period as one of high and edifying christian civilization or as a time of ignorance and superstition we be bind to admit that society in its physical intellectual and spiritual aspect be highly organize and coordinate after a most masterly fashion it be more nearly a unit function lucidly and consistently than anything the world have know since the roman empire whatever its defect lack of coherency be not one of they life be not divide into water-tight compartment but move on as a consistent whole failure be constant for the world even then be make up of man but the ideal be perfectly clear-cut the principle exactly see and explicitly formulate life be organic consistent highly articulate and withal as full of the passion of aspiration towards a ultimate ideal as be the gothic cathedral which be its perfect exemplar the reason for this coherency and consistency be the universal recognition and acceptance of religion as the one energize and standardize force in life the particular kind of religion that then prevail and the organic power which this religion have establish that be to say the church as a operative institution so long as this condition obtain which be roughly speak for three hundred year from the truce of god in 1041 to the beginning of the babylonian captivity of the papacy at avignon in 1309 there be substantial unity in life but as soon as it be shake this unity begin to break up into a diversity that accomplish a condition of chaos at and around the opening of the sixteenth century which only yield to the absolutism of the renaissance destine in its turn to break up into a second condition of chaos under the influence of industrialism puritanism and revolution since the accomplishment of the reformation this function of religion have never be restore to society in any degree comparable with that which it maintain during the middle age the counter-reformation preserve the institution itself in the mediterranean land but it do not restore its old spiritual power in its entirety amongst the people that accept the reformation the new religion assume for a time the authority of the old but the centrifugal force inherent in its nature soon split the reform church into myriad fragment so destroy they power of action while the abandonment of the sacramental system progressively weaken they dynamic force as it have from the first compound under compulsion with absolutism and tyranny so in the end it compromise with the cruelty selfishness injustice and avarice of industrialism and when finally this achieve world supremacy and physical science materialistic philosophy and social revolution enter the field as co-combatant it no longer possess a sufficient original power either of resistance or of re-creative energy religion be in itself not the reaction of the human mind under process of evolution to certain physical stimulus of experience and phenomenon it be supernatural in that its source be outside nature it be a manifestation of the grace of god and as such it can not be bring into existence by any conscious action of man or by any of he work on the other hand it can be foster and preserve or debilitate and disperse by these human act and institution and in the same way man himself may be make more receptive to this divine grace or turn against it by the same agency the teaching of dr john calvin to the contrary notwithstanding this be part of the catholic doctrine of free-will as oppose to the sixteenth-century dogma of predestination which distorted and degrade from the doctrine of st paul and st augustine play so large a part in that transformation of the christian religion from which we have suffer ever since god offer the free gift of religion and of faith to every child of man but the recipient must cooperate if the gift be to be accept the church that be to say the supernatural organism that be give material form in time and space and operate through human agency be for this reason subject to great vicissitude now rise to the highest level of righteousness and power now sink into depths of unrighteousness and impotence nothing however can affect the validity and the potency of its supernatural content and its supernatural channel of grace these remain unaffected whether the human organism be exalt or debase the sacrament and devotions and practice of worship be in themselves as potent if a borgium sit in the chair of st peter as they be if a hildebrand and innocent iii or a leo xiii be the occupant nevertheless every weakening or degradation of the visible organism affect and inevitably the attitude of man towards the thing itself and when this declension set in and continue unchecked the result be first a fall away and a discrediting of religion that sometimes result in general abandonment and second -- and after a time -- a new outpouring of spiritual power that result in complete regeneration the church in its human manifestation be as subject to the rhythmical rise and fall of the current of life as be the social organism or man himself therefore it be not to be expect that it will pursue a course of even exaltation or maintain a status that be impeccable now the work out of this law have issue in a great decline that begin with the exile at avignon and be not terminate until the council of trent in the depth of this catastrophe come the natural and righteous revolt against the manifold and intolerable abuse but like all reform movement that take on a revolutionary character reform and regeneration be soon forget in the unleash passion for destruction and innovation while the new doctrine of emancipation from authority and the right of private judgment in religious matter be seize upon by sovereign chafe under ecclesiastical control as a providential means of effect and establish they own independence and so give a importance and a ultimate victory that in and by themselves they could hardly have achieve in the end it be the secular and autocratic state that reap the victory not the reform religion which be first use as a tool and then abandon to its inevitable break-up into numberless antagonistic sect some of they retain a measure of the old faith and polity other represent all the illiteracy and uncouthness and fanaticism of the new racial and social factor as these emerge at long last from the submergence and the oppression that have be they fate with the dissolution of mediaevalism meanwhile the roman church which stand rigidly for historic christianity and have be preserve by the counter-reformation to the mediterranean state continue bind to the autocratic and highly centralized administrative system that have become universal among secular power during the decadence of mediaevalism and from which it have take its color and it keep even pace for the future with the progressive intensification of this absolutism this be natural though in many respects deplorable and it can be safely say that adverse criticism of the catholic church today be base only on quality it acquire during the period of renaissance autocracy and revive paganism quality that do not affect its essential integrity or authority but do misrepresent it before man and work as a handicap in its adaptability and in its work of win soul to christianity and re-establish the unity of christendom fortunately this very immobility have save it from a surrender to the new force that be develop in secular society during the last two century as it do yield to the compulsion of those that be let loose in the two that precede they it have never subject question of faith and moral to popular vote nor have it determine discipline by parliamentary practice under a well develop party system therefore it have preserve its unity its integrity and its just standard of comparative value on the other hand it have hold so stubbornly to some of the ill way of renaissance centralization which be in no sense consonant with its character that it have fail to retard the constant movement of society away from a life wherein religion be the dominate and coordinate force while at the present crisis it be as yet hardly more able than a divisive protestantism to offer the regenerative energy that a desperate case demand i do not know whether secular society be responsible for the decadence of religion or the decadence of religion be responsible for the failure of secular society nor do it particularly matter what i be concern with be a condition amounting to almost complete severance between the two and how we may knit up this ravelled sleeve of life so that once more we may have a wholesome unity in place of the present disunity for until this be accomplish until once more religion enter into the very marrow of social be enter with all its power of judgment and determination and co-ordination and creative energy just so long shall we seek in vain for we way out into the great peace of righteous and consistent living of course there be only one sure way one method by which this and all we manifold difficulty can be resolve and that be through the achieve enlightenment of the individual as i have insist in each of these lecture salvation be not through machinery but through the individual soul for it be life itself that be operate not the instrument that man devise in he ingenuity yet the mechanism be of great value for even itself may give aid and stimulus in the personal regenerative process or on the contrary it may deter this by the confusing and misleading influence it create therefore we be bind to regard material reform and of these as they suggest themselves in the field of organize religion i propose to speak no one will deny the progressive alienation of life from religion that have develop since the reformation and have now reach a point of almost complete severance religion once a public preoccupation have now withdraw to the fastness of the individual soul when it have not vanish altogether as it have in the case of the majority of citizen of this republic in so far as definite faith explicit belief application practice and action be concern in the hermitage that some still make within themselves religion still live on as ardent and as potent and as regenerative as before but in general if we be to judge from the conduct of recent life it be hold when it be accept at all with a certain formality and be neither cherish with conviction nor allow to interfere with the everyday life of the practical man as a great english statesman remark in the last century no one have a higher regard for religion than i but when it come to intrude it into public affair well really -- the situation be one not unnaturally to be anticipate for the whole course of religious secular and sociological development during the last few century have be such as to make any other result improbable i already have try to show what seem to I the destructive factor secularly and sociologically as for the factor in religious development that have work towards the same end they be first the shatter of the unity of christendom with the denial by those of the reform religion of the existence of a church one visible and catholic and infallible in matter of faith and moral second the denial of sacramental philosophy and abandonment of the sacrament -lrb- or all but one or at most two of they -rrb- as instrument of divine grace third the surrender of the various religious organism to the compulsion of the materialistic worldly and opportunist factor in the secular life of modernism the truth correspond to these three error be unity sacramentalism and unworldliness until these three thing be win back christianity will fail of its full mission society will continue aimless uncoördinate and on the verge of disaster life itself will lack the meaning and the reality that give both joy in the living and victory in achievement while the individual man will be gravely handicapped in the process of personal regeneration it be not my purpose to frame a general indictment against person and movement but rather to suggest certain way and means of possible recovery and in general i shall try to confine myself to that form of organize religion to which i personally adhere that be to say the anglican or episcopal church partly because of my better knowledge of its condition and partly because whatever be say may in most case be equally well apply to the protestant denomination _ the unity of the church _ it be no longer necessary to demonstrate this fundamental necessity the old day of the nineteenth century be go those day when honest man vociferously acclaimed as honorable and glorious the dissidence of dissent and the protestantism of the protestant religion everyone know now everyone that be that accept christianity that disunion be disgrace if not a very palpable sin the desire for a restore unity be almost universal but every effort in this direction whatever its source meet with failure and the reason would appear to be that the approach be make from the wrong direction in every case the individual be leave alone he personal belief and practice be he be assure jealously guard all that be ask be that some mechanical amalgamation some official approximation shall be effect free interchange of pulpit a system of reciprocal re-ordination a merger of church property and parson a irreducible minimum of credal insistency these and other even more ingeniously compromise be the well-meaning scheme that be put forward and in the process one point after another be surrender as a _ quid pro quo _ for the formal and technical capitulation of some other religious group it be demonstrable that even if these well-meaning approximation be receive with favor -- and thus far nothing of the kind have appear -- the result so far as essential unity be concern would be _ nil _ there be a perfectly definite line of division between the catholic and the protestant and until this line be erase there be no possible unity even if this be only official and administrative the catholic -lrb- and in respect to this one particular point i include under this title member of the roman anglican and eastern communion -rrb- maintain and practice the sacramental system the protestant do not there be no reason there be indeed grave danger of sacrilege in a joint reception of the holy communion by those who look on it as a mere symbol and those who accept it as the very body and blood of christ protestant clergy be urge to accept ordination at the hand of anglican bishop but the plea be make on the ground of order expediency and the preservation of tradition whereas the apostolical succession be establish and enforce not for these reason but in order that the grace of god originally impart by christ himself may be continue through the line he ordain for the making and commission of priest who have power to serve as the channel for the accomplishing of the divine miracle of the holy eucharist to offer the eternal sacrifice of the body and blood of christ for the quick and the dead and to remit the penalty of sin through confession and absolution if the lay on of hand by the bishop be solely a matter of tradition and discipline neither rome nor the anglican communion would be justify in hold to it as a condition of unity if it be for the transmission of the holy ghost for the making of a catholic priest with all that imply and have always imply then it be wrong even in the interest of a formal unity to offer it to those who believe neither in the priesthood nor in the sacrament in the catholic and historic sense the conversion of the individual must take precedence of corporate action of any sort when the secularist come to believe in the godhead of christ he will unite himself with the rest of the faithful in a church polity but he will not do this he have too much self-respect simply because he be tell by some ardent but minimize parson that he do not have to believe in the divinity of christ in order to join the church when a protestant come to accept the sacramental system to desire to participate in the holy sacrifice of the altar to make confession of he sin and receive absolution and to nourish and develop he spiritual nature by the use of the devotions that have grow up during nineteen hundred year he will renounce he protestantism when he self-respect would not permit he to do this just because he have be assure that he need not really change any of he previous belief in order to ally himself with a church that have better architecture and a more artistic ceremonial and locally a higher social standing when anglican or the eastern orthodox come to believe that a vernacular liturgy and a married priesthood and provincial autonomy be of less importance than catholic unity and when roman catholic can see that the same be of greater moment than a rigid preservation of renaissance centralization and a cold _ non possumus _ in the matter of order then the way will be open for the reunion of the west where this operation can not be affect by formal negotiation look towards some form of legalistic concordat the evil heritage of the sixteenth century be still heavy upon we and this heritage be one of jealousy and hate not of charity and toleration it be a heritage of legalism and technicality of self-will and individualism of shibboleth that have become a dead letter of prejudice that be foster on distorted history and the propaganda of the self-seeking and the vain the spirit of christ be not in it but the malice of satan work upon the better nature of man and justify in the name of conscience and principle what be frequently the workings of self-will and pride and intellectual obsession this be the tragedy of it all that protestant and anglican and roman catholic be so far as the majority be concerned honestly convince that they be right in maintain they own divisiveness in perpetuate a hundred protestant sect on the basis of some variation in the form of baptism or church government or the method of conversion in splitting up the catholic church because of a thousand year old disagreement as to a clause in the creed which have a technical and theological significance only or because one sector be allege to have add unjustifiably to the faith while the other be allege to have unjustifiably take away self-will and lack of charity not love and the common will as these be reveal to the world through the divine will of christ be work here the momentary triumph of evil over good the pass victory that yet mean the banishment of religion from the world and the assurance of disaster still greater than that which be now upon we unless every man bend all he energy to the task of make the will of god prevail first in himself and so in the secular and ecclesiastical society in and through which he play he part in the life of the world -- these be the fruit of a divide christendom i honestly believe that the first real step towards reunion would be a prompt cessation of the whole process of criticism vilification and abuse one of the other that now mark the attitude of what be know as church periodical roman anglican protestant be all alike for all maintain a consistent slanging of each other i have in mind in particular weekly religious papers in the united state which maintain department almost wholly make up of attack on roman catholicism and the derision of incident of bad taste or illiteracy in the protestant denomination and other which lose no opportunity to discredit or abuse the episcopal church and the protestant denomination and finally a curiously malevolent newspaper represent the worst type of protestant ignorance and prejudice which exist on its libelous and indecent and dishonest assault on catholicism wherever it may be find these be not alone for the condition of ascerbity and nagging be practically universal it merely echo the pulpit and a portion of the general public we all know of the so call church in boston that be the forum of escape nun and unfrocked priest but in many place of better repute the sermon that bitterly attack christian science or high church episcopalianism or the error of protestantism generally or the usurpation of rome be by no means unknown while elsewhere than in ireland the public as a whole find much pleasure in bate any religion that happen to differ from its own -- or offend its sense of the uselessness of all religion let we have a new truce of god and for the space of a year let all clergy lecturer newspaper religious journal and private individual totally abstain from sneer and ill-natured attack on other religion and they follower could this be accomplish a greater step would be take towards the reunion of christendom than could be achieve by any number of conference commission council and convention it be the will and the intent of christ that they all may be one that the world may believe that thou hast send I and in disunity we deny christ there be no consideration of inheritance of personal taste of interest of intellectual persuasion that can stand in the way of a affirmative answer to this prayer every man who call himself a christian and yet be not pray and work to break down the self-will and the self-conceit that so often under the masquerade of conscience hold he back from a return even if it be only step by step to the original unity of the catholic faith be guilty of sin while it be sin of a even graver degree that stand to the account of those who consciously work to perpetuate the division that now exist _ sacramentalism _ the stumble block the apparently impassable barrier be that which be erect when belief be substitute for faith it be the intellectualize of religion that have bring about the present failure of christianity as a vital and control force in man and in society the danger reveal itself even in the middle age and through perhaps the greatest christian philosopher and certainly one of the most commanding intellect the world have know : st thoma aquina in he case and that of the other of he time the intellect be still direct by spiritual force the chiefest of which be faith therefore the inherent danger in the intellectualize process do not clearly reveal itself or come into actual operation but with the renaissance and the reformation it stand boldly forth and since then as mind increase in its dominion faith decline the reformation in all its later phase that be to say after it cease to be a protest against moral defect and administrative abuse and become a revolutionary invention of new dogma and practice be the result of clever stupid or perverse mind work overtime on religious problem which could not be solve or even apprehend by the intellect whether it be that of a acute and highly trained master such as calvin or that of any one of the hundred founder of less savage but more curious and uncouth type of reform religion what we need now for the recovery and re-establishment of christianity be not so much increase belief as it be a renew faith faith in christ faith in he doctrine faith in he church we lose this faith when we abandon the sacrament and sacramentalism as superstition or retain some of they in form and as symbol while deny to they all supernatural power if we would aid the individual soul to regain this lose faith we could do no better than to restore the seven sacrament of the historic christian faith and christian church to the place they once hold for all christian and still hold in the roman catholic church the eastern orthodox church and -lrb- with limitation -rrb- in the anglican church faith beget faith faith in christ bring faith in the sacrament and faith in the sacrament bring faith in christ it be disbelief in the efficacy of the sacrament and in the sacramental principle in life that be the essential barrier between protestantism and catholicism and until this barrier be dissolve there can be neither formal unity nor unity by compromise this be already widely recognize and as well the actual loss that come with the denial and abandonment of the sacrament there be in the presbyterian church of scotland a strong tendency towards a reassertion of the full sacramental doctrine the free catholic movement throughout great britain be make up of congregationalist methodist baptist and other representative of evangelical protestantism and it be work unreservedly for the recovery and application of all the catholic sacrament with the devotions and ritual that go with they dr orchard the head and a congregational minister maintain in london a church where as a methodist member of the free catholic organization write I the other day the bless sacrament be perpetually reserve and ` high mass ' be celebrate on sunday with the full catholic ceremonial in my own practice of architecture i be constantly provide presbyterian congregational and even unitarian church by request with chancel contain altar properly vest and ornament with cross and candle while the almost universal demand be for church edifice that shall approach as nearly as possible in appearance to the typical catholic church of the middle age of course some of this be due to a revive instinct for beauty that almost sacramental quality in life which be ruthlessly destroy by protestantism and also to a renew sense of the value of symbol and ritual but back of it all be the grow consciousness that as dr newman smythe say protestantism have definitely fail or at least become superannuated that the essence of religion be spiritual not intellectual affirmative not negative and that the only measure of safety lie in a return towards if not actually to the catholic faith and practice from which the old revolt be affect it be a movement both significant and full of profound encouragement here then be two tendency that surely show the way and demand encouragement and furtherance recovery of the sense of christian unity in christ and through a unite catholic church and the re-acceptance of sacramentalism as the expression of that faith and as the method of that church i feel very strongly that wherever these tendency show themselves they must be acclaimed and cherish the protestant denomination must be aid in every way in they process of recovery of the good thing once throw away episcopalian must be persuade that nothing can be wrong that lead soul to christ and that therefore they must cease they opposition to reservation of the bless sacrament explicitly for adoration to such devotions as benediction and the rosary simply because they have not explicit apostolic sanction or to vestment incense and holy water because certain prescriptive law pass four hundred year ago in england have never be repeal above all be it necessary that the episcopal church should declare itself formally for the reinstitution of the seven catholic sacrament with the mass as the one supreme act of worship obligatory as the chief service on sunday and holy day and both as communion and as sacrifice in this connection there be one reform that would i think be more effective than any other -lrb- except the exaltation of the holy eucharist itself -rrb- and that be the complete cessation of the practice of commission lay reader and use they for mission work and clerical assistance a mission can be establish and make fruitful only on the basis of the sacrament and chiefly on those of the holy eucharist and penance it be not enough to send a zealous and well intentioned layman to a promising mission field in order that he may read morning and evening prayer and some sermon already publish what be need be a priest to say mass and hear confession and nothing else will serve as a substitute how this be to be accomplish now when the candidate for holy order be constantly fall off in number with no immediate prospect of recovery be a question perhaps we may learn something from the old custom of ordain mass priest without cure of soul and with a commission to celebrate the holy mystery even while they continue they own secular work in the world for my own part i be persuade that the best solution lie in the establish of diocesan monastery where man may take vow for short term and during the period of these vow remain at the order of the bishop to go out at any time and anywhere in the diocese and to do such temporary or periodical mission work as he may direct _ unworldliness : _ i have refer to the great fall off in the number of candidate for the priesthood in the episcopal church the same phenomenon be apparent in all the protestant denomination so far as i know but it have not show itself in the roman catholic church this defection parallel the falling-off of membership in the various church -lrb- except again the roman catholic -rrb- in proportion to the increase in population we be tell that the diminution of the ministry be due to the starvation wages that be pay in the vast majority of case and of course it be true that where a married clergy be allow man who believe they have a call both to ministerial and to domestic life will think twice before they follow the call of the first when the pecuniary return be such as to make the second impossible which be generally speak the situation today to obviate this difficulty many religious body have recently establish pension fund but even this form of clerical insurance together with the increase that have be effect in clerical stipend have show no result in a increase of student in theological seminary and in candidate for order the man who have enough of faith in god and a strong enough call to the ministry of christ will answer the call even if he do think twice before do so the trouble lie i believe in the very lack of faith and in a failure of confidence in organize religion largely bring about by organize religion itself through the method it have pursue during the last two or three generation there be a widespread belief that it be compromise with the world that it be play fast and loose with faith and discipline in a vain opportunism that void it of spiritual power even where distrust do not reach this disastrous conclusion there be a grow feeling of repugnance to the method now be adopt in high quarter to sell religion to the public as be the phrase which be sufficient in itself to explain the fall away that now seem to be in process the attempt to win unwilling support by the method of the institutional church the rampant advertising so frequently under the management of pay publicity agent the setting apart of half the sunday in the year for some one or other special purpose usually the raising of money for a specific and frequently worthy object the drive for million the huge and impressive organization scientifically conduct for round up lapse communicant or doubtful convert or cash and pledge for mission or pension or the raising of clergy stipend the nation-wide campaign the inter-church world movement these -- not to speak of the grow policy of make it easy for the hesitant to come into the church by minimize unpopular clause in the creed or loosening-up on discipline and of attract advanced element by the advocacy and exploit of each new social or industrial or political fad as it arise -- be strong deterrent to those who honestly and ardently hunger for religion that _ be _ religion and neither social service nor big business christ say you _ can not _ serve both god and mammon and this be one of the few case where he state a moral condition as a fact instead of indicate the right or the wrong possibility in action organize christianity have for some time be try to render this dual service and the penalty thereof be now on the world this consideration seem to I so important and so near the root of we trouble and not in the field of organize religion alone that i be go to quote at length from the rev fr duffy of the american society of the divine compassion what he have say come to I while i be prepare this lecture and it be so much better than anything i could say that for my present purpose i make it my own to the thoughtful person and the need of reformation will appeal only to the thoughtful person it must on reflection become abundantly evident that the chief necessity of we time in the religious world be the recovery of faith probably lack of the true measure of faith have be the story of every generation with few exception in the long history of christianity but there possibly never have be a time when man talk more of it and possess less than in we own day \* \* \* \* christianity be a new thing of splendid vision for each and every generation of man unique in its promise and unapproached in its attraction and yet how small a factor we have make it in the world 's moulding compare with what it might be we have not achieve a tiny part of what we might have achieve because we lack the essential of achievement faith and faith 's vision obsess after century of discussion and persecution with the notion that faith be make up of mere belief we have lose the secret of that victorious power that overcome the world and be weakly dependent upon the world 's means for what spiritual operation we undertake and so content have we grow with thing as they be that what they might be come only as a dream that pass away quickly with the night blind to we appalling money-dependency in modern religion satisfy that the kingdom of heaven be as nigh to we as be possible under present condition of society we practically have substitute for the theological virtue faith hope and charity the ascend degree of belief resignation money this be partly due to we religious inheritance and partly to mental and spiritual sloth which dislike the effort of think prefer easy acquiescence in condition that be the resultant of blinded vision for dependency upon money be not something merely of the present but a condition in the spiritual sphere that be largely a product of a long past the really inexcusable thing be we willingness in a day of greater light and knowledge to close we eye to the true nature of the unattractive anaemic thing we _ call _ faith which would be see as powerless to achieve at all if take out of the soil of material mean in which it have be plant he then give various instance of method actually put in practice amongst the church and denomination which indicate the renunciation of faith and a exclusive reliance on worldy agency and he then continue : the joint commission on clergy pension appoint by the general convention of 1913 make as the basis for apportionment not the service of self-denial of but the amount of stipend receive by the clergy eligible for pension thus penalize the priest who for the love of god sacrifice a larger income to accept work in the most need place where toil be abundant and money scarce it must be evident of course that the motive of the commission be not a endorsement of the blasphemous gospel of success by add penalty to the self-denying clergy what be painfully obvious be they apparent unbounded confidence that there be no clergy sufficiently foolish to sacrifice stipend at the call of faith 's venture and since the armistice the only real activity in organize religion have be a series of drive for vast sum of money in most case professionally direct a consideration of a few fact such as the forgo must readily convince even the most unimaginative person that whatever power faith might have have in the past it count for little today that its secret its very mean have be forget otherwise there could not be this extraordinary exaggeration of the place of money in spiritual operation and the unblushing tacit admission that mammon which christ so warn against have be recognize as the master of spiritual situation instead of the willing servant and useful adjunct of faith it be design to be in the christian vision indeed they all speak of that largely unconscious atmosphere of distrust of god which be so all-prevailing among christian people today if the great positive vice of the age be covetousness the great negative one be distrust of god the two invariably go together as part of a whole -- one be the reverse side of the other -- for it be not that we _ must _ not or _ ought _ not but that we _ can not _ serve god and mammon and this atmosphere be one in which faith can not exist it be stifle crushed kill except it breathe the pure sweet air of god with which it can alone surround itself when human heart will it be not surprising that out of such condition should grow false value and that spirituality should be measure by the world 's standard thus we have fall into the vicious habit of adjudging qualification for spiritual leadership among the clergy by the amount of they stipend and measure they potentiality for usefulness in the kingdom of god by the amount of they yearly income among the laity the man of power be ever the man of material mean whom we permit to play the part of providence in feeding and sustain the church from large purse the filling of which will not always bear close investigation and the really successful parish be always the one that no matter what its spiritual condition rejoice in abundant material mean so evident be it that the means of spiritual life have be so confuse with the purely material that it occasion no surprise when a neighborhood have change from the residence district of the comparatively well-to-do to the very poor the vestry feel bind to consider the moving of the church to a more ` desirable ' quarter these of course be hard fact to face and it be not strange that we should seek to evade they by a false optimism that think evil be eliminate by merely contemplate good the point be _ they must be face _ and at a time when there be some evidence of a little awaken it must more and more force itself into the consciousness of the thoughtful that the dead spiritual condition of today be due to the shift of faith from god to material thing as the means of achieve the only hope lie in the apparent unconsciousness of the error this be invariably the atmosphere that prevail when ecclesiastical history repeat itself in corruption it have be true of more than two or three generation though obviously unseen save by a few of those contemporary with the time that in jerusalem ` the head thereof judge for reward and the priest teach for hire and the prophet thereof divine for money yet will they lean upon the lord and say : be not the lord among we none evil can come upon we ' corporate unconsciousness in greater or less measure of these condition may influence the degree of guilt but never can acquit of the sin and the cold naked truth be that today we stand almost helpless before a world of peculiar problem what be there here to reflect the _ power _ and _ might _ of christianity such as the early church especially possess and subsequent generation in time of great faith really know so much of -- the power to heal the sick to cast out devil to achieve wonder out of christ 's poverty to experience the thrilling joy of religion in the ever-abiding divine presence and witness the marvel of faith in the conquering of the world how be it we be no longer able to communicate the secret to the suffering world which be able to transmute the people 's want into god 's plenty and attract and hold the heart of man with the joy of the vision splendid why be it that hope have give way to resignation that the preaching of forgiveness have be dwarf by the insistence upon penalty that distinct evil in the physical sphere be attribute to god and because of that hold up to religious estimation as good the day of miracle be regard as belong to a far distant past the answering of prayer look upon as the exception instead of the rule and the old melody of joy in religion exchange for the wail of despair in a interpretation of ` thy will be do ' that be only associate with human calamity the reply be as simple as to the thoughtful person it be obvious : we have lose knowledge of a living vital conquer faith that be root in god himself and have satisfy the hunger of human sense by place trust in the thing of the earth which we see and touch and in so do lose the power spiritually to achieve now we can only approach in the hope of a day of better thing the great practical and intellectual problem of we time from the standpoint of faith 's recovery for it be only in they relationship to faith they can be view intelligently by the christian and it will be find that at the root of all we difficulty and all we negligence -- so many of they unconscious -- and as the cause of we vain expediency and attempt to justify the corporate spiritual situation be the absence of vital faith and a _ whole _ obedience to which god alone have condition result we need sorely to reconsider what faith really be and when we have recover in some measure that knowledge of it in experience which declare its unspeakable worth in the early church and in later period of ecclesiastical history which stand out before all other we shall look back upon we past distrust of god and he promise with shame and wonderment and proceed to revise we cataloguing of spiritual value and degree of sin for the really destructive thing _ before all other _ be a weakened faith that compromise in a half obedience to christ and a search for earthly prop the work of satan have even be the prompt of distrust of god in the human family just as the work of redemption mean so largely the re-establish of it in the person of jesus christ from the first temptation of man to the present moment all the force of evil have concentrate upon break man 's trust in god and he promise every sin have have that as its ultimate end and every disaster ill and trial in the world and individual life be subtly present by the enemy of god and man -lrb- know we haziness of vision -rrb- so as to place the appearance against the creator in a blind disregard for the create just as in the life of the incarnate son all the great power of the force of darkness be bring to bear unsuccessfully upon the snap of he faith in he father -- from the time he be tempt to believe himself forget when hunger and physically reduce in the wilderness after he long fast until the dreadful cry of dereliction from the cross at the very end the call for reformation today then be to the do of thing leave undo the search for and recovery of almost lose spiritual power that alone lastingly can achieve for god and hasten man 's salvation and this require the venture and daring that break from the world withdraw from compromise and that rightly estimate the character and attitude of god refuse longer to believe he the author of evil we resignedly accept today by call they good and instead claim the power of the divine promise for the utter destruction of the world 's ill by a strict dependence upon spiritual force and weapon for the accomplishment of result above all this mean a change and reform in corporate conduct as the end of repentance for the present almost total disregard of the law and principle of christian living as give in the sermon on the mount these be hard saying and strong doctrine but will any one say they be not true the weakening of religion with the consequent decline of civilization be ultimately to be trace back to _ organized _ religion not to religion itself and still less to any inherent defect in christianity where organize religion have fail it deserve to fail because it countenance disunion forsake the saving sacrament and finally compromise with worldliness and materialism with each one of these false venture faith begin to weaken amongst the mass of people until at last this which can always save and alone can save cease to have either the power or the will to force the organism to conform to the spirit if we have indeed accomplish the depth of we fall then the time be at hand when we may hope and pray for a new outpouring of divine grace that will bring recovery there be wide evidence that man earnestly desire this i have already speak of the great corporate movement towards unity and these mean much even though they may at present take on something of the quality of mechanism instead of depend on the individual and the grace of god work in he the world conference on faith and order the just effect federation of the presbyterian methodist and congregationalist in canada above all the eirenic manifesto of the bishop at the last lambeth conference all indicate a new spirit work potently in the soul of man concrete result be not as yet conspicuous but the spirit be there and a beginning have be make even more significant be the wide testimony to the need for definite concrete and pervasive religion that be daily give by man whose name have hitherto be quite dissociate from matter of this kind scientist educator man of business and man of public life it may be testimony in favor of some new invention some synthetic product of curious and abnormal ingredient as a matter of fact it frequently be and we confront such remarkable product as mr well have give we for example the significant thing however be the fact of the desire and the avowal if we have this i think we may leave it to god to see that the desire be satisfy in the end by heavenly food and not by the nostrum of ingenuity for the same reason we may look without dismay on certain novel phenomenon of the moment in they divergence from the faith once deliver to the saint and leave in the keep of the church christ found as a living and eternal organism through which he spirit would work forever they be wrong and therefore they can not endure but each testify to the passionate desire in man for religion as a reality and no one of they come into existence except as the result of desperate action by man to recover something that have be take from they and that they soul need and would have at any cost each one of these strange manifestation be a reaction from some old error that have become established belief or custom no one who hold to historic christianity be interested in they but those who have find religion intellectualize beyond endurance and transform either by materialism or rationalism seek for the mysticism they know to be a reality -lrb- to employ a paradox -rrb- in the ultra mysticism of oriental cult those who revolt against the exaggeration of evil and its exaltation to eminence that rival that of god himself which be the legacy of one powerful movement in the reformation rush to the other extreme and deny the existence of evil and even the reality of matter while spiritism the most insidious perilous and fatal of all the spiritual temptation that beset the world at this time gain as its adherent those who have be deprive of the catholic belief in the communion of saint and have be forbid to pray for the dead or to ask for they prayer and intercession however strange and erroneous the actual manifestation there be no question as to the reality and prevalence of the desire for the recovery of spiritual power through the channel of religion it show itself as it should first of all in the individual and it be only recently that organize religion catholic or protestant have begin to show a sympathetic consciousness and to take the first hesitant step towards meet the demand because of this the seeker for reality have be leave unshepherded and have wander off into strange wilderness the call be now to the church to organize religion and if the call be heed we trouble be well on the road to a end if the old way of jealousy hatred and fear be maintain then humanly speak we case be hopeless if the older way of brotherhood charity and loving-kindness be follow the future be secure in the great peace nothing be wrong that lead man to christ and this be true from the salvation army at one end of the scale to the seven sacrament of catholicity at the other the world demand now not denial but affirmation not protest and division but the ringing credo of catholic unity viii personal responsibility not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of host we have try to approach each subject in this course of lecture in the spirit of peace and the greatest contributory factor in the achieve of the great peace be the individual himself on whom humanly speak rest the final responsibility not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of host not by majestical engine and curious device and mass-action nor yet by a impose human authority enforce by arm and the law but by the holy spirit of god work through the individual soul and compelling the individual will peace be one of the promise fruit of the holy spirit and like the other be manifest through human life therefore on we rest the preëminent responsibility of show forth in ourselves first of all those thing we desire for other and for society we have experience the great war we endure its aftermath and amidst the peril and danger that follow both there be none greater than that which attach to exterior war viz that the attention of both combatant be focus on the fault and the weakness and the crime of the opponent with the result that both become destructive critic rather than constructive example chesterton rightly say what be wrong with the critic be that he do not criticise himself \* \* \* rather he identify himself with the ideal see evil in other and flattering one 's self be the antithesis of the spirit that would lead to the great peace for in that spirit the field of warfare be transfer from the external to the internal and the interior contest which alone establish lasting result necessitate a recognition of we own error and the need of amendment of we own life if we modern device have fail if the thing we invent with a high heart and high hope in government industry society education philosophy have in the end bring disappointment disillusionment even despair it be less because of they inherent defect than because the individual failed and himself cease to act as the sufficient channel for the divine power which alone energize we weak little engine and which act through the individual alone there be no better demonstration of this essential part play by the personal life of man than the fact that god for the redemption of the world take on human form and become one man amongst many man there be no better demonstration of the fact that it be through the personal life of individual that the great peace be to be achieve both directly and indirectly than the fact that peace the gift of the holy spirit be promise to the individual man by christ himself as the legacy he leave to he disciple after he resurrection and ascension since then the world have be under the dispensation of the holy spirit the guide and comforter that be promise even though it have blindly and from time to time reject the guidance and therefore know not the comfort the old law of thou shalt not be follow by the new law of thou shalt and this in turn by the law of the third person of the trinity which do not supersede the dispensation of the father and of the son but fulfil they in that it afford the spiritual power if we will to abide by the inhibition and to carry out the command we search be for peace the great peace the peace of god which passeth all understanding and we shall achieve this for ourselves and for the world only through ourselves as individual and so for the society of which we be a part and in so far as we bring ourselves into contact with the spirit of god there be deep significance in the fact that the first time christ use the salutation peace be unto you be after he resurrection it would seem that this special gift of the holy spirit have to be withhold from man until after the human life of god the son have be bring to a end in accomplishment for he say peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you : not as the world giveth give i unto you let not you heart be trouble neither let it be afraid it be expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you : but if i depart i will send he unto you when he the spirit of truth be come he will guide you into all truth ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost be come upon you it be the spirit that quickeneth after god have reveal the law and give to we the great redeeming and atoning life he see that we have need of a further manifestation before we should be able to keep the law and live the life therefore the holy spirit be send to quicken we and give we power to do what we have both hear and see today we accept the moral law we recognize the perfection of chirst 's life but we need to be remind again that the power to be son of god be present with we if we will but use it as this power be a spirit it can only be apprehend spiritually when we mind and heart be set on material thing even on good material thing the still small voice of the spirit remain unheard : but if we listen first to that inward voice and then use the means of grace afford we we be enable to lift up we heart and mind to the creator and then to use in he service all the material universe which be also he creation we can not get a right philosophy by work for right philosophy but only by live in the right relationship as individual : then as a by-product of religion a right philosophy will come we can not get a right industrial system by search for a right industrial system but if we show forth in we life the christian virtue a right industrial system will come as one of the by-product of religion so with each one of we so-called problem life rightly live have no problem this be a hard say for a intellectual age whose temptation be to trust in its own power rather than in the power of god but except ye become as little child and walk by faith and not by sight the kingdom of god be withhold a soldier who suffer in the late war and out of he suffer find peace say christ 's hardest work be to teach the wise : those who be entrust with authority and responsibility will be the least prepared to make the venture of the spirit however much they may believe in it they be sacrifice least now : they will have to sacrifice most when the spirit come they have so much to unlearn : child and work man have so little the whole of we world today be root and ground in intellect we machinery we institution we great system the entire body of enterprise be govern by brain it be this that will alter just behind intellect there be a vision that be purer keener more powerful than the vision of you eye than the hearing of you ear than the touch of you hand this world be be transform into another which come into be at we spiritual touch the world need something personal something from the heart it be sick to death with the cold machinery of the intellect but before man see this they must change they view of life they must _ be bear again _ the scientist the historian and theologian the philosopher have make the universe too big it be not a big place : it be very tiny life be so simple really we wise man have make it so difficult so ugly it be only child who can see the rise christ child perhaps out of whom seven devil have be cast the world need not critic but teacher and child be wait everywhere to teach but man shut the window of they soul try rather to mould these little one to fit into the vacant space of they own stupid world be not child the true artist they will not tolerate anything but beauty they see beauty everywhere not because it be there but because they want it there everything they touch turn into something far more precious than gold : every word they utter be a song of praise you be almost in heaven every time you look into the eye of a child remember please these be the word of a man who have face the horrible reality of modern warfare and so do not dismiss they as mere poetry or with nicodemus ' question how can a man be bear again but listen to a modern interpretation of the answer to that question : -- -lrb- the life indeed -rrb- we must be bear again even to see the spiritual kingdom must be bear of water and the spirit to enter its gate at all so to he little audience of disciple we lord say it be not a affair of legislation of discovery of which man say ` lo here lo there but the kingdom of heaven be _ within you _ why a second birth this be a second birth because it must need supervene at a point where two element can work together the element of a appealing vitalize spirit from the unseen and the element of free human choice being of the spirit it be the birth into freedom : it be the soul emerge from its prison into the open air of liberty and light and life note the element of free choice we first birth be outside we choice and the gift be unconditioned we second birth when again we become as little child demand we response to the holy spirit and we persevere cooperation with he to make he influence effectual for ourselves and for the communion of saint and the corporate religion into which the spirit also baptize we in a recent sermon a bishop of the episcopal church say this be the creed of the church -- the divine father and forgiveness : the divine son and redemption : the divine spirit and abundant life therefore the church still insist upon the creation of moral rectitude and spiritual character as the end and purpose of religion aye as the basic problem underlie all question relate to human life -- social industrial civic and political the church still preach the gospel of the grace of god the obligation and blessing of worship the meaning and virtue of the christian sacrament also my brethren we shall not be content to criticize and find fault with we own age and time but rather we shall pray for the power to see within its questioning unrest and discontent -- aye its recklessness and apparent failure -- the striving of the spirit of god but each man have to voice for himself the conviction of the reality of the spiritual order and the spiritual life therefore let we believe in and practice the worship of god ` pray always ' as st paul say ` with all prayer and supplication in the spirit ' or as st jude say ` build up yourselve on you most holy faith pray in the holy spirit ' let we accept this suggestion and try to find in the unrest of we own time evidence of the striving of the spirit of god wait we perception and response the soldier of the great war have face death and imprisonment and suffering in many form say compare with the depth of good in the world the evil be shallow the first evidence of good in we own day be the almost universal discontent with evil and the desire to find a better way the humility which recognize that so widespread a condition can not be the fault of any one nation or group but be rather the responsibility of each one of we be cause for hope some of we believe that war can breed only war hatred only hatred that government can not make peace but can only cause cessation of open hostility and that the real peace the great peace must await the action of the spirit this spirit of love and forgiveness breed love and forgiveness indeed be far more potent than the spirit of hate because of this very strength and potency its evidence be not so immediately apparent but they be deeper-rooted perhaps in this material sphere we human being must see and to a certain extent experience hate before we can really know love and consciously and freely choose it when that choice be make when we know all that hate and evil and malice can accomplish yet deliberately choose to love we enemy we have slay the adversary and make hate and evil powerless of course we have not power of ourselves to do this but only through the grace of god when we try god 's way not wait for the other person to reform or to be generous or to speak gently or to forgive then and only then do we deserve the name of christian then and only then be we walk in love then and only then be we really pray effectually thy kingdom come thy will be do on earth as it be in heaven we have try the way of the world the way of reprisal the way of distrust and thank god we be none of we satisfy with the result perhaps now we may be ready to try the way of god by make the great adventure of faith each one in he own person faith in himself and faith in the future the way of the world have breed fear that have issue in hate and hate that have issue in fear but the better way that of faith breed trust that have issue in fellowship and fellowship that have issue in trust there be no problem of labor of politics of society that be insoluble if once it be approach in the spirit of faith and fellowship and trust but none of these be susceptible of solution where the control motive be hate distrust and fear the modern policy of centralization and segregation have result in deal with man as group and not as individual when for example iron-bound cult -lrb- they be no less than this -rrb- meet as capital and as labor both merge the individuality of they member in a thing which have no real or necessary existence but be a artificial creation of thought operating under the dominion of ephemeral almost accidental condition as a member of a interest or a cult where humanity and personality be so to speak in commission a man do not hesitate to do those thing he would never think of do for himself know they to be selfish cruel unjust and uncharitable a case in point -- if we need one which be hardly probable since they be of daily occurrence -- be the pend contest between the mine operator and mine worker in great britain where both party with government throw in be guilty of maintain theory and perpetrate act for which a individual would be even now excoriate and outlaw the irish imbroglio be another instance of the same kind in a personal letter from a consulting engineer who have have unusual opportunity by reason of he official position to come closely in contact with the condition govern industry and finance both in america and europe since the war i find this illuminating statement of a matured judgment as a practical matter and face the issue i would preach the practice of de-centralization in government and business which will in time develop the individual and accomplish the desire end \* \* \* decentralization should be carry to such a extent that the unit of business would be of such size that the head could again have a personal relation with each individual associate with he \* \* \* with the personal relation again establish unionism as at present practice would again be unnecessary and the union would become once more guild for the development and advancement of the individual it be this nullification of the human element of the person as such the introduction of the gross aggregate with its artificial corporate quality and the attempt to establish a correspondence between these unnatural thing the whole be intensify by the emotion of fear distrust and hate which produce the contemporary insistence on rights and the rank injustice cruelty and disorder that follow the blind contest to quote again from the soldier who achieve illumination through the recent war my friend there be no protection of rights in heaven when we speak of rights we be blind by the light of this world of rule and order and intellectual conceit it be not justice we need it be mercy if we honestly endeavor to bring about something more nearly approach the kingdom of god on earth we should do well to achieve a little more of the quality of child-like trust which know that through the petition to father or mother or to a guardian angel or directly to god the result will surely follow we long passionately to see a good _ we _ good as we see it accept here and now but whatever we offer no mater how righteous or how salutary be but a small part of the great good a limited and partial show forth of only one element while the final and comprehensive good be the result of many contribution and in the end be not ours but god 's and by he overrule providence it may look very unlike what we have predetermine and anticipate moreover the condition even of we own small good become effective be _ faith _ and neither sight nor action there be a faith that can move mountain and it be faith in fellowship in the underlie indestructible good in man above all in the desire and the intent of god to deal mercifully with we and beyond the dictate of justice and the claim of we own desert when we know and accept this power of faith place it above the efficiency of we own feeble work then indeed we may become the patient hopeful joyful and faithful christian we be intend to be and therefore the creator of the spirit of peace nothing permanent can be achieve except in coöperation with god any work of man alone -lrb- or of the devil -rrb- have in it the seed of decay and must perish this knowledge relieve we of the gloomy responsibility of destroy or try to destroy every evil thing we see or think we see if it be really evil it be already die unless nourish by evil within ourselves here be a buddhist legend which have a lesson for each of we -- the watcher in the shrine of buddha rush in to the holy father one morning with tiding of a horrible demon who have usurp the throne of we lord buddha the father run to the throne room each one more infuriate than the other and declaim against the insolence of the demon who grow huger and more hideous at every angry word that hurtle through the air at last arrive the oldest and most saintly of the monk and throw himself on he knee before the demon and say we thank thee o master for teach we how much anger and wrath and jealousy be still hide in we heart at every word he say the demon grow smaller and smaller and at last vanish he be be anger-eating demon and anger-rousing word and even thought of ill-feeling nourish he the belief that in comparison with the depth of good in the world the evil be shallow may also be express in the statement that god be lord of eternity while the devil be prince only of this world as this evil spirit have power and as a part of this power be the ability to appear as a angel of light so to deceive we we be bind by self-examination constantly indulge in to scrutinize those thing so common in we own life we do not notice they which may be but the illusion of this spirit of darkness show as a fictitious spirit of light : hurry and carelessness both in thought and in action snap-judgment at short range compromise with the spirit of the time in the interest of good business practical consideration or sound policy worship of the doctrine of get result acceptance of the horrible principle : that it be every man 's business to sell something to another from a patent medicine or gilt edge bond to a new philosophy or a old religion the estimating of value by size number cost it be common parlance among christian people to speak of what a man be worth mean how much money he have we speak of a man 's make a live meaning only how much money he make when by make only money he would be kill he living do we not speak of the call of a missionary from a unshepherded flock to a large city parish as a call to a wider sphere of usefulness when you or i conceive of any piece of work as important be it not because it involve either great number or great sum of money then we hear much today of the need for leader the need could not be exaggerated but do not this lack exist in part because we have forget that the christian 's first duty be to be a follower and that only from amongst real follower can god -lrb- not man least of all the man himself -rrb- raise up a leader these be small matter you may say but straw show which way the wind blow and the spirit like the wind manifest itself first in small matter every life be make up largely of small thing the little nameless unremembered act of kindness and of love which some one have call the noblest portion of a good man 's life with this brief glance at some of the possible manifestation of the spirit of evil which we believe to be temporary and therefore of secondary importance only let we consider some of the requisite of the christian life as exemplify in the life of christ especially those of which we need to be remind today we have already speak of that child-likeness which take the faith simply and apply it to the common thing of daily life -- christ 's life of ministry of good work -lrb- which be in proportion to the time give to preparation for activity and preaching of very short duration -rrb- full of injunction to those who be with he to tell no man therefore the good work which be do in he likeness must not be do in public if we be see of man verily we have we reward christ 's life end in apparent failure in ignominious death on the cross the world worship today 's success and immediate publicity the christian to be worthy of he lord must accept apparent failure and must offer he best work in secret : and my father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly a touching poem of franci thompson 's picture the marveling of a soul on he reward in paradise which in he humility he think undeserved the man ask of god : _ o when do i give thee drink erewhile or when embrace thine unseen foot what gift thee give for my lord christ 's smile who be a guest here most unmeet _ and be answer _ when thou kissedest thy wife and child sweet -lrb- they eye be fair in my sight as thine -rrb- i feel the embrace on my foot -lrb- lovely they lock in thy sight and mine -rrb- _ a necessary reminder of the fact that for each of we charity which be love begin at home and that we love and serve god best in he holy human relationship -- if we love not we brother whom we have see how can we love god whom we have not see again the individual christian life must like its great original suffer for other when we suffer as a result of we own wrongdoing we be but meet we just reward but if patiently and humbly and voluntarily we bear pain even unto death for other we be transcend justice the pagan law and exemplify mercy the christian virtue no sensitive soul in this generation conscious of the sacrifice of the million of young life who storm heaven in they willingness to die that other might live can doubt this the essence of love be sacrifice voluntary nay eager sacrifice before we bless lord die he be mock and ridicule he suffer physical hardship fall under the weight of the cross and he be lift up crucify to suffer the ignominious death of a felon he be make a spectacle for the jest and laughter of the multitude in we own time and amongst ourselves except for period of war there be little necessity for physical suffering for we faith but the need to endure ridicule be as great as ever perhaps even greater because of the absence of physical suffering since we be try to apply these thing in small and simple way to the individual life let we each one consider how much moral courage it take to defend christian virtue when they be sneer at under the guise of joke let we exercise charity by not quote instance but let we be watchful of we laughter and we fellowship which be both gift of god and see that we do not confuse pagan pleasure with christian joy the evil sneer with the tender recognition of the absurd in ourselves and in other it be mr chesterton again who point out the fact that the pagan virtue of justice and the like which he call the sad virtue be supersede when the great christian revelation come by the gay and exuberant virtue the virtue of grace faith hope and charity and who say the pagan virtue be the reasonable virtue and the christian virtue of faith hope and charity be in they essence as unreasonable as they can be charity mean pardon what be unpardonable or it be no virtue at all hope mean hope when thing be hopeless or it be no virtue at all and faith mean believe the incredible or it be no virtue at all if you say this be a paradox i reply : it must be so since it require faith to accept a paradox the realm of reason be the one in which we walk by sight and of this fact we age in its pride of intellect have need to be remind if christ be not the son of god and he revelation of the faith once deliver be not the divine and final guide fulfil complete and at the same time reverse every other ethic religion and moral code then these thing be indeed foolishness for there be no explain they on the ground of logic or philosophy but if by the gift of grace we have faith we remember i thank thee father that thou hast hide these thing from the wise and prudent and have reveal they unto babe : even so father for so it seem good in thy sight again and if as person we be to grow in relationship to a personal god we must both speak and listen to we father in other word we must use the great dynamic of prayer more thing be work by prayer than this world dream of we be tell that one of the requisite of the really good talker be to be a good listener the apparently good talker be in reality a monologuist in we prayer-life today do we recognize sufficiently the need for _ listen _ to god we be perhaps ready enough to ask for blessing and mercy but that be only a part of the full life of prayer which must include also thanksgive lifting of the heart and mind and quiet listening or interior prayer there be a age in the world when this interior prayer be so much more joyful and natural a thing than the world of matter that it have to be teach to labor be to pray today when we accept the necessity of labor and even worship activity for its own sake do we not need to be remind that to pray be to labor if you doubt this try to make that concentrated form of prayer know as meditation out of which spring a resolve and determination to do better try to do this faithfully for fifteen minute a day and it may prove the hardest work you have ever undertake a great servant of god have say i believe no soul can be lose which faithfully practice meditation for fifteen minute a day nor must we forget that in this work of prayer we be companion by the holy spirit the peace-maker who maketh intercession for we with groaning which can not be utter and who lead we ever gently but surely into that closer communion with god whose result be life more abundant after prayer it be easier to realize that to be spiritually mind be life and peace it be easier to obey the injunction and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye be seal unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as god for christ 's sake have forgive you and for those that seek after peace it must be _ all _ wrath _ all _ anger and _ all _ evil speaking which be put away : this leave no room for what the world call just wrath righteous anger or speak evil of evil doer let we call to mind the incident in the early life of st john afterwards the great disciple of love when he want to call down wrath on the wicked inhabitant of a city and be rebuke by we lord who say ye know not in what spirit ye speak after love have supplant wrath and the good spirit have take the place of the evil in st john 's heart he be send to convert the people he would have destroy yes it be the spirit that matter the wrath that be wrong and that must be put away before we can love god or we neighbor as ourself for the fruit of the spirit be love joy peace long suffer gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance when we understand that the object of life and of education be the creation of a spirit and not the do of thing we be free from the tyranny of result in this world as a final test and come to realize that judgment belong only to god who as a spirit judge the effort of course this do not mean that we be free from the moral law that certain evil thing in ourselves and in other be not always the result of a evil spirit but rather that in addition to avoid and shun those thing which be obviously evil we must with equal care avoid do even good thing in a bad spirit the commandment still stand the moral law be abate not one jot but in christianity and in christianity alone be we give power to fulfill the law and to add the new commandment the sum up of they all of love to god and man no human soul come into the world without some desire to be good because each human soul be a child of god to each one not blind by pride -lrb- and surely it should be easy in these day to be humble -rrb- come sooner or later the realization of he own inability of himself to do what he would the need for a power outside himself the power which be available and of which we have hear i be come that ye might have life and more abundantly let we examine how the apostle set about live this abundant life in dr genung 's the life indeed we read one and all they make it a matter of the spirit that be the man but the spirit they recognize be not a abstraction or a theory but a present person and helper who be witness with they spirit st john make the matter equally definite : ` the son of god ' he say ` be manifest that he might destroy the work of the devil ' and st paul mindful of the inner subtlety of the conflict warn he reader that satan have change he tactic and have transform himself into a angel of light i be not sure that we have gain greatly by let we notion of spiritual life grow dim and abstract perhaps for this very reason the rebellious negative design spirit that be so prone to invade the heart of we all be the more free to gain a foot-hold and go about control the tone of we life there be real advantage in bring the large issue of life to a point where not only we mind but as it be we sens can lay hold on they it be the impulse of simple-minded man like those early disciple and if we continue straight-seeing we do not outgrow it what make these view of life so deep be not that they be less simple than those of other but that they be more simple to st john the reality that have come to win the world be not the promise of salvation or prophecy of a eventual life eternal but just life without modification or limitation life absolute full-orbed pulsate through world see and unseen alike ' i be the life ' he make christ say not ' i be work to secure it ' st john it be who preserve to we that conception of eat the flesh and drink the blood of the son of man no philosopher in the world we may roundly say would ever have put it so and yet how effectually be thus reveal what it mean to get the power of the new life thoroughly incorporate with we blood and breath he it be who identify the most inner value of life with the simplest act and experience reduce it to term of eat bread and drinking water and walk in daylight and bearing fruit like the branch of a vine and follow like sheep the voice of a shepherd and enter a door and finding pasture let we cease try materialistic and intellectual means for supply the power to live the spiritual life and let we each one establish the needful relationship with the true source of power may we time not be liken to the oriental traveler who appreciate the convenience and force of electricity as see in a room he occupy fit he palace on he return with a set of elaborate fixture and be surprise to find no illumination therefrom we be torch who can not shine in themselves but who when connect with the great central source of power the bless trinity in its three glorious manifestation can show forth the light of the world christian should be torch bearer and the true torch bearer light not he own path so much as the path of those who come after he and this bring we to the fundamental reason for personal responsibility we motive in seek personal righteousness it not as might hastily be think because of a selfish desire to save we own soul or to withdraw either here or hereafter from other soul but for they sake to sanctify ourselves for the life we live today create the spiritual atmosphere of tomorrow from spain come the follow suggestive thought in regard to the value of the person the individual be the real purpose of the universe we may seek the hero of we thought in no philosopher who live in flesh and blood but in a being of fiction and of action more real than all the philosopher he be don quixote one can not say of don quixote that he be strictly idealistic he do not fight for idea : he be of the spirit and he fight for the spirit quixotism be a madness descend from the madness of the cross therefore it be despise by reason don quixote will not resign himself to either the world or its truth to science or logic to art or aesthetics to moral or ethic and what do he leave behind he one may ask i reply that he leave himself and that a man a man living and immortal be worth all theory and all philosophy other country have leave we institution and book : spain have leave soul st theresa be worth all institution whatever or any ` critique of pure reason ' yes this be i think the lesson we have to learn now at this turn point in history with the epoch of intellect crumble about we ear and the great world 's fair of multiply ingenious mechanism we have call modern civilization at a point of practical bankruptcy it be the spirit that count the soul of man living and immortal and only through we own living and the spiritual force that we can command and through ourselves apply shall we be able to compass that social regeneration that be the only alternative to social degeneration and catastrophe the man who do not live he belief be powerless to redeem or to create though he be a solon a charlemagne a napoleon or a washington the man who live he belief even if he be a mill-hand in fall river be contribute something of energize force to the task of re-creation not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of host fantastic and paradoxical as it may seem to link together don quixote and st theresa i be not sure that we could do better than to accept they as model the loud laughter of a age of intellectual ribaldry and self-conceit die away and the gaunt figure of the last of the crusader still stand before we heroic in he childlike refusal of compromise he burning compassion he deafness to ridicule in a sense we must all be ready to accept the jeering and the scorn that be pour out on the knight of la mancha if like he we be to fight even foolishly for the thing that be worth fight for -- either that they may be destroy or restore and with st theresa we must be willing to endure obloquy suspicion malice if like she we live in faith subject we will to the divine will and then spare nothing of ourselves in the labor of save the world for god in the twentieth century as st theresa labor to save it in the sixteenth century the call today be for personal service through the right living that follow the discovery of a right relationship to god not a campaign but a crusade and the figure of st loui and st franci and st theresa together with all the knight and crusader of christendom rise up before we to point the way we would find the great peace the world would find the great peace also but _ the way be all so very plain that we may lose the way _ we have be tell : seek ye first the kingdom of god and he righteousness and all these thing shall be add unto you for you heavenly father knoweth ye have need of these thing if we go forth on this new and knightly quest -- quest indeed in these latter day for the holy grail lose long since and hide away from man -- we may by the grace of god achieve then suddenly in the twinkling of a eye and before we be aware for the kingdom of god cometh not with watch we and even the world shall find that we have compass the great peace and if we do not live to see it yet in we certain hope we shall know that it will come if not in we time yet in god 's good time if not in we way yet in he more perfect way in these lecture i have from time to time and perhaps beyond you patience criticise and condemn many of those concrete institution which form the work mechanism of life even suggest possible substitute in end i would say as in begin this be not because salvation may be find through any device however perfect but because this itself by reason of its excellence on the one hand or its depravity on the other be under the law of life contributory to the operation of the divine spirit -lrb- which be the sole effective energy -rrb- or a deterrent i have try at long last to gather up this diffuse argument for the supremacy of spiritual force as it work through the individual and to place it before you in this conclude lecture perhaps i can best emphasize my point thus the evil of the institution which now hold back the progress that must be make towards social recovery and the great peace be far less the quality of wrongness in themselves and the ill influence they put in operation than it be the revelation they make of personal character it be not so much that newspaper be what they be as that there should be man who be pleased and content to make they this in apparently honest ignorance of what they be do and that there should be other in sufficient number to make they profitable business proposition by give they they appreciation and support it be not so much that government should be what it be as that character should have so far degenerate in the work majority of citizen that these quality should show themselves as a fixed condition and that there should be no body of man of numerical distinction who regard the situation with sentiment much more active than those of indifference and amuse toleration it be not so much that the industrial situation should be what it be as that there should be on both side moral wrong and that this condition could not have come about nor could it still be maintain except through character degeneration in the individual it be not so much that many form of religion be what they be as it be that they should progressively have become this through they exponent and adherent and that there should be so many who be still willing to defend they in this case every ill thing reveal through its very quality the defect of the individual man and as upon he must rest the responsibility for the fault so on he must be place the responsibility for the recovery the failure we have record the false god we have raise up in idolatry even the great war itself be revelation of failure in personal and individual character we may recognize this but recognition be not enough we may find society and committee and write book and deliver lecture but corporate action be not enough nor intellectual assent there be but one way that be right sufficient and effective and that be the right living of each individual which be the incarnation and operation of faith by the grace of god it be my desire to close this course of lecture not with my own word but with those of one of the great personality reveal by the war first however i wish to say this if there be any thought or word in what i have say that seem to you true then i ask you to use it not as a matter for discussion but as a impulse toward personal action if there be anything that be of the nature of explicit error then i pray that the spirit of truth may make deaf you ear that you hear not and blot out of you memory the record of what i have say if there be anything that be not consonant with the christian religion as this have be reveal to the world and as it be guard and interpret by the church to which these power be commit then i retract and disavow it explicitly and _ ex animo _ there be two great spiritual figure that have be reveal to we through the great war : cardinal mercier the great confessor who hold aloft the standard of spiritual glory through the war itself and bishop nicholaus of serbium who have testify to eternal truth and righteousness in the wilderness the war have bring to pass it be with he inspired word that i will make a ending of the thing i have be impel to say christ be merciful but at last he come as the judge \* \* \* he come now not to preside in the church only but to be in you home in you shop to

civilization be move picture make by man without god they perish the soul the spirit live the war be not against externals the war be against ourselves appendix a from the point attain in the lecture on a work philosophy a point i believe to be clearly indicate by christian philosophy and sharply differentiate from that of paganism or modernism i would adventure further and even into a field of pure theory where i can adduce no support or justification from any other source speculation along this line may be dangerous even unjustifiable certainly it introduce the peril of a attempt to intellectualize what can not be apprehend by the intellectual faculty a effort which have be the obsession of modernism and have result in spiritual catastrophe on the other hand we be confront by a definite and plausible system work out by those who be without fear of these consequence and while this already be lose something of its common acceptance it be still operative indeed be the only working system and consistent theory of the majority of think man outside the limit of catholicism i think it wrong both in its assumption and its inference and it certainly play a deplorable part in the building up of the latest phase of modern civilization while its persistence be i be persuade a barrier to recovery or advance this theory which have gradually be deduce from the wonderful investigation tabulation and inference of darwin tyndall huxley spencer and other of the great group of british intellectual and scientist of the nineteenth century be know under the general title of evolution the follow suggestion be offer with extreme diffidence and only as uncertain and indeterminate approximation in some respects they seem not inconsistent with the most recent scientific research which already be cast so much doubt on many of the assumed factor behind evolution and on the accept method of its operation the true solution if it be find will result from the cooperation of scientist philosopher and theologian illuminate by the fire of the divine wisdom -- hagium sophium -- for in such a problem as this almost the final secret of the cosmos no single human agency act alone can hope to achieve the final revelation while all act together could hardly escape fall into the falsehood of they own imagining if they rely solely on they unaided effort in the intellectual sphere assume then that life be a enduring process of the redemption of matter through the interpenetration of spirit what be a possible method of action to explain what i mean i must use a diagrammatic figure but i admit this must be not only inadequate but misleading for instead of the two dimension of a diagram we must postulate three with time add as a vital element and i dare say a fourth dimension as well confess inadequacy in the symbol let we conceive of a space divide into four stratum the lowest of these be the primary unknowable the region of pure spirit pure spirit itself the creative energy of the universe the unconditioned absolute in the term of christian theology almighty god the second be the plane of matter a area of potential but in itself inert and indeterminate the third be the space of what we call life in all its form the area in which the transformation and redemption take place the fourth be the ultimate unknowable that be to say that which follow on after life and receive the finished product of redemption -lrb- illustration : diagram no 1 the interpenetration of matter by spirit _ x _ the primary unknowable _ x ' _ the ultimate unknowable _ -lrb- greek : alpha -rrb- _ the plane of matter _ -lrb- greek : beta -rrb- _ the plane of life -rrb- now there be eternally in process a penetration of the stratum of matter by jet of the _ élan vital _ from the realm of pure spirit each as it be strive to detach from the plane of matter some small portion which be transform in its passage through life and achieve entrance into the ultimate unknowable when the process of redemption be for this small particle complete always however be exert the gravitational pull of matter and the energy that drive through instead of pursue a right line tend to bend in a parabolic curve like the trajectory of a cannon ball in the completion of the process some portion of redeem matter get by so to speak but other portion do not they return to they source of origin and be reabsorb in matter become subject to the operation of future interpenetrate jet of spiritual energy the upward drive of the _ élan vital _ constitute what may properly be know as evolution the decline fall the process of devolution or degeneration evolution then be only one part of the cosmic process it be inseparable from degeneration this process hold in the case of individual of family of race of state and of era or definite and complete period of time as man be begotten bear develop to maturity and then be bring downward to the grave so in the case of race and nation and the clearly define epoch into which the history of man divide itself there be no mechanical system of progress no cumulative wisdom and power that in the end will inevitably lead to earthly perfection and triumph for every individual there be the possibility of spiritual evolution within the time allot that will open for he the gate that bar the frontier of the world of reality and of redemption that lie beyond that world of earthly life which be the field of contest between unredeemed matter and redeeming spirit of contest and of victory -- or of failure in the case of race and nation and epoch there be the same conflict between material factor and spiritual energy the same crescent youth with all its primal vitality maturity with its assurance and competence and the die fall of dissipate energy in each case death be the concomitant of life but there be always something that last over and that be the spiritual achievement the precious residuum that remain defy death and dissolution that infuse the plane of life with its redemptive ardor and be the heritage of life that come after act with the sacramental agency of religion in coöperation with god who ordain and compass they both in that great process of redemption and salvation that be continually take place and will continue until matter and time which be but the ratio of the resistance of matter to the redeeming power of spirit shall be no more i confess the hopelessly mechanical quality in this vain attempt to put into word something that by its very nature must transcend all mode of expression that be intellectually apprehendable take literally it would be entirely false and probably heretical from a theological point of view as it certainly be more than inadequate as a philosophical proposition it be intend only as a symbol and a gross symbol at that but as such i will let it stand now if there be indeed a possible truth hide somewhere within somewhat clumsy approximation it must modify some of we generally accept idea the life-process will appear not a slow interrupted but substantially forward development from lower and simpler organism to higher and more complex with the end -lrb- if there be a end -rrb- beyond the very limit of eternity but rather a swift creation of some of the highest form through the first energy of the creative force with the throw off of ever lower and lower form as the curve of the trajectory descend so through a mass of low and static vitality come the sudden and enormous power that produce at the very beginning of we own recorded history of man the almost superhuman intelligence and capacity of the greek and the egyptian so each of the definite era of civilization open with the release of great energy the revealing of great figure of paramount character and force so conversely as the energy decline man appear less and less potent and in a descend scale this be the case with the greek state with the roman republic and the empire with byzantium with mediaevalism and with we modern era i do not know of any other theory that claim to explain the perpetual and rhythmical fluctuation of history as violent in they degree as they be approximately regular in they rhythm follow the idea a little further it may even appear that many of the lower and particularly the more distorted form of animal life instead of be abortive or undeveloped stage in a continuous evolutionary progress be actually the product of a diminish energy stage in a process of degeneration and therefore lead not upward to ever higher stage of development have issue at last in a complete perfection but rather downward to ultimate extinction geology record this process in sufficient quantity so far as many member of the animal kingdom be concerned and we in we own day have see the extinction of the dodo as well as the threaten disappearance of other species creep and crawl creature too that we could crush with the heel be but the last and puny descendant of mighty and terrible monster that once roll and crash through the fetid forest of the carboniferous era so there be race of man today amongst other the pygmy of africa and the australian bushman as well as some nearer in a certain degree to the dominant race of the world whom large-hearted optimist regard as stage of retard development capable under tutelage of advance to a level with the caucasian but who in this view of the case would be but the weakening product of the die fall of the energy that produce the greek the semite and the nordic stock so in the last instance the ape and the lemur and all they derivative may be not record of some of the many stage through which man have pass in he process of evolution sidetrack by the upward rush of one highly favor or fortunate line nor yet a abortive branch from the common trunk from which spring both man and ape but rather the last degradation of a primaeval energy produce in its declension these strange caricature of the man in whose production it find its achievement in other word the old evolutionary idea be exactly reverse and those phenomenon once look on as pass stage of growth become the memorial of a creative process that have already achieve and be now return with its fantastic manifestation in term of decline life even to that primordial mystery whence it have emerge grant this theory the search for the miss link whether in the geological stratum below those that reveal the piltdown skull or in the fastness of central asia be as vain a quest as it have always be primaeval man as he be grudgingly reveal to we may have be the degenerate remainder of a earlier and fully develop race whose record be bury in the sunken fastness of some vanish atlanti or lemurium as the race of the south sea island may be less metamorphosed remnant of the same stock into this infinitely degrade residuum of a vanish race enter the new energize force when the divine creative energy come once more into operation in the fullness of time and the minoan the egyptian and the greek come almost in a hour to they highest perfection so through the unnumbered age of the world 's history god have from time to time create man in he own image out of the dust of the earth and man so make a little lower than the angel have also in time fall and forfeit he inheritance yet the process go on without cease and in conformity with some law of divine periodicity but it be _ man _ that be create in the beginning of he full stature even as be symbolically record in the book of genesis not a hairy quadrumana that by the operation of the law of natural selection and the survival of the fittest ultimately and through endless age and by the most infinitesimal change become at last plato and caesar leonardo and dante st loui and shakespeare and st franci now in this process of the interpenetration of matter by spirit there must be a certain periodicity if it be a constant process and not one accomplished once and for all time in the very beginning of the world this rhythmical action which be exemplify by every phenomenon of nature the vibratory process of light sound heat electricity the pulsation of the heart the motion of the tide have never escape the observation even of primitive people and always attempt have be make to determine its periodicity may it not be infinitely complex as the ripple rise on the wave that lift on the swell of the underlie tide certainly we be now be force back to a new consideration of this periodical beat in history at least for now that we own era which come in by the power of the renaissance and the reformation and receive its final energize force through the revolution of the eighteenth century and the industrial revolution of the nineteenth be so manifestly come to its end we look backward for precedent for this unexpected debacle and lo they appear every five hundred year back as far as history record 500 bc anno dominus 500 ad 1000 ad and 1500 ad be all to the point of very clear approximation nodal point where the curve of the precede five century have achieve its crest curve downward and in its fall meet the curve of rise energy that be to condition the ensue era the next nodal point calculate on this basis come about the year 2000 be we not justified in plot we trajectory of modernism in place the crest in the year 1914 and in trace the line of fall from that moment i have plot this curve or series of curve after a rough and ready fashion -lrb- diagram no 2 -rrb- and though the personal equation must in any subjective proposition such as this enter largely into account i think the diagram will be accept in principle if not in detail and not wholly in its relationship i have make no effort to estimate or indicate comparative height and depths give to each five-hundred year epoch a similar level of rise and depth of fall perhaps the actual difference here would rightly estimate be less than we have be lead to believe though certainly few would lift the carolingian crest to the level of that of hellenism or of the middle age nor assign to the end of this latter period as low a fall as that accomplish during the tenth century in continental europe -lrb- illustration : diagram no 2 the rise and fall of the line of civilization showing also the nodal point at the christian era and at the year 500 1000 1500 and 2000 -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- in a third cut -lrb- diagram no 3 -rrb- i have roughly indicate in conventional form a phenomenon which seem to I to show itself around the nodal point when a descend curve of energy meet and cross the descend line as the _ élan vital _ that have make and characterize any period decline it throw off reaction the object of which be if possible to arrest or at least delay the fatal _ glissade _ these be in intent and in fact reform conscious effort at save a desperate situation by regenerative method trace back they line of procedure and in every case they will be find to issue out of the very force which be even then in process of degeneration therefore they be poison at the source and no true or vital reform for the sudden energy that urge they be after all in no respect different from that which be already a fail force -lrb- illustration : diagram no 3 the reaction throw off by -lrb- a -rrb- the descend line of vital force -lrb- b -rrb- by the ascend line -rrb- this i conceive be why today the multitudinous and specious reform which beat upon we from all side and find such ready acceptance in the enactment of law be really no reform at all since each one of they be but a exaggeration or distortion of the very principle and method that already be bend downward the curve of we progression until it disappear in the nether-world of failure as do those of every precede epoch of equal duration a example of what i mean be the astute say frequently hear nowadays : the cure for democracy be more democracy now while one curve descend and throw off its reformative reaction in the process the other be ascend preparatory to determine the come era for its allotted space of five century in this process it also throw off its own reaction but these be for the purpose of lift the line more rapidly bring its force into play before its determine time these also be exaggeration over-emphasized quality that be inherent in the ascend force and they be no more to be accept as authoritative than be the other they have they value however for they be prophetic and even in they exaggeration there be the clear forecast of thing to be trace they in turn to the source what be they source the new power issue out of obscurity and its character be veil but we can estimate it from the very nature of the exaggerated reaction we _ can _ see if something show itself in sociology economics politics religion art what you will that be especially a denial of what have be a control agency during the past four or five hundred year : if it be by common consent impractical and outside the current of manifest evolutionary development then shear of its exaggeration reduce to its essential quality it be very probably a clear show forth of what be about to come to birth and condition human life for the next five hundred year this i suppose explain the comprehensive return to medievalism that to the scorn of biologist sociologist and professor of political economy be flaunt itself before we today at the hand of a very small minority in all the category i have name as well as in many other besides a glance at the diagram will show a curious pattern round about the nodal point one may say that the reaction be somewhat mixed quite so at this moment we be beat upon by numberless reform both radical and reactionary materialism democracy rationalism anarchy contend against medievalism of twenty sort and strange mysticism out of the east which shall we choose _ if _ we choose and do not content ourselves with a easier inertia that allow nature to take its course it be simply the question on which wave will you ride that which be descend to oblivion or that which have within itself the power and potency to control man 's destiny for the next five hundred year appendix b certain book suggest for collateral reading adam henry mont saint-michel and chartre adam henry degradation of the
