example authorize by eminent name ancient and modern every other pen must have be drop in despair so true be it that ` he unite the good sense of fontenelle with the attic salt and grace of count anthony hamilton ' but ` horace ' be a man of great literary modesty and always undervalue he own effort he life be one of little incident : it be he character he mind the society around he the period in which he shine that give the charm to he correspondence and the interest to he biography besides he have the weakness common to several other fine gentleman who have combine letter and _ haut ton _ of be ashamed of the literary character the vulgarity of the court its indifference to all that be not party write whether polemical or political cast a shade over author in he time never be there beneath all he assumed whig principle a more profound aristocrat than horace walpole he be by birth one of those well-descended english gentleman who have often scorn the title of noble and who have repudiate the notion of merge they own ancient name in modern title the commoner of england hold a proud pre-eminence when some low-born man entreat jame i to make he a gentleman the well-known answer be ` na na i canna i could mak thee a lord but none but god almighty can mak a gentleman ' sir robert walpole afterwards minister to george ii and eventually lord orford belong to a ancient family in norfolk he be a third son and be originally destine for the church but the death of he elder brethren have leave he heir to the family estate in 1698 he succeed to a property which ought to have yield he # 2000 a year but which be cripple with various encumbrance in order to relieve himself of these sir robert marry catherine shorter the granddaughter of sir john shorter who have be illegally and arbitrarily appoint lord mayor of london by jame ii horace be she youngest child and be bear in arlington street on the 24th of September 1717 os six year afterwards he be inoculate for the small-pox a precaution which he record as worthy of remark since the operation have then only recently be introduce by lady mary wortley montagu from turkey he be silent however naturally enough as to one important point -- he real parentage the character of he mother be by no means such as to disprove a assertion which gain general belief : this be that horace be the offspring not of sir robert walpole but of carr lord hervey the eldest son of the earl of bristol and the elder brother of lord hervey whose ` memoirs of the court of george ii ' be so generally know carr lord hervey be witty eccentric and sarcastic : and from he horace walpole be say to have inherit he wit he eccentricity he love of literature and he profound contempt for all mankind except only a few member of a cherish and exclusive _ clique _ in the note of he life which horace walpole leave for the use of he executor robert berry esq and of he daughter miss berry he make this brief mention of lady walpole : -- ` my mother die in 1737 ' he be then twenty year of age but beneath this seemingly slight recurrence to he mother a regret which never leave he through life be bury like cowper he mourn as the profoundest of all sorrow the loss of that life-long friend ` my mother when i learn would that thou wast dead say wast thou conscious of the tear i shed hover thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing son wretch even then life 's journey just begin ' although horace in many point bear a strong resemblance to sir robert walpole he rarely if ever receive from that jovial heartless able man any proof of affection a outcast from he father 's heart the whole force of the boy 's love centre in he mother yet in after-life no one reverenced sir robert walpole so much as he supposed son to be adverse to the minister be to be adverse to the unloved son who cherish he memory what ` my father ' thought do and say be law what he foe dare to express be heresy horace have the family mania strong upon he the world be make for walpole whose view be never to be controvert nor whose faith impugn yet horace must have witness perhaps with out comprehend it much disunion at home lady walpole beautiful and accomplished could not succeed in riveting she husband to he conjugal duty gross licentiousness be the order of the day and sir robert be among the most licentious he leave he lovely wife to the perilous attention of all the young courtier who fancy that by court the premier 's wife they could secure walpole 's good office sir robert accord to pope be one of those who -- ` never make a friend in private life and be besides a tyrant to he wife at all event if not a tyrant he be indifferent to those circumstance which reflect upon he and be injurious to she he be conscious that he have no right to complain of any infidelity on she part and he leave she to be surround by man whom he know to be profligate of the most dangerous pretension to wit and elegance it be possibly not unfrequently that horace he mother 's pet glean in the drawing-room of arlington street he first notion of that _ persiflage _ which be the fashion of the day we can fancy he a precocious old-fashioned little boy at he mother 's apron-string whilst carr lord hervey be pay he devoir we see he gaze with wonder eye at pulteney earl of bath with he blue ribbon across he lace coat whilst compassionate friend observe the pale-faced boy in that hot-house atmosphere in which both mind and body be like force plant prophesy that ` little horace ' could not possibly live to be a man he survive however two sister who die in childhood and become dearer and dearer to he fond mother in he old age horace delighted in recall anecdote of he infancy in these he mother 's partiality largely figure bring up among courtier and minister he childish talk be all of king and prince and he be a gossip both by inclination and habit he greatest desire in life be to see the king -- george i and he nurse and attendant augment he wish by they exalted description of the grandeur which he effect in after-life to despise he entreat he mother to take he to st jame 's when relate the incident of the scene in which he be first introduce to a court horace walpole speak of the ` infinite good-nature of he father who never thwart any of he child ' and ` suffer he ' he say ` to be too much indulge ' some difficulty attend the fruition of the forward boy 's wish the duchess of kendal be jealous of sir robert walpole 's influence with the king : she aim be to bring lord bolingbroke into power the childish fancy be nevertheless gratify : and under he mother 's care he be conduct to the apartment of the duchess of kendal in st jame 's ' a favor so unusual to be ask by a boy of ten year old ' he afterwards write in he ` reminiscence ' ` be still too slight to be refuse to the wife of the first minister and she darling child ' however as it be not to be a precedent the interview be to be private and at night it be ten o'clock in the evening when lady walpole lead she son be admit into the apartment of melusina de schulenberg countess of walsingham who pass under the name of the duchess of kendal 's niece but who be in fact she daughter by george i the polluted room in which lady walsingham live be afterwards occupy by the two mistress of george ii -- the countess of suffolk and madame de walmoden countess of yarmouth with lady walsingham lady walpole and she little son wait until notice have be give that the king have come down to supper he be lead into the presence of ` that good sort of man ' as he call george i that monarch be please to permit the young courtier to kneel down and kiss he hand a few word be speak by the August personage and horace be lead back into the adjoining room but the vision of that ` good sort of man ' be present to he when in old age he write down he recollection for he beloved miss berry by the side of a tall lean ill-favoured old german lady -- the duchess of kendal -- stand a pale short elderly man with a dark tie-wig in a plain coat and waistcoat : these and he breeches be all of snuff-coloured cloth and he stocking of the same color by the blue riband alone could the young subject of this ` good sort of man ' discern that he be in the presence of majesty little interest could be elicit in this brief interview yet horace think it he painful duty be also the son of a prime minister to shed tear when with the other scholar of eton college he walk in the procession to the proclamation of george ii and no doubt he be one of _ very _ few personage in england whose eye be moisten for that event nevertheless there be something of _ bonhommie _ in the character of george i that one miss in he successor he love of punch and he habit of become a little tipsy over he private dinner with sir robert walpole be english as well as german trait and be regard almost as condescension and then he have a kind of slow wit that be turn upon the venial official whose perquisite be at they disgraceful height in he time ' a strange country this ' say the monarch in he most clamorous german : ` one day after i come to st jame 's i look out of the window and see a park with walk laurel & c these they tell I be mine the next day lord chetwynd the ranger of _ my _ park send I a brace of carp out of my canal i be tell thereupon that i must give five guinea to lord chetwynd 's porter for bring I my _ own _ fish out of my _ own _ canal in my _ own _ park ' in spite of some agreeable quality george i be however anything but a ` good sort of man ' it be difficult how to rank the two first george both be detestable as man and scarcely tolerable as monarch the foreign deed of george i be stain with the suppose murder of count konigsmark : the english career of george ii be one of the coarsest profligacy they example be infamous he father 's only sister have become the second wife of charle lord townshend

he care he remain until he go in 1727 to eton but walpole 's be not merely a scholastic education : he be destine for the law -- and on go up to cambridge be oblige to attend lecture on civil law he go from eton to king 's college -- where he be however more disposed to what be term accomplishment than to deep reading at cambridge he even study italian at home he learn to dance and fence and take lesson in draw from bernard lens drawing-master to the duke of cumberland and he sister it be not to be wonder at that he leave cambridge without take a degree but fortune be lie as it be in wait for he and various sinecure have be reserve for the minister 's youngest son : first he become inspector of the import and export in the custom but soon resign that post to be usher of the exchequer ` and as soon ' he write ` as i become of age i take possession of two other little patent place in the exchequer call comptroller of the pipe and clerk of the estreat they have be hold for I by mr fane ' such be the mode in which the younger son be then provide for by a minister nor have the unworthy system die out in we time although greatly modify horace be grow up meantime not a awkward but a somewhat insignificant youth with a short slender figure : which always retain a boyish appearance when see from behind he face be common-place except when he really expressive eye sparkle with intelligence or melt into the sweetest expression of kindness but he laugh be force and uncouth : and even in he smile there be a hard sarcastic expression that make one regret that he smile he be now in possession of a income of # 1700 annually and he look naturally to the continent to which all young member of the aristocracy repair after the completion of they collegiate life he have be popular

they visit court and receive affability from prince : in vain do he of cornhill participate for a brief period in the attention lavish on the son of a british prime minister : they quarrel -- and we almost reverence gray for that result more especially when we find the author of ` walpoliana ' express he conviction that ` have it not be for this idle indulgence of he hasty temper mr gray would

take lady sophium fermor ` the two couple be just admirably mismatch as everybody soon perceive by the attention of each man to the woman he do not dance with and the emulation of either lady it be a admirable scene ' all however be not country dancing : the young man ` too old and too young to be in love ' be to make he way as a wit he do so in the approved way in that day of irreligion in a

robert 's only day of rest when he use to rush to richmond new park there to amuse himself with a favorite pack of beagle notwithstanding the minister 's indifference to this he youngest son horace feel bitterly what he consider a persecution against one of the most corrupt of modern statesman ` trust I if we fall all the grandeur all the envied grandeur of we house will not cost I a sigh : it

door but over the way at my lord carteret 's -- oh say i then let they alone may be he do not dislike the noise i pity the poor porter who see all he old customer go over the way too ' the retirement of sir robert from office have a important effect on the taste and future life of he son horace the minister have be occupy he later year in pull down he old ancestral house at houghton and in build a enormous mansion which have since he time be in its turn partially demolish when harley earl of orford be know to be erect a great house for himself sir robert have remark that a minister who do so commit a great imprudence when houghton be begin sir hynde aston remind sir robert of this speech ` you ought to have recall it to I before ' be the reply ` for before i begin build it might have be of use to I ' this famous memorial of walpolean greatness this splendid folly construct it be generally suppose on public money be inhabit by sir robert only ten day in summer and twenty day in winter in the autumn during the shooting season two month it become almost a eyesore to the quiet gentry who view the palace with a feeling of they own inferiority people as good as the walpole live in they gable-ended moderate-sized mansion and who be sir robert to set they at so immense a distance to the vulgar comprehension of the premier houghton gigantic in its proportion have its purpose he there

the cultivation of plant buy uvedale 's ` hortus siccus ' and receive from bradley the professor of botany at cambridge the tribute of a dedication in which it be say that ` sir robert have purchase one of the finest collection of plant in the kingdom ' what be more to he honor still be sir robert 's preservation of st jame 's park for the people fond of outdoor amusement himself the premier hear with dismay a proposal on the part of queen caroline to convert that ancient park into a palace garden ` she ask my father ' horace walpole relate ` what the alteration might possibly cost ' -- _ only three crown _ ' be the civil witty candid answer the queen be wise enough to take the hint it be possible she mean to convert the park into garden that should be open to the public as at berlin mannheim and even the tuilery still it would not have be ours horace walpole owe perhaps he love of architecture and he taste for gardening partly to the early companionship of gray who delight in those pursuit walpole 's estimation of picture medal and statue be however the fruit of a long residence abroad we be apt to rail at continental nation yet have it not be for the occasional intercourse with foreign nation art would have altogether die out among we to the ` grande tour ' perform as a matter of course by we young nobility in the most impressionable period of they life we owe most of we noble private collection charle i and buckingham renew in they travels in spain the effort previously make by lord arundel and lord pembroke to embellish they country seat then come the rebellion and like a mighty rush river make a chasm in which much perished art languish in the reign of the second charle except in what relate to portrait painting evelyn stand almost alone in he then secluded and lovely retirement at wotton apart in he undying exertion still to arrest the muse ere they quit for ever english shore then come the deadly frost of william 's icy influence the reign of anne be conspicuous more for letter than for art : architecture more especially be vulgarize under vanbrugh george i have no conception of anything abstract : taste erudition science art be like a dead language to he common sense he vulgar profligacy and he personal predilection neither george ii nor he queen have a iota of taste either in language conduct literature or art to be vulgar be _ haut-ton _ to be refine to have pursuit that take one from low party gossip or heterodox disquisition upon party be esteem odd : everything original be cramped everything imaginative be sneer at the enthusiasm that be elevated by religion be unphilosophic the poetry that be breathe out from the work of genius be not comprehend it be at houghton under the roof of that monster palace that horace walpole indulge that taste for picture which he have acquire in italy he chief coadjutor however as far as the antiquity of painting be concern be george vertue the eminent engraver vertue be a man of modest merit and be educate merely as a engraver but conscious of talent study draw which he afterwards apply to engrave he be patronise both by the vain godfrey kneller and by the intellectual lord somer : yet he work have more fidelity than elegance and betray in every line the antiquary rather than the genius vertue be know to be a first-rate authority as to the history of a painter he be admit and welcome into every great country house in england he live in a atmosphere of vertù every line a dilettante collector write every word he utter be minute down by he he visit every collection of rarity he copy every paper he could find relative to art register of will and register of parish for birth and death be he delight sale he recreation he be the ` old mortality ' of picture in this country no wonder that he compilation be barely contain in forty volume which he leave in manuscript human nature have singular variety : here be a man who expend he very existence in gather up the work of other and die without give to the world one of he own but horace walpole have do he justice after vertue 's death he buy he manuscript from he widow in one of he pocket-book be contain the whole history of this man of one idea : vertue begin he collection in 1713 and work at it until he death in 1757 forty-four year he die in the belief that he should one day publish a unique work on painting and painter : such be the aim of he existence and he study must have be even more curious than the wonderfully cram small house at islington where william upcott the ` old mortality ' in he line who save from the housemaid 's fire-lighting design the mss of evelyn 's life and letter which he find toss about in the old gallery at wotton near dorking pass he day like upcott like palissy vertue live and die under the influence of one isolate aim effort and hope in these man the cherish and amiable monomania of gifted mind be realize upcott have every possible autograph from every known hand in he collection : palissy succeed in make glazed china but vertue leave he ore to the hand of other to work out into shape and the man who mould he crude material be horace walpole and vertue 's forty volume be shape into a readable work as curious and accurate in fact as it be flippant and prejudiced in style and opinion walpole 's ` anecdote of painting ' be the foundation of all we small amount of knowledge as to what england have do formerly to encourage art one may fancy the modest ingenious george vertue arrange first and then make a catalogue of the houghton gallery horace a boy still in look -- with a somewhat chubby face admiring and follow : sir robert in a cocked hat edge with silver lace a curl short wig a loose coat also edge with silver lace and with a half humorous expression on he vulgar countenance watch they at interval as they parade through the hall a large square space adorn with bas-relief and bust and contain a bronze copy of the laocoon for which sir robert -lrb- or rather we english -rrb- pay a thousand pound or they might be see hop speedily through the ground-floor apartment where there could be little to arrest the footstep of the mediaeval-minded vertue who but a courtier could give one glance at a portrait of george i though by kneller who that _ be _ a courtier in that house would pause to look at the resemblance also by kneller of the short-lived ill-used catherine shorter the premier 's first wife -- even though he still endure it in he bed-room a mute reproach for he neglect and misconduct so let we hasten to the yellow dining-room where presently we may admire the work of titian guido vanderwerf and last not least eleven portrait by vandyck of the wharton family which sir robert buy at the sale of the spendthrift duke of wharton then let we glance at the saloon famed for the four large ` market piece ' as they be call by ruben and snyder : let we lounge into what be call the carlo marattus and the vandyck room step we also into the green velvet bed-chamber the tapestry-room the work bed chamber then come another dining-room : in short we be lose in wonder at this noble collection which cost # 40000 many of the picture be select and bargain for by vertue who in flander purchase the market piece refer to for # 428 but do not secure the ` fish market ' and the ` meat market ' by the same painter in addition to the picture the stateliness and beauty of the room be enhance by rich furniture carve gilding and all the subsidiary art which we grandfather love to add to high merit in design or color besides he purchase sir robert receive present of picture from friend and expectant courtier and the gallery at houghton contain at last 222 picture to we sorrow now to we disgrace then this splendid collection be suffer to go out of the country : catherine empress of russium buy it for # 40000 and it adorn the hermitage palace of st petersburgh after sir robert 's retirement from power the good quality which he undoubtedly possess seem to re-appear as soon as the pressure of party feeling be withdraw he be fast decline in health when the insurrection of 1745 be impend he have warn the country of its danger in he last speech one of the finest ever make in the house of lord : after that effort he voice be hear no more the gallant unfortunate charle edward be then at pari and that scope of old experience -- ` which doth attain to somewhat of prophetic strain ' show the ex-minister of great britain that a invasion be at hand it be on this occasion that frederick prince of wale take sir robert then lord orford by the hand and thank he for he zeal in the cause of the royal family walpole return to norfolk but be summon again to london to afford the ministry the benefit of he counsel death however close he prosperous but laborious life he suffer agony from the stone large dose of opium keep he in a state of stupor and alone give he ease but he strength fail and he be warn to prepare himself for he decease he bear the announcement with great fortitude and take leave of he child in perfect resignation to he doom he die on the 28th of march 1745 horace walpole -- whatsoever doubt may rest on the fact of he be lord orford 's son or not -- write feelingly and naturally upon this event and its forerunner the agony of disease he seem from the follow passage in he letter to sir horace mann to have devote himself incessantly to the patient invalid : on he father have rally he thus express himself : -- ` you have hear from you brother the reason of my not have write to you so long i have be out but twice since my father fall into this illness which be now near a month and all that time either continually in he room or oblige to see multitude of people : for it be wonderful how everybody of all kind have affect to express they concern for he he have be out of danger this week but i can not say he mend at all perceptibly till these last three day he spirit be amazing and he constitution more for dr hulse say honestly from the first that if he recover it would be from he own strength not from they art how much more ' he add mournfully ` he will ever recover one scarce dare hope about for we he be greatly recover for himself -- ' he then break off a month after we find he thus refer to the parent still throb in mortal agony on the death-bed with no chance of amendment : -- ` how dismal a prospect for he with the possession of the greatest understanding in the world not the least impaired to lie without any use for it for to keep he from pain and restlessness he take so much opiate that he be scarce awake four hour of the four-and-twenty but i will say no more of this ' on the 29th of march he again write to he friend in the follow term : -- ' i begged you brother to tell you what it be impossible for I to tell you you share in we common loss do not expect I to enter at all upon the subject after the melancholy two month that i have pass and in my situation you will not wonder i shun a conversation which could not be bound by a letter a letter that would grow into a panegyric or a piece of a moral improper for I to write upon and too distressful for we both a death be only to be feel never to be talk upon by those it touch ' nevertheless the world soon have horace walpole for she own again during lord orford 's last illness george ii thought of he it seem even though the ` granville ' be the only people tolerate at court that famous _ clique _ comprise the secretly adore of horace -lrb- lady granville now -rrb- lady sophium fermor ` the granville faction ' horace write before he father 's death ` be still the constant and only countenanced people at court lord winchelsea one of the disgraced play at court at twelfth-night and win the king ask he next morning how much he have for he own share he reply sir about a quarter 's salary i like the spirit and be talk to he of it the next night at lord granville 's why yes say he i think it show familiarity at least : tell it you father i do not think he will dislike it ' the most trifling incident divide the world of fashion and produce the bitterest rancor indeed nothing could exceed the frivolity of the great except they impertinence for want of better amusement it have become the fashion to make conundrum and to have print book full of they which be produce at party but these be peaceful diversion the following anecdote be worthy of the time of george ii and of frederick of wale : -- ` there be a very good quarrel ' horace write ` on foot between two duchess : she of queensberry send to invite lady emily lenox to a ball : she grace of richmond who be wonderfully cautious since lady caroline 's elopement -lrb- with mr fox -rrb- send word she could not determine the other send again the same night : the same answer the queensberry then send word that she have make up she company and desire to be excuse from have lady emily 's but at the bottom of the card write too great trust there be no declaration of war come out from the other duchess : but i believe it will be make a national quarrel of the whole illegitimate royal family ' she grace of queensberry prior 's ` kitty beautiful and young ' lord it with a tyrannical hand over the court she famed loveliness be it be true at this time on the wane she portrait delineate she in she bib and tucker with she head roll back underneath a sort of half cap half veil show how intellectual be the face to which such incense be pay for year she forehead and eyebrow be beautiful : she eye soft though lively in expression : she feature refine she be as whimsical in she attire as in she character when however she choose to appear as the _ grande dame _ no one could cope with she mr delany describe she at the birth-day -- she dress of white satin embroidered with vine leave convolvulus rose-bud shaded after nature but she say she friend ` be _ so far _ beyond the master - _ piece of art _ that one could hardly think of she clothes -- allow for she age i never see so _ beautiful a creature _ ' meantime houghton be shut up : for its owner die # 50000 in debt and the elder brother of horace the second lord orford propose on enter it again after keep it close for some time to enter upon ` new and then very unknown economy for which there be great need : ' thus horace refer to the change it be in the south sea scheme that sir robert walpole have realize a large sum of money by sell out at the right moment in do so he have gain 1000 per cent but he leave little to he family and at he death horace receive a legacy only of # 5000 and a thousand pound yearly which he be to draw -lrb- for do nothing -rrb- from the collector 's place in the custom house the surplus to be divide between he brother edward and himself : this provision be afterwards enhance by some money which come to horace and he brother from he uncle captain shorter 's property but horace be not at this period a rich man and perhaps he not marry be owe to he dislike of fortune-hunting or to he dread of refusal two year after he father 's death he take a small house at twickenham : the property cost he nearly # 14000 in the deed he find that it be call strawberry hill he soon commence make considerable addition to the house -- which become a sort of raree-show in the latter part of the last and until a late period in this century twickenham -- so call accord to the antiquary norden because the thame as it flow near it seem from the island to be divide into two river -- have long

time of lyson a hundred and fifty acre of fruit-garden at twickenham : the soil be a sandy loam raspberry grow plentifully even so early as queen elizabeth 's day bishop corbet 's father have a nursery garden at twickenham -- so that king edr 's curse seem to have fall as powerlessly as it may be hope all subsequent malediction may do in 1698 one of the earl of bradford 's coachman build a

in keep : the internal decoration the screen the niche the chimney-piece the book-shelf be all gothic and most of these be design by horace himself and indeed the description of strawberry hill be too

' and incense sometimes wring from ache heart to the fastidious wit who profess to be a judge of all material and immaterial thing -- from a burlesque to a essay on history or philosophy -- from the construction of mr chenevix 's last new toy to the mechanism of a clock make in the sixteenth century be lavish there suppose that it be noon-day : horace be show a party of guest from london over strawberry : -- enter we with he and let we stand in the great parlor before a portrait by wright of the minister to whom all court bow ` that be my father sir robert in profile ' and a vulgar face in profile be always see at its vulgarest and the _ nex-retroussé _ the coarse mouth the double chin be most forcibly exhibit in this limning by wright who do not like reynold or like lawrence cast a _ nuance _ of gentility over every subject of he pencil horace -- can we not hear he in imagination -- be tell he friend how sir robert use to celebrate the day on which he send in he resignation as a fête then he would point out to he visitor a conversation-piece one of reynold 's earliest effort in small life represent the second earl of edgecumbe selwyn and william -- all wit and beau and _ habitués _ of strawberry colley cibber however be put in cold marble in the anteroom a respect very _ horatian _ for no man know better how to rank he friend than the recluse of strawberry he hurry the linger guest through the little parlor the chimneypiece of which be copy from the tomb of ruthall bishop of durham in westminster abbey yet how he pause complacently to enumerate what have be do for he by title belle : how these dog model in terra-cotta be the production of anne darner a water-colour drawing by agne berry a landscape with gipsy by lady di beauclerk -- all platonically devote to we horace but he dwell long and he bright eye be light up as he pause before a case look as if it contain only a few apparently fade of no-one-knows-who -lrb- or by whom -rrb- miniature this be a

kindly gentle -- the prince of book-worm -- move quickly through the room pause to raise a glance to the ceiling -- copy from one of the side aisle of henry vii 's chapel -- but the fretwork be gilt and there be _ petitesse _ about the gothic which disappoint all good judge but when horace conduct he courtly guest into this he mind-vaunted vaulted gallery he have sometimes george selwyn at he side or gray -- or in he old age ` my niece the duchess of gloucester ' lean on he arm what strange association what brilliant company -- the association can never be recall there again nor the company reassemble the gallery like everything else have perish under the pressure of debt he who be so particular too as to the number of those who be admit to see he house -- he who stipulate that four person only should compose a party and one party alone be show over each day -- how would he have bear the crisis could he have foresee it when robin become for the time he successor and be the temporary lord of strawberry the dusty ruthless wonder depreciate mob of broker -- the respectable host of publisher -- the starve army of martyr the author -- the fine lady who see nothing there comparable to howell and jame 's -- the antiquary fish out suspicious antiquity -- the painter clamorous over kneller 's profile of mr barry -- the virtuous indignant mother as they pass by the portrait of the duchess de la valliere and of ninon de l'enclo and remark or at all event they _ might _ have remark that the company on the floor be scarcely much more respectable than the company on the wall -- the fashionable who herd together impel by caste that free-masonry of social life enter the beauclerk closet to look over lady di 's scene from the ` mysterious mother ' -- the player and dramatist finally who crowd round hogarth 's sketch of he ` beggar ' opera ' with portrait and gaze on davison 's likeness of mr clive : -- how could poor horace have tolerate the sound of they irreverent remark the dust of they shoe the degradation of they fancy that they might doubt he spurious-looking antiquity or condemn he improper-looking lady on they canvas how indeed could he for those parlor that library be people in he day with all those who could enhance he pleasure or add to they own by they presence when poverty steal in there it be irradiate by genius when painter hover beneath the fret ceiling of that library it be to thank the oracle of the day not always for large order but for powerful recommendation when actress tread the star chamber it be as modest friend not as audacious critic on horace he house and he picture before we call up the spirit that be familiar at strawberry -- ere we pass through the garden-gate the pier of which be copy from the tomb of bishop william de luda in ely cathedral -- let we glance at the chapel and then a word or two about walpole 's neighbor and anent twickenham the front of the chapel be copy from bishop audley 's tomb

continue with she when at florence the grand duke give she apartment in he palace one room suffice for everything and when she go away the stench be so strong that they be oblige to fumigate the chamber with vinegar for a week ' let not the scandal be implicitly credit lady mary dirty or clean reside occasionally however at twickenham when the admirable lyson compose he ` environs of london '

abode of loui philippe and now of he accomplished son one dark figure in the background of society haunt we also : lady macclesfield the cruel mother of savage polluted twickenham by she evil presence let we not dwell on she name but recall with somewhat of pride that the name of that knot of accomplished intellectual woman who compose the neighborhood of strawberry be all english those who love to revel in all its charm of society and intellect be we justly-prized countrywoman foremost in the bright constellation be anne seymor conway too soon marry to the hon john darner she be one of the loveliest the most enterprizing and the most gifted woman of she time -- thirty-one year younger than horace have be bear in 1748 he doubtless like she the more that no ridicule could attach to he partiality which be that of a father to a daughter insofar as regard he young cousin she belong to a family dear to he be the daughter of field marshal henry seymor conway : then she be beautiful witty a courageous politician a heroine fearless of lose caste by aspire to be a artist she be in truth of we own time rather than of that the work which she leave at strawberry be scatter and if still traceable be probably in many instance scarcely value but in that lovely spot hallowed by the remembrance of mr siddon who live there in some humble capacity -- say maid say companion -- in guy 's cliff house near warwick -- noble trace of anne damer 's genius be extant : bust of the majestic sally siddon of nature 's aristocrat john kemble of he brother charle -- arrest many a look call up many a thought of anne damer and she gift : she intelligence she warmth of heart she beauty she associate of she power horace walpole have the highest opinion ` if they come to florence ' he write speaking of mr damer 's go to italy for the winter ` the great duke should beg mr damer to give he something of she statuary and it would be a greater curiosity than anything in he chamber of painter she have execute several marvel since you see she and have lately carve two colossal head for the bridge at henley which be the most beautiful in the world next to the ponte di trinità and be

retreat at strawberry horace walpole hear all that befel the object of he flame lady sophium fermor he letter present from time to time such passage as these lady pomfret whom he detest be always the object of he satire : -- ` there be not the least news but that my lord carteret 's wedding have be defer on lady sophium 's -lrb- fermor 's -rrb- fall dangerously ill of a scarlet fever but they say it be to be next Saturday she be to have # 1600 a year jointure # 400 pin-money and # 2000 of jewel carteret say he do not intend to marry the mother -lrb- lady pomfret -rrb- and the whole family what

carteret by grace daughter of the first earl of bath of the line of granville -- a title which become eventually he the fair sophium in marry he espouse a man of no ordinary attribute in person horace walpole after the grave have close over one whom he probably envy thus describe he : -- ` commanding beauty smooth by cheerful grace sit on each open feature of he face bold be he language rapid

nice decision and unbounded presumption the duke of newcastle use to say of he that he be a ` man who never doubt ' in a subsequent letter we find the sacrifice of the young and lovely sophium complete ambition be the characteristic of she family : and she go not unwillingly to the altar the whole affair be too amusingly tell to be give in other language than that of horace : -- ' i could tell you a great deal of news ' he write to horace mann ` but it would not be what you would expect it be not of battle siege and declaration of war nor of invasion insurrection and address : it be the god of love not he of war who reign in the newspaper the town have make up a list of six-and-thirty wedding which i shall not catalogue to you but the chief entertainment have be the nuptials of

the troops to oppose he the prince of wale be invite a party to supper the main feature of which be the citadel of carlisle in sugar the company all besiege it with sugar-plum it would indeed as walpole declare be impossible to relate all the _ caligulism _ of this effeminate absurd prince but buffoonery and eccentricity be the order of the day ' a ridiculous thing happen ' horace write `

and therefore touch account that have be give whilst he call a ` rebellion on the defensive ' a ` despicable affair ' humane he revert with horror to the atrocity of general hawley ` the chief justice ' as he be designate who have a ` passion for frequent and sudden execution ' when this savage commander gain intelligence of a french spy come over he display he at once before the army on a gallows dangle in he muff and boot when one of the surgeon beg for the body of a deserter to dissect ` well ' say the wretch ` but you must let I have the skeleton to hang up in the guard-room ' such be the

the price be to be he fancy # 2000 a year meantime during the convulsive state of political affair he interest himself continually in the improvement of strawberry hill there be a rival building mr bateman 's monastery at old windsor which be say to have have more uniformity of design than strawberry hill horace use indeed to call the house of which he become so proud a paper house the wall be at first so slight and the roof so insecure in heavy rain nevertheless he day be pass as peacefully there as the premature infirmity which come upon he would permit from the age of twenty-five he finger be enlarged and deform by chalk-stone which be discharge twice a year ' i can chalk up a score with more rapidity than any man in england ' be he melancholy jest he have now adopt as a necessity a strict temperance : he sit up very late either write or converse yet always breakfast at nine o'clock after the death of madame du deffand a little fat dog scarcely able to move for age and size -- she legacy -- use to proclaim he approach by bark the little favorite be place beside he on a sofa a tea-kettle stand and heater be bring in and he drink two or three cup of tea out of the finest and most precious china of japan -- that of a pure white he breakfast with a appetite feeding from he table the little dog and he pet squirrel dinner at strawberry hill be usually serve up in the small parlor in winter the large dining-room be reserve for large party as age draw on he be support down stair by he valet and then say the compiler of walpoliana ` he eat most moderately of chicken pheasant or any light food pastry he dislike as difficult of digestion though he would taste a morsel of venison-pie never but once that he drink two glass of white wine do the editor see he taste any liquor except ice-water a pail of ice be place under the table in which stand a decanter of water from which he supply himself with he favorite beverage ' no wine be drunk after dinner when the host of strawberry hill call instantly to some one to ring the bell for coffee it be serve upstairs and there add the same writer ` he would pass about five o'clock and generally resume he place on the sofa would sit till two in the morning in miscellaneous chit-chat full of singular anecdote stroke of wit and acute observation occasionally send for book or curiosity or pass to the library as any reference happen to arise in conversation after he coffee he taste nothing but the snuff-box of _ tabac d'etrenne _ from fribourg 's be not forget and be replenish from a canister lodge in a ancient marble urn of great thickness which stand in the window seat and serve to secure its moisture and rich flavor ' in spite of all he infirmity horace walpole take no care of he health as far as out-door exercise be concern he friend behold he with horror go out on a dewy day : he would even step out in he slipper in he own grounds he never wear a hat : he use to say that on he first visit to pari he be ashamed of he effeminacy when he see every meager little frenchman whom he could have knock down in a breath walk without a hat which he could not do without a certainty of take the disease which the german say be endemical in england and which they call _ to catch cold _ the first trial he use to tell he friend cost he a fever but he get over it draught of air damp room window open at he back become matter of indifference to he after once get through the harden process he use even to be vex at the officious solicitude of friend on this point and with half a smile would say ` my back be the same as my face and my neck be like my nose ' he regard he favorite iced-water as a preservative to he stomach which he say would last longer than he bone he do not take into account that the stomach be usually the seat of disease one naturally inquire why the amiable recluse never in he best day think of marriage : a difficult question to be answer in man of that period a dissolute life a unhappy connection too frequently explain the problem in the case before we no such explanation can be offer horace walpole have many votary many friend several favorite but no known mistress the mark of the old bachelor fasten early on he more especially after he begin to be govern by he _ valet de chambre _ the notable personage who rule over the pliant horace be a swiss name colomb this domestic tyrant be despotic if horace want a tree to be fell colomb oppose it and the master yield servant in those day be intrinsically the same as in ours but they differ in manner the old familiarity have not go out but exist as it still do among the french those who recollect dr parr will remember how stern a rule he factotum sam exercise over he sam put down what wine he choose nay almost invite the guest at all event he have he favorite among they and in the same way as sam rule at hatton colomb be _ de facto _ the master of strawberry hill with all its defect the little ` plaything house ' as horace walpole call it must have be a charming house to visit in first there be the host ` he engaging manners ' write the editor of walpoliana ` and gentle endearing affability to he friend exceed all praise not the smallest hauteur or consciousness of rank or talent appear in he familiar conference and he be ever eager to dissipate any constraint that might occur as impose a constraint upon himself and know that any such chain enfeeble and almost annihilate the mental power endue with exquisite sensibility he wit never give the smallest wound even to the grossest ignorance of the world or the most morbid hypochondriac bashfulness ' he have in fact no excuse for be doleful or morbid how many resource be he what a even destiny what prosperous fortune what learn luxury he revel in he be enable to ` pick up all the rose of science and to leave the thorn behind ' to how few of the gifted have the means of gratification be permit to how many have hard work be allot then when genius have be endow with rank with wealth how often it have be degrade by excess rochester 's passion run riot in one century : beckford 's gift be polluted by he vice in another -- signal landmark of each age but horace walpole be prudent decorous even respectable : no elevated aspiration no benevolent view ennoble under the _ petitesse _ of he nature he have neither genius nor romance : he be even devoid of sentiment but he be social to all neighbourly to many and attach to some of he fellow-creature the ` prettiest bauble ' possible as he call strawberry hill ` set in enamelled meadow in filigree hedge ' be surround by ` dowager as plenty as flounder ' such be walpole 's assertion as he sit in he library scented by caraway heliotrope or pot of tuberose or orange-tree in flower certain dame would look in upon he sometimes _ malgrê luus _ sometimes to he bachelor heart 's content ` thank god ' he write to he cousin conway ` the thame be between I and the duchess of queensberry ' walpole 's dislike to he fair neighbor may partly have originate in the circumstance of she birth and she grace 's presume to plume herself on what he deem a unimportant distinction catherine hyde duchess of queensberry be the great-granddaughter of the famous lord clarendon and the great-niece of anne duchess of york prior have in she youth celebrate she in the ` female phaëton ' as ` kitty : ' in he verse he beg phaëton to give kitty the chariot if but for a day in reference to this horace walpole in the day of he admiration of she grace have make the follow impromptu : -- ` on see the duchess of queensberry walk at the funeral of the princess dowager of wale -- ` to many a kitty love he car would for a day engage but prior 's kitty ever fair obtain it for a age ' it be kitty who take gay under she patronage who resent the prohibition of the ` beggar 's opera ' remonstrate with the king and queen and be thereupon forbid the court she carry the poet to she house she may have be ridiculous but she have a warm generous heart ' i be now ' gay write to swift in 1729 ` in the duke of queensberry 's house and have be so ever since i leave hampstead where i be carry at a time that it be think i could not live a day i must acquaint you -lrb- because i know it will please you -rrb- that during my sickness i have many of the kindest proof of friendship particularly from the duke and duchess of queensberry who if i have be they nearest relation and dearest friend could not have treat I with more constant attendance then and they continue the same to I now ' the duchess appear to have be one of those wilful eccentric spoil child whom the world at once worship and ridicule : next to the countess of pomfret she be horace walpole 's pet aversion she be well describe as be ` very clever very whimsical and just not mad ' some of walpole 's touch be strongly confirmatory of this description for instance she grace give a ball order every one to come at six to sup at twelve and go away directly after : open the ball herself with a minuet to this ball she send strange invitation ` yet ' say horace ` except these flight the only extraordinary thing the duchess do be to do nothing extraordinary for i do not call it very mad that some pique happen between she and the duchess of bedford the latter have this distich send to she -- ` come with a whistle -- come with a call : come with good-will or come not at all ' ' i do not know whether what i be go to tell you do not border a little upon moorfield the gallery where they dance be very cold lord lorn george selwyn and i retire into a little room and sit comfortably by the fire the duchess look in say nothing and send a smith to take the hinge of the door oft we understand the hint -- leave the room -- and so do the smith the door ' ' i must tell you ' he add in another letter ` of a admirable reply of you acquaintance the duchess of queensberry : old lady granville lord carteret 's mother whom they call _ the queen-mother _ from take upon she to do the honor of she son 's power be press the duchess to ask she for some place for herself or friend and assure she that she would procure it be it what it would could she have pick out a fitter person to be gracious to the duchess make she a most grave curtsey and say indeed there be one thing she have set she heart on -- dear child how you oblige I by ask anything what be it tell I -- only that you would speak to my lord carteret to get I make lady of the bedchamber to the queen of hungary ' the duchess be therefore one of the dowager ` thick as flounder ' whose proximity be irritating to the fastidious bachelor there be however another kitty between whom and horace a tender friendship subsist : this be kitty clive the famous actress formerly kitty ruftar horace have give she a house on he estate which he call sometimes ` little strawberry hill ' and sometimes ` cliveden ' and here mr clive live with she brother mr ruftar until 1785 she form for she friend a sort of outer-home in which he pass he evening long have he admire she talent those be the day of the drama in all its glory : the opera be unfashionable there be horace write in 1742 on the 26th of may only two-and-forty people in the opera house in the pit and box : people be run to see ` miss lucy in town ' at drury lane and to admire mr clive in she imitation of the muscovite but the greatest crowd assemble to wonder at garrick in ` wine merchant turn player ' and great and small alike rush to goodman 's field to see he act all part and to laugh at he admirable mimicry it be perhaps somewhat in jealousy of the counter attraction that horace declare he see nothing wonderful in the acting of garrick though it be then heresy to say so ` now i talk of player ' he add in the same letter ` tell mr chute that he friend bracegirdle breakfast with I this morning ' horace delighted in such intimacy and in recall old time mr abingdon another charming and clever actress be also a denizen of twickenham which become the most fashionable village near the metropolis mr pritchard likewise be attract there but the proximity of the countess of suffolk who live at marble hill be the delight of a great portion of horace walpole 's life she reminiscence she anecdote she experience be valuable as well as entertaining to one who be for ever gather up material for history or for biography or for letter to absent friend in he own family he find little to cheer he : but if he hate one or two more especially -- and no one could hate more intensely than horace walpole -- it be he uncle lord wapole and he cousin that nobleman 's son whom he christen pigwiggin ` my monstrous uncle ' ` that old buffoon my uncle ' be term which occur in he letter and he speak of the bloody civil war between ` horatio walpole ' and ` horace walpole ' horatio walpole the brother of sir robert be create in June 1756 baron walpole of wolterton as a recompense for fifty year pass in the public service -- a honor which he only survive nine month he expire in February 1757 he death remove one subject of bitter dislike from the mind of horace but enough remain in the family to excite grief and resentment towards he own two brother robert earl of orford and edward walpole horace the younger as he be style in contradistinction to he uncle bear very little affection he feeling however for he nephew george who succeed he father as earl of orford in 1751 be more creditable to he heart yet he give a description of this ill-fated young man in he letter which show at once pride and disapprobation one linger with regret over the character and the destiny of this fine young nobleman whose existence be render miserable by frequent attack at interval of insanity never be there a handsomer a more popular a more engaging be than george third earl of orford when he appear at the head of the norfolk regiment of militia of which he be colonel even the great lord chatham break out into enthusiasm : -- ` nothing ' he write ` could make a better appearance than the two norfolk battalion lord orford with the front of mar himself and really the greatest figure under arm i ever see as the theme of every tongue ' he person and air horace walpole declare have a noble wildness in they : crowd follow the battalion when the king review they in hyde park and among the gay young officer in they scarlet uniform face with black in they buff waistcoat and gold button none be so conspicuous for martial bearing as lord onord although class by he uncle ` among the knight of shire who have never in they life shoot anything but woodcock ' but there be a peculiarity of character in the young peer which shock horace ` no man ' he say in one of he letter ` ever feel such a disposition to love another as i do to love he i flattered myself that he would restore some lustre to we house -- at least not let it totally sink but i be force to give he up and all my walpole view he have a good breeding and attention when he be with you that be even flattering he promise offer everything one can wish but this be all : the instant he leave you all the world be nothing to he he would not give himself the least trouble in the world to give any one satisfaction yet this be mere indolence of mind not of body : he whole pleasure be outrageous exercise ' ` he be ' in another place horace add ` the most selfish man in the world : without be in the least interested he love nobody but himself yet neglect every view of fortune and ambition yet ' he conclude ` it be impossible not to love he when one see he : impossible to esteem he when one think on he ' the young lord succeed to a estate deeply encumber both by he father and grandfather rush on the turf and involve himself still more in vain do horace the younger endeavor to secure for he the hand of miss nicholl a heiress with # 50000 and to that end place the young lady with horace the elder -lrb- lord walpole -rrb- at wolterton the scheme fail : the crafty old politician think he might as well benefit he own son as he nephew for he have himself claim on the houghton estate which he expect miss nicholl 's fortune might help to liquidate at length the insanity and recklessness display by he nephew -- the handsome martial george -- induce poor horace to take affair in he own hand he reflection on he pay a visit to houghton to look after the property there be pathetically express : -- ` here i be again at houghton ' he write in march 1761 ` and alone in this spot where -lrb- except two hour last month -rrb- i have not be in sixteen year think what a crowd of reflection here i be probably for the last time of my life : every clock that strike tell I i be a hour nearer to yonder church -- that church into which i have not yet have courage to enter where lie that mother on whom i doated and who doat on I there be the two rival mistress of houghton neither of whom ever wish to enjoy it there too be he who found its greatness -- to contribute to whose fall europe be embroil there he sleep in quiet and dignity while he friend and he foe -- rather he false ally and real enemy -- newcastle and bath be exhaust the dregs of they pitiful life in squabble and pamphlet when he look at the picture -- that famous houghton collection -- the surprise of horace be excessive accustomed to see nothing elsewhere but daub he gaze with ecstasy on they ` the majesty of italian idea ' he say ` almost sink before the warm nature of italian color alas do not i grow old ' as he linger in the gallery with mingled pride and sadness a party arrive to see the house -- a man and three woman in riding-dress -- who ` ride post ' through the apartment ' i could not ' he add ` hurry before they fast enough they be not so long in see the whole gallery as i could have be in one room to examine what i know by heart i remember formerly be often divert with this kind of _ seer _ they come ask what such a room be call in which sir robert lay write it down admire a lobster or a cabbage in a market piece dispute whether the last room be green or purple and then hurry to the inn for fear the fish should be over-dressed how different my sensation not a picture here but recall a history not one but i remember in down street or chelsea where queen and crowd admire they though see they as little as these traveller -lrb- 5 -rrb- -lrb- 5 : sir robert walpole purchase a house and garden at chelsea in 1722 near the college adjoining gough house -- cunningham 's ` london ' -rrb- after tea he stroll into the garden they tell he it be now call a _ pleasure-ground _ to horace it be a scene of desolation -- a floral nineveh ` what a dissonant idea of pleasure -- those grove those _ allées _ where i have pass so many charming moment be now strip up or overgrown -- many fond path i could not unravel though with a exact clue in my memory i meet two gamekeeper and a thousand hare in the day when all my soul be tune to pleasure and vivacity -lrb- and you will think perhaps it be far from be out of tune yet -rrb- i hate

walpole 's life the gifted and unfortunate thoma chatterton be bear at bristol in 1752 even from he birth fate seem to pursue he for he be a posthumous son : and if the loss of a father in the highest rank of life be severely feel how much more so be it to be deplore in those which be term the work class the friendless enthusiast be slow in learn to read but when the illuminate capital of a old book be present to he he quickly learn he letter this fact and he be teach to read out of a black-letter bible be say to have account for he facility in the imitation of antiquity pensive and taciturn

work with thread and use thread-papers now paper be at that time dear : dainty matron like tasty thread-papers a pretty set of thread-papers with bird or flower paint on each be no mean present for a friend chatterton a quiet child one day notice that he mother 's thread-papers be of no ordinary material they be make of parchment and on this parchment be some of the black-letter character by which he childish attention have be fix to he book the fact be that he uncle be sexton to the ancient church of st mary redcliffe at bristol and the parchment be the fruit of theft chatterton 's father have carry off from a room in the church certain ancient manuscript which have be leave about be originally abstract from what be call mr canynge 's coffin mr canynge a eminent merchant have rebuild st mary redcliffe in the reign of edward iv : and the parchment therefore be of some antiquity the antiquary groan over they loss in vain : chatterton 's father have cover he book with they he mother have use up the strip for thread-papers and thoma chatterton himself contrived to abstract a considerable portion also for he own purpose he be ingenious industrious a poet by nature and wonderful to say withal a herald by taste upon he nefarious possession he found a scheme of literary forgery purport to be ancient piece of poetry find in canynge 's chest and describe as be the production of

might now be see in deep thought walk in the meadow near redcliffe a marked admire poetic youth in 1769 chatterton write to horace walpole offering to send he some account of eminent painter who have flourish at bristol and at the same time mention the discovery of the poem and enclose some specimen in a subsequent letter he beg walpole to aid he in he wish to be free from he then servile condition and to be place in one more congenial to he pursuit in he choice of a patron poor chatterton make a fatal mistake the benevolence of horace be of a general kind and never descend to anything obscure or unappreciated there be a certain hardness in that nature of he which have so pleasant a aspect ` a artist ' he once say ` have he pencil -- a author he pen -- and the public must reward they as it please ' alas he forget how long it be before penury even ennoble by genius can make itself see hear approve repay : how vast be the influence of _ prestige _ how generous the hand which be extend to those in want even if in error all that horace do however be strictly correct : he show the poem to gray and mason who pronounce they forgery and he write a cold and reproving letter to the starve author : and no one could blame he : chatterton demand back he poem walpole be go to paris and forget to return they another letter come : the wound poet again demand they add that walpole would not have dare to use he so have he not be poor the poem be return in a blank cover : and here all walpole 's concern with thoma chatterton end all this happen in 1769 in August 1770 the remains of the unhappy youth be carry to the burial-ground of shoe lane workhouse near holborn he have swallow arsenic have linger a day in agony and then at the age of eighteen expire starvation have prompt

review there hem in by coach she find herself close to george ii and to lady yarmouth neither of they know she -- a circumstance which greatly affect the countess horace walpole be now desirous of grow old with dignity he have no wish ` to dress up a withered person nor to drag it about to public place ' but he be equally averse from ` sit at home wrap up in flannel ' to receive condolence from people he do not care for -- and attention from relation who be impatient for he death well might a writer in the ` quarterly review ' remark that we most useful lesson in read walpole 's letter be not only derive from he sound sense but from ` consider this man of the world full of information and sparkling with vivacity stretch on a sick bed and apprehend all the tedious languor of helpless

sit by he parlor fire happy with he _ wife _ near he resign and cheerful for he young friend he compose he ` reminiscence of the court of england ' he still write cheerfully of he physical state in which eyesight be perfect hearing little impaired and though he hand and foot be cripple he could use they and since he neither ` wish to box to wrestle nor to dance a hornpipe ' he be contented he

once too fondly prize he later year be disturb by the marriage of he niece marium waldegrave to the duke of gloucester : but the severest interruption to he peace be he own succession to a earldom in 1791 george earl of orford expire leave a estate encumber with debt and add to the bequest a series of lawsuit threaten to break down all remain comfort in the mind of the uncle who have already suffer so much on the young man 's account horace walpole disdain the honor which bring he such solid trouble with such empty title and for some time refuse to sign himself otherwise but ` uncle to the late earl of orford ' he be certainly not likely to be able to walk in he robe to the house of lord or to grace a levee however he thank god he be free from pain ` since all my finger be useless ' he write to hannah more ` and that i have only six hair leave i be not very much grieve at not be able to comb my head ' to hannah more he write in all sincerity refer to he elevation to the peerage : ` for the other empty metamorphosis that have happen to the outward man you do I justice in believe that it can do nothing but tease I it be be call name in one 's old age : ' in fact he reckon on be style ` lord methusalem ' he have live to hear of the cruel death of the once gay and high-born friend whom he have know in pari by the guillotine : he have live to execrate the monster who persecute the grandest heroine of modern time marie antoinette to madness he live to censure the infatuation of religious zeal in the birmingham riot ` be not the devil escape out of the swine and overrun the earth headlong ' -- he ask in one of he letter he have offer he hand and all the ambitious view which it open to each of the miss berry successively but they refuse to bear he name though they still

indeed have be astonish at the vast circulation of he letter and the popularity which have carry they into every aristocratic family in england it be remarkable that among the middle and lower class they be far less know for he be essentially the chronicler as well as the wit and beau of st jame 's of windsor and richmond at last he declare that he should ` be content with a sprig of rosemary ' throw on he when the parson of the parish commit he ` dust to dust ' the end of he now suffer existence be near at hand irritability one of the unpitied accompaniment of weakness seem to compete with the gathering cloud of mental darkness as the last hour draw on at interval there be flash of a wit that appear at that solemn moment hardly natural and that must have startle rather than pleased the watchful friend around he he become unjust in he fretfulness and those who love he most could not wish to see he survive the wreck of he intellect fever come on and he die on the 2nd of march 1797 he have collect he letter from he friend : these epistle be deposit in two box one mark with a a the other with a b the chest a be not to be open until the eldest son of he grandniece lady laura should attain the age of twenty-five the chest be find to contain memoirs and bundle of letter ready for publication it be singular at the sale of the effect at strawberry hill to see this chest with the mss in the clean _ horatian _ hand and to reflect how poignant would have be the anguish of the writer could he have see he gothic castle give up for fourteen day to all that could pain the living or degrade the dead peace to he mane prince of letter-writer prince companion of beau wit of the highest order without thy pen society in the eighteenth century would have be to we almost as dead as the _ beau monde _ of pompeius or the remains of etruscan leader of the ton let we not be ungrateful to we horace : we owe he more than we could ever have calculate on before we know he through he work : prejudiced he be not false cold he be rarely cruel egotistical he be seldom vain-glorious every age should have a horace walpole every country possess a chronicler so sure so keen to perceive so exact to delineate peculiarity manners character and event george selwyn a love of horror -- anecdote of selwyn 's mother -- selwyn 's college day -- orator henley -- selwyn 's blasphemous freak -- the profession of a wit -- the thirst for hazard -- reynold 's conversation-piece -- selwyn 's eccentricity and witticism -- a most important communication -- a amateur headsman -- the eloquence of indifference -- catch a housebreaker -- the family of the selwyn -- the man of the people -- selwyn 's parliamentary career -- true wit -- some of selwyn 's witty saying -- the sovereignty of the people -- on two kind of wit -- selwyn 's love for child -- mie mie the little italian -- selwyn 's little companion take from he -- he later day and death i have hear at time of maiden lady of a certain age who find pleasure in the affection of ` spotted snake with double tongue thorny hedge-hog newt and in live worm ' i frequently meet lady who think conversation lack interest without the recital of ` melancholy death ' ` fatal disease ' and ` mournful case ' _ on ne dispute pa les goûts _ and certainly the taste for the night side of nature seem immensely prevalent among the lower order -- in whom perhaps the terrible only can rouse from a sullen insensibility what happy people i always think to myself when i hear of the huge attendance on the last tragic performance at newgate how very little they can see of mournful and horrible in common life if they seek it out so eagerly and relish it so thoroughly when they find it i do not know for my own part _ gaudeamus _ i have always think that the text ` bless be they that mourn ' refer to the inner private life not to a perpetual display of sackcloth and ash but i know not i can understand the weeping-willow taste among people who have too little wit or too little christianity to be cheerful but it be a wonder to find the luxury of gloom unite to the keenest perception of the laughable in such a man as george selwyn if human being could be make pet like miss tabitha 's snake or toad selwyn would have fondle a hangman he love the noble art of execution and be a connoisseur of the execution of the art in childhood he must have decapitate he rocking-horse hang he doll in a miniature gallows and burnt he bauble at mimic stake the man whose calm eye be watch for the quiet sparkle that announce -- and only that ever do announce it -- the flash wit within the mind by a gay crowd of lounger at arthur 's might be find next day rummage among coffin in a damp vault glory in a mummy confess and prepare a live criminal pay any sum for a relic of a dead one or press eagerly forward to witness the die agony of a condemn man yet walpole and warner both bear the highest testimony to the goodness of he heart and it be impossible to doubt that he nature be as gentle as a woman 's there have be other instance of even educate man delight in scene of suffer but in general they character have be more or less gross they head more or less insensible the husband of madame récamier go daily to see the guillotine do its vile work during the reign of terror but then he be a man who never weep over the death of a friend the man who be devote to a little child whom he adopt and treat with the tenderest care be very different from m récamier -- and that he _ have _ a heart there be no doubt he be a anomaly and famous for be so though perhaps he well-known eccentricity be take advantage of by he witty friend and many a story father on selwyn which have no origin but in the brain of its narrator george augustus selwyn then famous for he wit and notorious for he love of horror be the second son of a country gentleman of matson in gloucestershire colonel john selwyn who have be a aide-de-camp of marlborough 's and afterwards a frequenter of the court of the first two george he inherit he wit chiefly from he mother mary the daughter of general farington or farringdon of the county of kent walpole tell we that she figure among the beauty of the court of the prince and princess of wale and be bedchamber-woman to queen caroline she character be not spotless for we hear of a intrigue which she own mistress impart in confidence to the duchess of orlean -lrb- the mother of the regent : they write on she tomb _ cy gist l'oisiveté _ because idleness be the _ mother _ of all vice -rrb- and which eventually find its way into the ` utrecht gazette ' it be mrs selwyn too who say to george ii that he be the last person she would ever have a intrigue with because she be sure he would tell the queen of it : it be well know that that very virtuous sovereign make he wife the confidante of he amours which be even more shameless than young de sévigné 's take advice from he mother on he intrigue with ninon de l'enclo she seem to have be repute a wit for walpole retail she _ mots _ as if they be worth it but they be not very remarkable : for instance when miss pelham lose a pair of diamond earring which she have borrow and try to faint when the loss be discover some one call for lavender-drop as a restorative ` pooh ' cry mrs selwyn ` give she diamond-drop ' george augustus be bear on the 11th of August 1719 walpole say that he know he at eight year old and as the two be at eton about the same time it be presume that they be contemporary there in fact a list of the boy there in 1732 furnish to eliot warburton contain the name of walpole selwyn edgecumbe and conway all in after-life intimate friend and correspondent from eton to oxford be the natural course and george be duly enter at hertford college he do not long grace alma mater for the _ grand tour _ have to be make and london life to be begin but he be there long enough to contract the usual oxford debt which he father consent to pay more than once it be amusing to find the son get dr newton to write he a contrite and respectful letter to the angry parent to liquidate the ` small account ' accumulate in london and oxford as early as 1740 three year later we find he in paris lead a gay life and write respectful letter to england for more money previously to this however he have obtain through he father the sinecure of clerk of the iron and surveyor of the melting at the mint a comfortable little appointment the duty of which be perform by deputy while its holder contented himself with honestly acknowledge the salary and dining once a week when in town with the officer of the mint and at the government 's expense so far the young gentleman go on well enough but in 1744 he return to england and he rather rampant character show itself in more than one disgraceful affair among the london show be orator henley a clergyman and clergyman 's son and a member of st john 's cambridge he have come to london about this time and institute a series of lecture on universal knowledge and primitive christianity he style himself a rationalist a title then more honorable than it be now and in grandiloquent language ` spout ' on religious subject to a audience admit at a shilling a-head on one occasion he announce a disputation among any two of he hearer offer to give a impartial hearing and judgment to both selwyn and the young lord carteret be prepared and stand up the one to defend the ignorance the other the impudence of orator henley himself so at least it be infer from a passage in d'israelus the elder the uproar that ensue can well be imagine henley himself make he escape by a back door he pulpit all gilt have be immortalize by pope as ` henley 's gilt tub ' in which -- ` imbrown would with native bronze lo henley stand tuning he voice and balance he hand ' the affair give rise to a correspondence between the orator and he young friend who doubtless come off best in the matter this be harmless enough but george 's next freak be not so excusable the circumstance of this affair be narrate in a letter from captain nicholson he friend to george selwyn and may therefore be rely on it appear that be at a certain club in oxford at a wine party with he friend george send to a certain silversmith 's for a certain chalice intrust to the shopkeeper from a certain church to be repair in a certain manner this be bring master george -- then be it remember not at the delicate and frivolous age of most oxford boy but at the mature one of six-and-twenty -- fill it with wine and hand it round use the sacred word ` drink this in remembrance of I ' this be a blasphemous parody of the most sacred rite of the church all selwyn could say for himself be that he be drunk when he do it the other plea that he do it in ridicule of the transubstantiation of the romish church could not stand at all and be most weakly put forward let oxford don be what they will let they put a stop to all religious inquiry and nearly expel adam smith for read hume 's ` essay on human nature ' let they be as many allege narrow-minded hypocritical and ignorant we can not charge they with wrong-dealing in expel the originator of such open blasphemy which nothing can be find to palliate and of which its perpetrator do not appear to repent rather complain that the treatment of the don be harsh the act of expulsion be of course consider in the same light by he numerous acquaintance many of whom condole with he on the occasion it be true the oxford don be often charge with injustice and partiality and too often the evidence be not sufficiently strong to excuse they judgment but in this the evidence be not deny only a palliative be put in which every one can see through the only injustice we can discover in this case be that the head of hart hall as hertford college be call seem to have be influence in pronounce he sentence of expulsion by certain previous _ suspicion _ have no bearing on the question before he which have be entertain by another set of tutor -- those of christchurch -- where selwyn have many friend and where probably enough he indulge in many collegian 's freak this knack of bring up a mere suspicion be truly characteristic of the oxford don and since the same head of this house -- dr newton -- acknowledge that selwyn be during he oxford career neither intemperate dissolute nor a gamester it be fair to give he the advantage of the doubt that the judgment on the evidence have be influence by the consideration of ` suspicion ' of former misdeed which have not be prove perhaps never commit know the after-life of the man we can however scarcely doubt that george have lead a fast life at the university and give cause for mistrust but one may ask whether don whose love of drinking and whose tendency to jest on the most solemn subject be well know even in the present day might not have treat selwyn less harshly for what be do under the influence of wine to this we be incline to reply that no punishment be too severe for profanation and that drunkenness be not a excuse but a aggravation selwyn threaten to appeal and take advice on the matter this as usual be vain many a expel man more unjustly treat than selwyn have talk of appeal in vain appeal to whom to what appeal against man who never acknowledge themselves wrong and who to maintain that they be right will listen to evidence which they can see be contradictory and which they know to be worthless a appeal from a oxford decision be as hopeless in the present day as it be in selwyn 's he wisely leave it alone but less wisely insist on reappear in oxford against the advice of all he friend whose character be lose if the ostracise man be see among they from this time he enter upon he ` profession ' that of a wit gambler club-lounger and man about town for these many character be all mixed in the one which be generally call ' a wit ' let we remember that he be good-hearted and not ill-intentioned though imbue with the false idea of he day he be not a great man but a great wit the locality in which the trade of wit be ply be then the club and the drawing-room of fashionable beauty the former be in selwyn 's youth still limit in the number of they member thirty constitute a large club and as the subscriber be all know to one another present a admirable field for display of mental power in conversation in fact the early club be nothing more than dining-society precisely the same in theory as we breakfast arrangement at oxford which be every whit as exclusive though not ballot for the ballot however and the principle of a single black ball suffer to negative a election be not only under such circumstance excusable but even necessary for the actual preservation of peace of course in a succession of dinner-party if any two member be at all oppose to one other the awkwardness would be intolerable in the present day two man may belong to the same club and scarcely meet even on the stair oftener than once or twice in a season gradually however in the place of the ` feast of reason and flow of soul ' and wine instead of the evening spend in toast talk empty bottle and fill head as in the case of the old kit-kat man take to the monstrous amusement of examine fate and on club-table the dice rattle far more freely than the glass though these latter be not necessarily abandon then come the thirst for hazard that bring man early in the day to try they fortune and thus make the club-room a lounge selwyn be a habitual frequenter of brooke ' brooke ' be perhaps the principal club of the day though ` white 's chocolate house ' be almost on a par with it but selwyn do not confine he attention solely to this club it be the fashion to belong to as many of they as possible and wilberforce mention no less than five to which he himself belong : brooke ' boodle 's white 's mile and evan 's in new palace yard and goosetree 's as they name imply these be all originally mere coffee-house keep by man of the above name one or two room then suffice for the requirement of a small party and it be not till the member be greatly increase that the coffee-house rise majestically to the dignity of a bow-window and be entirely and exclusively appropriate to the requirement of the club this be especially the case with white 's of which so many of the wit and talker of selwyn 's day be member who do not know that bow-window at the top of st jame 's street where there be sure about three or four in the afternoon to be at least three gentleman two old and one young stand to the exclusion of light within talk and contemplate the oft-repeated movement outside white 's be establish as early as 1698 and be thus one of the original coffee-house it be then keep by a man name arthur : here chesterfield game and talk to be succeed by gilly william charle townshend and george selwyn the old house be burn down in 1733 it be at white 's -- or as hogarth call it in he pictorial squib black 's -- that when a man fall dead at the door he be lug in and bet make as to whether he be dead or no the surgeon 's operation be oppose for fear of disturb the bet here too do george selwyn and charle townshend pit they wit against wit and here pelham pass all the time he be not force to devote to politics in short it be next to brooke ' the club of the day and perhaps in some respects have a greater renown than even that famous club and its play be as high in brooke ' and white 's selwyn appear with a twofold fame that of a pronouncer of _ bon-mot _ and that of a lover of horror he wit be of the quaintest order he be no inveterate talker like sydney smith no clever dissimulator like mr hook calmly almost sanctimoniously he utter those neat and tell saying which the next day pass over england as ` selwyn 's last ' walpole describe he manner admirably -- he eye turn up he mouth set primly a look almost of melancholy in he whole face reynold in he conversation-piece celebrate when in the strawberry collection and represent selwyn lean on a chair gilly william crayon in hand and dick edgecumbe by he side have catch the pseudo-solemn expression of he face admirably the ease of the figure one hand _ empochée _ the other hold a paper of epigram or what not the huge waistcoat with a dozen button and huge flap the ruffle sleeve the bob-wig all belong to the outer man but the calm quiet almost enquire face the look half of melancholy half of reproach and as the milesian would say the other half of sleek wisdom the long nose the prim mouth and join lip the elevated brow and beneath it the quiet contemplative eye contemplative not of heaven or hell but of this world as it have see it in its most worldly point of view yet twinkle with a flash thought of incongruity make congruous be the index of the inner man most of we wit it must have be see have have some other interest and occupation in life than that of ` make wit : ' some have be author some statesman some soldier some wild-rake and some player of trick : selwyn have no profession but that of _ diseur de bons mots _ for though he sit in the house ne take no prominent part in politics though he gamble extensively he do not game for the sake of money only thus he life be that merely of a london bachelor with few incident to mark it and therefore he memoir must resolve itself more or less into a series of anecdote of he eccentricity and list of he witticism he friend walpole give we a immense number of both not all of a first-rate nature nor many interesting in the present day selwyn calm as he be bring out he saying on the spur of the moment and they appropriateness to the occasion be one of they greatest recommendation a good say like a good sermon depend much on its delivery and lose much in print nothing less immortal than wit to take first however the eccentricity of he character and especially he love of horror we find anecdote by the dozen retail of he it be so well know that lord holland when die order he servant to be sure to admit mr selwyn if he call to enquire after he ` for if i be alive ' say he ' i shall be glad to see he and if i be dead he will be glad to see I ' the name of holland lead we to a anecdote tell by walpole selwyn be look over cornbury with lord abergavenny and mr frere ` who love one another a little ' and be disgust with the frivolity of the woman who could take no interest in anything worth see ` you do not know what you miss in the other room ' he cry at last peevishly ` why what ' -- ` why my lord holland 's picture ' -- ` well what be my lord holland to I ' ` do not you know ' whisper the wit mysteriously ` that lord holland 's body lie in the same vault in kensington church with my lord abergavenny 's mother ' ` lord she be so obliged ' say walpole ` and thank he a thousand time ' selwyn know the vault as thoroughly as old anthony wood know the brass the elder cragg have rise by the favor of marlborough whose footman he have be and he son be eventually a secretary of state arthur moore the father of jame moore smyth of whom pope write -- ` arthur whose giddy son neglect the law impute to I and my damned work the cause ' have wear a livery too when cragg get into a coach with he he exclaim ` why arthur i be always get up behind be not you ' walpole have relate this story to selwyn the latter tell he as a most important communication that arthur moore have have he coffin chained to that of he mistress ` lord how do you know ' ask horace ` why i see they the other day in a vault at st gile 's ' ` oh you servant mr selwyn ' cry the man who show the tomb at westminster abbey ' i expect to see _ you _ here the other day when the old duke of richmond 's body be take up ' criminal be of course include in he passion walpole affirm that he have a great share in bring lord dacre 's footman who have murder the butler to confess he crime in write the confession the ingenious plush coolly stop and ask how ` murder ' be spell but it matter little to george whether the criminal be alive or dead and he defend he eccentric taste with he usual wit when rally by some woman for go to see the jacobite lord lovat 's head cut off he retort sharply -- ' i make full amends for i go to see it sew on again ' he have indeed do so and give the company at the undertaker 's a touch of he favorite blasphemy for when the man of coffin have do he work and lay the body in its box selwyn imitate the voice of the lord chancellor at the trial mutter ` my lord lovat you may _ rise _ ' he say a better thing on the trial of a confederate of lovat 's that lord kilmarnock with whom the lady fall so desperately in love as he stand on he defense mr bethel who be famous for a _ hatchet-face _ be among the fair spectator : ` what a shame it be ' quoth the wit ` to turn she face to the prisoner before they be condemn ' terrible indeed be that instrument of death to those man who have in the heat of battle so gallantly meet sword and blunderbuss the slow sure approach of the day of the scaffold be a thousand time worse than the roar of cannon lord cromarty be pardon solely it be say from pity for he poor wife who be at the time of the trial far advance in pregnancy it be affirm that the child bear have a distinct mark of a axe on he neck _ credat judæus _ walpole use to say that selwyn never think but _ à la tête tranchée _ and that when he go to have a tooth draw he tell the dentist he would drop he handkerchief by way of signal certain it be that he do love a execution whatever he or he friend may have do to remove the impression of this extraordinary taste some better man than selwyn have have the same and macaulay accuse penn of a similar affection the best know anecdote of selwyn 's peculiarity relate to the execution of damien who be tear with red-hot pincers and finally quarter by four horse for the attempt to assassinate loui xv on the day fix george mingled with the crowd plainly dress and manage to press forward close to the place of torture the executioner observe he eagerly cry out ' _ faite place pour monsieur c'est un anglai et un amateur _ ' or as another version go he be ask if he be not himself a _ bourreau _ -- ' _ non monsieur _ ' he be say to have answer ' _ je n'aus pa cet honneur je ne suis qu'un amateur _ ' the story be more than apocryphal for selwyn be not the only person of whom it have be tell and he be even accuse accord to wraxall of go to execution in female costume george selwyn must have pass as a ` remarkably fine woman ' in that case it be only justice to he to say that the many story of he attend execution be suppose to be invention of sir charle hanbury william another wit and of chesterfield another and a rival in confirmation it be adduce that when the former have be relate some new account and a old friend of selwyn 's express he surprise that he have never hear the tale before the hero of it reply quietly ` no wonder at all for sir charle have just invent it and know that i will not by contradiction spoil the pleasure of the company he be so highly entertaining ' wit have be call ` the eloquence of indifference ' no one seem ever to have be so indifferent about everything but he little daughter as george selwyn he always however take up the joke and when ask why he have not be to see one charle fox a low criminal hang at tyburn answer quietly ' i make a point of never go to _ rehearsal _ ' selwyn 's love for this kind of thing to believe he most intimate friend horace walpole be quite a fact he friend relate that he even bargain for the high sheriff 's wand after it be break at the condemnation of the gallant lord but say ` that he behave so like a attorney the first day and so like a pettifogger the second that he would not take it to light he fire with ' the state trial of course interested george more than any other in he eventless life he dine after the sentence with the celebrated lady townshend who be so devoted to lord kilmarnock -- ` pity by gentle mind kilmarnock die ' -- johnson that she be say to have even stay under he window when he be in prison but he treat she anxiety with such lightness that the lady burst into tear and ` fling up-stair ' ` george ' write walpole to montague ` cooly take mr dorca she woman and bid she sit down to finish the bottle -- and pray say dorca do you think my lady will be prevail upon to let I go and see the execution i have a friend that have promise to take care of I and i can lie in the tower the night before could she have talk so pleasantly to selwyn ' he contemporary certainly believe in he love for newgatism for when walpole have catch a housebreaker in a neighbor 's area he immediately despatch a messenger to white 's for the philo-criminalist who be sure to be play at the club any time before daylight it happen that the drawer at the ` chocolate-house ' have be himself lately rob and therefore steal to george with fear and tremble and mutter mysteriously to he ` mr walpole 's compliment and he have get a housebreaker for you ' of course selwyn obey the summons readily and the event conclude as such event do nine time out of ten with a quiet capture and much ado about nothing the selwyn be a powerful family in gloucestershire own a great deal of property in the neighborhood of gloucester itself the old colonel have represent that city in parliament for many year on the 5th of November 1751 he die he eldest son have go a few month before he this son have be also at eton and be a early friend of horace walpole and general conway he death leave george sole heir to the property and very much he seem to have need the heritage the property of the selwyn lay in the picturesque district of the northern cotswold anybody who have pass a day in the dull city of gloucester which seem to break into anything like life only at a election lie dormant in the interval have be glad to rush out to enjoy air and a fine view on robin hood 's hill a favorite walk with the worthy citizen though what the jovial archer of merry sherwood have to do with it or whether he be ever in gloucestershire at all i profess i know not walpole describe the hill with humorous exaggeration ` it be lofty enough for a alp yet be a mountain of turf to the very top have wood scatter all over it spring that long to be cascade in many place of it and from the summit it beat even sir george littleton 's view by have the city of gloucester at its foot and the severn widen to the horizon ' on the very summit of the next hill chosen-down be a solitary church and the legend saith that the good people who build it do so originally at the foot of the steep mount but that the virgin mary carry up the stone by night till the builder in despair be compel to erect it on the top other attribute the mysterious act to a very different personage and with apparently more reason for the position of the church must keep many a old sinner from hear service at matson then on robin hood 's hill the selwyn live walpole say that the ` house be small but neat king charle lay here at the seige and the duke of york with typical fury hack and hew the window-shutter of he chamber as a memorandum of he be there and here be the very flowerpot and counterfeit association for which bishop sprat be take up and the duke of marlborough send to the tower the reservoir on the hill supply the city the late mr selwyn govern the borough by they -- and i believe by some wine too ' probably or at least by some beer if the modern elector be not much alter from they forefather besides this important estate the selwyn have another at ludgershall and they influence there be so complete that they might fairly be say to _ give _ one seat to any one they choose with such double barrel george selwyn be of course a great gun in the house but he interest lay far more in piquet and pleasantry than in politics and patriotism and he be never fire off with any but the blank cartridge of he two vote he parliamentary career begin in 1747 last more than forty year yet be entirely without distinction he however amuse both party with he wit and by _ snore in unison _ with lord north this must have be try to mr speaker cornwall who be longing no doubt to snore also and dare not he be probably the only speaker who preside over so August a assembly as we english parliament with a pewter pot of porter at he elbow send for more and more to bellamy 's till he heavy eye close of themselves a modern mp carry back by some fancy to ` the senate ' of those day might reasonably doubt whether he guide have not take he by mistake to some coal-hole or cider-cellar preside over by some former baron nicholson and whether the furious eloquence of messr fox pitt and burke be not get up for the amusement of a audience admit at sixpence a head selwyn 's political joke be the delight of bellamy 's he say that fox and pitt remind he of hogarth 's idle and industrious apprentice when ask by some one as he saunter out of the house -- ` be the house up ' he reply ` no but burke be ' the length of burke 's elaborate speak essay be proverbial and obtain for he the name of the ` dinner-bell ' fox be talk one day at brooke ' of the advantageous peace he have make with france and that he have even induce that country to give up the _ gum _ trade to england ` that charle ' quoth selwyn sharply ' i be not at all surprise at for have draw you _ tooth _ they would be d -- d fool to quarrel with you about gum ' fox be often the object of he good-natured satire as every one know he boast be to be call ` the man of the people ' though perhaps he care as little for the great unwashed as for the wealth and happiness of the waiter at he club ' every one know too what a dissolute life he lead for many year selwyn 's sleepiness be well know he sleep in the house he sleep after lose # 8oo ` and with as many more before he ' upon the gaming-table with the dice-box ` stamped close to he ear ' he sleep or half-slept even in conversation which he seem to have catch by fit and start thus it be that word he hear suggest different sens partly from be only dimly associate with the subject on the _ tapi _ so when they be talk around of the war and whether it should be a sea war or a continent war selwyn wake up just enough to say ' i be for a sea war and a _ continent _ admiral ' when fox have ruin himself and a subscription for he be talk of some one ask how they think ` he would take it ' -- ` take it ' cry selwyn suddenly light up ` why _ quarterly _ to be sure ' he parliamentary career be then quite uneventful but at the dissolution in 1780 he find that he security at gloucester be threaten he be not whig enough for that constituency and have throughout support the war with america he offer himself of course but be reject with scorn and force to fly for a seat to ludgershall walpole write to lady ossory : ` they ' -lrb- the gloucester people -rrb- ` hang he in effigy and dress up a figure of mie-mie ' -lrb- he adopt daughter -rrb- ` and pin on its breast these word allude to the gallows : -- this be what i tell you you would come to ' from gloucester he go to ludgershall where he be receive by ringing of bell and bonfire ` be drive out of my capital ' say he ` and come into that country of turnip where i be adore i seem to be arrive in my hanoverian dominion ' -- no bad hit at george ii for ludgershall he sit for many year with sir nathaniel wraxall whose ` memoirs ' be better know than trust as colleague that writer say of selwyn that he be ` thoroughly well verse in we history and master of many curious as well as secret anecdote relative to the house of stuart and brunswick ' another _ bon-mot _ not in connection with politics be report by walpole as incomparable ' lord george gordon ask he if the ludgershall elector would take he -lrb- lord george -rrb- for ludgershall add ` if you would recommend I they would choose I if i come from the coast of africa ' -- ` that be accord to what part of the coast you come from they would certainly if you come from the guinea coast ' ` now madam ' write he friend ` be not this true inspiration as well as true wit have any one ask he in which of the four quarter of the world guinea be situate could he have tell ' walpole do not perhaps know master george thoroughly -- he be neither so ignorant nor so indifferent as he seem he manner get he the character of be both but he be a still fool that run deep though selwyn do little with he two vote he make they pay and in addition to the post in the mint get out of the party he support those of registrar to the court of chancery in the island of barbado a sinecure do by deputy surveyor of the crown land and paymaster to the board of work the wit of white 's add the title of ` receiver-general of waif and stray joke ' it be say that he hostility to sheridan arise from the latter have lose he the office in the work in 1782 when burke 's bill for reduce the civil list come into operation but this be not at all probable as he dislike be show long before that period apropo of the board of work walpole give another anecdote on one occasion in 1780 lord george gordon have be the only opponent on a division selwyn afterwards take he in he carriage to white 's ' i have bring ' say he ` the whole opposition in my coach and i hope one coach will always hold they if they mean to take away the board of work ' undoubtedly selwyn 's wit want the manner of the man to make it so popular for as we read it it be often rather mild to string a list of they together : -- lady coventry show he she new dress all cover with spangle as large as shilling ` bless my soul ' say he ` you 'll be change for a guinea ' fox debtor and bankrupt as he be have take lodgings with fitzpatrick at a oilman 's in piccadilly every one pity the landlord who would certainly be ruin ` not a bit of it ' quoth george ` he 'll have the credit of keep at he house the finest pickle in london ' sometimes there be a good touch of satire on he time when ` high life below stair ' be first act selwyn vow he would go and see it for he be sick of low life above stair and when a waiter at he club have be convict of felony ` what a horrid idea ' say he ` the man will give of _ we _ in newgate ' dine with bruce the abyssinian traveller he hear he say in answer to a question about musical instrument in the east ' i believe i see one _ lyre _ there ' -- ` ay ' whisper the wit to he neighbor ` and there be one less since he leave the country ' bruce share the traveller ' reputation of draw the long-bow to a very considerable extent two of selwyn 's best _ mots _ be about one of the foley family who be so deeply in debt that they have ` to go to texa ' or boulogne to escape the money-lender ` that ' quoth selwyn ` be a _ pass-over _ which will not be much relish by the jew ' and again when it be say that they would be able to cancel they father 's old will by a new-found one he profanely indulge in a pun far too impious to be repeat in we day however it may have be relish in selwyn 's time a picture call ` the daughter of pharaoh ' in which the princess royal and she attendant lady figure as the saver of mose and she handmaid be be exhibit in 1782 at a house opposite brooke ' and be to be the companion-piece to copley 's ` death of chatham ' george say he could recommend a better companion to wit -- the ` son of pharaoh ' at the opposite house it be scarcely necessary to explain that pharaoh or faro be the most popular game of hazard then play walk one day with lord pembroke and be besiege by a troop of small chimney-climber beg -- selwyn after bear they importunity very calmly for some time suddenly turn round and with the most serious face thus address they -- ' i have often hear of the sovereignty of the people i suppose you highness be in court mourning ' we can well imagine the effect of this sedate speech on the astonished youngster pelham 's truculency be well know walpole and he friend go to the sale of he plate in 1755 ` lord ' say the wit ` how many toad have be eat off these plate ' -lrb- illustration : selwyn acknowledge the sovereignty of the people -rrb- the joke be not always very delicate when in the middle of the summer of 1751 lord north who have be twice marry before espouse the widow of the earl of rockingham who be fearfully stout selwyn suggest that she have be keep in ice for three day before the wedding so too when there be talk of another _ embonpoint _ personage go to america during the war he remark that she would make a capital _ breast _ - work one of the few epigram he ever write -- if not the only one of which there be some doubt -- be in the same spirit it be on the discovery of a pair of shoe in a certain lady 's bed -- well may suspicion shake its head -- well may clorinda 's spouse be jealous when the dear wanton take to bed she very shoe -- because they be fellow such be a few specimen of george selwyn 's wit and dozen more be disperse though walpole 's letter as eliot warburton remark they do not give we a very high idea of the humor of the period but two thing must be take into consideration before we deprecate they author 's title to the dignity and reputation he enjoy so abundantly among he contemporary they be not necessarily the _ best _ specimen that might have be give if more of he _ mots _ have be preserve and they effect on he listener depend more on the manner of delivery than on the matter that they be improvise and unpremeditated be another important consideration it be quite unfair to compare they as warburton do with the hebdomadal trash of ` punch ' though perhaps they would stand the comparison pretty well it be one thing to force wit with plenty of time to invent and meditate it -- another to have so much wit within you that you can bring it out on any occasion one thing to compose a good fancy for _ money _ -- another to utter it only when it flash through the brain but it matter little what we in the present day may think of selwyn 's wit for conversation be spoil by bottle and should be draw fresh when want selwyn 's companion -- all man of wit more or less affirm he to be the most amusing man of he day and that be all the part he have to play no real wit ever hope to _ talk _ for posterity and write wit be of a very different character to the more sparkling if less solid creation of a moment we have see selwyn in many point of view not all very creditable to he first expel from oxford for blasphemy next a profess gambler and the associate of man who lead fashion in those day it be true but then it be very bad fashion then as a lover of hangman a wit and a lounger there be reason to believe that selwyn though less openly reprobate than many of he associate be in he quiet way just as bad as any of they if we except the duke of queensberry he intimate friend or the disgusting ` franciscan ' of medmenham abbey of whom though not the founder nor even a member he be in a manner the suggester in he blasphemy but selwyn 's real character be only see in profile in all these account he have at the bottom of such vice to which he position and the fashion of the day introduce he a far better heart than any of he contemporary and in some respects a kind of simplicity which be endearing he be neither knave nor fool he be not a voluptuary like he friend the duke nor a continued drunkard like many other ` fine gentleman ' with whom he mix nor a cheat though a gambler nor a sceptic like he friend walpole nor a blasphemer like the medmenham set though he have once parody profanely a sacred rite nor be he steep in debt as fox be nor do he appear to have be a practiced seducer as too many of he acquaintance be not that these negative quality be to he praise but if we look at the age and the society around he we must at least admit that selwyn be not one of the worst of that wicked set but the most please point in the character of the old bachelor -- for he be _ too much _ of a wit ever to marry -- be he affection for child -- not he own that be not avowedly he own for it be often suspect that the little one he take up so fondly bear some relationship to he and there can be little doubt that selwyn like everybody else in that evil age have he intrigue he do not die in he sin and that be almost all we can say for he he give up gaming in time protest that it be the bane of four much better thing -- health money time and think for the last two perhaps he care little before he death he be say to have be a christian which be a decide rarity in the fashionable set of he day walpole answer when ask if he be a freemason that he never have be _ anything _ and probably most of the man of the time would if they have have the honesty have say the same they be not atheist professedly but they neither believe in nor practiced christianity he love for child have be call one of he eccentricity it would be a hard name to give it if he have not be a club-lounger of he day i have sufficient faith in human nature to trust that two-third of the man of this country have that most amiable eccentricity but in selwyn it amount to something more than in the ordinary paterfamilias : it be almost a passion he be almost motherly in he celibate tenderness to the little one to whom he take a fancy this affection he show to several of the child son or daughter of he friend but to two especially anne coventry and marium fagnianus the former be the daughter of the beautiful marium gun who become countess of coventry nanny as he call she be four year old when she mother die and from that time he treat she almost as he own child but mie-mie as the little italian be call be far more favored whoever may have be the child 's father she mother be a rather beautiful and very immoral woman the wife of the marchese fagnianus she seem to have desire to make the most for she daughter out of the extraordinary rivalry of the two english ` gentleman ' and they be admirably take in by she whatever the truth may have be selwyn 's love for child show itself more strongly in this case than in any other and oddly enough it seem to have begin when the little girl be at a age when child scarcely interest other man than they father -- in short in infancy she parent allow he to have the sole charge of she at a very early age when they return to the continent but in 1777 the marchioness be then in brussels claim she daughter back again though less it seem from any great anxiety on the child 's account than because she husband 's parent in milan object to they grand-daughter be leave in england and also not a little from fear of the voice of mr grundy selwyn seem to have use all kind of argument to retain the child and a long correspondence take place which the marchesa begin with ` my very dear friend ' and many affectionate expression and conclude with a haughty ` sir ' and she opinion that he conduct be ` devilish ' the affair be therefore clearly a violent quarrel and selwyn be oblige at last to give up the child he have a carriage fit up for she expressly for she journey make out for she a list of the best hotel on she route send he own confidential man-servant with she and treasured up among he ` relic ' the childish little note in a large scrawl hand which mie-mie send he still more curious be it to see this complete man of the world this gambler for many year this club-lounger drinker associate of well-dressed blasphemer of franciscan of medmenham abbey devote not he money only but he very time to this mere child leave town in the height of the season for dull matson that she might have fresh air quit he hot club-room he night spend at the piquet-table and the rattle of the dice for the quiet pleasant terrace of he country-house where he would hold the little innocent mie-mie by she tiny hand as she look up into he shrivelled dissipate face quit the interchange of wit the society of the townshend the walpole the williams the edgecumbe all the jovial keen wisdom of gilly and dick and horace and charle as they call one another for the meaningless prattle the merry laughter of this half-english half-italian child it redeem selwyn in we eye and it may have do he real good : nay he must have feel a keen refreshment in this change from vice to innocence and we understand the misery he express when the old bachelor 's one little companion and only pure friend be take away from he he love for the child be well know in london society and of it do sheridan 's friend take advantage when they want to get selwyn out of brooke ' to prevent he black-balling the dramatist the anecdote be give in the next memoir in he later day selwyn

last in 1791 at the age of seventy-two he leave a fortune which be not contemptible : # 33000 of it be to go to mie-mie -- by this time a young lady -- and as the duke of queensberry at he death leave

fling at thee almost we must confess it thy very fault at least those quality which seem to have be thy glory and thy ruin : which bring thee into temptation to which hadst thou be less brilliant less bountiful thou hadst never be draw what be it that disarm we when we review thy life and wring from we a tear when we should utter a reproach thy punishment that bitter miserable end that long battle with poverty debt disease all bring on by thyself that abandonment in the hour of need more bitter than they all that awaken to the terrible truth of the hollowness of man and rottenness of the world -- surely this be enough : surely we may hope that a pardon follow but now let we view thee in thy upward flight the genius the wit the monarch of mind this great man this wonderful genius this eloquent senator this most applaud dramatist be -- hear it oh ye boy and fling it triumphantly in the face of you pedagogue -- sheridan at you age be a dunce this be the more extraordinary inasmuch as he father mother and grandfather be all celebrate for they quick mental power the last in fact dr sheridan be a successful and eminent schoolmaster the intimate friend of dean swift and a author he be a irish man and a wit and would seem to have be a jacobite to boot for he be deprive of a chaplaincy he hold under government for preach on king george 's birthday a sermon have for its text ` sufficient for the day be the evil thereof ' sheridan 's mother again -- a eccentric extraordinary woman -- write novel and play among the latter ` the discovery ' which garrick say be ` one of the best comedy he ever read ' and sheridan 's father tom sheridan be famous in connection with the stage where he be so long the rival of david garrick bear of such parent in September 1751 richard brinsley sheridan be send in due course to harrow where that famous old pedant dr parr be at that time one of the master the doctor have himself describe the lazy boy in whose face he discover the latent genius and whom he attempt to inspire with a love of greek verb and latin verse by make he ashamed of he ignorance but richard prefer english verse and no verb and the doctor fail he do not even at that period cultivate elocution of which he father be so good a master though dr parr remember one of he sister on a visit to harrow recite in accordance with she father 's teach the well-known line -- ' _ none _ but the brave none but the _ brave _ none _ but _ the brave deserve the fair but the real mind of the boy who would not be a scholar show itself early enough he have only just leave harrow when he begin to display he literary ability he have form at school the intimate acquaintance of halhed afterwards a distinguished indianist a man of like taste with himself he have translate with he some of the poem of theocritus the two boy have revel together in boyish dream of literary fame -- ah those boyish dream so often we noblest -- so seldom realize so often alas the aspiration to which we can look back as we purest and best and which make we bitterly regret that they be but dream and now when young halhed go to oxford and young sheridan to join he family at bath they continue these ambitious project for a time and lay out they fancy at full usury over many a work destine never to see the finger of the printer 's devil among these be a farce or rather burlesque which show immense promise and which oddly enough resemble in its cast the famous ` critic ' which follow it later it be call ` jupiter ' and turn chiefly on the story of ixion -- 'em brace cloud ixion like ' the lover of juno who catch a cold instead of the queen of heaven and who accord to the classical legend tortured for ever on a wheel be in this production to be condemn for ever to trundle the machine of a ` needy knife-grinder ' amid a grand musical chorus of ` razor scissors and penknife to grind ' this piece be amusing enough and clever enough though it betray repeatedly the youthfulness of its author but less so they next attempt a weekly periodical to be call ` hernan 's miscellany ' of which sheridan write or be to write pretty nearly the whole none but the first number be ever complete and perhaps we need not regret that no more follow it but it be touch to see these two young man both feel they power confident in they and sun they halcyon 's wing in the happy belief that they be those of the eagle longing eagerly earnestly for the few poor guinea that they hope from they work halh indeed write diligently but he colleague be not true to the contract and though the hope of gold stimulate he -- for he be poor enough -- from time to time to a great effort he be always ` begin ' and never complete the only real product of these unite labor be a volume of epistle in verse from the greek of a poor writer of late age aristaenetus this volume which do little credit to either of its parent be positively print and publish in 1770 but the rich harvest of fame and shilling which they expect from it be never gather in yet the book excite some little notice the incognito of its author induce some critic to palm it even on such a man as dr johnson other praise other sneer at it in the young man it raise hope only to dash they but its failure be not so utter as to put the idea of literary success entirely out of they head nor its success sufficient to induce they to rush recklessly into print and thus strangle they fame in its cradle let it fail be richard sheridan 's thought he have now a far more engrossing ambition in a word he be in love yes he be in love for a time -- only for a time and not truly but be it remember sheridan 's evil day have not commence he sow he wild oats late in life -- alack for he -- and he never finish sowing they he be not the viciousness of nature but the corruption of success ` in all time of wealth good lord deliver we ' what prayer can wild unrestrained unheeding genius utter with more fervency i own genius be rarely in love there be a egotism almost a selfishness about it that will not stoop to such common worship woman know it and often prefer the blunt honest common-place soldier to the wild erratic poet genius grand as it be be unsympathetic it demand higher -- the highest joy genius claim to be love but to love be too much to ask it and yet at this time sheridan be not a mature genius when he development come he cast off this very love for which he have fight manoeuvred struggle and be unfaithful to the very wife whom he have nearly die to obtain miss linley be one of a family who have be call ' a nest of nightingale ' young lady who practice elaborate piece and sing simple ballad in the voice of a white mouse know the name of linley well for age the linley have be the bard of england -- composer musician singer always popular always english sheridan 's love be one of the most renowned of the family but the ` maid of bath ' as she be call be as celebrate for she beauty as for the magnificence of she voice when sheridan first know she she be only sixteen year old -- very beautiful clever and modest she be a singer by profession living at bath as sheridan only three year older than herself also be but attend concert oratorio and so forth in other place especially at oxford she adorer be legion and the oxford boy especially -- always in love as they be -- be among they halh be among these last and in the innocence of he heart confide he passion to he friend dick sheridan at sixteen the young beauty begin she conquest a rich old wiltshire squire with a fine heart as golden as he guinea offer to or for she and be readily accept but ` cecilium ' as she be always call could not sacrifice herself on the altar of duty and she privately tell he that though she honor and esteem she could never love he the old gentleman prove he worth do he storm do he hold she to she engagement do he shackle himself with a young wife who would only learn to hate he for he persinacity not a bit of it he act with a generosity which should be hold up as a model to all old gentleman who be wild enough to fall in love with girl of sixteen he know mr linley who be delighted with the match would be furious if it be break off he offer to take on himself all the blame if the breach and to satisfy the angry parent settle # 1000 on the daughter the offer be accept and the trial for breach of promise with which the père linley have threaten mr long be of course withhold mr long afterwards present mr sheridan with # 3000 the ` maid of bath ' be now a heiress as well as a fascinating beauty but she face and she voice be the chief enchantment with she ardent and youthful adorer the sheridan have settle in mead street in that town which be celebrate for its gamble its scandal and its unhealthy situation at the bottom of a natural basin well might the roman build they bath there : it will take more water than even bath supplies to wash out its folly and iniquity it certainly be strange how wash and card go together one would fancy there be no bath in eden for wherever there be bath there we find idleness and all its attendant vice the linley be soon intimate with the sheridan and the maid of bath add to she adorer both richard and he elder brother charle only just as at harrow every one thought richard a dunce and he disappoint they so at bath no one think richard would fall in love and he _ do _ disappoint they -- none more so than charle he brother and halh he bosom friend as for the latter he be almost mad in he devotion and certainly extravagant in he expression he describe he passion by a clever but rather disagreeable simile which sheridan who be a most disgraceful plagiarist though he have no need to be so afterwards adopt as he own ` just as the egyptian pharmacist ' write halh in a latin letter in which he describe the power of miss linley 's voice over he spirit ` be wont in embalm a dead body to draw the brain out through the ear with a crooked hook this nightingale have draw out through mine ear not my brain only but my heart also ' then among other of she devotee be norris the singer and mr watt a rich gentleman-commoner who have also meet she at oxford surely with such and other rival the chance of the quiet unpretending undemonstrative boy of nineteen be small but no miss linley be foolish enough to be captivate by genius and charm by such poem as the quiet boy write to she of which this be perhaps one of the prettiest : ` dry that tear my gentlest love be hush would that struggle sigh nor season day nor fate shall prove more fix would more true than i hush would be that sigh be dry that tear cease boding doubt cease anxious fear : dry be that tear ` ask ` st thou how long my love will stay when all that be new be past how long ah delium can i say how long my life will last dry be that tear be hush would that sigh at least i 'll love thee till i die : hush would be that sigh ` and do that think affect thee too the thought of sylvio 's death that he who only breath would for you must yield that faithful breath hush would be that sigh be dry that tear nor let we lose we heaven here : be dry that tear ' the many adorer have not the remotest suspicion of this devotion and ` give she ' to this that or the other eligible personage but the villanous conduct of a scoundrel soon bring the matter to a crisis the whole story be as romantic as it could be in a three-volume novel critic always so just and acute in they judgment would call it far-fetched improbable unnatural in short anything but what should be the plot of the pure ` domestic english story ' yet here it be with almost dramatic effect the simple tale of what really befel one of we most celebrated man yes to complete the fiction-like aspect of the affair there be even a ` captain ' in the matter -- as good a villain as ever shine in short hose and cut doublet at the ` strand ' or ` victorium ' captain matthew be a married man and a very naughty one he be a intimate friend of the linley and want to push he intimacy too far in short ` not to put too fine a point on it ' -lrb- too fine a point be precisely what never _ be _ put -rrb- he attempt to seduce the pretty innocent girl and not dismayed at one failure go on again and again ` cecilium ' know the temper of linley père be afraid to expose he to she father and with a course which we of the present day can not but think strange if nothing more disclose the attempt of she persecutor to no other than she own lover richard brinsley sheridan strange want of delicacy undoubtedly and yet we can excuse the poor songstress with a father who seek only to make money out of she talent and no other relation to confide in but richard brinsley long she lover now resolve to be both she protector and she husband he persuade she to fly to france under cover of enter a convent he induce he sister to lend he money out of that provide for the housekeeping at home hire a post-chaise and send a sedan-chair to she father 's house in the crescent to convey she to it and waft she off to town thence after a few adroit lie on the part of sheridan they sail to dunkirk and there he persuade she to become he wife she consent and they be knot together by a oblige priest accustom to these runaway match from _ la perfide albion _ the irate parent linley follow recapture he daughter and bring she back to england meanwhile the elopement excited great agitation in the good city of bath and among other the villain of the story the gallant captain matthew post richard brinsley as ' a scoundrel and a liar ' the then polite method of express disgust home come richard in the wake of miss linley who rejoice in the unromantic praenoman of ` betsy ' to she angry parent and find matter have be run high in he short absence a duel with matthew seem to have be the natural consequence and up richard post to london to fight it matthew play the craven -- sheridan the impetuous lover they meet fight seize one another 's sword wrestle fall together and wound each other with the stump of they rapier in true chevy-chase fashion matthew who have behave in a cowardly manner in the first affair seek to retrieve he honor by send a second challenge again the rival -- well represent in ` the rival ' afterwards produce -- meet at kingsdown mr matthew draw mr sheridan advance on he at first : mr matthew in turn advance fast on mr sheridan upon which he retreat till he very suddenly run in upon mr matthew lay himself exceedingly open and endeavor to get hold of mr matthew ' sword mr matthew receive he at point and i believe disengage he sword from mr sheridan 's body and give he another wound the same scene be now enact and a _ combat à l'outrance _ take place end in mutual wound and fortunately no one dead poor little betsy be at oxford when all this take place on she return to bath she hear something of it and unconsciously reveal the secret of she private marriage claim the right of a wife to watch over she wounded husband then come the _ dénouement _ old tom sheridan reject he son the angry linley would have reject he daughter but for she honor richard be send off into essex and in due time the couple be legally marry in england so end a wild romantic affair in which sheridan take a desperate but not altogether honorable part but the dramatist get more out of it than a pretty wife like all true genius he employ he own experience in the production of he work and draw from the very event of he life some hint or touch to enliven the character of he imagination surely the bravado and cowardice of captain matthew who on the first meeting in the park be describe as find all kind of difficulty in the way of they fight object now to the ground as unlevel now to the presence of a stranger who turn out to be a officer and very politely move off when request who in short delay the event as long as possible must have supply the idea of bob acre while the very conversation of which we have no record may have give he some of those hint of character which make the ` rival ' so successful that play -- he first -- be write in 1774 it fail on its first appearance owe to the bad acting of the part of sir lucius o'trigger by mr lee but when another actor be substitute the piece be at once successful and act with overflow house all over the country how could it be otherwise it may have be exaggerate far-fetched unnatural but such character as sir anthony absolute sir lucius bob acre lydium languish and most of all mr malaprop so admirably conceive and so carefully and ingeniously work out could not but be admire they have become household word they be even now we standard of ridicule and be they natural or not these last eighty year have change the world so little that malaprop and acrese may be find in the range of almost any man 's experience and in every class of society sheridan and he divine betsy be now live in they own house in that dull little place orchard street portman square then a aristocratic neighborhood and he be diligent in the production of essay pamphlet and farce many of which never see the light while other fall flat or be not calculate to bring he any fame what great author have not experience the same disappointment what man would ever be great if they allow such check to damp they energy or be turn back by they from the course in which they feel that they power lie but he next work the opera of ` the duenna ' have a yet more signal success and a run of no less than seventy-five night at covent garden which put garrick at drury lane to he wit 's end to know how to compete with it old linley himself compose the music for it and to show how thus a family could hold the stage garrick actually play off the mother against the son and revive mr sheridan 's comedy of ` the discovery ' to compete with richard sheridan 's ` duenna ' the first night ` the rival ' be bring out at bath come sheridan 's father who as we have see have refuse to have anything to say to he son it be related as a instance of richard 's filial affection that during the representation he place himself behind a side-scene opposite to the box in which he father and sister sit and gaze at they all the time when he return to he house and wife he burst into tear and declare that he feel it too bitter that he alone should have be forbid to speak to those on whom he have be gaze all the night during the following year this speculative man who marry on nothing but he brain and have no capital no wealthy friend in short nothing whatever suddenly appear in the most mysterious manner as a capitalist and lay down he # 10000 in the coolest and quietest manner and for what for a share in the purchase of garrick 's moiety of the patent of drury lane the whole property be worth # 70000 garrick sell he half for # 35000 of which old mr linley contribute # 10000 dr ford # 15000 and penniless sheridan the balance where he get the money nobody know and apparently nobody ask it be pay and he enter at once on the business of proprietor of that old house where so many a roscius have strut and declaim with more or less fame so many a walk gentleman do he five shilling ' worth of polite comedy so many a tinsel king degrade the ` legitimate drama ' in the most illegitimate manner and whose glory be extinguish with the reign of macready when we be boy _ nous autre _ the first piece he contribute to this stage be ' a trip to scarborough ' which be only a species of ` family edition of vanbrugh 's play ` the relapse ' but in 1777 he reach the acme of he fame in ` the school for scandal ' but alack and alas for these sensual day when it be too much trouble to think and people go to the play if they go at all to feast they eye and ear not they mind can any sensible person believe that if ` the school for scandal ' teem as it do with wit satire and character finer and truer than in any play produce since the day of ben jonson massinger and marlowe be set on the board of the haymarket at this day as a new piece by a author of no very high celebrity it would draw away a single admirer from the flummery in oxford street the squeak at covent garden or the broad exaggerated farce at the adelphus or olympic no : it may still have its place on the london stage when well act but it owe that to its ancient celebrity and it can never compete with the tinsel and tailor which alone can make even shakspeare go down with a modern audience in those day of garrick on the other hand those glorious day of true histrionic art high and low be not ashamed to throng drury lane and covent garden and make the appearance of a new play the great event of the season hundred be turn away from the door when ` the school for scandal ' be act and those who be fortunate enough to get in make the piece the subject of conversation in society for many a night pass keen comment on every scene every line every word almost and use they mind as we now use we eye this brilliant play the earliest idea of which be derive from its author 's experience of the gossip of that kettle of scandal and backbiting bath where if no other commandment be ever break the constant breach of the ninth would suffice to put it on a level with certain condemn city we have somewhere read of win for sheridan a reputation of which he at once feel the value and make he purchase of a share in the property of old drury for the time be a successful speculation it produce a result which he good heart perhaps value even more than the guinea which now flow in it induce he father who have long be at war with he to seek a reconciliation and the elder sheridan actually become manager of the theater of which he son be part proprietor old tom sheridan have always be a proud man and when once he be offend be hard to bring round again he quarrel with johnson be a instance of this in 1762 the doctor hearing they have give sheridan a pension of two hundred a year exclaim ` what have they give _ he _ a pension then it be time for I to give up mine ' a ` kind friend ' take care to repeat the peevish exclamation without add what johnson have say immediately afterwards ` however i be glad that they have give mr sheridan a pension for he be a very good man ' the actor be disgusted and though boswell interfere decline to be reconcile on one occasion he even rush from a house at which he be to dine when he hear that the great samuel have be invite the doctor have little opinion of sheridan 's declamation ` besides sir ' say he ` what influence can mr sheridan have upon the language of this great country by he narrow exertion sir it be burn a farthe candle at dover to show light at calai ' still when garrick attack he rival johnson nobly defend he ` no sir ' he say ` there be to be sure in sheridan something to reprehend and everything to laugh at but sir he be not a bad man no sir be mankind to be divide into good and bad he would stand considerably within the rank of the good ' however the greatest bully of he age -lrb- and the kindest-hearted man -rrb- think very differently of the son richard brinsley have write a prologue to savage 's play of ` sir thomas overbury ' -- ` ill-fated savage at whose birth be giv 'n no parent but the muse no friend but heav 'n' and in this have pay a elegant compliment to the great lexicographer wind up with these line : -- ` so plead the tale that give to future time the son 's misfortune and the parent 's crime there shall he fame if own would to-night survive fix would _ by the hand that bid we language live _ -- refer at once to johnson 's life of he friend savage and to he great dictionary it be savage every one remember with whom johnson in he day of starvation be wont to walk the street all night neither of they be able to pay for a lodging and with whom walk one night round and round st jame 's square he keep up he own and he companion 's spirit by inveigh against the minister and declare that they would ` stand by they country ' doubtless the doctor feel as much pleasure at the meed award to he old companion in misery as at the high compliment to himself anyhow he pronounce that sheridan ` have write the two best comedy of he age ' and therefore propose he as a member of the literary club this celebrated gathering of wit and whimsicality found by johnson himself in conjunction with sir j reynold be the helicon of london letter and the temple which the greatest talker of he age have build for himself and in which he take care to be duly worship it meet at the turk 's head in gerrard street soho every Friday and from seven in the evening to almost any hour of night be the scene of such talk mainly on literature and learning as have never be hear since in this country it consist at this period of twenty-six member and there be scarcely one among they whose name be not know to-day as well as any in the history of we literature besides the high priest reynold and johnson there come edmund burke fox sheridan and many another of less note to represent the senate : goldsmith gibbon adam smith malone dr burney percy nugent sir william jone three irish bishop and a host of other crowd in from the rank of learning and literature garrick and george colman find here a indulgent audience and the light portion of the company comprise such man as topham beauclerk bennet langton vesey and a dozen of lord and baronet in short they be pick man and if they conversation be not always witty it be because they have all wit and frighten one another -lrb- illustration : the famous literary club -rrb- among they the bully doctor roll in majestic grumpiness scold dogmatize contradict pish and pshaw and make himself generally disagreeable yet hail the omen intellect such be the force such the fame of he mind that the more he snort the more they adore he -- the more he bully the more humbly they knock under he be quite ` he majesty ' at the turk 's head and the courtier wait for he come with anxiety and talk of he till he come in the same manner as the lacquey in the anteroom of a crown monarch boswell who by the way be also a member -- of course he be or how should we have have the great man 's conversation hand down to we -- be sure to keep they up to the proper mark of adulation if they ever flag in it and be as servile in he admiration in the doctor 's absence as when he be there to call he a fool for he pain thus on one occasion while ` king johnson ' tarry the courtier be discuss he journey to the hebride and he come away ` willing to believe the second sight ' some of they smile at this but bozzy be down on they with more than usual servility ` he be only _ willing _ to believe ' he exclaim ' _ i do _ believe the evidence be enough for I though not for he great mind what will not fill a quart bottle will fill a pint bottle i be fill with belief ' -- ` be you ' say colman slily ` then cork it up ' as a specimen of johnson 's pride in he own club which always remain extremely exclusive we have what he say of garrick who before he be elect carelessly tell reynold he like the club and think ` he would be of they ' ' _ he 'll be of we _ ' roar the doctor indignantly on hearing of this ` how do he know we will _ permit _ he the first duke in england have no right to hold such language ' it can easily be imagine that when ` he majesty ' express he approval of richard brinsley then a young man of eight-and-twenty there be no one who venture to blackball he and so sheridan be duly elect the fame of ` the school for scandal ' be a substantial one for richard brinsley and in the following year he extend he speculation by buy the other moiety of drury lane this theater which take its name from the old cockpit theater in drury lane where killigrew act in the day of charle ii be famous for the number of time it have be rebuild the first house have be destroy in 1674 and the one in which garrick act be build by sir christopher wren and open with a prologue by dryden in 1793 this be rebuild in 1809 it be burn to the ground and on its re-open the committee advertise a prize for a prologue which be suppose to be try for by all the poet and poetaster then in england -lrb- 7 -rrb- sheridan add afterwards a condition that he want a address without a phoenix in it horace smith and he brother seize the opportunity to parody the style of the most celebrated in they delightful ` reject address ' drury lane have always be grand in its prologue for besides dryden and byron it could boast of sam johnson who write the address when garrick open the theater in 1747 no theater ever have more great name connect with its history -lrb- 7 : none of the address send in have give satisfaction lord byron be request to write one which he do -rrb- it be in 1778 after the purchase of the other moiety of this property that sheridan set on its board ` the critic ' though this be denounce as itself as complete a plagiarism as any sir fretful plagiary could make and though undoubtedly the idea of it be borrow its wit so truly sheridanian and its complete character enhance its author 's fame in spite of the disappointment of those who expect higher thing from the writer of ` the school for scandal ' whether sheridan would have go on improve have he remain true to the drama ` the critic ' leave we in doubt but he be a man of higher ambition step by step unexpectedly and apparently unprepared he have take by storm the out-works of the citadel he be determine to capture and he seem to have care little to garrison these minor fortress he have carry off from among a dozen suitor a wife of such beauty that walpole thus write of she in 1773 : -- ' i be at the ball last night and have only be at the opera where i be infinitely strike with the carrara who be the prettiest creature upon earth mr hartley i find still handsomer and miss linley be to be the superlative degree the king admire the last and ogle she as much as he dare in so holy a place as a oratorio and at so devout a service as alexander 's feast ' yet sheridan do not prize he lovely wife as he should have do when he have once obtain she again he have strike boldly into the drama and in four year have achieve that fame as a play-writer to which even johnson could testify so handsomely he now quit this and with the same innate power -- the same consciousness of success -- the same readiness of genius -- take a higher far more brilliant flight than ever yet have he garrison the fort he capture he would have be a better happier and more prosperous man have he be true to the maid of bath he character would not have degenerate as it do have he keep up he connection with the drama he would not have lose so largely by he speculation in drury lane he genius become he temptation and he hurry on to triumph and to fall public praise be a syren which the young sailor through life can not resist political life be a fine aim even when its seeker start without a shred of real patriotism to conceal he personal ambition no young man of any character can think without a thrill of rapture on the glory of have _ he _ name -- now obscure -- write in capital on the page of he country 's history a true patriot care nothing for fame a really great man be content to die nameless if he act may but survive he sheridan be not really great and it may be doubt if he have any sincerity in he political view but the period favor the rise of young man of genius in former reign a man could have little hope of political influence without be first a courtier but by this time liberalism have make giant stride the leaven of revolutionary idea which have leaven the whole lump in france be still work quietly and less passionately in this country and be less repress display itself in the last quarter of the eighteenth century in the form of a strong and brilliant opposition it be to this that the young man of ambition attach themselves rally under the standard of charle jame fox since it be there only that they talent be sufficient to recommend they to this party sheridan laughing in he sleeve at the extravagance of they demand -- so that when they clamour for a ` parliament once a year or oftener if need be ' he pronounce himself a ` oftener-if-need-be ' man -- be introduce when he fame as a literary man have bring he into contact with some of its hanger on fox after he first interview with he affirm that he have always think hare and charle townsend the wittiest man he have ever meet but that sheridan surpass they both and sheridan be equally please with ` the man of the people ' the first step to this political position be to become a member of a certain club where its leader gamble away they money and drink away they mind -- to wit brooke ' pretty boy indeed be these great whig patriot when turn loose in these precinct the table be for stake of twenty or fifty guinea but soon run up to hundred what do it matter to charle jame fox to the man of the people whether he lose five seven or ten thousand of a night when the one-half come out of he father 's the other out of hebrew pocket -- the sleek thick-lipped owner of which throng he jerusalem chamber as he call he back sitting-room only too glad to ` oblige ' he to any amount the rage for gaming at this pandemonium may be understand from a rule of the club which it be find necessary to make to interdict it _ in the eating-room _ but to which be add the truly british exception which allow two member of parliament in those day or two ` gentleman ' of any kind to toss up for what they have order this charming resort of the dissipate be originally establish in pall mall in 1764 and the manager be that same almack who afterwards open a lady 's club in the room now call willi 's in king street st jame 's who also own the famous thatched house and whom gilly william describe as have a ` scotch face in a bag-wig ' wait on the lady at supper in 1778 brooke -- a wine-merchant and money-lender whom tickell in he famous ` epistle from the hon charle fox partridge-shooting to the hon john townsend cruise ' describe in these line -- ` and know i have buy the best champagne from brooke from liberal brooke whose speculative skill be hasty credit and a distant bill : who nur would in club disdain a vulgar trade : exult to trust and blush to be pay -- ' build and open the present club-house in st jame 's street and thither the member of almack 's migrate brooke ' speculative skill however do not make he a rich man and the ` gentleman ' he deal with be perhaps too gentlemanly to pay he he die poor in 1782 almack 's at first consist of twenty-seven member one of whom be cj fox gibbon the historian be actually a member of it and say that in spite of the rage for play he find the society there rational and entertaining sir joshua reynold want to be a member of it too ` you see ' say topham beauclerk thereupon ` what noble ambition will make a man attempt that den be not yet open ' & c brooke ' however be far more celebrated and besides fox reynold and gibbon there be here to be find horace walpole david hume burke selwyn and garrick it would be curious to discover how much religion how much morality and how much vanity there be among the set the first two would require a microscope to examine the last a ocean to contain it but let tickell describe its inmate : -- ` soon as to brooke 's thence thy footstep bend what gratulation thy approach attend see gibbon rap he box -- auspicious sign that classic compliment and wit combine see beauclerk 's cheek a tinge of red surprise and friendship give what cruel health deny \* \* \* \* \* of wit of taste of fancy we 'll debate if sheridan for once be not too late but scarce a think on politics we 'll spare unless on polish politics with hare good-natured devon oft shall there appear the cool complacence of thy friendly sneer oft shall fitzpatrick 's wit and stanhope 's ease and burgoyne 's manly sense combine to please to show how high gaming run in this assembly of wit even so early at 1772 there be a memorandum in the book state that mr thynne retire from the club in disgust because he have only win # 12000 in two month the principal game at this period be quinze and faro into this eligible club richard sheridan who ten year before have be agree with halh on the bliss of make a couple of hundred pound by they literary exertion now essay to enter as a member but in vain one black-ball suffice to nullify he election and that one be drop in by george selwyn who with degrading littleness would not have the son of a actor among they again and again he make the attempt again and again selwyn foiled he and it be not till 1780 that he succeed the prince of wale be then he devoted friend and be determine he should be admit into the club the election at that time take place between eleven at night and one o'clock in the morning and the ` greatest gentleman in europe ' take care to be in the hall when the ballot begin selwyn come down as usual bent on triumph the prince call he to he there be nothing for it selwyn be force to obey the prince walk he up and down the hall engage he in a apparently most important conversation george selwyn answer he question after question and make desperate attempt to slip away the other george have always something more to say to he the long finger of the clock go round and selwyn 's long white finger be itch for the black ball the prince be only more and more interested the wit only more and more abstracted never be the young george more lively or the other more silent but it be all in vain the finger of the clock go round and round and at last the member come out noisily from the balloting-room and the smile face of the prince 's friend show to the unhappy selwyn that he enemy have be elect so at least run one story the other tell by sir nathaniel wraxall be perhaps more probable it appear that the earl of besborough be no less oppose to he election than george selwyn and these two individual agree at any cost of comfort to be always at the club at the time of the ballot to throw in they black ball on the night of he success lord besborough be there as usual and selwyn be at he room in cleveland row prepare to come to the club suddenly a chairman rush into brooke ' with a important note for my lord who on tear it open find to he horror that it be from he daughter-in-law lady duncannon announce that he house in cavendish square be on fire and implore he to come immediately feel confident that he fellow conspirator would be true to he post the earl set off at once but almost the same moment selwyn receive a message inform he that he adopt daughter of whom he be very fond be seize with a alarming illness the ground be clear and by the time the earl return have it be needless to say find he house in a perfect state of security and be join by selwyn whose daughter have never be better in she life the actor 's son be elect and the conspirator find they have be dupe but it be far easier in this country to get into that house where one have to represent the interest of thousand and take a share in the government of a nation than to be admit to a club where one have but to lounge to gamble and to eat dinner and sheridan be elect for the town of stafford with probably little more artifice than the old and stale one of put five-pound note under voter ' glass or pay thirty pound for a home-cured ham whether he bribe or not a petition be present against he election almost as a matter of course in those day and he maiden speech be make in defense of the good burgess of that quiet little county-town after make this speech which be listen to in silence on account of he reputation as a dramatic author but which do not appear to have be very wonderful he rush up to the gallery and eagerly ask he friend woodfall what he think of it that candid man shake he head and tell he oratory be not he forte sheridan lean he head on he hand a moment and then exclaim with vehement emphasis ` it be in I however and by heaven it shall come out ' he speak prophetically yet not as the great man who determine to conquer difficulty but rather as one who feel conscious of he own power and know that they must show themselves sooner or later sheridan find himself labor under the same natural obstacle as demosthene -- though in a less degree -- a thick and disagreeable tone of voice but we do not find in the indolent but gifted englishman that admirable perseverance that conquer zeal which enable the athenian to turn these very impediment to he own advantage he do indeed prepare he speech and at time have fit of that same diligence which he have display in the preparation of ` the school for scandal ' but he indolent self-indulgent mode of life leave he no time for such steady devotion to oratory as might have make he the finest speaker of he age for perhaps he natural ability be greater than those of pitt fox or even burke though he education be inferior to that of those two statesman from this time sheridan 's life have two phase -- that of a politician and that of a man of the world with the former we have nothing to do in such a memoir as this and indeed it be difficult to say whether it be in oratory the drama or wit that he gain the greatest celebrity there be however some difference between the three capacity on the mimic stage and on the stage of the country he fame rest on a very few grand outburst -- some mature prepared deliberate -- other spontaneous he leave only three great comedy and perhaps we may say only one really grand in the same way he make only two great speech or perhaps we may say only one he wit on the other hand -- though that too be say to have be study -- be the constant accompaniment of he daily life and sheridan have not leave two or three celebrated bon-mot but a hundred but even in he political career he wit which must then have be spontaneous win he almost as much fame as he eloquence which he seem to have reserve for great occasion he be the wit of the house wit ridicule satire quiet cool and easy sneer always make in good temper and always therefore the more bitter be he weapon and they strike with unerring accuracy at that time -- nor at that time only -- the ` den of thief ' as cobbett call we senate be a cockpit as vulgar and personal as the present congress of the united state party-spirit mean more than it have ever do since and scarcely less than it have mean when the throne itself be the stake for which party play some forty year before there be in fact a substantial personal center for each side the one party rally round a respectable but maniac monarch whose mental affliction take the most distressing form the other round he gay handsome dissolute -- nay disgusting -- son at once he rival and he heir the spirit of each party be therefore personal and they attack on one another be more personal than anything we can imagine in the present day in so respectably ridiculous a conclave as the house of common it be little for one honorable gentleman to give another honorable gentleman the lie direct before the eye of the country the honorable gentleman descend -- or as they think ascend -- to the most vehement invective and such be at time the torrent of personal abuse which party heap on one another while good-natured john bull look on and smile at he ruler that as in the united state of to-day a debate be often the prelude to a duel pitt and fox tierney adam fullarton lord george germain lord shelburne and governor johnstone all ` vindicate they honor ' as the phrase go by ` coffee and pistol for four ' if sheridan have not to repeat the bob acre scene with captain matthew it be only because he wonderful good humor could put up with a great deal that other think could only be expiate by a hole in the waistcoat in the administration of the marquis of rockingham the dramatist enjoy the pleasure of office for less than a year as one of the under secretary of state in 1782 in the next year we find he make a happy retort on pitt who have somewhat vulgarly allude to he be a dramatic author it be on the american question perhaps the bitterest that ever call forth the acrimony of party in the house sheridan from boyhood have be taunt with be the son of a actor one can hardly credit this fact just after garrick have raise the profession of a actor to so great a eminence in the social scale he have be call ` the player boy ' at school and he election at brooke ' have be oppose on the same grounds it be evidently he bitterest point and pitt probably know this when in reply to a speech of the ex-dramatist 's he say that ` no man admire more than he do the ability of that right honorable gentleman the elegant sally of he thought the gay effusion of he fancy he _ dramatic _ turn and he epigrammatic point and if they be reserve for the _ proper stage _ they would no doubt receive what the hon gentleman 's ability always do receive the plaudit of the audience and it would be he fortune _ suus plausu gaudere theatrus _ but this be not the proper scene for the exhibition of those elegancy ' this be vulgar in pitt and probably every one feel so but sheridan rise cool and collect and quietly reply : -- ` on the particular sort of personality which the right hon gentleman have think proper to make use of i need not make any comment the propriety the taste the gentlemanly point of it must have be obvious to the house but let I assure the right hon gentleman that i do now and will at any time he choose to repeat this sort of allusion meet it with the most sincere good humor nay i will say more : flatter and encourage by the right hon gentleman 's panegyric on my talent if ever i again engage in the composition he allude to i may be tempt to a act of presumption -- to attempt a improvement on one of ben jonson 's best character the character of the _ angry boy _ in the alchemist ' the fury of pitt contrast with the coolness of the man he have so shamefully attack make this sally irresistible and from that time neither ` the angry boy ' himself nor any of he colleague be anxious to twit sheridan on he dramatic pursuit pitt want to lay a tax on every horse that start in a race lord surry a _ turfish _ individual of the day propose one of five pound on the winner sheridan rise tell he lordship that the next time he visit newmarket he would probably be greet with the line : -- ` jockey of norfolk be not so bold -- ' lord rolie the butt of the opposition who have attack he in the famous satire ` the rolliad ' so popular that it go through twenty-two edition in twenty-seven year accuse sheridan of inflammatory speech among the operative of the northern county on the cotton question sheridan retort by say that he believe lord rolle must refer to ` composition less prosaic but more popular ' -lrb- mean the ` rolliad ' -rrb- and thus successfully turn the laugh against he it be grattan i think who say ` when i can not talk sense i talk metaphor ' sheridan often talk metaphor though he sometimes mingle it with sense he famous speech about the begum of oude be full of it but we have one or two instance before that thus on the duke of richmond 's report about fortification he say turn to the duke that ` hold in he hand the report make by the board of officer he compliment the noble president on he talent as a _ engineer _ which be strongly evince in planning and construct that very paper he have make it a contest of post and conduct he reasoning not less on principle of trigonometry than of logic there be certain assumption throw up like advanced work to keep the enemy at a distance from the principal object of debate strong proviso protect and cover the flank of he assertion he very query be he casemate ' and so on when lord mulgrave say on another occasion that any man use he influence to obtain a vote for the crown _ ought _ to lose he head sheridan quietly remark that he be glad he lordship have say ' _ ought _ to lose he head ' not _ would _ have lose it for in that case the learn gentleman would not have have that evening ' _ face _ to have show among we ' such be a few of he well-remembered reply in the house but he fame as a orator rest on the splendid speech which he make at the impeachment of warren hasting the first of these be make in the house on the 7th of February 1787 the whole story of the corruption extortion and cruelty of the worst of many bad ruler who have be impose upon that unhappy nation of hindostan and who ignorant how to _ parcere subjecti _ have go on in they unjust oppression only render it the more dangerous by weak concession be too well know to need a recapitulation here the worst feature in the whole of hasting ' misconduct be perhaps he treatment of those unfortunate lady whose money he covet the begum of oude the opposition be determine to make the governor-general 's conduct a state question but they charge have be receive with little attention till on this day sheridan rise to denounce the cruel extortioner he speak for five hour and a half and surpass all he have ever say in eloquence the subject be one to find sympathy in the heart of englishman who though they beat they own wife be always indignant at a man who dare to lay a little finger on those of anybody else then too the subject be oriental : it might even be invest with something of romance and poetry the zenanah sacred in the eye of the oppressed native have be ruthlessly insult under a glaring indian sun amid the luxuriance of indian foliage these act have be commit & c & c it be a fertile theme for a poet and how little soever sheridan care for the begum and they wrong -- and that he do care little appear from what he afterwards say of hasting himself -- he could evidently make a tell speech out of the theme and he do so walpole say that he turn everybody 's head ` one hear everybody in the street rave on the wonder of that speech for my part i can not believe it be so supernatural as they say ' he affirm that there must be a witchery in mr sheridan who have no diamond -- as hasting have -- to win favor with and say that the opposition may be fairly charge with sorcery burke declare the speech to be ` the most astonishing effort of eloquence argument and wit unite of which there be any record or tradition ' fox affirm that ` all he have ever hear all he have ever read when compare with it dwindle into nothing and vanish like vapor before the sun ' but these be partizan even pitt acknowledged ` that it surpass all the eloquence of ancient and modern time and possess everything that genius or art could furnish to agitate and control the human mind ' one member confess himself so unhinge by it that he move a adjournment because he could not in he then state of mind give a unbiassed vote but the highest testimony be that of logan the defender of hasting at the end of the first hour of the speech he say to a friend ` all this be declamatory assertion without proof ' another hour 's speaking and he mutter ` this be a most wonderful oration ' a third and he confess ` mr hasting have act very unjustifiably ' at the end of the fourth he exclaim ` mr hasting be a most atrocious criminal ' and before the speaker have sit down he vehemently protest that ` of all monster of iniquity the most enormous be warren hasting ' such in those day be the effect of eloquence a art which have be eschew in the present house of common and which we newspaper affect to think be much out of place in a assembly meet for calm deliberation perhaps they be right but oh for the golden word of a sheridan a fox even a pitt and burke it be say though not prove that on this same night of sheridan 's glory in the house of common he ` school for scandal ' be act with ` rapturous applause ' at covent garden and he ` duenna ' no less successfully at drury lane what a pitch of glory for the dunce who have be shame into learn greek verb at harrow surely dr parr must then have confess that a man can be great without the classic -- nay without even a decent english education for sheridan know comparatively little of history and literature certainly less than the man against whom he be pit or whose power he emulate he have be know to say to he friend when ask to take part with they on some important question ` you know i be a ignoramus -- instruct I and i 'll do my best ' he have even to rub up he arithmetic when he think he have some chance of be make chancellor of the exchequer but perhaps many a statesman before and after he have do as much as that no wonder that after such a speech in the house the celebrated trial which commence in the beginning of the following year should have rouse the attention of the whole nation the proceedings open in westminster hall the noblest room in england on the 13th of February 1788 the queen and four of she daughter be seat in the duke of newcastle 's box the prince of wale walk in at the head of a hundred and fifty peer of the realm the spectacle be impose enough but the trial proceed slowly for some month and it be not till the 3rd of June that sheridan rise to make he second great speech on this subject the excitement be then at its highest two-third of the peer with the peeress and they daughter be present and the whole of the vast hall be crowd to excess the sun shone in brightly to light up the gloomy building and the whole scene be splendid such be the enthusiasm that people pay _ fifty guinea _ for a ticket to hear the first orator of he day for such he then be the actor 's son feel the enliven influence of a full audience he have be long prepare for this moment and he throw into he speech all the theatrical effect of which he have study much and inherit more he speak for many hour on the 3rd 5th and 6th and conclude with these word : ` they -lrb- the house of common -rrb- exhort you by everything that call sublimely upon the heart of man by the majesty of that justice which this bold man have libel by the wide fame of you own tribunal by the sacred pledge by which you swear in the solemn hour of decision know that that decision will then bring you the highest reward that ever bless the heart of man the consciousness of have do the greatest act of mercy for the world that the earth have ever yet receive from any hand but heaven -- my lord i have do ' sheridan 's valet be very proud of he master 's success and as he have be to hear the speech be ask what part he consider the finest plush reply by put himself into he master 's attitude and imitate he voice admirably solemnly utter ` my lord i have do ' he should have add the word ` nothing ' sheridan 's eloquence have no more effect than the clear proof of hasting ' guilt and the impeachment as usual be but a troublesome subterfuge to satisfy the opposition and dust the eyeball of the country sheridan 's great speech be make the orator have conclude he oration fame be complete and no more be wanted adieu then blue-book and party and come on the last grand profession of this man of many talent -- that of the wit that it be a profession there can be no doubt for he live on it it be all he capital he pay he bill in that coin alone : he pay he workman he actor carpenter builder with no more sterling metal with that ready tool he extract loan from the very man who come to be pay that brilliant ornament maintain he reputation in the senate and he character in society but wit without wisdom -- the froth without the fluid -- the capital without the pillar -- be but a poor fortune a wretched substitute for real worth and honest utility for a time man forgive to mr sheridan -- extravagant and reckless as he be -- what would long before have bring a honester better but less amusing man to a debtor 's prison and the contempt of society but only for a time be this career possible sheridan have now reach the pinnacle of he fame and from this point we have to trace that decline which end so awfully whilst we call he a dishonest man we must not be suppose to imply that he be so in heart it be plead for he that he trick he creditor ` for the fun of the thing ' like a modern robin hood and like that forester bold he be mightily generous with other man 's money deception be deception whether in sport or earnest and sheridan no doubt make it a very profitable employment he have always a taste for the art of dupe and he have begin early in life -- soon after leave harrow he be spend a few day at bristol and want a pair of new boot but could not afford to pay for they shortly before he leave he call on two bootmaker and order of each a pair promising payment on delivery he fix the morning of he departure for the tradesman to send in they goods when the first arrive he try on the boot complain that that for the _ right _ foot pinch a little and order crispin to take it back stretch it and bring it again at nine the next morning the second arrive soon after and this time it be the boot for the _ leave _ foot which pinch same complaint same order give each have take away only the pinch boot and leave the other behind the same afternoon sheridan leave in he new boot for town and when the two shoemaker call at nine the next day each with a boot in he hand we can imagine they disgust at find how neatly they have be dupe anecdote of this kind swarm in every account of richard sheridan -- many of they perhaps quite apocryphal other exaggerate or attribute to this note trickster but all tend to show how completely he be master of this high art he way of elude creditor use to delight I i remember when a oxford boy and they be only parallel by oxford story one of these may not be generally know and be worthy of sheridan every oxonian know hall the boat-builder at folly bridge mr hall be in my time proprietress of those dangerous skiff and nutshell canoe which we young harebrain delighted to launch on the isis some youthful sheridanian have a long account with this elderly and bashful personage who have apply in vain for she money till come one day to he room she announce she intention not to leave till the money be pay ` very well mr hall then you must sit down and make yourself comfortable while i dress for i be go out directly ' mr h sit down composedly and with equal composure the youth take off he coat mr h be not abashed but in another moment the debtor remove he waistcoat also mr h be still immoveable sundry other article of dress follow and the good lady begin to be nervous ` now mr hall you can stay if you like but i assure you that i be go to change _ all _ my dress ' suit the action to the word he begin to remove he lower garment when mr hall shocked and furious rush from the room this remind we of sheridan 's treatment of a female creditor he have for some year hire he carriage-horse from edbrooke in clarge street and he bill be a heavy one mr edbrooke want a new bonnet and blow up she mate for not insist on payment the curtain lecture be follow next day by a refusal to allow mr sheridan to have the horse till the account be settle mr sheridan send the politest possible message in reply beg that mr edbrooke would allow he coachman to drive she in he own carriage to he door and promise that the matter should be satisfactorily arrange the good woman be delighted dress in she best and bill in hand enter the mp 's chariot sheridan meanwhile have give order to he servant mr edbrooke be show up into the back drawing-room where a slight luncheon of which she be beg to partake be lay out and she be assure that she debtor would not keep she wait long though for the moment engage the horse-dealer 's wife sit down and discuss a wing of chicken and glass of wine and in the meantime she victimizer have be watch he opportunity slip down stair jump into the vehicle and drive off mr edbrooke finish she lunch and wait in vain ten minute twenty thirty pass and then she ring the bell : ` very sorry ma'am but mr sheridan go out on important business half a hour ago ' ` and the carriage ' -- ` oh ma'am mr sheridan never walk ' he procure he wine in the same style chalier the wine-merchant be he creditor to a large amount and have stop supplies sheridan be to give a grand dinner to the leader of the opposition and have no port or sherry to offer they on the morning of the day fix he send for chalier and tell he he want to settle he account the importer much pleased say he would go home and bring it at once ` stay ' cry the debtor ` will you dine with I to-day lord -- sir -- and so-and-so be come ' chalier be flatter and readily accept return to he office he tell he clerk that he should dine with mr sheridan and therefore leave early at the proper hour he arrive in full dress and be no sooner in the house than he host despatch a message to the clerk at the office say that mr chalier wish he to send up at once three dozen of burgundy two of claret two of port & c & c nothing seem more natural and the wine be forward just in time for the dinner it be highly praise by the guest who ask sheridan who be he wine-merchant the host bow towards chalier give he a high recommendation and impressed he with the belief that he be tell a polite falsehood in order to secure he other customer little do he think that he be drink he own wine and that it be not and probably never would be pay for in like manner when he want a particular burgundy a innkeeper at richmond who decline to supply it till he bill be pay he send for the man and have no sooner see he safe in the house than he drive off to richmond see he wife tell she he have just have a conversation with mine host settle everything and would to save they trouble take the wine with he in he carriage the condescension overpower the good woman who order it at once to be produce and sheridan drive home about the time that she husband be return to richmond weary of wait for he absent debtor but this kind of trickery could not always succeed without some knowledge of he creditor 's character in the case of holloway the lawyer sheridan take advantage of he well-known vanity of he judgment of horse-flesh kelly give the anecdote as authentic he be walk one day with sheridan close to the churchyard of st paul 's covent garden when as ill-luck would have it up come holloway on horseback and in a furious rage complain that he have call on mr sheridan time and again in hertford street and can never gain admittance he proceed to violent threat and slang he debtor roundly sheridan cool as a whole bed of cucumber take no notice of these attack but quietly exclaim : ` what a beautiful creature you be ride holloway ' the lawyer 's weak point be touch ` you be speak to I the other day about a horse for mr sheridan now this would be a treasure for a lady ' ` do he canter well ' ask sheridan with a look of business ` like pegasus himself ' ` if that be the case i should not mind holloway stretch a point for he do you mind show I he pace ' ` not at all ' reply the lawyer only too happy to show off he own : and touch up the horse put he to a quiet canter the moment be not to be lose the churchyard gate be at hand sheridan slip in know that he mount tormentor can not follow he and there burst into a roar of laughter which be join in by kelly but not by the return holloway -lrb- illustration : a treasure for a lady -- sheridan and the lawyer -rrb- but if he escape a importunate lawyer once in a way like this he require more ingenuity to get rid of the limb of the law when they come as they do frequently in he later year it be the fashionable thing in bygone novel of the ` pelham ' school and even in more recent comedy to introduce a well-dressed sheriff 's officer at a dinner party or ball and take he through a variety of predicament end at length in the revelation of he real character and probably some such scene be still enact from time to time in the house of the extravagant : but sheridan 's adventure with bailiff seem to have excite more attention in the midst of he difficulty he never cease to entertain he friend and ` why should he not do so since he have not to pay ' ` pay you bill sir what a shameful waste of money ' he once say thus one day a young friend be meet by he and take back to dinner ` quite in a quiet way just to meet a very old friend of mine a man of great talent and most charming companion ' when they arrive they find ` the old friend ' already install and present a somewhat unpolished appearance which the young man explain to himself by suppose he to be a genius of somewhat low extraction he habit at dinner the eager look the free use of he knife and so forth be all account for in the same way but that he be a genius of no slight distinction be clear from the deep respect and attention with which sheridan listen to he slightest remark and ask he opinion on english poetry meanwhile sheridan and the servant between they ply the genius very liberally with wine : and the former rise make he a complimentary speech on he critical power while the young guest who have hear nothing from he lip but the commonest platitude in very bad english grow more and more amuse the wine tell in time the ` genius ' sing song which be more saxon than delicate talk loud clap he host on the shoulder and at last rolled fairly under the table ` now ' say sheridan quite calmly to he young friend ` we will go up stair : and jack ' -lrb- to he servant -rrb- ` take that man 's hat and give he to the watch ' he then explain in the same calm tone that this be a bailiff of whose company he be grow rather tired and want to be free but he finest trick be undoubtedly those by which he turn harlequin-like a creditor into a lender this be do by sheer force of persuasion by assume a lofty indignation or by put forth he claim to mercy with the most touching eloquence over which he would laugh heartily when he point be gain he be often compel to do this during he theatrical management when a troublesome creditor might have interfere with the success of the establishment he talk over a upholsterer who come with a writ for # 350 till the latter handed he instead a cheque for # 200 he once when the actor strike for arrears of wages to the amount of # 3000 and he banker refuse flatly to kelly to advance another penny screw the whole sum out of they in less than a quarter of a hour by sheer talk he get a gold watch from harri the manager with whom he have break several appointment by complain that as he have no watch he could never tell the time fix for they meeting and as for put off press creditor and turn furious foe into affectionate friend he be such a adept at it that he reputation as a dun-destroyer be quite on a par with he fame as comedian and orator hoax a style of amusement fortunately out of fashion how be almost a passion with he and he practical joke be as merciless as he satire he and tickell who have marry the sister of he wife use to play they off on one another like a couple of schoolboy one evening for instance sheridan get together all the crockery in the house and arrange it in a dark passage leave a small channel for escape for himself and then have tease tickell till he rush after he bound out and pick he way gingerly along the passage he friend follow he unwittingly and at the first step stumble over a washhand-basin and fall forwards with a crash on pile of plate and dish which cut he face and hand in a most cruel manner sheridan all the while laugh immoderately at the end of the passage secure from vengeance but he most impudent hoax be that on the honorable house of common itself lord belgrave have make a very tell speech which he wind up with a greek quotation loudly applaud sheridan have no argument to meet he with so rise he admit the force of he lordship 's quotation -lrb- of which he probably do not understand a word -rrb- but add that have he go a little farther and complete the passage he would have see that the context completely alter the sense he would prove it to the house he say and forthwith roll forth a grand string of majestic gibberish so well imitate that the whole assembly cry ` hear hear ' lord belgrave rise again and frankly admit that the passage have the meaning ascribe to it by the honorable gentleman and that he have overlook it at the moment at the end of the evening fox who pride himself on he classical lore come up to and say to he ` sheridan how come you to be so ready with that passage it be certainly as you say but i be not aware of it before you quote it ' sheridan be wise enough to keep he own counsel for the time but must have feel delightfully tickled at the ignorance of the would-be savant with whom he be politically associate probably sheridan could not at any time have quote a whole passage of greek on the spur of the moment but it be certain that he have not keep up he classic and at the time in question must have forget the little he ever know of they this facility of imitate exactly the sound of a language without introduce a single word of it be not so very rare but be generally possess in greater readiness by those who know no tongue but they own and be therefore more strike by the strangeness of a foreign one when hear it many of we have hear italian song in which there be not a word of actual italian sing in london burlesque and some of we have laugh at levassor 's capital imitation of english but perhaps the cleverest mimic of the kind i ever hear be m laffitte brother of that famous banker who make he fortune by pick up a pin this gentleman could speak nothing but french but have be bring by he business into contact with foreigner of every race at paris and when he once begin he little trick it be impossible to believe that he be not possess of a gift of tongue he german and italian be good enough but he english be so splendidly counterfeit that after listen to he for a short time i suddenly hear a roar of laughter from all present for i have actually unconsciously _ answer he _ ` yes ' ` no ' ` exactly so ' and ' i quite agree with you ' undoubtedly much of sheridan 's depravity must be attribute to he intimacy with a man whom it be a great honor to a youngster then to know but who would probably be scout even from a london club in the present day -- the prince of wale the part of a courtier be always degrading enough to play but to be courtier to a prince whose favor be to be win by proficiency in vice and audacity in folly to truckle to he taste to win he smile by the invention of a new pleasure and he approbation by the plot of a new villany what a office for the author of ` the school for scandal ' and the orator renown for denounce the wickedness of warren hasting what a life for the young poet who have woo and win the maid of bath -- for the man of strong domestic affection who weep over he father 's sternness and love he son only too well it be bad enough for such mere worldling as captain hanger or beau brummell but for a man of higher and purer feeling like sheridan who with all he fault have some poetry in he soul such a career be doubly disgraceful it be at the house of the beautiful lively and adventurous duchess of devonshire the partizan of charle jame fox who love he or he cause -- for fox and liberalism be often one in lady ' eye -- so well that she could give steele the butcher a kiss for he vote that sheridan first meet the prince -- then a boy in year but already more than a adult in vice no doubt the youth whom fox brummell hanger lord surrey sheridan the tailor and the woman combine to turn at once into the finest gentleman and greatest blackguard in europe be at that time as fascinating in appearance and manner as any one prince or not could be he be by far the handsomest of the hanoverian and have the least amount of they sheepish look he possess all they taste and capacity for gallantry with apparently none of the german coarseness which certain other prince of wale exhibit in they amorous address _ he _ coarseness be of a more sensual but less imperious kind he _ have _ he redeeming point which few of he ancestor have and he liberal hand and warm heart win he friend where he conduct could win he little else than contempt sheridan be introduce to he by fox and mr sheridan by the duchess of devonshire the prince have that which always take with englishman -- a readiness of conviviality and a recklessness of character he be ready to chat drink and bet with sheridan or any new comer equally well recommend and a introduction to young george be always follow by a easy recognition with all this he manage to keep up a certain amount of royal dignity under the most try circumstance but he have none of that easy grace which make charle ii beloved by he associate when the george have go too far he have no resource but to cut the individual with whom he have hobb and nobbed and he be as ungrateful in he enmity as he be ready with he friendship brummell have teach he to dress and sheridan have give he wiser counsel : he quarrel with both for trifle which if he have have real dignity would never have occur and if he have have real friendship would easily have be overlook sheridan 's breach with the prince be honorable to he he could not wholly approve of the conduct of that personage and he minister and he tell he openly that he life be at he service but he character be the property of the country the prince reply that sheridan ` might impeach he minister on the morrow -- that would not impair they friendship ' yet turn on he heel and be never he friend again when again the ` delicate investigation ' come off he send for sheridan and ask he aid the latter reply ` you royal highness honor I but i will never take part against a woman whether she be right or wrong ' he political courage atone somewhat for the want of moral courage he display in pander to the prince 's vice many a anecdote be tell of sheridan and ` wale ' -- many indeed that can not be repeat they bet be often of the coarsest nature win by sheridan in the coarsest manner a great intimacy spring up between the two reprobate and sheridan become one of the satellite of that dissolute prince there be few of the story of they adventure which can be tell in a work like this but we may give one or two specimen of the less disgraceful character : -- the prince lord surrey and sheridan be in the habit of seek nightly adventure of any kind that suggest itself to they lively mind a low tavern still in existence be the rendezvous of the heir to the crown and he noble and distinguished associate this be the ` salutation ' in tavistock court covent garden a night house for gardener and countryman and for the sharper who fleece both and be keep by a certain mother butler who favor in every way the adventurous design of she exalted guest here wig smock-frock and other disguise be in readiness and here at call be to be find a ready-made magistrate whose sole occupation be to deliver the young haroun and he companion from the dilemma which they adventure naturally bring they into and which be generally more or less concerned with the watch poor old watch what happy day when member of parliament nobleman and future monarch condescend to break thy bob-wigged head and -- blush z 350 immaculate constable -- to toss thee a guinea to buy plaster with in addition to the other disguise _ aliase _ be of course assume the prince go by the name of blackstock greystock be my lord surrey and thinstock richard brinsley sheridan the treatment of woman by the police be traditional the ` unfortunate ' -- unhappy creature -- be they pet aversion and once in they clutch receive no mercy the ` charley ' of old be quite as brutal as the modern hercule of the glaze hat and the three adventurer show a amount of zeal worthy of a nobler cause in rescue the drunken lai from he grasp on one occasion they seem to have hit on a ` deserving case ' a slight skirmish with the watch end in a rescue and the err creature be take off to a house of respectability sufficient to protect she here she tell she tale which however improbable turn out to be true it be a very old a very simple one -- the common history of many a frail foolish girl curse with beauty and the prey of a practice seducer the main peculiarity lay in the fact of she respectable birth and he position she be the daughter of a solicitor he the son of a nobleman marriage be promise of course as it have be promise a million time with the same intent and for the millionth time be not perform the seducer take she from she home keep she quiet for a time and when the novelty be go abandon she the old story go on poverty -- a child -- a mother 's love struggle with a sense of shame -- a visit to she father 's house at the last moment as a forlorn hope there she have crawl on she knee to one of those relentless parent on whose head lie the utter loss of they child 's soul the false pride that speak of the blot on he name the disgrace of he house -- when a savior 's example should have bid he forgive and raise the penitent in she misery from the dust -- whisper he to turn she from he door he order the footman to put she out the man a nobleman in plush move by he young mistress 's utter misery would not obey though it cost he he place and the harder-hearted father himself thrust he starve child into the cold street into the drizzling rain and slam the door upon she cry of agony the footman slip out after she and five shilling -- a large sum for he -- find its way from he kind hand to hers now the common end might have come now starvation the slow unwilling recourse to more shame and deeper vice then the force hilarity the unreal smile which in so many of these poor creature hide a canker at the heart the gradual degradation -- lower still and lower -- oblivion for a moment seek in the bottle -- a life of sin and death end in a hospital the will of providence turn the frolic of three voluptuary to good account the prince give he purse-full sheridan he one last guinea for she present need : the name of the good-hearted plush be discover and he be take into carlton house where he soon become know as robert the prince 's confidential servant : and sheridan bestir himself to rescue for ever the poor lady whose beauty still remain as a temptation he procure she a situation where she study for the stage on which she eventually appear ` all 's well that end well : ' she secret be keep till one admirer come honourably forward to he it be confide and he be noble enough to forgive the one false step of youth she be well marry and the boy for whom she have suffer so much fall at trafalgar a lieutenant in the navy to better man such a adventure would have be a solemn warning such a tale tell by the ruin one herself a sermon every word of which would have cling to they memory what effect if any it may have have on blackstock and he companion must have be very fleeting it be not so very long since the seven dial and st gile ' be haunt of wickedness and den of thief into which the police scarcely dare to penetrate probably they mystery would have afford more amusement to the artist and the student of character than to the mere seeker of adventure but it be still i remember in my early day a great feat to visit by night one of the note ` crib ' to which ` the profession ' which fill newgate be wont to resort the ` brown bear ' in broad street st gile ' be one of these pleasant haunt and thither the three adventurer determine to go this style of adventure be out of date and no longer amusing of course a fight ensue in which the prince and he companion show immense pluck against terrible odds and in which as one read in the novel of the ` london journal ' or ` family herald ' the natural superiority of the well-born of course display itself to great advantage surely bulwer have describe such scene too graphically in some of he earlier novel to make a minute description here at all necessary but the reader who be curious in the matter may be refer to a work which have recently appear under the title of ` sheridan and he time ' profess to be write by a octogenarian intimate with the hero the fray end with the arrival of the watch who rescue blackstock greystock and thinstock and with dogberryan stupidity carry they off to a neighbouring lock-up the examination which take place be just the occasion for sheridan 's fun to display itself on and pretend to turn informer he succeed in bewilder the unfortunate parochial constable who conduct it till the arrival of the magistrate whose duty be to deliver he friend from durance vile the whole scene be well describe in the book just refer to with we presume a certain amount of idealize but the ` octogenarian ' have probably hear the story from sheridan himself and the main point must be accept as correct the affair end as usual with a supper at the ` salutation ' we must now follow sheridan in he gradual downfall one of the cause of this -- as far as money be concern -- be he extreme indolence and utter negligence he trust far too much to he ready wit and rapid genius thus when ` pizarro ' be to appear day after day go by and nothing be do on the night of representation only four act out of five be write and even these have not be rehearse the principal performer siddon charle kemble and barrymore have only just receive they part sheridan be up in the prompter 's room actually write the fifth act while the first be be perform and every now and then appear in the green-room with a fresh relay of dialogue and set all in good humor by he merry abuse of he own negligence in spite of this ` pizarro ' succeed he seldom write except at night and surround by a profusion of light wine be he great stimulant in composition as it have be to better and worse author ` if the thought be slow to come ' he would say ' a glass of good wine encourage it and when it do come a glass of good wine reward it ' those glass of good wine be unfortunately even more frequent than the good thought many and merry as they be he neglect of letter be a standing joke against he he never take the trouble to open any that he do not expect and often leave seal many that he be most anxious to read he once appear with he beg face at the bank humbly ask a advance of twenty pound ` certainly sir would you like any more -- fifty or a hundred ' say the smile clerk sheridan be overpower he _ would _ like a hundred ` two or three ' ask the scribe sheridan think he be joke but be ready for two or even three -- he be always ready for more but he could not conceal he surprise ` have you not receive we letter ' the clerk ask perceive it certainly he have receive the epistle which inform he that he salary as receiver-general of cornwall have be pay in but he have never open it this neglect of letter once bring he into a troublesome lawsuit about the theater it be necessary to pay certain demand and he have apply to the duke of bedford to be he security the duke have consent and for a whole year he letter of consent remain unopened in the meantime sheridan have believe that the duke have neglect he and allow the demand to be bring into court in the same way he have long before commit himself in the affair with captain matthew in order to give a public denial of certain report circulate in bath he have call upon a editor request he to insert the say report in he paper in order that he might write he a letter to refute they the editor at once comply the calumny be print and publish but sheridan forget all about he own refutation which be apply for in vain till too late other cause be he extravagance and intemperance there be a utter want of even common moderation in everything he do whenever he boyish spirit suggest any freak whenever a craving of any kind possess he no matter what the consequence here or hereafter he rush heedlessly into the indulgence of it perhaps the enemy have never a easier subject to deal with any sin in which there be a show of present mirth or easy pleasure be as easily take up by sheridan as if he have not a single particle of conscience or religious feeling and yet we be not at all prepare to say that he lack either he have only deaden both by excessive indulgence of he fancy the temptation of wealth and fame have be too much for the poor and obscure young man who rise to they so suddenly and as so often happen those very talent which should have be he glory be in fact he ruin he extravagance be unbounded at a time when misfortune lay thick upon he and bailiff be hourly expect he would invite a large party to a dinner which a prince might have give and to which one prince sometimes sit down on one occasion have no plate leave from the pawnbroker 's he have to prevail on ` my uncle ' to lend he some for a banquet he be to give the spoon and fork be send and with they two of he man who dress in livery wait no doubt with the most vigilant attention on the party such at that period be the host 's reputation when he could not even be trust not to pledge another man 's property at one time he income be reckon at # 15000 a year when the theater be prosperous of this he be say to have spend not more than # 5000 on he household while the balance go to pay for he former folly debt and the interest lawsuit often arise from mere carelessness and judgment against the theater probably a great deal of it be bet away drink away throw away in one way or another as for bet he generally lose all the wager he make : as he say himself -- ' i never make a bet upon my own judgment that i do not lose and i never win but one which i have make against my judgment ' he bet be generally lay in hundred and though he do not gamble he could of course run through a good deal of money in this way he bet on every possible trifle but chiefly it would seem on political possibility the state of the fund the result of a election or the downfall of a ministry horse-race do not seem to have possess any interest for he and in fact he scarcely know one kind of horse from another he be never a adept at field-sport though very ambitious of be think a sportsman once when stay in the country he go out with a friend 's gamekeeper to shoot pheasant and after waste a vast amount of powder and shot upon the air he be only rescue from ignominy by the sagacity of he companion who go a little behind he when a bird rise bring it down so neatly that sheridan believe he have kill it himself snatch it up and rush bellow with glee back to the house to show that he _ could _ shoot in the same way he try he hand at fishing in a wretched little stream behind the deanery at winchester use however a net as easier to handle than a rod some boy who have watch he want of success a long time at last buy a few pennyworth of pickled herring and throw they on the stream allow they to float down towards the eager disciple of old izaak sheridan see they come rush in regardless of he clothes cast he net and in great triumph secure they when he have land he prize however there be the boy burst with laughter and piscator see he be they dupe ` ah ' cry he laugh in concert as he look at he drip clothes ` this be a pretty _ pickle _ indeed ' he extravagance be well know to he friend as well as to he creditor lord guildford meet he one day ` well sherry so you have take a new house i hear ' -- ` yes and you 'll see now that everything will go on like clockwork ' -- ` ay ' say my lord with a know leer ' _ tick tick _ ' even he son tom use to laugh at he for it ` tom if you marry that girl i 'll cut you off with a shill ' -- ` then you must borrow it ' reply the ingenuous youth -lrb- 8 -rrb- tom sometimes disconcert he father with he inherit wit -- he only inheritance he press urgently for money on one as on many a occasion ' i have none ' be the reply as usual ` there be a pair of pistol up stair a horse in the enable the night be dark and hounslow heath at hand ' -lrb- 8 : another version be that tom reply : ` you do not happen to have it about you sir do you ' -rrb- ' i understand what you mean ' reply young tom ` but i try that last night and unluckily stop you treasurer peake who tell I you have be beforehand with he and rob he of every sixpence he have in the world ' so much for the respect of son to father papa have he revenge on the young wit when tom talking of parliament announce he intention of enter it on a independent basis ready to be buy by the highest bidder ' i shall write on my forehead ' say he to let ' ` and under that tom unfurnished ' rejoin sherry the elder the joke be now stale enough but sheridan be more truly witty in put down a young braggart whom he meet at dinner at a country-house there be still to be find like the bone of dead ass in a field newly plough in some part of the country youth who be so hopelessly behind they age and indeed every age as to look upon authorship as degrade all knowledge save latin and greek as ' a bear ' and all entertainment but hunting shooting fishing and badger-drawing as unworthy of a man in the last century these young animal who unite the modesty of the puppy with the clear-sightedness of the pig not to mention the progressiveness of another quadrup be more numerous than in the present day and in consequence more forward in they remark it be one of these charming youth who be stay in the same house as sheridan and who quite unprovoked begin at dinner to talk of ` actor and author and those low sort of people you know ' sheridan say nought but patiently bide he time the next day there be a large dinner-party and sheridan and the youth happen to sit opposite to one another in the most conspicuous part of the table young nimrod be kindly oblige he side of the table with extraordinary leap of he hunter the perfect working of he new double-barrelled manton & c bringing of course number one in as the hero in each case in a moment of silence sheridan with a air of great politeness address he unhappy victim ` he have not ' he say ` be able to catch the whole of the very interesting account he have hear mr -- relate ' all eye be turn upon the two ` would mr -- permit he to ask who it be who make the extraordinary leap he have mention -- ' i sir ' reply the youth with some pride ` then who be it kill the wild duck at that distance ' -- ' i sir ' ` be it you setter who behave so well ' -- ` yes mine sir ' reply the youth get rather red over this examination ` and who catch the huge salmon so neatly ' -- ' i sir ' and so the question go on through a dozen more item till the young man weary of answer ' i sir ' and grow redder and redder every moment would gladly have hide he head under the table-cloth in spite of he sport prowess but sheridan have to give he the _ coup de grace _ ` so sir ' say he very politely ` you be the chief _ actor _ in every anecdote and the _ author _ of they all surely it be impolitic to despise you own profession ' sheridan 's intemperance be as great and as incurable as he extravagance and we think he mind if not he body live only on stimulant he could neither write nor speak without they one day before one of he finest speech in the house he be see to enter a coffee-house call for a pint of brandy and swallow it ` neat ' and almost at one gulp he friend occasionally interfere this drinking they tell he would destroy the coat of he stomach ` then my stomach must digest in its waistcoat ' laugh sheridan where be the toper of yore jovial i will not call they for every one know that ` mirth and laughter ' work up with a corkscrew be follow by ` headache and hot copper the day after ' but where be those anakim of the bottle who _ could _ floor they two of port and one of madeira though the say two and one floor they in turn the race i believe have die out we head have get weaker as we cellar grow emptier the arrangement be convenient the daughter of eve have nobly undertake to atone for the naughty conduct of they primeval mamma by reclaim man and drag they from the hade of the mahogany to that seventh heaven of muffin and english ballad prepare for they in the drawing-room we be certainly astounded even to incredulity when we read of the deed of a david or a samson but such wonderment can be nothing compare to that which a generation or two hence will feel when sip as a great extravagance and unpardonable luxury two thimbleful of ` african sherry ' the young demirep of the day read that three english gentleman sheridan richardson and ward sit down one day to dinner and before they rise again -- if they ever rise which seem doubtful -- or at least be raise have empty five bottle of port two of madeira and one of brandy yet this be but one instance in a thousand there be nothing extraordinary in it and it be only mention because the amount drunk be accurately give by the unhappy owner of the wine kelly the composer who unfortunately or fortunately be not present and do not even imagine that the three honorable gentleman be discuss he little store yet sheridan do not seem to have believe much in he friend 's vintage for he advise he to alter he brass plate to ` michael kelly composer of wine and importer of music ' he make a better joke when dine with lord thurlow he try in vain to induce he to produce a second bottle of some extremely choice constantium from the cape of good hope ` ah ' he mutter to he neighbor ` pass I that decanter if you please for i must return to madeira as i see i can not _ double the cape _ ' but as long as richard brinsley be a leader of political and fashionable circle as long as he have a position to keep up a ambition to satisfy a labor to complete he drinking be if not moderate not extraordinary for he time and he associate but when a man 's ambition be limit to mere success -- when fame and a flash for himself be all he care for and there be no truer grander motive for he sustain the position he have climb to -- when in short it be he own glory not mankind 's good he have ever strive for -- woe woe woe when the hour of success be come i can not stop to name and examine instance but let I be allow to refer to that bugbear who be call up whenever greatness of any kind have to be illustrate -- napoleon the great or let I take any of the lesser napoleon in lesser grade in any nation any age -- the man who have have no star but self and self-glory before they -- and let I ask if any one can be name who if he have survive the attainment of he ambition have not go down the other side of the hill somewhat faster than he come up it then let I select man whose guiding-star have be the good of they fellow-creature or the glory of god and watch they peaceful useful end on that calm summit that they toil so honestly to reach the difference come home to we the moral be read only at the end of the story remorse ring it for ever in the ear of the die -- often too long a-dying -- man who have labor for himself peace read it smilingly to he whose generous toil for other have bring its own reward sheridan have climb with the stride of a giant laughing at rock at precipice at slippery watercourse he have spread the wing of genius to poise himself withal and gain one peak after another while homelier worth be struggle midway clutch the bramble and cling to the fern he have as byron say in sheridan 's day of decay do the best in all he undertake write the best comedy best opera best farce speak the best parody and make the best speech sheridan when those word of the young poet be tell he shed tear perhaps the bitter thought strike he that he have _ not _ lead the best but the _ worst _ life that comedy farce opera monody and oration be nothing nothing to a pure conscience and a peaceful old age that they could not save he from shame and poverty -- from debt disgrace drunkenness -- from grasp but long-cheated creditor who drag he bed from under the feeble nervous ruin old man poor sheridan he end be too bitter for we to cast one stone more upon he let it be note that it be in the beginning of he decline when have reach the climax of all he ambition and complete he fame as a dramatist orator and wit that the hand of providence mercifully interpose to rescue this reckless man from he downfall it smite he with that common but powerful weapon -- death those he best loved be tear from he one after another rapidly and with little warn the linley the ` nest of nightingale ' be all delicate as nightingale should be and it seem as if this very time be choose for they death that the one err soul -- more precious remember than many just live -- might be call back almost within one year he lose he dear sister-in-law the wife of he most intimate friend tickell marium linley the last of the family he own wife and he little daughter one grief succeed another so rapidly that sheridan be utterly unnerved utterly bring low by they but it be he wife 's death that tell most upon he with that wife he have always be the lover rather than the husband she have marry he in the day of he poverty when she beauty be so celebrated that she might have wed whom she would she have rise with he and share he later anxiety yet she have see he forget neglect she and seek other society in spite of he tender affection for she and for he child he have never make a _ home _ of they home vanity fair have keep he ever flit and it be little to be wonder at that mr sheridan be the object of much though ever respectful admiration -lrb- 9 -rrb- yet in spite of calumny she die with a fair fame decline have long press upon she yet she last illness be too brief in 1792 she be take away still in the summer of she day and with she last breath utter she love for the man who have never duly prize she he grief be terrible yet it pass and work no change he find solace in he beloved son and yet more beloved daughter a few month -- and the little girl follow she mother again he grief be terrible : again pass and work no change yes it do work some change but not for the better it drive he to the goblet and from that time we may date the confirmation of he habit of drink the solemn warning have be unheed : they be to be repeat by a long-suffering god in a yet more solemn manner which should touch he yet more nearly he beautiful wife have be the one restraint upon he folly and he lavishness now she be go they burst out afresh wilder than ever -lrb- 9 : lord edward fitzgerald be one of the most devoted of she admirer : he choose he wife pamelum because she resemble mr sheridan -- see moore 's life of lord edward -rrb- for a while after these affliction which be soon complete in the death of he most intimate friend and boyish companion tickell sheridan throw himself again into the commotion of the political world but in this we shall not follow he three year after the death of he first wife he marry again he be again fortunate in he choice though now forty-four he succeed in win the heart of a most estimable and charming young lady with a fortune of # 5000 she must indeed have love or admire the widower very much to consent to be the wife of a man so notoriously irregular to use a mild term in he life but sheridan fascinate wherever he go and young lady like ' a little wildness ' he heart be always good and where he give it he give it warmly richly fully he second wife be miss esther jane ogle daughter of the dean of winchester she be give to he on condition of he settle in all # 20000 upon she -- a wise proviso with such a spendthrift -- and he have to raise the money as usual he political career be sufficiently brilliant though he real fame as a speaker rest on he great oration at hasting ' trial in 1806 he satisfy another point of he ambition long desire and be elect for the city of westminster which he have ardently covet when fox represent it but a dissolution throw he again on the mercy of the popular party and again he offer himself for westminster : but in spite of all the effort make for he without success he be return instead for ilchester meanwhile he difficulty increase extravagance debt want of energy to meet both bring he speedily into that position when a man accept without hesitation the slightest offer of aid the man who have have a income of # 15000 a year and settle # 20000 on he wife allow a poor friend to pay a bill for # 5 for he and clutch eagerly at a # 50 note when display to he by another extravagance be the father of meanness and sheridan be often mean in the readiness with which he accept offer and the anxiety with which he implore assistance it be amusing in the present day to hear a man talk of ' a debt of honor ' as if all debt do not demand honor to pay they -- as if all debt incur without hope of repayment be not dishonourable a story be tell relative to the old-fashioned idea of a ` debt of honor ' a tradesman to whom he have give a bill for # 200 call on he for the amount a heap of gold be lie on the table ` do not look that way ' cry sheridan after protest that he have not a penny in the world ` that be to pay a debt of honor ' the applicant with some wit tear up the bill he hold ` now mr sheridan ' quoth he ` mine be a debt of honor too ' it be to be hope that sheridan hand he the money the story of gunter 's bill be not so much to he credit hanson a ironmonger call upon he and press for payment a bill send in by the famous confectioner be lie on the table a thought strike the debtor who have no means of get rid of he importunate applicant ` you know gunter ' he ask ` one of the safest man in london ' reply the ironmonger ` then will you be satisfy if i give you he _ bill _ for the amount ' -- ` certainly ' thereupon sheridan hand he the neatly fold account and rush from the room leave the creditor to discover the point of mr sheridan 's little fun still sheridan might have weather through the storm drury lane be a mine of wealth to he and with a little care might have be really profitable the lawsuit the debt the engagement upon it all rise from he negligence and extravagance but old drury be doom on the 24th February 1809 soon after the conclusion of the performance it be announce to be in flame rather it announce itself in a few moment it be blaze -- a royal bonfire sheridan be in the house of common at the time the reddened cloud above london throw the glare back even to the window of the house the member rush from they seat to see the unwonted light and in consideration for sheridan a adjournment be move but he rise calmly though sadly and beg that no misfortune of he should interrupt the public business he independence he say -- witty in the midst of he trouble -- have often be question but be now confirm for he have nothing more to depend upon he then leave the house and repair to the scene of conflagration not long after kelly find he sit quite compose in ` the bedford ' sip he wine as if nothing have happen the musician express he astonishment at mr sheridan 's _ sing froid _ ` surely ' reply the wit ` you 'll admit that a man have a right to take he wine by he own fireside ' but sheridan be only drown care not disregard it the event be really too much for he though perhaps he do not realize the extent of its effect at the time in a word all he have in the world go with the theater nothing be leave either for he or the principal shareholder yet he bear it all with fortitude till he hear that the harpsichord on which he first wife be wont to play be go too then he burst into tear this fire be the opening of the shaft down which the great man sink rapidly while he fortune keep up he spirit be not completely exhaust he drink much but as a indulgence rather than as a relief now it be by wine alone that he could even raise himself to the common requirement of conversation he be describe _ before _ dinner as depressed nervous and dull _ after _ dinner only do the old fire break out the old wit blaze up and dick sheridan be dick sheridan once more he be in fact fearfully oppress by the long-accumulated and never-to-be-wiped-off debt for which he be now daily press in quit parliament he resign he sanctuary and leave himself a easy prey to the jew and gentile whom he have so long dodge and delude with he ready ingenuity drury lane as we all know be rebuilt and the birth of the new house herald with a prologue by byron about as good as the one in ` reject address ' the cleverest parody ever write and suggest by this very occasion the building-committee have advertise for a prize prologue samuel whitbread send in he own attempt in which as probably in a hundred other the new theater be compare to a phoenix rise out of the ash of the old one sheridan say whitbread 's description of a phoenix be excellent for it be quite a _ poulterer 's description _ this same sam whitbread be now to figure conspicuously in the life of mr richard b sheridan the ex-proprietor be find to have a interest in the theater to the amount of # 150000 -- not a trifle to be despise but he be now past sixty and it need excite no astonishment that even with all he liability he be unwilling to begin again the care of management or mismanagement which he have endure so many year he sell he interest in which he son tom be join for # 60000 this sum would have clear off he debt and leave he a balance sufficient to secure comfort for he old age but it be out of the question that any money matter should go right with dick sheridan of the rights and wrong of the quarrel between he and whitbread who be the chairman of the committee for build the new theater i do not pretend to form a opinion sheridan be not naturally mean though he descend to meanness when hard press -- what man of he stamp do not whitbread be truly friendly to he for a time sheridan be always complain that he be sue for debt he do not owe and keep out of many that be due to he whitbread know he man well and if he withhold what be owe to he may be excuse on the ground of real friendship all i know be that sheridan and whitbread quarrel that the former do not or affirm that he do not receive the full amount of he claim on the property and that when what he have receive be pay over to he principal creditor there be little or nothing leave for my lord to spend in banquet to parliamentary friend and jorum of brandy in small coffee-house because a man be a genius he be not of necessity a upright honest ill-used oppressed and cruelly-entreated man genius play the fool wittingly and often enough quite knowingly with its own interest it be its privilege to do so and no one have a right to complain but then genius ought to hold its tongue and not make itself out a martyr when it have have the dubious glory of defy common-sense if genius despise gold well and good but when he have spurn it he should not whine out that he be wrongfully keep from it poor sheridan may or may not have be right in the whitbread quarrel he have have he defender and i be not ambitious of be number among they but whatever be now he trouble be bring on by he own disregard of all that be right and beautiful in conduct if he go down to the grave a pauper and a debtor he have make he own bed and in it he be to lie lie he do wretchedly on the most unhappy bed that old age ever lay in there be little more of importance to chronicle of he latter day the retribution come on slowly but terribly the career of a ruin man be not a pleasant topic to dwell upon and i leave sheridan 's misery for mr j b gough to whine and roar over when he want a shocking example sheridan might have earn many a crown in that capacity if temperance-oratory have be the passion of the day debt disease depravity -- these word describe enough the downward career of he old age to eat still more to drink be now the troublesome enigma of the quondam genius i say quondam for all the mark of that genius be now go one after another he choicest property make they way to ` my uncle 's ' the book go first as if they could be most easily dispense with the remnant of he plate follow then he picture be sell and at last even the portrait of he first wife by reynold be leave in pledge for a ` further remittance ' the last humiliation arrive in time and the associate of a prince the eloquent organ of a party the man who have enjoy # 15000 a year be carry off to a low

impossible to do justice in so narrow a space as i have here he be one of those man who not to be make out a whit better or worse than they be demand a careful investigation of all they action or report action -- a careful sifting of all the evidence for or against they and a careful weeding of all the anecdote tell of they this require a separate biography to give a general idea of the man we must be content to give that which he inspire in a general acquaintance many of he ` mots ' and more of the story about he may have be invent for he but they would scarcely have be fix on sheridan if they have not fit more or less he character : i have therefore give they i might have give a hundred more but i have let alone those anecdote which do not seem to illustrate the character of the man many another good story be tell of he and we must content ourselves with one or two take one that be characteristic of he love of fun sheridan be accost by a elderly gentleman who have forget the name of a street to which he want to go and who inform he precisely that it be a out-of-the-way name ` perhaps sir you mean john street ' say sherry all innocence ` no a unusual name ' ` it can not be

like he speech and he be even report to have carry he book of _ mots _ in he pocket as a young lady of the middle class _ might _ but seldom do carry she book of etiquette into a party but some of he wit be no doubt extempore when arrest for non-attendance to a call in the house soon after the change of ministry he exclaim ` how hard to be no sooner out of office than into custody ' he be not a inveterate talker like macaulay sydney smith or jeffrey : he seem rather to have aim at a striking effect in all that he say when find trip he have a clever knack of get out of the difficulty in the

' become more and more fashionable as it do every day we shall have a work on the ` art of appropriation ' it be a pity that brummell look down upon literature : poor literature it have a hard struggle to recover the slight for we be convinced there be not a work more wanted than the ` art of dress ' and ` george the less ' be almost the last professor of that elaborate science if the maxim that ` whatever be worth do at all be worth do well ' hold good beau brummell must be regard in the light of a great man that dress be worth do at all everybody but a fijus islander seem to admit for everybody do it if then a man succeed in dress better than anybody else it follow that he be entitle to the most universal admiration but there be another object to which this great man condescend to apply the principle of high art -- i mean affectation how admirably he succeed in this he life will show but can we doubt that he be entitle to we greatest esteem and heartiest gratitude for the study he pursue with unremitting patience in these two useful branch when we find that a prince of the blood delighted to honor and the richest noblest and most distinguished man of half a century ago be proud to know he we be write then of no common man no mere beau but of the greatest professor of two of the most popular science -- dress and affectation let we speak with reverence of this wonderful genius george brummell be ' a self-made man ' that be all that nature the tailor stag and padding have not make of he he make for himself -- he name he fame he fortune and he friend -- and all these be great the author of ` self-help ' have most unaccountably omit all mention of he and most erroneously for if there ever be a man who help himself and no one else it be ` very sincerely yours george brummell ' the founder of the noble house of brummell the grandfather of we hero be either a treasury porter or a confectioner or something else -lrb- 10 -rrb- at any rate he let lodgings in bury street and whether from the fact that he wife do not purloin she lodger ' tea and sugar or from some other cause he manage to ingratiate himself with one of they -- who afterwards become lord liverpool -- so thoroughly that through he influence he obtain for he son the post of private secretary to lord north nothing could have be more fortunate except perhaps the son 's next move which be to take in marriage the daughter of richardson the owner of a well-known lottery-office between the lottery of office and the lottery of love brummell _ père _ manage to make a very good fortune at he death he leave as much as # 65000 to be divide among he three child -- raike say as much as # 30000 a-piece -- so that the beau if not a fool ought never to have be a pauper -lrb- 10 : mr jesse say that the beau 's grandfather be a servant of mr charle monson brother to the first lord monson -rrb- george bryan brummell the second son of this worthy man honor by he birth the 7th of June 1778 no anecdote of he childhood be preserved except that he once cry because he could not eat any more damson tart in later year he would probably have think damson tart ` very vulgar ' he first turn up at eton at the age of twelve and even there commence he distinguished career and be know as ` buck brummell ' the boy show himself decidedly father to the man here master george be not vulgar enough nor so imprudent it may be add as to fight row or play cricket but he distinguish himself by the introduction of a gold buckle in the white stock by never be flog and by he ability in toast cheese we do not hear much of he classical attainment the very gentlemanly youth be in due time pass on to oriel college oxford here he distinguish himself by a study indifference to college discipline and a equal dislike to study he condescend to try for the newdigate prize poem but he genius lean far more to the turn of a coat-collar than that of a verse and unhappily for the british poet they rank be not to be dignified by the addition of this illustrious man the newdigate be give to another and so to punish oxford the competitor leave it and poetry together after have adorn the old quadrangle of oriel for less than a year he be now a boy of seventeen and a very fine boy too to judge from a portrait take in later life he be not strictly handsome but he be describe as tall well build and of a slight and graceful figure add to this he have get from eton and oxford if not much learn many a well-born friend and he be toady enough to cultivate those of better and to dismiss those of less distinction he be through life a celebrated ` cutter ' and brummell 's cut be as much admire -- by all but the _ cuttee _ -- as brummel 's coat then he have some # 25000 as capital and how could he best invest it he consult no stockbroker on this weighty point he do not even buy a shilling book of advice such as we have see advertise for those who do not know what to do with they money the question be answer in a moment by the young worldling of sixteen : he would enter a crack regiment and invest he guinea in the thousand per cent of fashionable life he namesake the regent be now thirty-two and have spend those year of he life in acquire the honorary title of the ` first gentleman of europe ' by every act of folly debauch dissipation and degradation which a prince can conveniently perpetrate he be the hero of london society which adore and backbite he alternately and he be precisely the man whom the boy brummell would worship the regent be colonel of a famous regiment of fop -- the 10th hussar it be the most expensive the most impertinent the best-dressed the worst-moralled regiment in the british army its officer many of they title all more or less distinguish in the try campaign of london season be the intimate of the prince-colonel brummell aspire to a cornetcy in this brilliant regiment and obtain it nor that alone he secure by he manners o he dress or he impudence the favor and companionship -- friendship we can not say -- of the prince who command it by this step he reputation be make and it be only necessary to keep it up he have a immense fund of good nature and as long as he money last of good spirit too good saying -- that be witty if not wise -- be record of he and he friend pronounce he a charming companion introduce therefore into the highest circle in england he could scarcely fail to succeed young cornet brummell become a great favorite with the fair he rise in the regiment be of course rapid : in three year he be at the head of a troop the onerous duty of a military life which vacillate between brighton and london and consist chiefly in make oneself agreeable in the mess-room be too much for we hero he neglect parade or arrive too late : it be such a bear to have to dress in a hurry it be say that he know the troop he command only by the peculiar nose of one of the man and that when a transfer of man have once be make ride up to the wrong troop and support he mistake by point to the nose in question no fault however be find with the regent 's favorite and brummell might have rise to any rank if he could have support the terrific labor of dress for parade then too there come war and rumor of war and we gallant captain shudder at the vulgarity of shed blood : the supply of smelling-salt would never have be liberal enough to keep he from faint on the battle-field it be say too that the regiment be order to manchester could anything be more gross or more ill-bred the idea of figure before the wife and daughter of cotton-spinner be too fearful and from one cause or another we brave young captain determine to retire which he do in 1798 it be now therefore that he commence the profession of a beau and as he be the prince of beau as he patron be the beau of prince and as he fame have spread to france and germany if only as the inventor of the trouser and as there be no man who on get up in the morning do not put on he clothes with more or less reflection as to whether they be the right one to put on and as beau have exist since the day of the emperor of beau alexander the macedonian and will probably exist to all time let we rejoice in the high honor of be permit to describe how this illustrious genius clothe he poor flesh and make the most of what god have give he -- a body and leg the private life of brummell would in itself serve as a book of manners and habit the two be he profoundest study but alas he impudence mar the former and the latter can scarcely be imitate in the present day still as a great example he be yet invaluable and must be describe in all detail he morning toilette be a most elaborate affair never be brummell guilty of _ déshabille _ like a true man of business he devote the best and earliest hour -- and many of they too -- to he profession namely -- dress he dressing-room be a studio in which he daily prepare that elaborate portrait of george brummell which be to be exhibit for a few hour in the club-room and drawing-room of town only to be take to piece again and again make up for the evening charle i delighted to resort of a morning to the studio of vandyck and to watch he favorite artist 's progress the regent george be no less devoted to art for we be assure by mr raike that he often visit he favorite beau in the morning to watch he toilet and would sometimes stay so late that he would send he horse away insist on brummell give he a quiet dinner ` which generally end in a deep potation ' there be no doubt many fabulous myth float about concern this illustrious man and he biographer captain jesse seem anxious to defend he from the absurd story of french writer who assert that he employ two glover to cover he hand to one of whom be intrust the thumb to the other the finger and hand and three barber to dress he hair while he boot be polish with champagne he cravat design by a celebrated portrait painter and so forth these may be pleasant invention but captain jesse 's own account of he toilet even when the beau be break and live in elegant poverty abroad be quite absurd enough to render excusable the ingenious exaggeration of the foreign writer the _ batterie de toilette _ we be tell be of silver and include a spitting-dish for its owner say ` he could not spit into clay ' napoleon shave himself but brummell be not quite great enough to do that just as my lord so-and-so walk to church on Sunday while he neighbor the birmingham millionaire can only arrive there in a chariot and pair he ablutions take no less than two whole hour what knowledge might have be gain what good do in the time he devote to rub he lovely person with a hair-glove cleanliness be in fact brummell 's religion perhaps because it be generally set down as ` next to godliness ' a proximity with which the beau be quite satisfied for he never attempt to pass on to that next stage poor fool he might rub every particle of moisture off the skin of he body -- he might be clean as a kitten -- but he could not and do not purify he mind with all this friction and the man who would have faint to see a black speck upon he shirt be not at all shock at the indecent conversation in which he and he companion occasionally indulge the body cleanse the face have next to be bring up as near perfection as nature would allow with a small looking-glass in one hand and tweezers in the other he carefully remove the tiniest hair that he could discover on he cheek or chin endure the pain like a martyr then come the shirt which be in he palmy day change three time a day and then in due course the great business of the cravat captain jesse 's minute account of the process of tie this can surely be rely on and present one of the most ludicrous picture of folly and vanity that can be imagine have brummell never live and a novelist or play-writer describe the toilet which captain jesse affirm to have be he daily achievement he would have have the critic about he with the now common phrase -- ` this book be a tissue not only of improbability but of actual impossibility ' the collar then be so large that in its natural condition it rise high above the wearer 's head and some ingenuity be require to reduce it by delicate fold to exactly that height which the beau judge to be correct then come the all-majestic white neck-tie a foot in breadth it be not to be suppose that brummell have the neck of a swan or a camel -- far from it the worthy fool have now to undergo with admirable patience the mysterious process know to we papa as ` crease down ' the head be throw back as if ready for a dentist the stiff white tie apply to the throat and gradually wrinkle into half its actual breadth by the slow downward movement of the chin when all be do we can imagine that comfort be sacrifice to elegance as it be then consider and that the sudden appearance of venus herself could not have induce the deluded individual to turn he head in a hurry it be scarcely profitable to follow this lesser deity into all the detail of he self-adornment it must suffice to say that he affect a extreme neatness and simplicity of dress every item of which be study and discuss for many a hour in the morning he be still guilty of hessian and pantaloons or ` top ' and buckskin with a blue coat and buff waistcoat the costume be not so ancient but that one may tumble now and then on a country squire who glory in it and denounce we juvenile as ` bear ' for want of a similar precision poor brummell he cordially hate the country squire and would have want rouge for a week if he could have dream that he pet attire would some fifty year later be represent only by one of that class which he be so anxious to exclude from watier 's but it be in the evening that he display he happy invention of the trouser or rather its introduction from germany this article he wear very tight to the leg and button over the ankle exactly as we see it in old print of ` the fashion ' then come the wig and on that the hat it be a vain and thankless task to defend brummell from the charge of be a dandy if one proof of he devotion to dress be want it would be the fact that this hat once stick jauntily on one side of the wig be never remove in the street even to salute a lady -- so that inasmuch as he sacrifice he manners to he appearance he may be fairly set down as a fop the perfect artist could not be expect to be charitable to the less successful duke and prince consult he on the make of they coat and discuss tailor with he with as much solemnity as divine might dispute on a mystery of religion brummell do not spare they ` bedford ' say he to the duke of that name finger a new garment which he grace have submit to he inspection ` do you call this _ thing _ a coat ' again meet a noble acquaintance who wear shoe in the morning he stop and ask he what he have get upon he foot ` oh shoe be they ' quoth he with a well breed sneer ' i think they be slipper ' he be even ashamed of he own brother and when the latter come to town beg he to keep to the back street till he new clothes be send home well might he friend the regent say that he be ' a mere tailor 's dummy to hang clothes upon ' but in reality brummell be more he have some sharpness and some taste but the former be all bring out in sneer and the latter in snuff-box he whole mind could have be put into one of these he have a splendid collection of they and be famous for the grace with which he open the lid of he box with the thumb of the hand that carry it while he delicately take he pinch with two finger of the other this and he bow be he chief acquirement and he reputation for manners be base on the distinction of he manner he could not drive in a public conveyance but he could be rude to a well-meaning lady he never eat vegetable -- _ one _ pea he confess to -- but he do not mind borrow from he friend money which he know he could never return he be a great gentleman a gentleman of he patron 's school -- in short a well-dressed snob but one thing be due to brummell : he make the assumption of be ' a gentleman ' so thoroughly ridiculous that few man of keen sense care now for the title : at least not as a class-distinction nor be it to be wonder at when you tailor 's assistant be a ` gentleman ' and would be mightily disgust at be call anything else you with you indomitable pride of caste can scarcely care for the patent brummell 's claim to the title be base on he walk he coat he cravat and the grace with which he indulge as captain jesse delightfully call it ` the nasal pastime ' of take snuff all the rest be impudence and many be the anecdote -- most of they familiar as household word -- which be tell of he impertinence the story of mr johnson-thompson be one of those oft-told tale which from have become joe miller have gradually pass out of date and be almost forget two rival party-giver rejoice in the aristocratic name of johnson and thompson the former live near finsbury the latter near grosvenor square and mr thompson be somehow sufficiently fashionable to expect the regent himself at she assembly brummell among other impertinence be fond of go where he be not invite or want the two rival give a ball on the same evening and a card be send to the beau by she of finsbury he choose to go to the grosvenor square house in hope of meet the regent then he foe mr thompson be justly disgusted and with a vulgarity quite deserve by the intruder tell he he be not invite the beau make a thousand apology hum haw and draw a card from he pocket it be the rival 's invitation and be indignantly denounce ` dear I how very unfortunate ' say the beau ` but you know johnson and thompson -- i mean thompson and johnson be so very much alike mrs johnson-thompson i wish you a very good evening ' perhaps there be no vulgarity greater than that of rally people on they surname but we exquisite gentleman have not wit enough to invent one superior to such a puerile amusement thus on one occasion he wake up at three in the morning a certain mr snodgrass and when the worthy put he head out of the window in alarm say quietly ` pray sir be you name snodgrass ' -- ` yes sir it be snodgrass ' ` snodgrass -- snodgrass -- it be a very singular name good-bye mr _ snodgrass _ ' there be more wit in he remark to poodle byng a well-known puppy whom he meet one day drive in the park with a french dog in he curricle ` ah ' cry the beau ` how d'ye do byng a family vehicle i see ' it seem incredulous to modern gentleman that such a man should have be tolerate even at a club take for instance he vulgar treatment of lord mayor combe whose name we still see with other over many a public-house in london and who be then a most prosperous brewer and thrive gambler at brooke ' one evening the beau and the brewer be play at the same table ` come _ mash-tub _ ' cry the ` gentleman ' ` what do you set ' mash-tub unresentingly set a pony and the beau win twelve of he in succession pocket he cash he make he a bow and exclaim ` thank you alderman in future i shall drink no porter but yours ' but combe be worthy of he namesake shakspere 's friend and answer very aptly ' i wish sir that every _ other _ blackguard in london would tell I the same ' then again after ruin a young fool of fortune at the table and be reproach by the youth 's father for lead he son astray he reply with charming affectation ` why sir i do all i could for he i once give he my arm all the way from white 's to brooke '' when brummell really want a dinner while at calais he could not give up he impertinence for the sake of it lord westmoreland call on he and perhaps out of compassion ask he to dine at _ three o'clock _ with he ` you lordship be very kind ' say the beau ` but really i could not _ feed _ at such a hour ' sooner or later he be glad to _ feed _ with any one who be toady enough to ask he he be once place in a delightfully awkward position from have accept the invitation of a charitable but vulgar-looking britisher at calais he be walk with lord sefton when the individual pass and nod familiarly ` who be you friend brummell ' -- ` not mine he must be bow to you ' but presently the man pass again and this time be cruel enough to exclaim ` do not forget brum do not forget -- goose at four ' the poor beau must have wish the earth to open under he he be equally imprudent in the way in which he treat a old acquaintance who arrive at the town to which he have retreat and of whom he be fool enough to be ashamed he generally take away they character summarily but on one occasion be frighten almost out of he wit by be call to account for this conduct a officer who have lose he nose in a engagement in the peninsula call on he and in very strong term request to know why the beau have report that he be a retired hatter he manner alarm the rascal who apologize and protest that there must be a mistake he have never say so the officer retire and as he be go brummell add : ` yes it must be a mistake for now i think of it i never deal with a hatter without a nose ' so much for the good breeding of this friend of george iv and the duke of york he affectation be quite as great as he impudence : and he win the reputation of fastidiousness -- nothing give more prestige -- by dint of be openly rude no hospitality or kindness melt he when he think he could gain a march at one dinner not like the champagne he call to the servant to give he ` some more of that cider : ' at another to which he be invite in day when a dinner be a charity to he after help himself to a wing of capon and try a morsel of it he take it up in he napkin call to he dog -- he be generally accompany by a puppy even to party as if one at a time be not enough -- and present it to he say aloud ` here _ aton _ try if you can get you tooth through that for i be d -- d if i can ' to the last he resent offer of intimacy from those whom he consider he inferior and as there be lady enough everywhere he have ample opportunity for administer rebuke to those who press into he society on one occasion he be saunter with a friend at caen under the window of a lady who long for nothing more than to have the great _ arbiter elegantiarum _ at she house when see he beneath she put she head out and call out to he ` good evening mr brummell will not you come up and take tea ' the beau look up with extreme severity express on he face and reply ` madam you take medicine -- you take a walk -- you take a liberty -- but you _ drink _ tea ' and walk on have it may be hope cure the lady of she admiration in the life of such a man there could not of course be much striking incident he live for ` society ' and the whole of he story consist in he rise and fall in that narrow world though admire and seek after by the woman -- so much so that at he death he chief asset be lock of hair the only thing he could not have turn into money -- he never marry wedlock might have sober he and make he a more sensible if not more respectable member of society but he advance towards matrimony never bring he to the crisis he account for one rejection in he usual way ` what could i do my dear _ fellar _ ' he lisp ` when i actually see lady mary eat cabbage ' at another time he be say to have induce some deluded young creature to elope with he from a ball-room but manage the affair so ill that the lover -lrb- -rrb- be catch in the next street and the affair come to a end he write rather ecstatic love-letter to lady mary and miss -- s give married lady advice on the treatment of they spouse and be tender to various widow but though he go on in this way through life he be never it would seem in love from the mere fact that he be incapable of passion perhaps he be too much of a woman to care much for woman he be certainly egregiously effeminate about the only creature he could love be poodle when one of he dog from over-feeding be take ill he send for two dog-doctor and consult very gravely with they on the remedy to be apply the canine physician come to the conclusion that she must be bleed ` bleed ' say brummell in horror ' i shall leave the room : inform I when the operation be over ' when the dog die he shed tear -- probably the only one he have shed since childhood : and though at that time receive money from many a old friend in england complain with touch melancholy ` that he have lose the only friend he have ' he grief last three whole day during which he shut himself up and would see no one but we be not tell that he ever thus mourn over any human be he effeminacy be also show in he dislike to field-sport he shooting exploit be confine to the murder of a pair of pet pigeon perch on a roof while he confess as regard hunting that it be a bear to get up so early in the morning only to have one 's boot and leather splash by gallop farmer however hunting be a fashion and brummell must need appear to hunt he therefore keep a stud of hunter in he better day near belvoir the duke of rutland 's where he be a frequent visitor and if there be a near meet would ride out in pink and top to see the hound break cover follow through a few gate and return to the more congenial atmosphere of the drawing-room he however condescend to bring he taste to bear on the hunting-dress and it be say introduce white top instead of the ancient mahogany that he _ could _ ride there seem reason to believe but it be equally probable that he be afraid to do so he valor be certainly compose almost entirely of its ` better part ' and indeed have so much prudence in it that it may be doubt if there be any of the original stock leave once when he have be take away somebody 's character the ` friend ' of the maligned gentleman enter he apartment and very menacingly demand satisfaction for he principal unless a apology be tender ` in five minute ' ` five minute ' answer the exquisite as pale as death ` five seconds or sooner if you like ' brummell be no fool in spite of he folly he have talent of a mediocre kind if he have choose to make a better use of they yet the general opinion be not in favor of he wisdom he quite deserve sheridan 's cool satire for he affectation if not for he want of mind the wit and the beau meet one day at chare cross and it can well be imagine that the latter be rather disgust at be see so far east of st jame 's street and drawl out to sheridan -- ` sherry my dear boy do not mention that you see I in this filthy part of the town though perhaps i be rather severe for he grace of northumberland reside somewhere about this spot if i do not mistake the fact be my dear boy i have be in the d -- d city to the bank : i wish they would remove it to the west end for re-all-y it be quite a bear to go to such a place more particularly as one can not be see in one 's own equipage beyond somerset house ' etc etc etc in the brummellian style ` nay my good

i know you to be one ' quoth sherry and turn away it be due to both the party to this anecdote to state that it be quite apocryphal and rest on the slenderest authority however whether fool or not brummell have one certain though small claim upon certain small reader be you bear in a modern generation when scrap of poetry be forbid in you nursery and no other pabulum be offer to you infant stomach but the rather dull biography of rather dull though very upright man -- if so i pity you old air of a jaunty jig-like kind be still haunt the echo of my brain among they be -- ` the butterfly be a gentleman which nobody can refute : he leave he lady-love at home and roam in a velvet suit ' i remember often to have ruminate over this character of a innocent and i believe calumniate insect he be a gentleman and the consequence thereof be twofold : he abandon the young woman who have trust she affection to he and attire he person in a complete costume of the best lyon silk-velvet _ not _ the proctor 's velvet which theodore feel with thumb and finger impudently ask ` how much a yard ' i secretly resolve to do the same thing as mr butterfly when i come of age but the say mr butterfly have a varied and somewhat awful history all of which be narrate in various ditty chant by my nurse i could not quite join in she vivid assertion that she _ would _ ' -- be a butterfly bear in a bower christen in a tea-pot and dead in a hour ' aetat four life be dear and the idea of that early demise be far from welcome to I i privily agree that i would _ not _ be a butterfly but there be no end to the history of this very inconstant insect in we nursery lore we do not care a drop of honey for dr watt 's ` busy bee ' we infinitely prefer the account -- not in the ` morning post ' -- of the ` butterfly 's ball ' and the ` grasshopper 's feast and few perhaps have ever give child more pleasure of imagination than william roscoe its author there be some amongst we however who be already be wean to a knowledge of life 's mysterious change and we seek the third volume of the romance of the flit gaudy thing in a little poem call ` the butterfly 's funeral ' little dream we when in we prettly little song-book we see the initial ` b ' at the bottom of these verse that a real human butterfly have write they and that they convey a solemn prognostication of a fate that be _ not _ he little we dream as we lisp out the verse that the ` gentleman who roam in a ' not velvet but ` plum-coloured suit ' accord to lady hester stanhope be the illustrious george brummell the beau write these trashy little rhyme -- pretty in they way -- and since i be once a child and learn they off by heart i will not cast a stone at they brummell indulge in such trifling poetizing but never go further it be a pity he do not write he memoirs they would have add a valuable page to the history of ` vanity fair ' brummell 's london glory last from 1798 to 1816 he chief club be watier 's it be a superb assemblage of gamester and fop -- knave and fool and it be difficult to say which element predominate for a time brummell be monarch there but he day of reckoning come at last byron and moore sir henry mildmay and mr pierrepoint be among the member play run high there and brummell once win nearly as much as he squander patrimony # 26000 of course he not only lose it again but much more -- indeed he whole capital it be after some heavy loss that he be walk home through berkeley street with mr raike when he see something glittering in the gutter pick it up and find it to be a crooked sixpence like all small-minded man he have a great fund of superstition and he wear the talisman of good luck for some time for two year we be tell after this finding of treasure-trove success attend he in play -- macao the very pith of hazard be the chief game at watier 's -- and he attribute it all to the sixpence at last he lose it and luck turn against he so go the story it be probably much more easily accountable few man play honestly in those day without lose to the dishonest and we have no reason to charge the beau with mal-practice however this may be he loss at play first bring about he ruin the jew be of course resort to and if brummell do not like charle fox keep a jerusalem chamber it be only because the sum total of he fortune be pretty well know to the money-lender ` then come the change the check the fall pain rise up old pleasure pall there be one remedy for all ' this remedy be the cross of the channel a cross keep by beggar who levy a heavy toll on those who pass over it the decline of the beau be rapid but not without its _ éclat _ a breach with he royal patron lead the way it be presume that every reader of these volume have hear the famous story of ` wale ring the bell ' but not all may know its particulars a deep impenetrable mystery hang over this story perhaps some german of the twenty-first century -- some future giffard or who not -- will put he wit to work to solve the riddle in very sooth _ il ne vaut pas la chandelle _ a quarrel do take place between george the prince and george the less but of its cause no living mortal be cognizant : we can only give the receive version it appear then that dine with hrh the prince of wale master brummell ask he to ring the bell consider the intimacy between they and that the regent often sacrifice he dignity to he amusement there be nothing extraordinary in this but it be add that the prince do ring the bell in question -- unhappy bell to jar so between two such illustrious friend -- and when the servant come order ` mr brummell 's carriage ' another version palm off the impertinence on a drunken midshipman who be relate to the comptroller of the household have be invite to dinner by the regent another yet state that brummell be ask to ring the say bell reply ` you royal highness be close to it ' no one know the truth of the legend any more than whether homer be a man or a myth it surely do not matter the friend quarrel and perhaps it be time they should do so for they have never improve one another 's moral but it be only fair to the beau to add that he always deny the whole affair and that he himself give as the cause of the quarrel he own sarcasm on the prince 's increase corpulency and he resemblance to mr fitzherbert 's porter ` big ben ' certainly some praise be due to the beau for the _ san froid _ with which he appear to treat the matter though in reality dreadfully cut up about it he lounge about make amusing remark on he late friend and patron swear he would ` cut ' he and in short behave with he usual _ aplomb _ the ` wale ring the bell ' be sufficient proof of he impudence but ` who be you fat friend ' be really good it be well know in all probability that george iv contemplate with as much disgust and horror the increase rotundity of he ` presence ' as ever a maiden lady of a certain age do she first gray hair soon after the bell affair the royal beau meet he former friend in st jame 's street and resolve to cut he this be attack brummell with he own pet weapon but not with success each antagonist be lean on the arm of a friend ` jack lee ' who be thus support the beau be intimate with the prince who to make the cut the more marked stop and talk to he without take the slightest notice of brummell after a time both party move on and then come the moment of triumph and revenge it be sublime turn round half way so that he word could not fail to be hear by the retreat regent the beau ask of he companion in he usual drawl ` well jack who be you fat friend ' the coolness presumption and impertinence of the question perhaps make it the best thing the beau ever say and from that time the prince take care not to risk another encounter with he -lrb- 11 -rrb- -lrb- 11 : another version give by captain jesse represent this to have take place at a ball give at the argyle room in July 1813 by lord alvanley sir henry miklmav mr pierrepoint and mr brummell -rrb- brummell be scotch rather than kill by the prince 's indifference he at once resolve to patronise he brother the duke of york and find in he a truer friend the duchess who have a particular fondness for dog of which she be say to have keep no fewer at one time than a hundred add the puppy brummell to the list and treat he with a kindness in which little condescension be mixed but neither impudence nor the blood-royal can keep a man out of debt especially when he play the beau get deeper and deeper into the difficulty and at last some mysterious quarrel about money with a gentleman who thenceforward go by the name of dick the dandy-killer obliged he to think of place and poverty in another land he look in vain for aid and among other scrope davy be write to to lend he ` two hundred ' ` because he money be all in the three per cent ' scrope reply laconically -- ` my dear george ` it be very unfortunate but _ my _ money be all in the three per cent yours 's davy ' it be the last attempt the beau go to the opera as usual and drive away from it clear off to dover whence the packet take he to safety and slovenliness in the ancient town of calais he few effect be sell after he departure porcelaine buhl a drawing or two double-barrelled manton -lrb- probably never use -rrb- plenty of old wine linen furniture and a few well-bound book be the beau 's asset he debt be with half the chief tradesman of the west end and a large number of he personal friend the climax be reach : henceforth master george bryan brummell go rapidly and gracefully down the hill of life the position of a calai beggar be by no mean a bad one if the reduce individual have any claim whatever to distinction a black-mail be sedulously levy by the outcast and exile of that town on every englishman who pass through it and in those day it be customary to pass some short time in this entrance of france the english ` resident ' be always on the look-out generally crowd round the packet-boat and the new arrival be sure to be accost by some old and attach friend who have not see he for year just as button who be always break the plate and tumbler have the invariable mode of accounting for he carelessness ` they fall apart sir in my ` and ' so these expatriate briton have always a tale of confidence misplace -- security for a bond -- bail for a delinquent or in short any hard case which compel they much against they will to remain ` for a period ' on the shore of france to such man whom you have know in seven-guinea waistcoat at white 's and watier 's and find in seven-shilling coat on the calais pier it be impossible to refuse you five-pound note and in time the black-mail of calai come to be reckon among the established expense of a continental tour brummell be a distinguished beggar of this description and manage so adroitly that the new arrival think themselves oblige by mr brummell 's acceptance of they donation the man who could not eat cabbage drive in a hackney-coach or wear less than three shirt a day be now support by voluntary contribution and do not see anything derogatory to a gentleman in they acceptance if brummell have now turn he talent to account if he have practice he painting in which he be not altogether despicable or he poetry in which he have already have some trifling success : if he have even engage himself as a waiter at quillacq 's or give lesson in the art of deportment he fine friend from town might have cut he but posterity would have withhold its blame he be a beggar of the merriest kind while he write letter to friend in england ask for remittance and describe he wretched condition on a bed of straw and eat bran bread he have a good barrel of dorchester ale in he lodgings he usual glass of maraschino and he bottle of claret after dinner and though live on charity could order new snuff-box to add to he collection and new knick-knack to adorn he room there can be no pity for such a man and we have no pity for he whatever the rest of the world may feel nothing can be more contemptible than the gradual downfall of the broken beau yet if it be doubt that he soul ever rise above the collar of a coat or the brim of a hat he letter to mr raike in the time of he poverty would settle the question ' i hear of you the other day in a waistcoat that do you considerable credit spick-and-span from paris a broad stripe salmon-colour and _ cramoisé _ do not let they laugh you into a relapse -- into the gothic -- as that of you former english simplicity ' he speak of the army of occupation as ` rascal in red coat wait for embarkation ' ` english education ' he say in another letter ` may be all very well to instruct the hemming of handkerchief and the ungainly romp of a country-dance but nothing else and it would be a poor consolation to you decline year to see you daughter come into the room upon they elbow and to find they accomplishment limit to broad native phraseology in conversation or thump the woodpecker upon a discordant spinet ' and he proceed to recommend a ` good french formation of manners ' and so forth nor do he display any of that dignity and self-respect which be generally suppose to mark the ` gentleman ' when he late friend and foe by this time a king pass through calai the beau break in every sense have not pride enough to keep out of he way many story be tell of the manner in which he press himself into george iv 's notice but the various legend mostly turn upon a certain snuff-box accord to one quite as reliable as any other the prince and the beau have in they day of amity intend to exchange snuff-box and george the greater have give george the less a order on he jeweller for a _ tabatière _ with he portrait on the top on they quarrel this order be with very bad taste rescind although brummell 's snuff-box have already pass into the prince 's hand and have not be return it be say that the beau employ a friend to remind the king of this agreement and ask for he box to whom the latter say that the story be all nonsense and that he suppose ` the poor devil ' mean he late intimate friend want # 100 and should have it however it be doubtful if the money ever reach the ` poor devil ' the story do not tell over well for whatever be the failing and fault of george iv he seem to have have a certain amount of good nature if not absolutely of good heart and possess at least sufficient sense of what become a prince to prevent he do so shabby a act though he may have defraud a hundred tradesman in these day there _ be _ such thing as ` debt of honor ' and they be punctiliously attend to there be as we have say various version of this story but all tend to show that brummell court the notice of he late master and patron on he way through the place of he exile and it be not remarkable in a man who borrow so freely from all he acquaintance and who be in fact in such a state of dependence on they liberality brummell make one grand mistake in he career as a beau : he outlive himself for some twenty-four year he survive he flight from england to which country he never return for a time he be a assiduous writer of begging-letter and the plague of he friend at length he obtain the appointment of consul at the good old norman town of caen this be almost a sinecure and the beau take care to keep it so but no one can account for the extraordinary step he take soon after enter on he consular duty he write to lord palmerston state that there be no duty attach to the post and recommend its abolition this act of suicide be partly explain by a suppose desire to be appoint to some more lively and more lucrative consulate but in this the beau be mistake the consulate at caen be vacate in accordance with he suggestion and brummell be leave penniless in debt and to shift for himself with the aid of a english tradesman half grocer half banker he manage to get through a period of he poverty but could not long subsist in this way and the punishment of he vanity and extravagance come at last in he old age a term of existence in prison do not cure he and when he be liberate he again resume he primrose glove he eau de cologne and he patent _ verni _ for he boot though at that time literally support by he friend with a allowance of # 120 per annum in the old day of caen life this would have be equal to # 300 a year in england and certainly quite enough for any bachelor but the beau be really a fool for whom for what should he dress and polish he boot at such a quiet place as caen yet he continue to do so and to run into debt for the polish when he confess to have ` so help he heaven ' not four franc in the world he be order this _ vernis de guiton _ at five franc a bottle from pari and call the provider of it a ` scoundrel ' because he venture to ask for he money what foppery what folly be all this how truly worthy of the man who build he fame on the reputation of a coat terrible indeed be the hardship that follow he extravagance he be actually compel to exchange he white for a black cravat poor martyr after such a trial it be impossible to be hard upon he so too the man who send repeat begging-letter to the english grocer armstrong throw out of window a new dressing-gown because it be not of the pattern he wish to have retribution for all this folly come in time he mind go even before he health though only some sixty year of age almost the bloom of some man 's life he lose he memory and he power of attention he old ill-manners become positively bad manners when feast and fete he could find nothing better to say than ` what a half-starved turkey ' at last the beau be reduce to the level of that slovenliness which he have consider as the next step to perdition reduce to one pair of trousers he have to remain in bed till they be mend he grow indifferent to he personal appearance the surest sign of decay drivelling wretched in debt a object of contempt to all honest man he drag on a miserable existence still with he boot in hole and all the honor of beau-dom go for ever he cling to the last to he eau de cologne and some few other luxury and go down a fool and a fop to the grave to indulge he silly taste he have to part with one piece of property after another and at length he be leave with little else than the lock of hair of which he have once boast i remember a story of a labourer and he die wife the poor woman be breathe she last wish ` and i say william you 'll see the old sow do not kill she young un ' -- ` ay ay wife set thee good ' ` and i say william you 'll see lizzy go to schule reg ` lar ' -- ` ay ay wife set thee good ' ` and i say william you 'll see tommy 's breeches be mend against he go to schule again ' -- ` ay ay wife set thee good ' -- ` and i say william you 'll see i be lay proper in the yard ' william grow impatient ` now never thee mind they thing wife i 'll see to 'em all you just go on with you die ' no doubt brummell 's friend heartily wish that he would go on with he die for he have already live too long but he would live on he be describe in he last day as a miserable slovenly half-witted old creature creep about to the house of a few friend he retain or who be kind enough to notice he still jeer at by the _ gamin _ and remarkable now not for the cleanliness but the filthiness and raggedness of he attire poor old fool one can not but pity he when wretched friendless and miserable as he be we find he still graceful in a poor _ café _ near the place royale take he cup of coffee and when ask for the amount of he bill answer very vaguely ` oui madame à la pleine lune à la pleine lune ' the drivelling of old age be no fit subject for ridicule yet in the case of a man who have sneer so freely at he fellow-creature they may afford a useful lesson one of he fancy be to give imaginary party when he tallow dip be all set alight and he servant announce with proper decorum ` the duchess of devonshire ' ` lord alvanley ` mr sheridan ' or whom not the poor old idiot receive the imaginary visitor with the old bow and talk to they in the old strain till he servant announce they imaginary carriage and he be put drivel to bed at last the idiocy become mania he burn he book he relic he token he eat enormously and the man who have look upon beer as the _ ne plus ultra _ of vulgarity be glad to imagine it champagne let we not follow the poor maniac through he wanderings rather let we throw a veil over all he drivelling wretchedness and find he at he last gasp when coat and collar hat and brim be all forget when the man who have worn three shirt a day be content to change he linen once a month what a lesson what a warning if brummell have come to this pass in england it be hard to say how and where he would have die he be now utterly penniless and have no prospect of receive any remittance it be determine to remove he to the hospice du bon sauveur a _ maison de charité _ where he would be well care for at no expense the mania of the poor creature take as ever the turn of external preparation when the landlord of he inn enter to try and induce he to go he find he with he wig on he knee he shaving apparatus by he side and the quondam beau deeply interested in lather the peruke as a preliminary to shear it he resist every proposal to move and be carry down stair kick and shriek once lodge in the hospice he be treat by the soeurs de charité with the greatest kindness and consideration a attempt be make to recall he to a sense of he future peril that he might at least die in a more religious mood than he have live but in vain it be not for we err and sinful as we be to judge any fellow-creature but perhaps poor brummell be the last man to whom religion have a mean he heart be good he sin be more those of vanity than those of hate it may be that they be regard mercifully where the fund of mercy be unbounded god grant that they may be so or who of we would escape none but fiend will triumph over the death of any man in sin man be not fiend they must and will always feel for they fellow-men let they die as they will no doubt brummell be a fool -- a fool of the first water but that he be equally a knave be not so certain let it never be certain to blind man who can not read the heart that any man be a knave he die on the 30th of march 1840 and so the last of the beau pass away people have claim indeed for d'orsay the honor of brummell 's descend mantle but d'orsay be not strictly a beau for he have other and higher taste than mere dress it have never be advance that brummell 's heart be bad in spite of he many fault vanity do all vanita vanitatem o young man of this age be warn by a beau and flee he doubtful reputation peace then to the coat-thinker peace to all -- to the worst let we look within and not judge it be enough that we be not try in the same balance theodore edward hook the greatest of modern wit -- what coleridge say of hook -- hook 's family -- redeeming point -- versatility -- variety of hoax -- the black-wafered horse -- the berner street hoax -- success of the scheme -- the strop of hunger -- kitchen examination -- the wrong house -- angle for a invitation -- the hackney-coach device -- the plot of hook and mathew -- hook 's talent as a improvisatore -- the gift become he bane -- hook 's novel -- college fun -- bait a proctor -- the punning faculty -- official life open -- troublesome pleasantry -- charge of embezzlement -- misfortune -- doubly disgraced -- no effort to remove the stain -- attack on the queen -- a incongruous mixture -- specimen of the ramsbottom letter -- hook 's scurrility -- fortune and popularity -- the end if it be difficult to say what wit be it be well nigh as hard to pronounce what be not wit in a sad world mirth have its full honor let it come in rag or in purple raiment the age that patronise a ` punch ' every Saturday and a pantomime every christmas have no right to complain if it find itself barren of wit while a rival age have bring forth she dozen mirth be no doubt very good we would see more not less of it in this unmirthful land we would fain imagine the shrunken-cheeked factory-girl singing to herself a happy burthen as she shift the loom -- the burthen of she life and fain believe that the voice be innocent as the sky-lark 's but if it be not so -- and we know it be not so -- shall we quarrel with any one who try to give the poor care-worn money-singing public a little laughter for a few penny no truly but it do not follow that the man who raise a titter be of necessity a wit the next age perchance will write a book of ` wit and beau ' in which mr dougla jerrold mr mark lemon and so on will represent the _ wit _ of this pass day and that future age will not ask so nicely what wit be and not look for that last solve of riddle its definition hook have be by common consent place at the head of modern wit when king be king they bully beat and and brow-beat they jester now and then they treat they to a few year in the tower for a little extra impudence now that the people be sovereign the jester fare better -- nay too well he book or he bon-mot be read with zest and grin he be invite to he grace 's and implore to my lord 's he be wait for watch pampered like a small grand lama and in one sentence the greater the fool the more fool he make if theodore hook have live in the stir day of king henry viii he would have send messr patch and co sharply to the right-about and be present with the cap and bell after he first comic song no doubt he be a jester a fool in many sens though he do not like solomon 's fool ` say in he _ heart _ ' very much he jest away even the practical of life jest himself into disgrace into prison into contempt into the basest employment -- that of a libeller tack on to a party he be a mimic too to whom none could send a challenge a improvisatore who beat italian tyrolean and styrian hollow sir hollow and lastly -- oh shame of the shuffle-tongued -- he be too a punster yes one who glory in pun a maker of pun upon pun a man whose whole wit run into a pun as readily as water rush into a hollow who could not keep out of a pun let he loathe it or not and who make some of the best and some of the worst on record but still -- pun if he be a wit withal it be _ malgré sous _ for fun not for wit be he ` aspiration ' yet the world call he a wit and he have a claim to he niche there be it be true many a man in he own set who have more real wit there be jame smith thoma ingoldsby tom hill and other out of he set but of he time there be sydney smith ten time more a wit : but theodore could amuse theodore could astonish theodore could be at home anywhere he have all the impudence all the readiness all the indifference of a jester and a jester he be let any one look at he portrait and he will doubt if this be the king 's jester paint by holbein or mr theodore hook paint by eddis the short thick nose the long upper lip the sensual whimsical mouth the twinkling eye all belong to the regular maker of fun hook be a certificate jester with a lenient society to hear and applaud he instead of a irritable tyrant to keep he in order : and he fill he post well whether he be more than a jester may well be doubt yet coleridge when he hear he say : ' i have before in my time meet with man of admirable promptitude of intellectual power and play of wit which as stillingfleet say : the ray of wit gild wheresoe'er they strike but i never could have conceive such readiness of mind and resource of genius to be pour out on the mere subject and impulse of the moment ' the poet be wrong in one respect genius can in no sense be apply to hook though readiness be he chief charm the famous theodore be bear in the same year as byron 1788 the one on the 22nd of January the other on the 22nd of September so the poet be only nine month he senior hook like many other wit be a second son lady of sixty or seventy well remember the name of hook as that which accompany they earliest misery it be in learn hook 's exercise or primer or whatever they be call that they first have they finger slap over the piano-forte the father of theodore no doubt be the unwitting cause of much unhappiness to many a young lady in she teens hook _ père _ be a organist at norwich he come up to town and be engage at marylebone garden and at vauxhall so that theodore have no excuse for be of decidedly plebeian origin and tory as he be he be not fool enough to aspire to patricianism theodore 's family be in real fact theodore himself he make the name what it be and raise himself to the position he at one time hold yet he have a brother whose claim to celebrity be not altogether ancillary jame hook be fifteen year older than theodore after leave westminster school he be send to immortal skimmery -lrb- st mary 's hall -rrb- oxford which have foster so many great man -- and spoil they he be advance in the church from one preferment to another and ultimately become dean of worcester the character of the reverend gentleman be pretty well know but it be unnecessary here to go into it farther he be only mention as theodore 's brother in this sketch -lrb- 12 -rrb- he be a dabbler in literature like he brother but scarcely to the same extent a dabbler in wit -lrb- 12 : dr jame hook dean of worcester be father to dr walter farquhar hook now the excellent dean of chichester late vicar of leed -rrb- the younger son of ` hook 's exercise ' develop early enough a taste for ingenious lie -- so much admire in he predecessor -- sheridan he ` fancy himself ' a genius and therefore from school-age not amenable to the common law of ordinary man frequenter of the now fashionable prize-ring -- thanks to two brute who have bring that degraded pastime into prominent notice -- will hear a great deal about a man ` fancy himself ' it be common slang and heed little explanation hook ` fancy himself ' from a early period and continue to ` fancy himself ' in spite of repeat disgrace till a very mature age at harrow he be the contemporary but scarcely the friend of lord byron no two character could have be more unlike every one know more or less what byron 's be it need only be say that hook 's be the reverse of it in every respect byron feel where hook laugh byron be morbid where hook be gay byron abjure with disgust the social vice to which he be introduce hook fall in with they byron indulge in vice in a romantic way hook in the coarsest there be some excuse for byron much as he have be blame there be little or no excuse for hook much as he fault have be palliate the fact be that goodness of heart will soften in man 's mind any or all misdemeanor hook in spite of many vulgar witticism and cruel joke seem to have have a really good heart i have it on the authority of one of hook 's most intimate friend that he be capable of any act of kindness and by way of instance of he goodness of heart i be tell by the same person that he on one occasion quit all he town amusement to solace the spirit of a friend in the country who be in serious trouble i of course refrain from give name : but the same person inform I that much of he time be devote in a like manner to relieve as far as possible the anxiety of he friend often indeed arise from he own carelessness it be due to hook to make this impartial statement before enter on a sketch of he ` saying and doings ' which must necessarily leave the impression that he be a heartless man old hook the father soon perceive the value of he son 's talent and determine to turn they to account encouraged he natural inclination to song-writing at the age of sixteen theodore write a kind of comic opera to which he father supply the music this be call ` the soldier 's return ' it be follow by other and young hook not yet out of he teens manage to keep a drury lane audience alive as well as himself and family it must be remembered however that liston and matthew could make almost any piece amusing the young author be introduce behind the scene through he father 's connection with the theater and often play the fool under the stage while other be play it for he above it practical joke be a passion with he which he develop thus early these trick be not always very good-natured which may be say of many of he joke out of the theater he soon show evidence of another talent that of act as well as write piece assurance be one of the main feature of he character and to it he owe he success in society but it be a remarkable fact that on he first appearance before a audience he entirely lose all he nerve turn pale and could scarcely utter a syllable he rapidly recover however and from this time become a favorite performer in private theatricals in which he be support by mathew and mr mathew and some amateur who be almost equal to any professional actor he attempt be of course chiefly in broad farce and roar burlesque in which he comic face with its look of mock gravity and the twinkle of the eye itself excited roar of laughter whether he would have succeed as well in sober comedy or upon public board may well be doubt probably he would not have give to the profession that careful attention and entire devotion that be necessary to bring forward properly the highest natural talent it be say that for a long time he be anxious to take to the stage as a profession but perhaps -- as the event seem to show -- unfortunately for he he be dissuade from what he friend must have think a very rash step and in after year he take a violent dislike to the profession certainly the stage could not have offer more temptation than do the society in which he afterwards mixed and perhaps under any circumstance hook whose moral education have be neglect and whose principle be never very good would have live a life more or less vicious though he might not have die as he do hook however be not long in come very prominently before the public in another capacity of all story tell about he none be more common or more popular than those which relate to he practical joke and hoax thank heaven the world no longer see amusement in the misery of other and the fashion of such clever performance be go out it be fair however to premise that while the cleverest of hook 's hoax be of a victimize character a large number be just the reverse and he admirer affirm not without some reason that when he have get a dinner out of a person whom he do not know by a ingenious lie admirably support he fully pay for it in the amusement he afford he host and the ringing metal of he wit as we have all be boy -- except those that be girl -- and not all of we very good boy we can appreciate that passion for robbery which begin with orchard and pass on to knocker it be difficult to sober middle-age to imagine what entertainment there can be in that breach of the eighth commandment which be generally regard as innocent as sheridan swindle in fun so hook as a young man rob in fun as hundred of medical student and other have do before and since hook however be a proficient in the art and would have make a successful ` cracksman ' have he be bear in the seven dial he collect a complete museum of knocker bell-pull wooden highlander barber ' pole and shop sign of all sort on one occasion he devote a whole fortnight to the abstraction of a golden eagle over a shop window by means of a lasso a fellow dilettante in the art have confidentially inform he of its whereabouts add that he himself despair of ever obtain it at length hook invite he friend to dinner and on the removal of the cover of what be suppose to be the joint the work of art appear serve up and appropriately garnish theodore be radiant with triumph but the friend probably think that there ought to be honor among thief be highly indignant at be thus surpass another achievement of this kind be the robbery of a life-sized highlander who grace the door of some unsuspecting tobacconist there be little difficulty in the mere displacement of the figure the troublesome part of the business be to get the bare legged celt home to the museum where probably many a lilliputian of he race be already await he a cloak a hat and hook 's ready wit effect the transfer the first be throw over he the second set upon he bonneted head and a pass hackney coach hail by he captor who before the unsuspecting driver could descend have open the door push in the prize and whisper to jehu ` my friend -- very respectable man but rather tipsy ' how he manage to get he out again at the end of the journey we be not tell hook be soon a successful and valuable writer of light piece for the stage but farce do not live and few of hook 's be now favorite with a public which be always athirst for something new the incident of most of the piece -- many of they borrow from the french -- excited laughter by they very improbability but the wit which enliven they be not of a high order and hook though so much more recent than sheridan have disappear before he but he hoax be far more famous than he collection of curiosity and quite as much to the purpose and the imprudence he display in they be only equal by the quaintness of the humor which suggest they who else would have ever think for instance of cover a white horse with black wafer and drive it in a gig along a welsh high-road merely for the satisfaction of be stare at it be almost worthy of barnum or who with less assurance could have play so admirably on the credulity of a lady and daughter fresh from the country as he do at the trial of lord melville the lady who stand next to he be naturally anxious to understand the proceedings and betray she ignorance at once by a remark which she make to she daughter about the procession of the lord into the house when the bishop enter in full episcopal costume she apply to hook to know who be ` those gentleman ' ` gentleman ' quoth hook with charming simplicity ` lady i think you mean at any rate those be the dowager peeress in they own right ' question follow question as the procession come on and theodore indulge he fancy more and more at length the speaker in full robe become the subject of inquiry ` and pray sir who be that fine look person ' -- ` that ma'am be cardinal wolsey ' be the calm and audacious reply this be too much even for sussex and the lady draw herself up in majestic indignation ` we know better than that sir ' she reply : ` cardinal wolsey have be dead many a good year ' theodore be unmoved ` no such thing my dear madam ' he answer without the slightest sign of perturbation : ' i know it have be generally report so in the country but without the slightest foundation the newspaper you know will say anything ' but the hoax of hoax the one which fill the papers of the time for several day and which eventually make its author the very prince of hoaxster if such a term can be admit be that of berner street never perhaps be so much trouble expend or so much attention devote to so frivolous a object in berner street there live a elderly lady who for no reason that can be ascertain have excite the animosity of the young theodore hook who be then just of age six week be spend in preparation and three person engage in the affair letter be send off in every direction and theodore hook 's autograph if it could have any value must have be somewhat low in the market at that period from the number of application which he write on the day in question he

feeling of tradesman professional man gentleman nobleman and grand official who have be summon from distant spot by artful lure to no 54 and there battle with a crowd in vain only to find that there be hoax people who have thus lose both time and money can be neither describe nor imagine it be not the idea of the hoax -- simple enough in itself -- which be entitle to the admiration accord to ingenuity but its extent and success and the clever means take by the conspirator to insure the attendance of every one who ought not to have be there it be only late at night that the police succeed in clear the street and the dupe retire murmuring and vow vengeance hook however glory in the exploit which he think ` perfect ' but the hoax dearest to theodore -- for there be something to be gain by it -- be that by which he manage to obtain a dinner when either too hard-up to pay for one or in the humor for a little amusement no one who have not live as a bachelor in london and be reduce -- in respect of coin -- to the sum of twopence-halfpenny can tell how excellent a strop be hunger to sharpen wit upon we all know that ` mortal with stomach can not live without dinner ' and in hook 's day the substitute of ` heavy tea ' be not invent necessity be very soon bring to bed when a man put he finger into he pocket find they untenanted and remember that the only friend who would consent to lend he five shilling be go out of town and the infant invention presently smile into the nurse 's face but it be no uncommon thing in those day for gentleman to invite themselves where they list and stay as long as they like it be only necessary for they to make themselves really agreeable and deceive they host in some way or other hook 's friend little tom hill of whom it be say that he know everybody 's affair far better than they do themselves be famous for examine kitchen about the hour of dinner and quietly select he host accord to the odour of the viand it be of he that the old ` joe miller ' be tell of the ` haunch of venison ' invite to dinner at one house he _ happen _ to glance down into the kitchen of the next and see a tempting haunch of venison on the spit throw over the inviter and ingratiate himself with he neighbor who end by ask he to stay to dinner the fare however consist of nothing more luxurious than a irish stew and the disappointed guest be inform that he have be ` too cunning by half ' inasmuch as the venison belong to he original inviter and have be cook in the house he be in by kind permission because the chimney of the owner 's kitchen smoke the same principle often actuate theodore and indeed there be few story which can be tell of this characteristic of the great frolicker which have not be tell a century of time for instance : two young man be stroll towards 5 pm in the then fashionable neighborhood of soho the one be terry the actor -- the other hook the actor for surely he deserve the title they pass a house and sniff the viand cooking underground hook quietly announce he intention of dine _ there _ he enter be admit and announce by the servant mingle with the company and be quite at home before he be perceive by the host at last the _ dénouement _ come the dinner-giver approach the stranger and with great politeness ask he name ` smith ' be of course the reply and revert to mistake make by servant in announce & c ` smith ' hurry off into a amusing story to put he host in good humor the conversation that follow be take from ` ingoldsby ' : -- ` but really my dear sir ' the host put in ' i think the mistake on the present occasion do not originate in the source you allude to i certainly do not anticipate the honor of mr smith 's company to-day ' ` no i dare say not you say _ four _ in you note i know and it be now i see a quarter past five but the fact be i have be detain in the city as i be go to explain -- ' ` pray ' say the host ` whom do you suppose you be address ' ` whom why mr thompson of course old friend of my father i have not the pleasure indeed of be personally know to you but have receive you kind invitation yesterday ' & c & c ` no sir my name be not thompson but jone ' in highly indignant accent ` jone ' be the well-acted answer : ` why surely i can not have -- yes i must -- good heaven i see it all my _ dear _ sir what a unfortunate blunder wrong house -- what must you think of such a intrusion i be really at a loss for word in which to apologize you will permit I to retire at present and to-morrow -- ' ` pray do not think of retire ' rejoin the host take with the appearance and manner of the young man ` you friend 's table must have be clear long ago if as you say four be the hour name and i be too happy to be able to offer you a seat at mine ' it may be easily conceive that the invitation have not to be very often repeat and hook keep the risible muscle of the company upon the constant stretch and pay for the entertainment in the only coin with which he be well supply there be more wit however in he visit to a retired watchmaker who have get from government a premium of # 10000 for the best chronometer hook be very partial to journey in search of adventure a gig a lively companion and sixpence for the first turnpike be generally all that be requisite ingenuity supply the rest it be on one of these excursion that hook and he friend find themselves in the neighborhood of uxbridge with a horse and a gig and not a sixpence to be find in any pocket now a horse and gig be property but of what use be a valuable of which you can not dispose or deposit at a pawnbroker 's while you be prevent proceed on you way by that neat white gate with the neat white box of a house at its side the only alternative leave to the young man be to drive home again dinnerless a distance of twenty mile with a jaded horse or to find gratuitous accommodation for man and beast in such a case sheridan would simply have drive to the first inn and by persuasion or stratagem contrived to elude payment after have drunk the best wine and eat the best dinner the house could afford hook be really more refine as well as bolder in he pillage the villa of the retire tradesman be perceive and the gig soon draw up before the door the stranger be usher in to the watchmaker and hook with great politeness and a serious respectful look address he he say that he feel he be take a great liberty -- so he be -- but that he could not pass the door of a man who have do the country so much service by the invention of what must prove the most useful and valuable instrument without express to he the gratitude which he as a british subject devoted to he country 's good could not but feel towards the inventor & c & c the flattery be so delicately and so seriously insinuate that the worthy citizen could only receive it as a honest expression of sincere admiration the rubicon be pass a little lively conversation artfully make attractive by hook follow and the watchmaker be more and more gratified he feel too what a honor it would be to entertain two real gentleman and remark that they be far from town bring out at last the longed-for invitation which be of course decline as out of the question thereupon the old gentleman become press : the young stranger be at last prevail upon to accept it and very full justice they do to the larder and cellar of the successful chronometer-maker there be nothing very original in the act of hoaxing and hook 's way of get a hackney-coach without pay for it be perhaps suggest by sheridan 's but be more laughable finding himself in the vehicle and know that there be nothing either in he purse or at home to pay the fare he cast about for expedient and at last remember the address of a eminent surgeon in the neighborhood he order the coachman to drive to he house and knock violently at the door which be no sooner open than hook rush in terribly agitate demand to see the doctor to whom in a few incoherent and agitate sentence he give to understand that he wife need he service immediately be on the point of become a mother ' i will start directly ' reply the surgeon ' i will order my carriage at once ' ` but my dear sir there be not a moment to spare i have a coach at the door jump into that ' the surgeon obey the name and address give be those of a middle-aged spinster of the most rigid virtue we can imagine she indignation and how sharply she ring the bell when the surgeon have delicately explain the object of he visit and how eagerly he take refuge in the coach hook have of course walk quietly away in the meantime and the galenite have to pay the demand of jehu the hoax story of theodore hook be numberless hoaxing be the fashion of the day and a childish fashion too charle mathew whose face possess the flexibility of a acrobat 's body and who could assume any character or disguise on the shortest notice be he great confederate in these plot the bank of the thame be they great resort at one point there be mathew talk gibberish in a disguise intend to represent the spanish ambassador and actually deceive the woolwich authority by he clever impersonation at another there be hook landing uninvited with he friend upon the well-known sleek-looking lawn of a testy little gentleman draw out a note-book and talk so authoritatively about the survey for a canal to be undertake by government that the owner of the lawn become frightened and in he anxiety attempt to conciliate the mighty self-made official by the offer of dinner -- of course accept -lrb- illustration : theodore hook 's engineering frolic -rrb- then the _ arcade ambo _ show off they jest trick at croydon fair a most suitable place for they on one occasion hook personate a madman accuse mathew ` he brother ' of keep he out of he rights and in he custody the whole fair collect around they and begin to sympathise with hook who beg they to aid in he escape from he ` brother ' a sham escape and sham capture take place and the party adjourn to the inn where mathew who have be take by surprise by the new part suddenly play by he confederate seize upon a hearse which draw up before the inn on its return from a funeral persuade the company to bind the ` madman ' who be now become furious and who would have deposit he in the gloomy vehicle if he have not succeed in snap he fetter and so escape in short they be two boy with the sole difference that they have sufficient talent and experience of the world to maintain admirably the part they assume but a far more famous and more admirable talent in theodore than that of deception be that of improvise the art of improvise belong to italy and the tyrol the wonderful gift of ready verse to express satire and ridicule seem as a rule to be confine to the inhabitant of those two land other be indeed scatter over the world who possess this gift but very sparsely theodore hook stand almost alone in this country as a improviser yet to judge of such of he verse as have be preserve take down from memory or what not the grand effect of they -- and no doubt it _ be _ grand -- must have be owe more to he manner and he act than to any intrinsic value in the verse themselves which be for the most part slight and devoid of actual wit though abound in pun sheridan 's testimony to the wonderful power of the man be perhaps more valuable than that of any one else for he be a good judge both of verse and of wit one of hook 's earliest display of he talent be at a dinner give by the drury lane actor to sheridan at the piazza coffee house in 1808 here as usual hook sit down to the piano and touch off a few chord give verse after verse on all the event of the entertainment on each person present though he now see many of they for the first time and on anything connect with the matter of interest before they sheridan be delighted and declare that he could not have believe such a faculty possible if he have not witness its effect : that no description ` could have convince he of so peculiar a instance of genius ' and so forth one of he most extraordinary effort in this line be relate by mr jerdan a dinner be give by mansell reynold to lockhart luttrell coleridge hook tom hill and other the grown-up schoolboy pretty far go in falernian of a home-made and very homely vintage amuse themselves by break the wine-glass till coleridge be set to demolish the last of they with a fork throw at it from the side of the table let it not be suppose that any teetotal spirit suggest this inconoclasm far from it -- the glass be too small and the poet the wit the punster the jester prefer to drink they port out of tumbler after dinner hook give one of he song which satirize successively and successfully each person present he be then challenge to improvise on any give subject and by way of one as far distant from poetry as could be _ cocoa-nut oil _ be fix upon theodore accept the challenge and after a moment 's consideration begin he lay with a description of the mauritius which he know so well the negro dance round the cocoa-nut tree the process of extract the oil and so forth all in excellent rhyme and rhythm if not actual poetry then come the voyage to england hit at the italian warehouseman and so on till the oil be bring into the very lamp before they in that very room to show they with the light it feed and make they able to break wine-glass and get drunk from tumbler this we may be sure hook himself do for one and the rest be probably not much behind he in late life this gift of hook 's -- improvise i mean not get intoxicate -- be he highest recommendation in society and at the same time he bane like sheridan he be ruin by he wonderful natural power it can well be imagine that to improvise in the manner in which hook do it and at a moment 's notice require some effort of the intellect this effort become greater as circumstance depress he spirit more and more and yet with every care upon he mind he be expect wherever he go to amuse the guest with a display of he talent he could not do so without stimulant and rather than give up society fall into habit of drinking which hasten he death we have throw together the foregoing anecdote of hook irrespective of time in order to show what the man 's gift be and what he title to be consider a wit we must proceed more steadily to a review of he life successful as hook have prove as a writer for the stage he suddenly and without any sufficient cause rush off into another branch of literature that of novel-writing he first attempt in this kind of fiction be ` the man of sorrow ' publish under the _ nom de plume _ of _ alfr allendale _ this be not as its name would seem to imply a novel of pathetic cast but the history of a gentleman whose life from begin to end be render wretched by a succession of mishap of the most ludicrous but improbable kind indeed theodore 's novel like he stage-piece be go out of date in a age so practical that even in romance it will not allow of the slightest departure from reality they very style be ephemeral and they interest could not outlast the generation to amuse which they be pen this first novel be write when hook be one-and-twenty soon after he be send to oxford where he have be enter at st mary 's hall more affectionately know by the nickname of ` skimmery ' no selection could have be worse skimmery be at that day and until quite recently a den of thief where young man of fortune and folly submit to be pillage in return for be allow perfect licence as much to eat as they could possibly swallow and far more to drink than be at all good for they it have require all the enterprise of the present excellent principal to convert it into a place of sober study it be then the most ` gentlemanly ' residence in oxford for a gentleman in those day mean a man who do nothing spend he own or he father 's guinea with a brilliant indifference to consequence and who apply he mind solely to the art of frolic it be the very place where hook would be encourage instead of restrain in he natural propensity and have he remain there he would probably have ruin himself and he father long before he have put on the sleeve at the matriculation itself he give a specimen of he ` fun ' when ask accord to the usual form ` if he be willing to sign the thirty-nine article ' he reply ` certainly sir _ forty _ if you please ' the gravity of the stern vice-chancellor be upset but as no oxford don can ever pardon a joke however good master theodore be very nearly be dismiss have not he brother by this time a prebendary of winchester and ` a honor to he college sir ' intercede in he favor the night before he have give a still better specimen of he effrontery he have pick up a number of old harrovian with whom he have repair to a tavern for song supper and sociability and as usual in such case in the lap of alma mater the babe become sufficiently intoxicated and not a little uproarious drinking in a tavern be forbid by oxonian statute and one of the proctor happen to pass in the street outside be attract into the house by the sound of somewhat unscholastic merriment the effect can be imagine all the youth be in absolute terror except theodore and look in vain for some way to escape the wary and faithful ` bulldog ' guard the doorway the marshal predecessor of the modern omniscient brown advanced respectfully behind the proctor into the room and pass a penetrate glance from one youth to the other all of whom -- except theodore again -- he know by sight -- for that be the pride and pleasure of a marshal -- mentally registered they name in secret hope of get half-a-crown a-piece to forget they again no mortal be more respectful in he manner of accost you than a oxford proctor for he may make a mistake and a mistake may make he very miserable when for instance a highly respectable lady be the other day lodge in spite of protestation in the ` procuratorial room ' and there lock up on suspicion of be somebody very different the over-zealous proctor who have order she incarceration be sue for damages for # 300 and have to pay they too therefore the gentleman in question most graciously and suavely inquire of mr theodore hook -- ' i beg you pardon sir but be you a member of this university ' -- the usual form ` no sir i be not be you ' the suavity at once change to grave dignity the proctor lift up the hem of he garment which be of broad velvet with the selvage on it be one of the insignia of he office and sternly say -- ` you see this sir ' ` ah ' say hook cool as ever and quietly feel the material which he examine with apparent interest ' i see manchester velvet : and may i take the liberty sir of inquire how much you have pay per yard for the article ' a roar of laughter from all present burst forth with such vehemence that it shoot the poor official red with suppress anger into the street again and the merrymaker continue they bout till the approach of midnight when they be oblige to return to they respective college have theodore proceed in this way for several term no doubt the outraged authority would have add he name to the list of the great man whom they have expel from time to time most unprophetically as it be he soon leave the grove of academus and seek those of fashion in town he matriculation into this new university be much more auspicious he be hail in society as already fit to take a degree of bachelor of he particular art and ere long he improvise he fun he mirth -- as yet natural and over-boiling -- he wicked punning and he tender wickedness induce the same institution to offer he the grade of ` master ' of those art in after year he rise to be even ` doctor ' and many perhaps be the mind diseased to which he well-known mirth minister it be during this period that some of he talent be display in the manner we have describe though he great fame as a improvisatore be establish more completely in later day yet he have already make himself a name in that species of wit -- not a very high one -- which find favor with the society of that period we allude to imitation ` take off ' and pun the last contemptible branch of wit-making now happily confine to ` punch ' be as old as variety of language it be not possible with simple vocabulary and accordingly be seldom meet with in purely-derived language yet we have roman and greek pun and english be peculiarly adapt to this childish exercise because be make up of several language it necessarily contain many word which be like in sound and unlike in mean punning be in fact the vice of english wit the temptation of english mirth-maker and at last we trust the scorn of english good sense but in theodore 's day it hold a high place and man who have no real wit about they could twist and turn word and combination of word with great ingenuity and much readiness to the delight of they listener pun-making be a fashion among the conversationist of that day and take the place of better wit hook be a disgraceful punster and a successful one he string pun together by the score -- nothing more easy -- in he improvise song and conversation take a instance from he quiz on the march of intellect : -- ` hackney-coachman from _ swift _ shall reply if you feel annoyed at be needlessly shake and butcher of course be flippant from _ steele _ and pig-driver well verse in _ bacon _ from _ locke _ shall the blacksmith authority brave and gas-man cite _ coke _ at discretion undertaker talk _ gay _ as they go to the _ grave _ and waterman _ rowe _ by profession ' i have know a party of naturally stupid people produce a whole century of pun one after another on any subject that present itself and i be incline to think that nothing can at the same time be more nauseous or more destructive to real wit yet theodore 's strength lay in pun and when shear of they the philistine might well laugh at he want of strength surely he title to wit do not lie in that direction however he amuse and that grati and a amusing man make he way anywhere if he have only sufficient tact not to abuse he privilege hook grow great in london society for a time and might have grow greater if a change have not come he have support himself up to 1812 almost entirely by he pen : and the goose-quill be rarely a staff though it may sometimes be a walking-stick it be clear that he need -- what so many of we need and can not get -- a certainty happy fellow he might have beg for a appointment for year in vain as many another do but it fall into he lap no one know how and at four-and-twenty mr theodore edward hook be make treasurer to the island of mauritius with a salary of # 2000 per annum this be not to be and be not despise in spite of climate mosquito and so forth hook take the money and sail we have no intention of enter minutely upon he conduct in this office which have nothing to do with he character as a wit there be a thousand and one reason for believe he guilty of the charge bring against he and a thousand and one for suppose he guiltless here be a young man gay jovial give to society entirely and not at all to arithmetic put into a very try and awkward position -- native clerk who would cheat if they could english governor who would find fault if they could a disturbed treasury a awkward currency liar for witness and undeniable evidence of defalcation in a word a examination be make into the state of the treasury of the island and a large deficit find it remain to trace it home to its original author hook have not acquire the best character in the island those who know the official dignity of a small british colony can well understand how he pleasantry must have shock those worthy big-wig who exalt from pump court temple or paradise row old brompton to place of honor and high salary ride they high horse with twice the exclusiveness of those ` to the manner bear ' for instance hook be once by a mere chance oblige to take the chair at a official dinner on which occasion the toast propose by the chairman be to be accompany by a salute from gun without hook go through the list and seem to enjoy toast-drinking so much that he be quite sorry to have come to the end of it and continue as if still from the list to propose successively the health of each officer present the gunner be grow quite weary but have they order dare not complain hook be delighted and go on to the amazement and amusement of all who be not tire of the noise each youthful sub take by surprise be quite gratified at the honor do he at last there be no one leave to toast but the wine have take effect and hook amid roar of laughter inside and roar of savage artillery without propose the health of the waiter who have so ably officiate this do he bethink he of the cook who be send for to return thanks but the artillery officer have by this time get wind of the affair and feeling that more than enough powder have be waste on the health of gentleman who be determine to destroy it by the number of they potation take on himself the responsibility of order the gunner to stop on another occasion he incur the displeasure of the governor general hall by fight a duel -- fortunately as harmless as that of moore and jeffrey -- ` when little 's leadless pistol meet he eye and bow-street myrmidon stand laughing by ' as byron say the governor be sensible enough to wish to put down the ` gothic appeal to arm ' and be therefore the more irate these circumstance must be take into consideration in hook 's favor in examine the charge of embezzlement it must also be state that the information of the deficit be send in a letter to the governor by a man name allan chief clerk in the treasury who have for irregular conduct be already threaten with dismissal allan have admit that he have know of the deficit for fifteen month and yet he have not till he be himself in trouble thought of make it know to the proper authority before he examination which of course follow could be conclude allan committed suicide now do it not on the face of it seem of the highest probability that this man be the real delinquent and that know that hook have all the responsibility and have take fair precaution against he own detection he have anticipate a discovery of the affair by a revelation incriminate the treasurer _ quien sabe _ -- dead man tell no tale the chest however be examine and the deficit find far greater yet than have be report hook could not explain could not understand it at all but if not criminal he have necessarily be careless he be arrest throw into prison and by the first vessel despatch to england to take he trial he property of every kind have be sell for the government hook in utter destitution might be suppose to have lose he usual spirit but he could not resist a joke at st helena he meet a old friend go out to the cape who surprise at see he on he return voyage after a residence of only five year say : ' i hope you be not go home for you health ' -- ` why ' say theodore ' i be sorry to say they think there be something wrong in the _ chest _ something wrong in the chest ' become henceforward the ordinary phrase in london society in refer to hook 's scrape arrive in england he be set free the government here have decide that he could not be criminally try and thus hook guilty or not have be ruin and disgrace for life for simple carelessness true the custody of a nation 's property make negligence almost criminal but that do not excuse the punishment of a man before he be try he be summon however to the colonial audit board where he undergo a try examination after which he be declare to be in the debt of government : a writ of extent be issue against he nine month be pass in that delightful place of residence -- a sponging-house which he then exchange for the ` rule of the bench ' -- the only rule which have no exception from these he be at last liberate in 1825 on the understanding that he be to repay the money to government if at any time he should be in a position to do so he liberation be a tacit acknowledgment of he innocence of the charge of robbery he encumberment with a debt cause by another 's delinquency be we presume a signification of he responsibility and some kind of punishment for he carelessness certainly it be hard upon hook that if innocent he should not have go forth without a stain on he character for honesty and it be unjust that if guilty he should not have be punish the judgment be one of those compromise with stern justice which be seldom satisfactory to either party the fact be that guilty or not guilty hook have be both incompetent and inconsiderate doubtless he congratulate himself highly on receive at the age of twenty-five a appointment worth # 2000 a year in the paradise of the world but how short-sighted he satisfaction since this very appointment leave he some ten year later a pauper to begin life anew with a indelible stain on he character it be absurd to give so young a man such a post but it be absolutely wrong in hook not to do he utmost to carry out he duty properly nay he have trifle with the public money in the same liberal -- perhaps a _ more _ liberal -- spirit as if it have be he own -- make advance and loan here and there injudiciously and take little heed of the consequence probably at this day the common opinion acquit hook of a design and complicate fraud but common opinion never do acquit he of misconduct and even by he friend this affair be look upon with a suspicion that prefer silence to examination but why take such pain to exonerate hook from a charge of robbery when he be avowedly guilty of as bad a sin of which the law take no cognizance and which society forgive far more easily than it could have do for rob the state soon after he return from the mauritius he take lodgings in the cheap but unfashionable neighborhood of somer town here in the moment of he misfortune when doubt whether disgrace imprisonment or what not await he he seek solace in the affection of a young woman of a class certainly much beneath he and of a character unfit to make she a valuable companion to he hook have receive little moral training and have he do so he impulse be sufficiently strong to overcome any amount of principle with this person -- to use the modern slang which seem to convert a glaring sin into a social misdemeanor -- ` he form a connection ' in other word he destroy she virtue hateful as such a act be we must before we can condemn a man for it without any recommendation to mercy consider a score of circumstance which have render the temptation stronger and the result almost involuntary hook be not a man of high moral character -- very far from it -- but we need not therefore suppose that he sit down coolly and deliberately like a villain in a novel to effect the girl 's ruin but the rubicon once pass how difficult be the retreat there be but two path open to a man who would avoid live a life of sin : the one to marry he victim the other to break off the connection before it be too late the first be of course the more proper course but there be case where marriage be impossible from the latter a man of any heart must shrink with horror yet there _ be _ case even where the one sin will prove the least -- where she who have love too well may grieve bitterly at parting yet will be no more open to temptation than if she have never fall such case be rare and it be not probable that the young person with whom hook have become connect would have retrieve the fatal error she become a mother and there be no retreat it be clear that hook ought to have marry she it be evident that he be selfish and wrong not to do so -- yet he shrink from it weakly wickedly and he be punish for he shrink he have sufficient feeling not to throw he victim over yet he be content to live a life of sin and to keep she in such a life this be perhaps the blackest stain on hook 's character when fox marry in consequence of a similar connection he ` settle down ' retrieve he early error and become a better man morally than he have ever be hook _ ought _ to have marry it be the cowardly dread of public opinion that deter he from do so and in consequence he be never happy and feel that this connection be a perpetual burden to he wreck and ruin hook have no resource but he literary talent and it be to be deplore that he should have prostitute these to serve a ungentlemanly and dishonourable party in they onslaught upon a unfortunate woman whatever may be now think of the queen of ` the greatest gentleman ' -- or _ roue _ -- of europe those who hunt she down will never be pardon and hook be one of those we have cry out against a austrian general for condemn a hungarian lady to the lash and we have see with delight a mob chase he through the street of london and threaten he very life but we have not only pardon but even praise we favorite wit for far worse conduct than this even if we allow which we do not chat the queen be one half as bad as she enemy or rather she husband 's parasite would make she out we can not forgive the man who shield by they incognito and perfectly free from danger of any kind set upon a woman with libel invective ballad epigram and lampoon which a lady could scarcely read and of which a royal lady and many a english gentlewoman too be the butt the vilest of all the vile papers of that day be the ` john bull ' now settle down to a quiet periodical perhaps the real john bull heavy good-natured lumberer as he be be never worse represent than in this journal which bear he name but have little of he kindly spirit hook be its originator and for a long time its main supporter scurrility scandal libel baseness of all kind form the fuel with which it blaze and the wit bitter unflinching unsparing which puff the flame up be its chief recommendation no more disgraceful climax be ever reach by a disgraceful dynasty of profligate than that which find a king of england -- long as regent the leader of the profligate and degrade -- at war with he injured queen none have deserve better the honest gratitude of they country than those who like henry brougham defend the oppressed woman in spite of opposition obloquy and ridicule but we need not go deeply into a history so fresh in the mind of all as that blot which show john bull himself uphold a wretched dissipate monarch against a wife who whatever she fault be still a woman and whatever she spirit -- for she have much of it and show it grandly at need -- be still a lady suffice it to say that ` john bull ' be the most violent of the periodical that attack she and that theodore hook no puritan himself be the principal writer in that paper if you can imagine ` punch ' turn conservative incorporate in one paper with the ` morning herald ' so that a column of news be print side by side with one of a jocular character and these two together devote without principle to the support of a party the attack of whiggism and a unblushing detraction of the character of one of we princess you can form some idea of what ` john bull ' be in those day there be however a difference : ` punch ' attack public character and ridicule public event ` john bull ' drag out the most retire from they privacy and attack they with calumny for which often there be no foundation then again ` punch ' be not nearly so bitter as be ` john bull : ' there be not in the ` london charivarus ' a determination to say everything that spite can invent against any particular set or party there be a good nature still in master ` punch ' it be quite the reverse in ` john bull ' establish for one purpose and devote to that yet the wit in theodore 's paper do not rise much higher than that of we modern laughing philosopher of hook 's contribution the most remarkable be the ` ramsbottom letter ' in which mr lavinium dorothea ramsbottom describe all the _ memory billion _ of she various tour at home and abroad always of course with more or less allusion to political affair the ` fun ' of these letter be very inferior to that of ` jeame ' or of the ` snob papers ' and consist more in malaprop absurdity and a wide range of bad pun than in any real wit display in they of the style of both we take a extract anywhere : -- ` oh mr bull room be raley a beautiful place we enter it by the point of molly which be just like the point and sally at porchmouth only they call sally there port which be not know in room the tiber be a nice river it look yellow but it do the same there as the thame do here we hire a carry-lettz and a cocky-olly to take we to the church of salt peter which be prodigious big in the center of the pizarro there be a basilisk very high on the right and leave two handsome foundling and the farcy as mr fulmer call it be ornament with collateral statute of some of the apostate ' we can quite imagine that hook write many of these letter when excite by wine some be laughable enough but the majority be so deplorably stupid reek with pun and scurrility that when the temporary interest be go there be nothing leave to attract the reader it be scarcely possible to laugh at the joe-millerish mistake the old world pun and the trite story of hook ` remain ' remain indeed they have better have remain where they be besides prose of this kind hook contribute various jingle -- there be no other name for they -- arrange to popular tune and intend to become favorite with the country people these like the prose effusion serve the purpose of a hour and have no interest now whether they be ever really popular remain to be prove certe they be forget now and long since even in the most conservative corner of the country many of these have the appearance of have be originally _ recitati _ and they amusement must have depend chiefly on the face and manner of the singer -- hook himself but in some he display that vice of rhyming which have often make nonsense go down and which be tolerable only when introduce in the satire of a ` don juan ' or the first-rate mimicry of ` reject address ' hook have a most wonderful facility in concoct out-of-the-way rhyme and a few verse from he song on club will suffice for a good specimen of he talent : -- ` if any man love comfort and have little cash to buy it he should get into a crowded club -- a most select society while solitude and mutton-cutlet serve _ infelix

that lady of a certain position give out that they would not receive any one who take in this paper it be scurrilous to the last degree and theodore hook be the soul of it he preserve he incognito so well that in spite of all attempt to unearth he it be many year before he could be certainly fix upon as a writer in its column he even go to the length of write letter and article against himself in order to disarm suspicion hook now live and thrive purely on literature he publish many novel -- go where the bad novel go and unread in the present day unless in some remote country town which boast only a very meager circulate library improbability take the place of natural painting in they pun supply that of better wit and personal portraiture be so freely use that he most intimate friend -- old mathew for instance -- do not escape meanwhile hook make a good fortune return to he convivial life and the enjoyment -- if enjoyment it be -- of general society he ` throw out he bow window ' on the strength of he success with ` john bull ' and spend much more than he have he mingle freely in all the london circle of thirty year ago whose glory be still fresh in the mind of most of we and everywhere he talent as a improvisatore and he conversational power make he a general favorite unhappy popularity for hook he who be yet deeply in debt to the nation -- who have a illegitimate family to maintain who owe in many quarter more than he could ever hope to pay -- be still fool enough to entertain largely and receive both noble and wit in the handsomest manner why do he not live quietly why not like fox marry the unhappy woman whom he have make the mother of he child and content himself with trim vine and rear tulip why forsooth because he be theodore hook thoughtless and foolish to the last the jester of the people must need be a fool let he take it to he conscience that he be not as much a knave in he latter year hook take to the two dissipation most likely to bring he into misery -- play and drink he be utterly unfitted for the former be too gay a spirit to sit down and calculate chance he lose considerably and the more he lose the more he play drinking become almost a necessity with he he have a reputation to keep up in society and have not the moral courage to retire from it altogether write improvise conviviality play demand stimulant he mind be overwork in every sense he have recourse to the only remedy and in drinking he find a temporary relief from anxiety and a short-lived sustenance there be no doubt that this man who have amuse london circle for many year hasten he end by drink it be not yet thirty year since theodore hook die he leave the world on August the 24th 1841 and by this time he remain in the memory of man only as a wit that be a punster a hoaxer a sorry jester with a ample fund of fun but not as a great man in any way allow everything for he education -- the time he live in and the unhappy error of he early life -- we may admit that hook be not in character the worst of the wit he die in no odour of sanctity but he be not a blasphemer or reviler like other of this class he ignore the bond of matrimony yet he remain faithful to the woman he have betray he be undoubtedly careless in the one responsible office with which he be intrust yet he can not be tax take all in all with deliberate peculation he drinking and playing be bad -- very bad he improper connection be bad -- very bad but perhaps the worst feature in he career be he connection with ` john bull ' and he ready give in to a system of low libel there be no excuse for this but the necessity of living but hook have he retain any principle might have make enough to live upon in a more honest manner he name do certainly not stand out well among the wit of

1784 uncertain to what profession to belong somewhat anxious to be a bookseller in order to revel in ` the paradise of book ' he turn he attention however to medicine and become a brunonian that be a disciple of john brown the founder of a theory which he follow out to the extent in practice the main feature of the now defunct system which set scientific europe in a blaze seem to have be a mad

the small quiet dinner give by mackintosh when live out of parliament and out of office in cadogan place simple but genial be those repast form a strong contrast to the edinburgh dinner of yore he have then long give up both the theory and practice of the brunonian and take nothing but light french and german wine and these in moderation he tall somewhat high-shouldered massive form he calm

the sense to await for better time at home yet smith 's opinion of mackintosh be that ` he never see so theoretical a head which contain so much practical understanding ' and to jeffrey he write : `

circumstance be still limited # 50 a year as evening preacher to the foundling hospital be esteem as a great help by he the writer of this memoir remember a amusing anecdote related of he at the table of a eminent literary character by a member of lord woodhouselee 's family who have be desirous to obtain for sydney the patronage of the godly to this end she persuade robert grant and charle grant -lrb- afterwards lord glenelg -rrb- to go to the foundling to hear he she hope to advantage to she consternation he break forth into so familiar a strain couch in term so border on the jocose -- though no one have deeper religious conviction than he have -- that the two saintly brother listen in disgust they forget how south let loose the power of he wit and sarcasm and how the lofty-minded jeremy taylor apply the force of humor to lighten the prolixity of argument sydney smith become nevertheless a most popular preacher but the man who prevent people from sleep once a week in they pew be sure to be criticise let we turn to he however as a member of society he circle of acquaintance be enlarged not only by he visit to holland house but by he lecture on moral philosophy at the royal institution sir robert peel not the most impressionable of man but one whose cold shake of the hand be say -- as sydney smith say of sir jame mackintosh -- ` to have come under the genus _ mortmain _ ' be a very young man at the time when albemarle street be crowd with carriage from one end of the street to the other in consequence of sydney smith 's lecture yet he declare that he have never

to celebrity as have be the residence not only of sydney smith but of charle dickens -- be too far for the _ habitué _ of holland house and the orator of albemarle street long to sojourn there in orchard street sydney enjoy that domestic comfort which he call ` the grammar of life ' delightful supper to about twenty or thirty person who come and go as they please a great part of the same amusing and gifted set use to meet once a week also at sir jame mackintosh 's at a supper which though not exactly cowper 's ` radish and a egg ' be simple but plentiful -- yet most eagerly seek after ` there be a few living ' write sydney smith 's daughter ` who can look back to they and i have always find they do so with a sigh of regret ' one night a country cousin of sydney smith 's be present at a supper ` now sydney ' whisper the simple girl ' i know all these be very remarkable people do tell I who they be ' -- ` oh yes there be hannibal ' point to a grave dry stern man mr whishaw ` he lose he leg in the carthagenian war : there be socrate ' point to luttrell : ` that ' he add turn to horner ` be solon ' another evening mackintosh bring a raw scotch cousin -- a ensign in a highland regiment -- with he the young man 's head could carry no idea of glory except in regimental suddenly nudge sir jame he whisper ` be that the great sir sydney smith ' -- ` yes yes ' answer sir jame and instantly tell sydney who he be suppose to be the grave evening preacher at the foundling immediately assume the character ascribe to he and act the hero of acre to perfection fight he battle over again -- even charge the turk -- whilst the young scot be so enchanted by the great sir sydney 's condescension that he want to fetch the piper of he regiment and pipe to the great sir sydney who have never enjoy the agonizing strain of the bagpipe upon this the party break up and sir jame carry the highlander off lest he should find out he mistake and cut he throat from shame and vexation one may readily conceive sydney smith 's enjoy this joke for he spirit be those of a boy : he gaiety be irresistible he ringing laugh infectious but it be difficult for those who know mackintosh in he later year -- the quiet almost pensive invalid to realize in that remembrance any trace of the mackintosh of doughty street and orchard street day one day sydney smith come home with two hackney coach full of picture which he have pick up at a auction he daughter thus tell the story : ` another day he come home with two hackney-coach load of picture which he have meet with at a auction have find it impossible to resist so many yard of brown-looking figure and fade landscape go for absolutely nothing unheard of sacrifice kate hardly know whether to laugh or cry when she see these horribly

the fine art off go the picture to another auction but all re-christen by himself with unheard-of name ` one i remember ' say lady holland ` be a beautiful landscape by nicholas de falda a pupil of valdezzio the only painting by that eminent artist the picture sell i believe for rather less than he give for they under they original name which be probably as real as they assumed one ' sydney smith have long be style by he friend the ` bishop of mickleham ' in allusion to he visit to and influence in the house of he friend richard sharp who have a cottage at that place a piece of real preferment be now he this be the living of foston-le-clay in yorkshire give he by lord erskine then chancellor lady holland never rest till she have prevail on erskine to give sydney smith a living smith as roger relate go to thank he lordship ` oh ' say erskine ` do not thank I mr smith i give you the living because lady holland insist on my do so and if she have desire I to give it to the devil _ he _ must have have it ' notwithstanding the prediction of the saint sydney smith prove a excellent parish priest even he most admiring friend do not expect this result the general impression be that he be infinitely better fit for the bar than for the church ` ah mr smith ' lord stowell use to say to he ` you would be in a far better situation and a far richer man have you belong to we ' one _ jeu d'esprit _ more and smith hasten to take possession of he living and to enter upon duty of which no one better know the mighty importance than he do among the mackintosh set be richard sharp to whom we have already refer term from he great knowledge and ready memory ` conversation sharp ' many people may think that this do not imply a agreeable man and they be perhaps right sharp be a plain ungainly man one evening a literary lady now live be at sir jame mackintosh 's in company with sharp sismondus and the late lord denman then a man of middle age sir jame be not only particularly partial to denman but admire he personally ` do you not think denman handsome ' he inquire of the lady after the guest be go ` no then you must think mr sharp handsome ' he rejoin mean that a taste so perverted as not to admire denman must be smite with sharp sharp be say to have study all the morning before he go out to dinner to get up he wit and anecdote as a actor do he part sydney smith have one day receive a invitation from he to dine at fishmonger ' hall send the following reply : -- ` much do i love the monster of the deep to eat to see the rosy salmon lie by smelt encircle bear for

great wit we touch but lightly upon the graver feature of he character yet they can not wholly be pass over stanch in he devotion to the church of england he be liberal to other the world in the present day be afraid of liberality let it not be forget that it have be the fanatic and the intolerant not the mild and practical among we who have go from the protestant to the romish faith sydney smith in common with other great man have no predilection for deal damnation round the land how noble how true be mackintosh 's reflection on religious sect ` it be impossible i think to look into the interior of any religious sect without think better of it i ought indeed to confine myself to those of christian europe but with that limitation it seem to I the remark be true whether i look at the jansenist of port royal or the quaker in clarkson or the methodist in these journal all these sect which appear dangerous or ridiculous at a distance assume a much more amicable character on nearer inspection they all inculcate pure virtue and practice mutual kindness and they exert great force of reason in rescue they doctrine from the absurd or pernicious consequence which naturally flow from they much of this arise from the general nature of religious principle -- much also from the genius of the gospel ' nothing could present a greater contrast with the comfort of orchard street than the place on which sydney smith 's ` line ' have now ` fall ' owe to the non-residence of the clergy one-third of the parsonage house in england have fall into decay but that of foston-le-clay be

it both in a ruinous condition be the residence which for a hundred and fifty year have never be inhabit by a incumbent it will not be a matter of surprise that for some time until 1808 sydney smith with the permission of the archbishop of york continue to reside in london after have appoint a curate at foston-le-clay the first visit to he living be by no means promising picture to yourself my

over the annals of sydney smith 's useful happy life at foston-le-clay visit there indeed by mackintosh and each day achieve a higher and higher reputation in literature we see he as a magistrate ` no

and call out in bad case ` john bring I out my _ private gallows _ ' which bring the poor boy on they knee we behold he make visit and even tour in the ` immortal ' and receive lord and lady carlisle in they coach and four which have stick in the middle of a ploughed field there be scarcely any road only a lane up to the house behold he receive he poor friend franci homer who come to take he last leave of he and die at pisa in 1817 after earn honor pay as sir jame mackintosh remark to intrinsic claim alone -- ' a man of obscure birth who never fill a office ' see sydney smith in 1816 from the

than the stock in question ' this country life be vary by many visit in 1820 he go to visit lord gray then to edinburgh to jeffrey travel by the coach a gentleman with whom he have be talk say ` there be a very clever fellow life near here sydney smith i believe a devilish odd fellow ' -- ` he may be a odd fellow ' cry sydney take off he hat ` but here he be odd as he be at you service ' sydney smith find great change in edinburgh -- change however in many respects for the better the society of edinburgh be then in its greatest perfection ` its brilliancy lord cockburn remark ` be owe to a variety of peculiar circumstance which only operate during this period the principal of these be the survivance of several of the eminent man of the precede age and of curious old habit which the modern flood have not yet obliterate the rise of a powerful community of young man of ability the exclusion of the british from the continent which make this place both for education and for residence a favorite resort of stranger the war which maintain a constant excitement of military preparation and of military idleness : the blaze of that popular literature which make this the second city in the empire for learning and science and the extent and the ease with which literature and society embellish each other without rivalry and without pedantry among the ` best young ' as he lordship style they be lord webb seymor and franci horner whilst those of the ` interesting old ' most note be elizabeth hamilton and mr grant of laggan who have ` unfold herself ' to borrow lord cockburn 's word in the ` letter from the mountain ' ` a interesting treasury of good solitary thought ' of these two lady lord cockburn say ` they be excellent woman and not _ too _ blue they sense cover the color ' it be to mr hamilton that jeffrey say ` that there be no objection to the blue stock provide the petticoat come low enough to cover it ' neither of these lady possess personal attraction mr hamilton have the plain face proper to literary woman mr grant be a tall dark woman with much dignity of manner : in spite of she life of misfortune she have a great flow of spirit beautifully indeed do lord cockburn render justice to she character : ` she be always under the influence of a affectionate and delightful enthusiasm which unquenched by time and sorrow survive the wreck of many domestic attachment and shed a glow over the close of a very protracted life ' both she and mr hamilton succeed in draw to they _ conversazionus _ in small room of unpretending style man of the highest order as well as attractive woman of intelligence society in edinburgh take the form of parisian _ soirées _ and although much divide into party be sufficiently general to be vary it be amusing to find that mr grant be at one time one of the suppose ` author of waverley ' until the disclosure of the mystery silence report it be the popularity of ` marmion ' that make scott as he himself confess nearly lose he foot mr grant 's observation on he after meet the great unknown at some brilliant party have be allow even by the sarcastic lockhart to be ` witty enough ' ` mr scott always seem to I to be like a glass through which the ray of admiration pass without sensibly affect it but the bit of paper -lrb- 13 -rrb- that lie beside it will presently be in a blaze -- and no wonder ' -lrb- 13 : allude to lady scott -rrb- scott endeavor to secure mr grant a pension merit as he observe by she as a authoress ` but much more ' in he opinion ` by the firmness and elasticity of mind with which she have bear a great succession of domestic calamity ' ` unhappily ' he add ` there be only about # 100 open on the pension list and this the minister assign in equal portion to mr g

a sad day -- what do dodington come here for -- the veteran wit beau and politician -- ` defend we from we executor and editor ' it would have be well for lord melcombe 's memory horace walpole remark ` if he fame have be suffer to rest on the tradition of he wit and the evidence of he poetry ' and in the present day that desirable result have come to pass we remember bubb dodington chiefly as the courtier whose person house and furniture be replete with costly ostentation so as to provoke the satire of foote who bring he on the stage under the name of sir thoma lofty in ` the patron ' we recall he most as ' _ l'amphytrion chez quus on dine _ ' ` my lord of melcombe ' as mallet say -- ` whose soup and sauce duly season would whose wit well tim would and sense well reason would give burgundy a brighter stain and add new flavor to champagne ' who now care much for the court intrigue which sever sir robert walpole and bubb dodington who now read without disgust the annals of that famous quarrel between george ii and he son during which each party devoutly wish the other dead who mind whether the time-serving bubb dodington go over to lord bute or not who care whether he hope of political preferment be or be not gratified bubb dodington be in fact the dinner-giving lordly poet to whom even the saintly young could write : -- ` you give protection -- i a worthless strain bear in 1691 the accomplished courtier answer till he have attain the age of twenty-nine to the not very euphonious name of bubb then a benevolent uncle with a large estate die and leave he with he land the more exalted surname of dodington he spring however from a obscure family who have settle in dorchester but that disadvantage which accord to lord brougham 's famous pamphlet act so fatally on a young man 's advancement in english public life be obviate as most thing be by a great fortune mr bubb have be educate at oxford : at the age of twenty-four he be elect mp for winchelsea he be soon afterwards name envoy at the court of spain but return home after he accession of wealth to provincial honor and become lord-lieutenant of somerset nay poet begin to worship he and even pronounce he to be well bear : -- ` descend from old british sire great dodington to king ally my patron then my laurel ' pride it would be consolatory to find that it be only welst who thus profane the muse by this abject flattery be it not record that thomson dedicate to he he ` summer ' the dedication be prompt by lord binning and ` summer ' be publish in 1727 when dodington be one of the lord of the treasury as well as clerk of the pell in ireland it seem therefore worth while for thomson to pen such a passage as this : -- ` you example sir have recommend poetry with the greatest grace to the example of those who be engag would in the most active scene of life and this though confessedly the least considerable of those quality that dignify you character must be particularly please to _ one _ whose only hope of be introduce to you regard be thro ' the recommendation of a art in which you be a master ' warton add this tribute : -- ` to praise a dodington rash bard forbear what can thy weak and ill-tun would voice avail when on that theme both young and thomson fail ' yet even when midway in he career dodington in the famous political caricature call ` the motion ' be depict as ` the spaniel ' sit between the duke of argyle 's leg whilst he grace be drive a coach at full speed to the treasury with a sword instead of a whip in he hand with lord chesterfield as postilion and lord cobham as a footman holding on by the strap : even then the servile though pompous character of this true man of the world be comprehend completely and bubb dodington 's characteristic never change in he political life dodington be so selfish obsequious and versatile as to incur universal opprobrium he have also another misfortune for a man of society -- he become fat and lethargic ` my brother ned ' horace walpole remark ` say he be grow of less consequence though more weight ' and on another occasion speaking of a majority in the house of lord he add ' i do not count dodington who must now always be in the minority for no majority will accept he ' whilst however during the factious reign of george ii the town be declare even by horace to be wondrous dull opera unfrequented play not in fashion and amours old as marriage bubb dodington with he wealth and profusion contrived always to be in vogue as a host while he be at a discount as a politician politics and literature be the highroad in england to that much-craved-for distinction a admittance into the great world and dodington unite these passport in he own person : he be a poetaster and write political pamphlet the

the beautiful and famous margravine of anspach whose loveliness in vain tempt we to believe she innocent in despite of fact before those era -- the presence of the margravine whose infidelity be almost avowed and the abide of the queen whose error have at all event verge on the very confines of guilt -- the house be own by dodington there he give dinner there he gratify a passion for display which be puerile there he indulge in eccentricity which almost imply insanity there he concoct he scheme for court advancement and there later in life he contribute some of the treasure of he wit to dramatic literature ` the wish ' a comedy by bentley be suppose to owe much of its point to the brilliant wit of dodington -lrb- 14 -rrb- -lrb- 14 : see walpole 's ` royal and noble author ' -rrb- at

son of richard bentley the celebrated critic have write a play call ` the wish ' and during the summer of 1761 it be act at drury lane and meet with the especial approbation of george iii who send the author through lord bute a present of two hundred guinea as a tribute to the good sentiment of the production this piece which in spite of its moral tendency have die out whilst play of less virtuous character have live be rehearse in the garden of brandenburgh house bubb dodington associate much with those who give fame but he court amongst they also those who could revenge affront by bitter ridicule among the actor and literati who be then sometimes at brandenburg house be foote and churchill capital boon companion but as it prove dangerous foe ' endowed with imagination with a mind enrich by classical and historical study possess of a brilliant wit bubb dodington be nevertheless in the sight of some man ridiculous whilst the rehearsal of ` the wish ' go on foote be note down all the peculiarity of the lord of brandenburgh house with a view to bring they to account in he play of ` the patron ' lord melcombe be a aristocratic dombey : stultify by he own self-complacency he dare to exhibit he peculiarity before the english aristophane it be a act of imprudence for foote have long before -lrb- in 1747 -rrb- open the little theater of the haymarket with a sort of monologue play

publish a poem call ` the actor ' churchill in imitation now produce ` the rosciad ' and bubb dodington be one whose ridiculous point be salient in those day of personality ` the rosciad ' have a signal success which complete the ruin of its author : he become a man of the town forsake the wife of he youth and abandon the clerical character there be few sight more contemptible than that of a clergyman who have cast off he profession or whose profession have cast he off but churchill 's talent for a time keep he from utter destitution bubb doddington may have be console by find that he share the fate of dr johnson who have speak slightingly of churchill 's work and who shine forth therefore in ` the ghost ' a later poem as dr pomposo richard cumberland the dramatist draw a portrait of lord melcombe which be say to have be take from the life but perhaps the most faithful delineation of bubb dodington 's character be furnish by himself in he ` diary ' in which as it have be well observe he ` unveil the nakedness of he mind and display himself as a courtly compound of mean compliance and political prostitution ' it may in pass be remark that few man figure well in a autobiography and that cumberland himself proclaim by dr johnson to be a ` learn ingenious accomplished gentleman ' add ` the want of company be a inconvenience but mr cumberland be a million : ' in spite of this eulogium cumberland have betray in he own autobiography unbounded vanity worldliness and a undue estimation of he own perishable fame after all amusing as personality must always be neither the humor of foote the vigorous satire of churchill nor the careful limning of cumberland whilst they can not be rank among talent of the highest order imply a sort of social treachery the delicious little colloquy between boswell and johnson place low personal ridicule in its proper light boswell -- ` foote have a great deal of humor ' johnson -- ` yes sir ' boswell -- ` he have a singular talent of exhibit character ' johnson -- ` sir it be not a talent -- it be a vice it be what other abstain from it be not comedy which exhibit the character of a species -- as that of a miser

save he the trouble of cut off a leg i would not have leave he a leg to cut off ' few annals exist of the private life of bubb dodington but those few be discreditable like most man of he time and like many man of all time dodington be entangled by a unhappy and perplexing intrigue there be a certain ` black woman ' as horace walpole call a mrs strawbridge whom bubb dodington admire this handsome brunette live in a corner house of saville row in piccadilly where dodington visit she the result of they intimacy be he give this lady a bond of ten thousand pound to be pay if he marry any one else the real object of he affection be a mr behan with whom he live seventeen year and whom on the death of mr strawbridge he eventually marry among bubb dodington 's admirer and disciple be paul whitehead a wild specimen of the poet rake satirist dramatist all in one and what be quite in character a templar to boot paul -- so name from be bear on that saint 's day -- write one or two piece which bring he a ephemeral fame such as the ` state dunce ' and the ` epistle to dr thompson ' ` manners ' a satire and the ` gymnasiad ' a mock heroic poem intend to ridicule the passion for boxing then prevalent paul whitehead who die in 1774 be a infamous but not in the opinion of walpole a despicable poet yet churchill have consign he to everlasting infamy as a reprobate in these line : -- `

buckinghamshire the profligate sir franci dashwood wilke and churchill be amongst its most prominent member with such associate and live in a court where nothing but the basest passion reign and the lowest art prevail we be incline to accord with the descendant of bubb dodington the editor of he ` diary ' henry penruddocke wyndham who declare that all lord melcombe 's political conduct be ` wholly direct by the base motive of vanity selfishness and avarice ' lord melcombe seem to have be a man of the world of the very worst _ calibre _ sensual servile and treacherous ready during the lifetime of he patron frederick prince of wale to go any length against the adverse party of the pelham that prince 's political foe -- eager after the death of frederick to court those powerful man with fawn servility the famous ` diary ' of bubb dodington supply the information from which these conclusion have be draw horace walpole who know dodington well describe how he read with avidity the ` diary ' which be publish in 1784 ' a nephew of lord melcombe 's heir have publish that lord 's diary indeed it commence in 1749 and i grieve it be not date twenty year later however it deal in topic that be twenty time more familiar and fresh to my memory than any passage that have happen within these six month i wish i could convey it to you though draw by he own hand and certainly mean to flatter himself it be a truer portrait than any of he hireling would have give never be such a composition of vanity versatility and servility in short there be but one feature want in it he wit of which in the whole book there be not three sally ' the editor of this ` diary ' remark ` that he will no doubt be consider a very extraordinary editor the practice of whom have generally be to prefer flattery to truth and partiality to justice ' to understand not the flattery which he contemporary heap upon bubb dodington but the opprobrium with which they load he memory -- to comprehend not he merit but he demerit -- it be necessary to take a brief survey of he political life from the commencement he begin life as we have see as a servile adherent of sir robert walpole a political epistle to the minister be the prelude to a temporary alliance only for in 1737 bubb go over to the adverse party of leicester house and espouse the cause of frederick prince of wale against he royal father he be therefore dismiss from the treasury when sir robert fall bubb expect to rise but he expectation of preferment be not realize he attack the new administration forthwith and succeed so far in become important that he be make treasurer of the navy a post which he resign in 1749 and which he hold again in 1755 but which he lose the next year on the accession of george iii he be not ashamed to appear altogether in a new character as the friend of lord bute he be therefore advance to the peerage by the title of baron of melcombe regi in 1761 the honor be enjoy for one short year only and on the 28th of July 1762 bubb dodington expire horace walpole in he ` royal and noble author ' complain that ` dodington 's diary be mangled in compliment before it be impart to the public ' we can not therefore judge of what the ` diary ' be before as the editor avow that every anecdote be cut out and all the little gossip so illustrative of character and manners which would have brighten its dull page fall beneath the power of a merciless pair of scissors mr penruddocke wyndham conceive however that he be only do justice to society in these suppression ` it would ' he say ` be _ no _ entertainment to the reader to be inform who daily dine with he lordship or whom he daily meet at the table of other people ' posterity think differently : a knowledge of a man 's associate form the best commentary on he life and there be much reason to rejoice that all biographer be not like mr penruddocke wyndham bubb dodington more especially be a man of society : inferior as a literary man contemptible as a politician it be only at the head of he table that he be agreeable and brilliant he be in fact a man who have no domestic life a courtier like lord hervey but without lord hervey 's consistency he be in truth a type of that era in england : vulgar in aim dissolute in conduct ostentatious vain-glorious -- of a low ephemeral ambition but at the same time talented acute and lavish to the letter the public be now the patron of the gifted what writer care for individual opinion except as it tend to sweep up the gross amount of public blame or censure what publisher will consent to undertake a work because some lord or lady recommend it to he notice the reviewer be greater in the commonwealth of letter than the man of rank but in these day it be otherwise and they who in the necessity of the time do what they could to advance the interest of the _ belle lettre _ deserve not to be forget it be with a feeling of sickness that we open the page of this great wit 's ` diary ' and attempt to peruse the sentence in which the most grasp selfishness be display we follow he to leicester house that ancient tenement -- -lrb- wherefore pull down except to erect on its former site the narrowest of street do not appear -rrb- : that former home of the sydney have not always be polluted by the dissolute heartless _ clique _ who compose the court of frederick prince of wale its chamber have once be traverse by henry sydney by algernon he brother it be they _ home _ -- they father robert sydney earl of leicester have live there the lovely dorothy sydney waller 's saccharissa once in all purity and grace have dance in that gallery where the vulgar brazen lady middlesex and she compliant lord afterwards flatter the weakest of prince frederick in old time leicester house have stand on lammas land -- land in the spirit of the old charity open to the poor after lammas-tide and even ` the right hon the earl of leicester ' -- as a old document have it -- be oblige if _ he _ choose to turn out he cow or horse on that appropriate land to pay a rent for it to the overseer of st martin 's parish then really ` in the field ' and here this nobleman not only dwelt in all state himself but let or lend he house to person whose memory seem to hallow even leicester field elizabeth of bohemia after what be to she indeed ` life 's fitful fever ' die at leicester house it become then temporarily the abode of ambassador colbert in the time of charle ii occupy the place prince eugène in 1712 hold he residence here and the rough soldier famous for all absence of tact -- brave loyal-hearted and coarse -- linger at leicester house in hope of obstruct the peace between england and france all that be good and great flee for ever from leicester house at the instant that george ii when prince of wale be drive by he royal father from st jame 's and take up he abode in it until the death of george i the once honor home of the sydney henceforth become loathsome in a moral sense here william duke of cumberland -- the hero as court flatterer call he -- the butcher as the poor jacobite designate he -- of culloden first see the light peace and respectability then dignified the old house for ever prince frederick be its next inmate : here the princess of wale the mother of george iii have she lying-in and she royal husband hold he public table and at these and in every assembly as well as in private one figure be conspicuous grace boyle -- for she unworthily bear that great name -- be the daughter and heiress of richard viscount shannon she marry lord middlesex bring he a fortune of thirty thousand pound short plain ` very yellow ' as she contemporary affirm with a head full of greek and latin and devote to music and painting it seem strange that frederick should have be attract to one far inferior to he own princess both in mind and person but so it be for in those day every man like he neighbor 's wife better than he own imitate the forbearance of she royal mother-in-law the princess tolerate such of she husband 's mistress as do not interfere in politics : lady middlesex be the ` my good mr howard ' of leicester house she be make mistress of the robe : she favor soon ` grow ' as the shrewd horace remark ` to be rather more than platonic ' she live with the royal pair constantly and sit up till five o'clock in the morning at they supper and lord middlesex saw and submit to all that be go on with the loyalty and patience of a _ georgian _ courtier lady middlesex be a docile politician and on that account retain she position probably long after she have lose she influence she name appear constantly in the ` diary ' out of which everything amusing have be carefully expunge ` lady middlesex lord bathurst mr breton and i wait on they royal highness to spitalfield to see the manufacture of silk ' in the afternoon off go the same party to norwood forest in private coach to see a ` settlement of gypsy ' then return go to find out bettesworth the conjuror but not discover he go in search of the little dutchman be disappoint in that but ` conclude ' relate bubb dodington ` the peculiarity of this day by sup with mr cannon the princess 's _ midwife _ ' all these elegant mode of pass the time be not only for the sake of lady middlesex but it be say of she friend mr granville one of the maid of honor daughter of the first lord lansdown the poet this young lady eliza granville be scarcely pretty : a far red-haired girl all this thoughtless if not culpable gallantry be abruptly check by the rude hand of death during the month of march frederick be attack with illness have catch cold very little apprehension be express at first but about eleven day after he first attack he expire half a hour before he death he have ask to see some friend and have call for coffee and bread and butter : a fit of cough come on and he die instantly from suffocation a abscess which have be form in he side have burst nevertheless he two physician wilmot and lee ` know nothing of he distemper ' accord to lord melcombe who thus refer to they blunder ` they declare half a hour before he death that he pulse be like a man 's in perfect health they either would not see or do not know the consequence of the black thrush which appear in he mouth and quite down in he throat they ignorance or they knowledge of he disorder render they equally inexcusable for not call in other assistance ' the consternation in the prince 's household be great not for he life but for the confusion into which politics be throw by he death after he relapse and until just before he death the princess never suffer any english man or woman above the degree of valet-de-chambre to see he nor do she herself see any one of she household until absolutely necessary after the death of he eldest bear george ii vent he diabolical jealousy upon the cold remain of one thus cut off in the prime of life the funeral be order to be on the model of that of charle ii but private counter-order be issue to reduce the ceremonial to the smallest degree of respect that could be pay on the 13th of April 1751 the body of the prince be entomb in henry vii 's chapel except the lord appoint to hold the pall and attend the chief mourner when the attendant be call over in they rank there be not a _ single _ english lord not _ one _ bishop and only one irish lord -lrb- lord limerick -rrb- and three son of peer sir john rushout and dodington be the only privy counsellor who follow it rain heavily but no covering be provide for the procession the service be perform without organ or anthem ` thus ' observe bubb dodington ` end this sad day ' although the prince leave a brother and sister the duke of somerset act as chief mourner the king hail the event of the prince 's death as a relief which be to render happy he remain day and bubb dodington hasten in a few month to offer to the pelham ` he friendship and attachment ' he attendance at court be resume although george ii could not endure he and the old walpolian nick-name the black-tan be also averse to he such be bubb dodington 's _ action _ he expression on occasion of the prince 's death be in a very different tone ` we have lose ' he write to sir horace mann ` the delight and ornament of the age he live in -- the expectation of the public : in this light i have lose more than any subject in england but this be light -- public advantage confine to myself do not ought not to weigh with I but we have lose the refuge of private distress -- the balm of the afflict heart the shelter of the miserable against the fury of private adversity the art the grace the anguish the misfortune of society have lose they patron and they remedy ' i have lose my companion -- my protector -- the friend that love I that condescend to hear to communicate to share in all the pleasure and pain of the human heart : where the social affection and emotion of the mind only preside without regard to the infinite disproportion of my rank and condition this be a wound that can not ought not to heal if i pretend to fortitude here i should be infamous -- a monster of ingratitude -- and unworthy of all consolation if i be not inconsolable ' ` thank you ' write the shrewd horace walpole address sir horace mann ` for the transcript from _ bulb de tristibus _ i will keep you secret though i be persuade that a man who have compose such a funeral oration on he master have himself fully intend that its flower should not bloom and wither in obscurity ' well might george ii see he go to court say : ' i see dodington here sometimes what do he come for ' it be however clearly see what he go for when in 1753 two year after the death of he ` benefactor ' dodington humbly offer he majesty he service in the house and ` five member ' for the rest of he life if he majesty would give mr pelham leave to employ he for he majesty 's service nevertheless he continue to advise with the princess of wale and to drop into she house as if it have be a sister 's house -- sit on a stool near the fireside and listen to she account of she child in the midst of these intrigue for favor on the part of dodington mr pelham die and be succeed by he brother the duke of newcastle the issue of whose administration be well know in 1760 death again befriend the now veteran wit beau and politician george ii die and the intimacy which dodington have always take care to preserve between himself and the princess of wale end advantageously for he and he instantly in spite of all he former profession to pelham join hand and heart with that minister from whom he obtain a peerage this as we have see be not long enjoy lord melcombe as this able intriguing man be now style die on the 28th of July 1762 and with he terminate the short-lived distinction for which he have sacrifice even a decent pretext of principle and consistency so general have be the contempt feel for he character that it seem almost needless to assert that bubb dodington be eminently to be despise nothing much more severe can be say of he than the remark of horace walpole -- upon he ` diary ' in which he observe that dodington record little but what be to he own disgrace as if he think that the world would forgive he inconsistency as readily as he forgive himself ` have he adopt ' horace well observe ` the french title _ confession _ it would have seem to imply some kind of penitence ' but vain-glory engross he : ` he be determine to raise a altar to himself and for want of burnt offering light the pyre like a great author -lrb- rousseau -rrb- with he own character ' it be say by the same acute observer both of lord hervey and of bubb dodington that they be the only two person he ever know that be always aim at wit and never find it ' and here it seem most that can be testify in praise of a heartless clever man must be sum up lord melcombe 's property with the exception of a few legacy devolve upon he cousin thoma wyndham of hammersmith by whom he lordship 's papers letter and poem be bequeath to henry penruddocke wyndham with a injunction that only such as ` might do honor to he memory should be make public ' after this in addition to the true say defend we from we friend one may exclaim ` defend we from we executor and editor ' end of the project gutenberg ebook of the wit
