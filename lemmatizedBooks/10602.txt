miscounsell must need miswend -lrb- _ miswend _ go wrong -rrb- thus therefore i advize upon the case : that not to anie certaine trade or place 130 nor anie man we should we self applie for why should he that be at libertie make himselfe bond sith then we be free bear let we all servile base subiection scorne and as we bee sonne of the world so wide 135 let we we father heritage divide and chalenge to we self we portion dew of all the patrimonie which a few now hold in hugger mugger in they hand -lrb- _ in hugger mugger _ in secret -rrb- and all the rest doo rob of good and land : 140 for now a

be the golden age of saturne old but this might better be the world of gold for without golde now nothing wilbe get therefore if please you this shalbe we plot : we will not be of anie occupation 155 let such vile vassall bear to base vocation drudge in the world and for they living droyle -lrb- _ droyle _ moil -rrb- which have no wit to live withouten toyle but we will walke about the world at pleasure like two free man and make we ease we treasure free man some begger call but they be free 161 and they which call they so more begger bee : for they doo swinke and sweate to feed the other -lrb- _ swinke _ toil -rrb- who live like lord of that which they doo gather and yet doo never thanke they for the same 165 but as they due by nature doo it clame such will we fashion both we self to bee lord of the world and so will wander free where so we listeth uncontrol would of anie hard be we hap if we emongst so manie 170 light not on some that may we state amend sildome but some good commeth ere the end well seemd the ape to like this ordinaunce : yet well consider of the circumstaunce as pause in great doubt awhile he staid 175 and afterwards with grave advizement say : i can not my lief brother like but well -lrb- _ lief _ dear -rrb- the purpose of the complot which ye tell for well i wot -lrb- compar have to all the rest of each degree -rrb- that begger life be best 180 and they that thinke themselves the best of all oft-time to beg be content to fall but this i wot withall that we shall ronne into great daunger like to bee undonne thus wildly to wander in the world eye 185 withouten pasport or good warrantye for feare least we like rogue should be repute and for eare-marked beast abroad be brute therefore i read that we we counsell call how to prevent this mischiefe ere it fall 190 and how we may with most securitie beg amongst those that beggar doo defie right well deere gossip ye advize have say then the foxe but i this doubt will save : for ere we farther passe i will devise 195 a pasport for we both in fittest wize and by the name of souldier we protect that now be think a civile beg sect be you the souldier for you likest be for manly semblance and small skill in warre : 200 i will but wayte on you and as occasion fall out my selfe fit for the same will fashion the pasport end both they forward go the ape clad souldierlike fit for th ` intent in

beare as if good service he be fit to doo but little thrift for he he do it too : 240 and stoutly forward he he step do straine that like a handsome swaine it he become when as they nigh approach that good man see they wander loosly first begin t ` enquire of custome what and whence they be to whom the ape : i be a souldiere 246 that late in warre have spend my deerest blood and in long service

great punishment or shame for they false treason and vile theeverie : 315 for not a lambe of all they flockes-supply have they to shew but ever as they breed they slue they and upon they flesh feed : for that disguised dog lov would blood to spill and draw the wicked shepheard to he will 320 so twixt they both they not a lambkin left and when lambe fail would the old sheepe live they reave that how t ` acquite themselves unto they lord they be in doubt and flatly set abord -lrb- _ set abord _ set adrift at a loss -rrb- the foxe then counsel would th ` ape for to require 325 respite till

all they ill they steal away and tooke they hastie flight carry in clowde of all-concealing night 340 so be the husbandman leave to he losse and they unto they fortune change to tosse after which sort they wander long while abuse manie through they cloaked guile that at the last they gin to be descrye 345 of everie one and all they sleight espye so as they beg now they fail quyte for none would

915 can ever thrive in that unluckie quest or such as have a reynold to he man that by he shift he master furnish can but yet this foxe could not so closely hide he craftie feate but that they be descride 920 at length by such as sate in iustice seate who for the same he fowlie do entreate and have worthily he punish out of the court for ever banish and now the ape want he huckster man 925 that wont provide he necessaries gin to growe into great lacke ne could upholde he countenaunce in those he garment olde ne new one could he easily provide though all man he uncased gan deride 930 like as a puppit place in a play whose part once past all man bid take away : so that he drive be to great distresse and shortly bring to hopelesse wretchednesse then closely as he might he cast to

spide how in a gloomy glade the lyon sleep lay in secret shade he crowne and scepter lie he beside and have doft for heate he dreadfull hide : which when they see the ape be sore afrayde 955 and would have flee with terror all dismayde but he the foxe with hardy word do stay and bad he put all cowardize away for now be time if ever they would hope to ayme they counsel to the fairest scope 960 and they for ever highly to advaunce in case the good which they owne happie chaunce they freely offr they would wisely take scarse could the ape yet speake so do he quake yet as he could he askt how good might growe 965 where nought but dread and death do seeme in show now sayd he while the lyon sleepeth sound may we he crowne and mace take from the ground and eke he skinne the terror of the wood wherewith we may we self if we thinke good 970 make king of beast and lord of forest all subiect unto that powre imperiall ah but sayd the ape who be so bold a wretch that dare he hardy hand to those outstretch when as he knowe he meede if he be spide 975 to be a thousand deathe and shame beside fond ape sayd then the foxe into whose brest never creep thought of honor nor brave gest -lrb- _ gest _

should assay -lrb- _ whether _ which of the two -rrb- those royall ornament to steale away marie that shall you selfe quoth he theretoo for ye be fine and nimble it to doo 1000 of all the beast which in the forrest bee be not a fitter for this turne than yee : therefore mine owne deare brother take good hart and ever thinke a kingdome be you part loath be the ape though praise to adventer 1005 yet faintly gin into he worke to enter afraid of everie leafe that stir would he by and everie stick that underneath do ly : upon he tiptoe nicely he up go for make noyse and still he eare he lend 1010 to

play 1015 he all those royall signe have stolne away and with the fox helpe they bear aside into a secret corner unespide whither whena they come they fall at word whether of they should be the lord of lord : 1020 for th ` ape be stryfull and ambicious and the foxe guilefull and most covetous that neither pleased be to have the rayne twixt they divide into even twaine but either algate would be lord alone : 1025 -lrb- _ algate _ by all means -rrb- for love and lordship bide no paragone -lrb- _ paragone _ equal partner -rrb- i be most worthie say the ape sith i for it do put my life in

you be astray for though to steale the diademe away be the worke of you nimble hand yet i 1035 do first devise the plot by pollicie so that it wholly springeth from my wit : for which also i claime my selfe more fit than you to rule : for government of state will without wisedome soone be ruinate 1040 and where ye claime you selfe for outward shape most like a man man be not like a ape in he chiefe part that be in wit and spirite but i therein most like to he doo merite for my slie wyle and subtill craftinesse 1045 the title of the kingdome to possesse nath ` les my brother since we pass be unto this point we will appease we iarre and i with reason meete will rest content that ye shall have both crowne and government 1050 upon condition that ye rule bee in all affaire and counsel by mee and that ye let none other ever drawe you minde from I but keepe this as a lawe : and hereupon a oath unto I plight 1055 the ape be glad to end the strife so light and thereto swear : for who would not oft sweare and oft unsweare a diademe to beare then freely up those royall spoyle he tooke yet at the lyon skin he inly quooke 1060 but it dissemble and upon he head the crowne and on he backe the skin he do and the false foxe he help to array then when he be all dight he tooke he way into the forest that he might be seene 1065 of the wilde beast in he new glory sheene there the two first whome he encountr be the sheepe and th ` asse who striken both with feare at sight of he gin fast away to flye but unto they the foxe alowd do cry 1070 and in the king name bad they both to stay upon the payne that thereof follow may hardly naythle be they restrayne so till that the foxe forth toward they do goe and there disswade they from needlease feare 1075 for that the king do favor to they beare and therefore dreadle bad they come to corte for no wild beast should do they any torte -lrb- _ torte _ wrong -rrb- there or abroad ne would he maiestye use they but well with gracious clemencye 1080 as whome he know to he both fast and true so he perswade they with homage due themselves to humble to the ape prostrate who gently to they bow in he gate -lrb- _ gate _ way -rrb- receyve they with chearefull entertayne 1085 thenceforth proceeding with he princely trayne he shortly meet the tygre and the bear which with the simple camell rage sore in bitter word seek to take occasion upon he fleshly corpse to make invasion : 1090 but soone as they this mock-king do espy they troublous strife they stint by and by -lrb- _ stint by and by _ stop at once -rrb- think indeed that it the lyon be he then to prove whether he powre would pa as currant send the foxe to they streight way 1095 commaund they they cause of strife bewray and if that wrong on eyther side there be that he should warne the wronger to appeare the morrow next at court it to defend in the meane time upon the king t ` attend 1100 the subtile foxe so well he message sayd that the proud beast he readily obayd : whereby the ape in wondrous stomack woxe strongly encorag would by the crafty foxe that king indeed himselfe he shortly think 1105 and all the beast he fear as they ought and follow unto he palaice hye where take congé each one by and by depart to he home in dreadfull awe full of the fear sight which late they sawe 1110 the ape thus seize of the regall throne eftsone by counsell of the foxe alone gan to

reason 1131 no temperance nor no regard of season do thenceforth ever enter in he minde but crueltie the signe of currish kinde and sdeignfull pride and wilfull arrogaunce 1135 such followe those whom
