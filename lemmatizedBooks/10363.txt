produce by distribute proofreader the bravo a tale by j fenimore cooper giustizium in palazzo e pane in piazza 1872 preface it be to be regret the world do not discriminate more justly in its use of political term government be usually call either monarchy or republic the former class embrace equally those institution in which the sovereign be worship as a god and those in which he perform the humble office of a manikin in the latter we find aristocracy and democracy blended in the same generic appellation the consequence of a generalization so wide be a utter confusion on the subject of the polity of state the author have endeavor to give he countryman in this book a picture of the social system of one of the _ soi-disant _ republic of the other hemisphere there have be no attempt to portray historical character only too fictitious in they graver dress but simply to set forth the familiar operation of venetian policy for the justification of he likeness after allow for the defect of execution he refer to the well-known work of m daru a history of the progress of political liberty write purely in the interest of humanity be still a desideratum in literature in nation which have make a false commencement it would be find that the citizen or rather the subject have extort immunity after immunity as he grow intelligence and importance have both instruct and require he to defend those particular rights which be necessary to he well-being a certain accumulation of these immunity constitute with a solitary and recent exception in switzerland the essence of european liberty even at this hour it be scarcely necessary to tell the reader that this freedom be it more or less depend on a principle entirely different from we own here the immunity do not proceed from but they be grant to the government be in other word concession of natural rights make by the people to the state for the benefit of social protection so long as this vital difference exist between ourselves and other nation it will be vain to think of find analogy in they institution it be true that in a age like this public opinion be itself a charter and that the most despotic government which exist within the pale of christendom must in some degree respect its influence the mildest and justest government in europe be at this moment theoretically despotism the character of both prince and people enter largely into the consideration of so extraordinary result and it should never be forget that though the character of the latter be sufficiently secure that of the former be liable to change but admit every benefit which possibly can flow from a just administration with wise and humane prince a government which be not properly base on the people possess a unavoidable and oppressive evil of the first magnitude in the necessity of support itself by physical force and onerous imposition against the natural action of the majority be we to characterize a republic we should say it be a state in which power both theoretically and practically be derive from the nation with a constant responsibility of the agent of the public to the people -- a responsibility that be neither to be evade nor deny that such a system be better on a large than on a small scale though contrary to brilliant theory which have be write to uphold different institution must be evident on the smallest reflection since the danger of all popular government be from popular mistake and a people of diversified interest and extend territorial possession be much less likely to be the subject of sinister passion than the inhabitant of a single town or county if to this definition we should add as a infallible test of the genus that a true republic be a government of which all other be jealous and vituperative on the instinct of self-preservation we believe there would be no mistake the class how far venice would have be obnoxious to this proof the reader be leave to judge for himself chapter i i stand in venice on the bridge of sigh a palace and a prison on each hand i see from out the wave she structure rise as from the stroke of the enchanter 's wand a thousand year they cloudy wing expand around I and a die glory smile o'er the far time when many a subject land look to the winged lion ' marble pile where venice sit in state thron on she hundred isle byron the sun have disappear behind the summit of the tyrolean alp and the moon be already rise above the low barrier of the lido hundred of pedestrian be pour out of the narrow street of venice into the square of st mark like water gush through some strait aqueduct into a broad and bubble basin gallant cavalierus and grave cittadinus soldier of dalmatium and seaman of the galley dame of the city and female of lighter manners jeweller of the rialto and trader from the levant jew turk and christian traveller adventurer podestà valet avvocato and gondolier hold they way alike to the common center of amusement the hurry air and careless eye the measure step and jealous glance the jest and laugh the song of the cantatrice and the melody of the flute the grimace of the buffoon and the tragic frown of the improvisatore the pyramid of the grotesque the compel and melancholy smile of the harpist cry of water-seller cowl of monk plumage of warrior hum of voice and the universal movement and bustle add to the more permanent object of the place render the scene the most remarkable of christendom on the very confines of that line which separate western from eastern europe and in constant communication with the latter venice possess a greater admixture of character and costume than any other of the numerous port of that region a portion of this peculiarity be still to be observe under the fall fortune of the place but at the period of we tale the city of the isle though no longer mistress of the mediterranean nor even of the adriatic be still rich and powerful she influence be feel in the council of the civilized world and she commerce though wane be yet sufficient to uphold the vast possession of those family whose ancestor have become rich in the day of she prosperity man live among she island in that state of incipient lethargy which mark the progress of a downward course whether the decline be of a moral or of a physical decay at the hour we have name the vast parallelogram of the piazza be fill fast the cafés and casino within the portico which surround three of its side be already throng with company while all beneath the arch be gay and brilliant with the flare of torch and lamp the noble range of edifice call the procuratory the massive pile of the ducal palace the most ancient christian church the granite column of the piazzetta the triumphal mast of the great square and the giddy tower of the campanile be slumber in the more mellow glow of the moon face the wide area of the great square stand the quaint and venerable cathedral of san marco a temple of trophy and one equally proclaim the prowess and the piety of its founder this remarkable structure preside over the other fixture of the place like a monument of the republic 's antiquity and greatness its saracenic architecture the row of precious but useless little column that load its front the low asiatic dome which rest upon its wall in the repose of a thousand year the rude and gaudy mosaic and above all the capture horse of corinth which start from out the sombre mass in the glory of grecian art receive from the solemn and appropriate light a character of melancholy and mystery that well comport with the thick recollection which crowd the mind as the eye gaze at this rare relic of the past as fit companion to this edifice the other peculiar ornament of the place stand at hand the base of the campanile lay in shadow but a hundred foot of its gray summit receive the full ray of the moon along its eastern face the mast destine to bear the conquer ensign of candium constantinople and the morea cut the air by its side in dark and fairy line while at the extremity of the smaller square and near the margin of the sea the form of the winged lion and the patron saint of the city each on he column of african granite be distinctly trace against the back-ground of the azure sky it be near the base of the former of these massive block of stone that one stand who seem to gaze at the animated and striking scene with the listlessness and indifference of satiety a multitude some in masque and other careless of be know have pour along the quay into the piazzetta on they way to the principal square while this individual have scarce turn a glance aside or change a limb in weariness he attitude be that of patient practice and obedient wait on another 's pleasure with fold arm a body poise on one leg and a vacant though good-humored eye he appear to attend some beck of authority ere he quit the spot a silken jacket in whose tissue flower of the gayest color be interweave the fall collar of scarlet the bright velvet cap with armorial bearing embroider on its front proclaim he to be a gondolier in private service weary at length with the antic of a distant group of tumbler whose pile of human body have for a time arrest he look this individual turn away and face the light air from the water recognition and pleasure shot into he countenance and in a moment he arm be interlock with those of a swarthy mariner who wear the loose attire and phrygian cap of man of he call the gondolier be the first to speak the word flow from he in the soft accent of he native island be it thou stefano they say thou hadst fall into the gripe of the devil of barbary and that thou wast plant flower for a infidel with thy hand and water they with thy tear the answer be in the harsher dialect of calabrium and it be give with the rough familiarity of a seaman la bella sorrentina be no housekeeper of a curato she be not a damsel to take a siesta with a tunisian rover prowl about in she neighborhood hadst ever be beyond the lido thou wouldst have know the difference between chase the felucca and catch she kneel down and thank san teodoro for he care there be much pray on thy deck that hour caro stefano though none be bolder among the mountain of calabrium when thy felucca be once safely draw up on the beach the mariner cast a half-comic half-serious glance upward at the image of the patron saint ere he reply there be more need of the wing of thy lion than of the favor of thy saint i never come further north for aid than san gennaro even when it blow a hurricane so much the worse for thee caro since the good bishop be better at stop the lava than at quiet the wind but there be danger then of lose the felucca and she brave people among the turk there be in truth a tunis-man prowl about between strombolus and sicily but ali di san michele he might better have chase the cloud above the volcano than run after the felucca in a sirocco thou wast chicken-hearted stefano i -- i be more like thy lion here with some small addition of chain and muzzle as be see by thy felucca 's speed cospetto i wish myself a knight of san giovannus a thousand time during the chase and la bellum sorrentina a brave maltese galley if it be only for the cause of christian honor the miscreant hung upon my quarter for the better part of three glass so near that i could tell which of the knave wear dirty cloth in he turban and which clean it be a sore sight to a christian stefano to see the right thus bear upon by a infidel and thy foot warm with the thought of the bastinado caro mio i have run too often barefoot over we calabrian mountain to tingle at the sole with every fancy of that sort every man have he weak spot and i know thine to be dread of a turk 's arm thy native hill have they soft as well as they hard ground but it be say the tunisian choose a board knotty as he own heart when he amuse himself with the wailing of a christian well the happiest of we all must take such as fortune bring if my sole be to be shoe with blow the honest priest of sant ' aga will be cheat by a penitent i have bargain with the good curato that all such accidental calamity shall go in the general account of penance but how fare the world of venice -- and what dost thou among the canal at this season to keep the flower of thy jacket from wilting to-day as yesterday and to-morrow will be as to-day i row the gondola from the rialto to the giudecca from san giorgio to san marco from san marco to the lido and from the lido home there be no tunis-men by the way to chill the heart or warm the foot enough of friendship and be there nothing stir in the republic -- no young noble drown nor any jew hang nothing of that much interest -- except the calamity which befall pietro thou rememberest pietrello he who cross into dalmatium with thee once as a supernumerary the time he be suspect of have aid the young frenchman in run away with a senator 's daughter do i remember the last famine the rogue do nothing but eat maccaronus and swallow the lachryma christus which the dalmatian count have on freight poverino he gondola have be run down by a ancona-man who pass over the boat as if it be a senator step on a fly so much for little fish come into deep water the honest fellow be cross the giudecca with a stranger who have occasion to say he prayer at the redentore when the brig hit he in the canopy and break up the gondola as if it have be a bubble leave by the bucentaur the padrone should have be too generous to complain of pietro 's clumsiness since it meet with its own punishment madre di dio he go to sea that hour or he might be feed the fish of the lagune there be not a gondolier in venice who do not feel the wrong at he heart and we know how to obtain justice for a insult as well as we master well a gondola be mortal as well as a felucca and both have they time better die by the prow of a brig than fall into the gripe of a turk how be thy young master gino and be he likely to obtain he claim of the senate he cool himself in the giudecca in the morning and if thou would ` st know what he do at evening thou hast only to look among the noble in the broglio as the gondolier speak he glance a eye aside at a group of patrician rank who pace the gloomy arcade which support the superior wall of the doge 's palace a spot sacred at time to the use of the privileged i be no stranger to the habit thy venetian noble have of come to that low colonnade at this hour but i never before hear of they prefer the water of the giudecca for they bath be even the doge to throw himself out of a gondola he must sink or swim like a meaner christian acqua dell ' adriatico be the young duca go to the redentore too to say he prayer he be come back after have but what matter it in what canal a young noble sigh away the night we happen to be near when the ancona-man perform he feat while giorgio and i be boil with rage at the awkwardness of the stranger my master who never have much taste or knowledge in gondola go into the water to save the young lady from share the fate of she uncle diavolo this be the first syllable thou hast utter concern any young lady or of the death of she uncle thou wert thinking of thy tunis-man and hast forget i must have tell thee how near the beautiful signora be to share the fate of the gondola and how the loss of the roman marchese weigh in addition on the soul of the padrone santo padre that a christian should die the death of a hunt dog by the carelessness of a gondolier it may have be lucky for the ancona-man that it so fall out for they say the roman be one of influence enough to make a senator cross the bridge of sigh at need the devil take all careless waterman say i and what become of the awkward rogue i tell thee he go outside the lido that very hour or -- pietrello he be bring up by the oar of giorgio for both of we be active in save the cushion and other valuable could ` st thou do nothing for the poor roman ill-luck may follow that brig on account of he death ill-luck follow she say i till she lay she bone on some rock that be harder than the heart of she padrone as for the stranger we could do no more than offer up a prayer to san teodoro since he never rise after the blow but what have bring thee to venice caro mio for thy ill-fortune with the orange in the last voyage cause thee to denounce the place the calabrian lay a finger on one cheek and draw the skin down in a manner to give a droll expression to he dark comic eye while the whole of he really fine grecian face be charge with a expression of coarse humor look you gino -- thy master sometimes call for he gondola between sunset and morning a owl be not more wakeful than he have be of late this head of mine have not be on a pillow before the sun have come above the lido since the snow melt from monselice and when the sun of thy master 's countenance set in he own palazzo thou hastenest off to the bridge of the rialto among the jeweller and butcher to proclaim the manner in which he pass the night diamine ` twould be the last night i serve the duca di sant ' agata be my tongue so limber the gondolier and the confessor be the two privy-councillor of a noble master stefano with this small difference -- that the last only know what the sinner wish to reveal while the first sometimes know more i can find a safer if not a more honest employment than to be run about with my master 's secret in the air and i be wiser than to let every jew broker in san marco here have a peep into my charter-party nay old acquaintance there be some difference between we occupation after all a padrone of a felucca can not in justice be compare to the most confidential gondolier of a neapolitan duke who have a unsettled right to be admit to the council of three hundred just the difference between smooth water and rough -- you ruffle the surface of a canal with a lazy oar while i run the channel of piombino in a mistral shoot the faro of messina in a white squall double santa marium di leuca in a breathing levanter and come skim up the adriatic before a sirocco that be hot enough to cook my maccaronus and which set the whole sea boil worse than the caldron of scyllum hist eagerly interrupt the gondolier who have indulge with italian humor in the controversy for preeminence though without any real feeling here come one who may think else we shall have need of he hand to settle the dispute -- eccolo the calabrian recoil apace in silence and stand regard the individual who have cause this hurry remark with a gloomy but steady air the stranger move slowly past he year be under thirty though the calm gravity of he countenance impart to it a character of more mature age the cheek be bloodless but they betray rather the pallid hue of mental than of bodily disease the perfect condition of the physical man be sufficiently exhibit in the muscular fulness of a body which though light and active give every indication of strength he step be firm assure and even he carriage erect and easy and he whole mien be strongly characterize by a self-possession that could scarcely escape observation and yet he attire be that of a inferior class a doublet of common velvet a dark montero cap such as be then much use in the southern country of europe with other vestment of a similar fashion compose he dress the face be melancholy rather than sombre and its perfect repose accord well with the striking calmness of the body the lineament of the former however be bold and even noble exhibit that strong and manly outline which be so characteristic of the finer class of the italian countenance out of this striking array of feature gleam a eye that be full of brilliancy meaning and passion as the stranger pass he glittering organ roll over the person of the gondolier and he companion but the look though search be entirely without interest 'twa the wander but wary glance which man who have much reason to distrust habitually cast on a multitude it turn with the same jealous keenness on the face of the next it encounter and by the time the steady and well balanced form be lose in the crowd that quick and glowing eye have gleam in the same rapid and uneasy manner on twenty other neither the gondolier nor the mariner of calabrium speak until they rivet gaze after the retire figure become useless then the former simply ejaculate with a strong respiration -- jacopo he companion raise three of he finger with a occult meaning towards the palace of the doge do they let he take the air even in san marco he ask in unfeigned surprise it be not easy caro amico to make water run up stream or to stop the downward current it be say that most of the senator would sooner lose they hope of the horn bonnet than lose he jacopo he know more family secret than the good priore of san marco himself and he poor man be half he time in the confessional aye they be afraid to put he in a iron jacket lest awkward secret should be squeeze out corpo di bacco there would be little peace in venice if the council of three should take it into they head to loosen the tongue of yonder man in that rude manner but they say gino that thy council of three have a fashion of feed the fish of the lagune which might throw the suspicion of he death on some unhappy ancona-man be the body ever to come up again well no need of bawl it aloud as if thou wert hail a sicilian through thy trumpet though the fact should be so to say the truth there be few man in business who be think to have more custom than he who have just go up the piazzetta two sequin rejoin the calabrian enforce he meaning by a significant grimace santa madonna thou forgettest stefano that not even the confessor have any trouble with a job in which he have be employ not a caratano less than a hundred will buy a stroke of he art you blow for two sequin leave a man leisure to tell tale or even to say he prayer half the time jacopo ejaculate the other with a emphasis which seem to be a sort of sum up of all he aversion and horror the gondolier shrug he shoulder with quite as much meaning as a man bear on the shore of the baltic could have convey by word but he too appear to think the matter exhaust stefano milano he add after a moment of pause ` there be thing in venice which he who would eat he maccaronus in peace would do well to forget let thy errand in port be what it may thou art in good season to witness the regatta which will be give by the state itself to-morrow hast thou a oar for that race giorgio 's or mine under the patronage of san teodoro the prize will be a silver gondola to he who be lucky or skilful enough to win and then we shall have the nuptials with the adriatic thy noble have best woo the bride well for there be heretic who lay claim to she good will i meet a rover of strange rig and miraculous fleetness in round the headland of otranto who seem to have half a mind to follow the felucca in she path towards the lagune do the sight warm thee at the sole of thy foot gino dear there be not a turbaned head on he deck but every sea-cap sit upon a well cover poll and a shear chin thy bucentaur be no longer the bravest craft that float between dalmatium and the island though she gilding may glitter brightest there be man beyond the pillar of hercule who be not satisfy with do all that can be do on they own coast but who be pretend to do much of that which can be do on ours the republic be a little aged caro and year need rest the joint of the bucentaur be rack by time and many voyage to the lido i have hear my master say that the leap of the winged lion be not as far as it be even in he young day don camillo have the reputation of talk boldly of the foundation of this city of pile when he have the roof of old sant ' agata safely over he head be he to speak more reverently of the horn bonnet and of the council of three he pretension to succeed to the rights of he forefather might seem juster in the eye of he judge but distance be a great mellower of color and softener of fear my own opinion of the speed of the felucca and of the merit of a turk undergo change of this sort between port and the open sea and i have know thee good gino forget san teodoro and bawl as lustily to san gennaro when at naple as if thou really fancy thyself in danger from the mountain one must speak to those at hand in order to be quickest hear rejoin the gondolier cast a glance that be partly humorous and not without superstition upward at the image which crown the granite column against whose pedestal he still lean a truth which warn we to be prudent for yonder jew cast a look this way as if he feel a conscientious scruple in let any irreverent remark of ours go without report the bearded old rogue be say to have other dealings with the three hundred besides ask for the money he have lend to they son and so stefano thou thinkest the republic will never plant another mast of triumph in san marco or bring more trophy to the venerable church napolus herself with she constant change of master be as likely to do a great act on the sea as thy wing beast just now thou art well enough to row a gondola in the canal gino or to follow thy master to he calabrian castle but if thou would ` st know what pass in the wide world thou must be content to listen to mariner of the long course the day of san marco have go by and that of the heretic more north have come thou hast be much of late among the lie genoese stefano that thou comest hither with these idle tale of what a heretic can do genova la superba what have a city of wall to compare with one of canal and island like this -- and what have that apennine republic perform to be put in comparison with the great deed of the queen of the adriatic thou forgettest that venezia have be -- zitto zitto that _ have _ be caro mio be a great word with all italy thou art as proud of the past as a roman of the trastevere and the roman of the trastevere be right be it nothing stefano milano to be descend from a great and victorious people it be better gino monaldus to be one of a people which be great and victorious just now the enjoyment of the past be like the pleasure of the fool who dream of the wine he drink yesterday this be well for a neapolitan whose country never be a nation return the gondolier angrily i have hear don camillo who be one educate as well as bear in the land often say that half of the people of europe have ride the horse of sicily and use the leg of thy napolus except those who have the best right to the service of both even so and yet the fig be as sweet as ever and the beccafichus as tender the ash of the volcano cover all gino say a voice of authority near the gondolier signora he who interrupt the dialogue point to the boat without say more a rivederli hastily mutter the gondolier he friend squeeze he hand in perfect amity -- for in truth they be countryman by birth though chance have train the former on the canal -- and at the next instant gino be arrange the cushion for he master have first arouse he subordinate brother of the oar from a profound sleep chapter ii hast ever swim in a gondola at venice shakspeare when don camillo monforte enter the gondola he do not take he seat in the pavilion with a arm lean on the top of the canopy and he cloak throw loosely over one shoulder the young noble stand in a muse attitude until he dexterous servitor have extricate the boat from the little fleet which crowd the quay and have urge it into open water this duty perform gino touch he scarlet cap and look at he master as if to inquire the direction in which they be to proceed he be

a building which seem to excite more than common expectation giorgio work he oar with a single hand look over he shoulder at gino and gino permit he blade fairly to trail on the water both seem to await new order manifest something like that species of instinctive sympathy with he they serve which a long practiced horse be apt to show when he draw near a gate that be seldom pass unvisited by he driver the edifice which cause this hesitation in the two gondolier be one of those residence at venice which be quite as remarkable for they external riches and ornament as for they singular situation amid the water a massive rustic basement of marble be seat as solidly in the element as if it grow from a living rock while story be seemingly raise on story in the wanton observance of the most capricious rule of meretricious architecture until the pile reach a altitude that be little known except in the dwelling of prince colonnade medallion and massive cornice overhang the canal as if the art of man have take pride in load the superstructure in a manner to mock the unstable element which conceal its base a flight of step on which each gentle undulation produce by the passage of the barge wash a wave conduct to a vast vestibule that answer many of the purpose of a court two or three gondola be moor near but the absence of they people show they be for the use of those who dwell within the boat be protect from rough collision with the pass craft by pile drive obliquely into the bottom similar spar with paint and ornament head that sometimes bear the color and arm of the

that what the master command it be the duty of a faithful follower to perform thou wert bear my vassal gino monaldus and though train from boyhood in this occupation of a gondolier thou art properly a being of my fief in napoli st gennaro make I grateful for the honor signora but there be not a water-seller in the street of venice nor a mariner on she canal who do not wish this jacopo anywhere but in the bosom of abraham he be the terror of every young lover and of all the urgent creditor on the island thou seest silly babbler there be one of the former at least who do not hold he in dread thou wilt seek he beneath the bridge of sigh and show the signet deliver the package accord to my instruction it be certain loss of character to be see speak with the miscreant so lately as yesterday i hear annina the pretty daughter of the old wine-seller on the lido declare that to be see once in company with jacopo frontonus be as bad as to be catch twice bring old rope from the arsenal as befall roderigo she mother 's cousin thy distinction savor of the moral of the lido remember to exhibit the ring lest he distrust thy errand could not you eccellenza set I about clipping the wing of the lion or painting a better picture than tiziano di vecelli i have a mortal dislike even to pass the mere compliment of the day with one of you cut-throat be any of we gondolier to see I in discourse with the man it might exceed you eccellenza 's influence to get I a place in the regatta if he detain thee gino thou wilt wait he pleasure and if he dismiss thee at once return hither with all expedition that i may know the result i very well know signor don camillo that the honor of a noble be more tender of reproach than that of he follower and that the stain upon the silken robe of a senator be see farther than the spot upon a velvet jacket if any one unworthy of you eccellenza 's notice have dare to offend here be giorgio and i ready at any time to show how deeply we can feel a indignity which touch we master 's credit but a hireling of two or ten or even of a hundred sequin i thank thee for the hint gino go thou and sleep in thy gondola and bid giorgio come into my cabinet signora art thou resolute to do none of my bidding be it you eccellenza 's pleasure that i go to the bridge of sigh by the footway of the street or by the canal there may be need of a gondola -- thou wilt go with the oar a tumbler shall not have time to turn round before the answer of jacopo shall be here with this sudden change of purpose the gondolier quit the room for the reluctance of gino disappear the moment he find the confidential duty assign he by he master be likely to be perform by another descend rapidly by a secret stair instead of enter the vestibule where half a dozen menial of different employment be in wait he pass by one of the narrow corridor of the palace into a inner court and thence by a low and unimportant gate into a obscure alley which communicate with the nearest street though the age be one of so great activity and intelligence and the atlantic be no longer a barrier even to the ordinary amusement of life a great majority of american have never have a opportunity of personally examine the remarkable feature of a region of which the town that gino now thread with so much diligence be not the least worthy of observation those who have be so fortunate as to have visit italy therefore will excuse we if we make a brief but what we believe useful digression for the benefit of those who have not have that advantage the city of venice stand on a cluster of low sandy island it be probable that the country which lie nearest to the gulf if not the whole of the immense plain of lombardy itself be of alluvial formation whatever may have be the origin of that wide and fertile kingdom the cause which have give to the lagune they existence and to venice its unique and picturesque foundation be too apparent to be mistaken several torrent which flow from the valley of the alp pour they tribute into the adriatic at this point they water come charge with the débris of the mountain pulverize nearly to they original element release from the violence of the stream these particle have necessarily be deposit in the gulf at the spot where they have first become subject to the power of the sea under the influence of counteract current eddy and wave the sand have be throw into submarine pile until some of the bank have arise above the surface form island whose elevation have be gradually augment by the decay of vegetation a glance at the map will show that while the gulf of venice be not literally it be practically consider with reference to the effect produce by the south-east wind call the sirocco at the head of the adriatic this accidental circumstance be probably the reason why the lagune have a more determine character at the mouth of the minor stream that empty themselves here than at the mouth of most of the other river which equally flow from the alp or the apennine into the same shallow sea the natural consequence of a current of a river meet the water of any broad basin and where there be no base of rock be the formation at or near the spot where the oppose action be neutralize of a bank which be technically call a bar the coast of the union furnish constant evidence of the truth of this theory every river have its bar with channel that be often shift or clear by the freshet the gale or the tide the constant and powerful operation of the south-eastern wind on one side with the periodical increase of the alpine stream on the other have convert this bar at the entrance of the venetian lagune into a succession of long low sandy island which extend in a direct line nearly across the mouth of the gulf the water of the river have necessarily cut a few channel for they passage or what be now a lagune would long since have become a lake another thousand year may so far change the character of this extraordinary estuary as to convert the channel of the bay into river and the muddy bank into marsh and meadow resemble those that be now see for so many league inland the low margin of sand that in truth give all its maritime security to the port of venice and the lagune be call the lido di palestrino it have be artificially connect and secure in many place and the wall of the lido -lrb- literally the beach -rrb- though incomplete like most of the great and vaunted work of the other hemisphere and more particularly of italy rank with the mole of ancona and the sea-wall of cherbourg the hundred little island which now contain the ruin of what during the middle age be the mart of the mediterranean be group together within cannon-shot of the natural barrier art have unite with nature to turn the whole to good account and apart from the influence of moral cause the rivalry of a neighboring town which have be foster by political care and the gradual fill up of the water by the constant deposit of the stream it would be difficult to imagine a more commodious or a safer haven when enter than that which venice afford even to this hour as all the deeper channel of the lagune have be preserve the city be intersect in every direction by passage which from they appearance be call canal but which in truth be no more than so many small natural branch of the sea on the margin of these passage the wall of the dwelling arise literally from out of the water since economy of room have cause they owner to extend they possession to the very verge of the channel in the manner that quay and wharf be push into the stream in we own country in many instance the island themselves be no more than bank which be periodically bare and on all the use of pile have be necessary to support the superincumbent load of palace church and public monument under which in the course of age the humble spit of sand have be make to groan the great frequency of the canal and perhaps some attention to economy of labor have give to by far the greater part of the building the facility of a approach by water but while nearly every dwelling have one of its front on a canal there be always communication by the rear with the interior passage of the town it be a fault in most description that while the stranger hear so much of the canal of venice but little be say of she street : still narrow paved commodious and noiseless passage of this description intersect all the island which communicate with each other by means of a countless number of bridge though the hoof of a horse or the rumble of a wheel be never hear in these strait avenue they be of great resort for all the purpose of ordinary intercourse gino issue into one of these thoroughfare when he quit the private passage which communicate with the palace of he master he thread the throng by which it be crowd with a dexterity that resemble the winding of a eel among the weed of the lagune to the numerous greeting of he fellow he reply only by nod nor do he once arrest he footstep until they have lead he through the door of a low and dark dwelling that stand in a quarter of the place which be inhabit by people of a inferior condition grope he way among cask cordage and rubbish of all description the gondolier succeed in find a inner and retired door that open into a small room whose only light come from a species of well that descend between the wall of the adjacent house and that in which he be bless st anne be it thou gino monaldus exclaim a smart venetian grisette whose tone and manner betray as much of coquetry as of surprise on foot and by the secret door be this a hour to come on any of thy errand truly annina it be not the season for affair with thy father and it be something early for a visit to thee but there be less time for word than for action just now for the sake of san teodoro and that of a constant and silly young man who if not thy slave be at least thy dog bring forth the

matter of gravity and one that must be perform offhand the jacket if thou lovest I annina who have not neglect essential while she moralize on motive throw the garment on a stool that stand within

vestment and as rapidly assume the plainer garment he have seek -- the cap annina and the mask one who wear so false a face in common have little need of a bit of silk to conceal he countenance she answer throw he notwithstanding both the article he require this be well father battista himself who boast he can tell a sinner from a penitent merely by the savor of he presence would never suspect a

consulting thy wit for some plausible lie i look at the wall because conscience tell I that too much weakness for thee be about to draw I astray from duty what thou takest for deceit be only shame and modesty of that we shall judge when the tale be tell then listen thou hast hear of the affair between my master and the niece of the roman marchese who be drown in the giudecca by the carelessness of a ancona-man who pass over the gondola of pietro as if he felucca have be a galley of state who have be upon the lido the month past without hear the tale repeat with every variation of a gondolier 's anger well the matter be likely to come to a conclusion this night my master be about to do as i fear a very foolish thing he will be marry or worse i be send in all haste and secresy in search of a priest annina manifest strong interest in the fiction of the gondolier either from a distrustful temperament long habit or great familiarity with the character of she companion however she do not listen to he explanation without betray some doubt of its truth this will be a sudden bridal feast she say after a moment of pause ` tis well that few be invite or its savor might be spoil by the three hundred to what convent art thou send my errand be not particular the first that may be find provide he be a franciscan and a priest likely to have bowels for lover in haste don camillo monforte

of this cup and disburden thy conscience like a man i would that thy father would make the acquaintance of stefano milano resume the gondolier take a long breath after a still longer draught ` tis a padrone of calabrium who oftentimes bring into the port excellent liquor of he country and who would pass a cask of the red lachryma christus through the broglio itself and not a noble of they all should see it the man be here at present and if thou wilt he shall not be long without come into term with thee for a few skin i doubt if he have better liquor than this which have ripened upon the sand of the lido take another draught for the second taste be think to be better than the first if the wine improve in this manner thy father should be heavy-hearted at the sight of the lees ` twould be no more than charity to bring he and stefano acquaint why not do it immediately he felucca be in the port thou sayest and thou canst lead he hither by the secret door and the lane thou forgettest my errand don camillo be not use to be serve the second cospetto ' t be a pity that any other get the liquor which i be certain the calabrian have in secret this errand can be no matter of a moment like that of be sure of wine of the quality thou namest or if it be thou canst first dispatch thy master 's business and then to the port in quest of stefano that the purchase may not fail i will take a mask and be thy companion to see the calabrian thou knowest my father have much confidence in my judgment in matter like this while gino stand half stupified and half delighted at this proposition the ready and wily annina make some slight change in she outer garment place a silken mask before she face apply a key to the door and beckon to the gondolier to follow the canal with which the dwelling of the wine-dealer communicate be narrow gloomy and little frequent a gondola of the plainest description be fasten near and the girl enter it without appear to think any further arrangement necessary the servant of don camillo hesitate a single instant but have see that he half-meditated project of escape by the use of another boat could not be accomplish for want of means he take he worried place in the stern and begin to ply the oar with mechanical readiness chapter iii what well appoint leader front we here king henry vi the presence of annina be a grave embarrassment to gino he have he secret wish and limited ambition like other man and among the strongest of the former be the desire to stand well in the favor of the wine-seller 's daughter but the artful girl in cater to he palate with a liquor that be scarcely less celebrated among people of he class for its strength than its flavor have cause a momentary confusion in the brain of gino that require time to disperse the boat be in the grand canal and far on its way to the place of its destination before this happy purification of the intellect of the gondolier have be sufficiently effect by that time however the exercise of rowing the fresh air of the evening and the sight of so many accustomed object restore he faculty to the necessary degree of coolness and forethought as the boat approach the end of the canal he begin to cast he eye about he in quest of the well know felucca of the calabrian though the glory of venice have depart the trade of the city be not then at its present low ebb the port be still crowd with vessel from many distant haven and the flag of most of the maritime state of europe be see at interval within the barrier of the lido the moon be now sufficiently high to cast its soft light on the whole of the glittering basin and a forest compose of lateen yard of the slender mast of polacca and of the more massive and heavy hamper of regularly rig ship be to be see rise above the tranquil element thou art no judge of a vessel 's beauty annina say the gondolier to he companion who be deeply house in the pavilion of the boat else should i tell thee to look at this stranger from candia ` tis say that a fairer model have never enter within the lido than that same greek we errand be not with the candian trader gino therefore ply thy oar for time pass there be plenty of rough greek wine in he hold but as thou sayest we have naught with he yon tall ship which be moor without the smaller craft of we sea be the vessel of a lutheran from the island of inghilterra 'twa a sad day for the republic girl when it first permit the stranger to come into the water of the adriatic be it certain gino that the arm of st mark be strong enough to keep he out mother of diana i would rather thou didst not ask that question in a place where so many gondolier be in motion here be ragusan maltese sicilian and tuscan without number and a little fleet of french lie near each other there at the entrance of the giudecca they be a people who get together afloat or ashore for the benefit of the tongue here we be at the end of we journey the oar of gino give a backward sweep and the gondola be at rest by the side of a felucca a happy night to the bellum sorrentina and she worthy padrone be the greet of the gondolier as he put he foot on the deck of the vessel be the honest stefano milano on board the swift felucca the calabrian be not slow to answer and in a few moment the padrone and he two visitor be in close and secret conference i have bring one here who will be likely to put good venetian sequin into thy pocket caro observe the gondolier when the preliminary of discourse have be properly observe she be the daughter of a most conscientious wine-dealer who be quite as ready at transplant you sicilian grape into the island as he be willing and able to pay for they and one no doubt as handsome as she be ready say the mariner with blunt gallantry be the black cloud but fairly drive from before she face a mask be of little consequence in a bargain provide the money be forthcoming we be always in the carnival at venice and he who would buy or he who would sell have the same right to hide he face as to hide he thought what hast thou in the way of forbid liquor stefano that my companion may not lose the night in idle word per diana master gino thou puttest thy question with little ceremony the hold of the felucca be empty as thou mayest see by step to the hatch and as for any liquor we be perish for a drop to warm the blood and so far from come to seek it here say annina we should have do better to have go into the cathedral and say a ave for thy safe voyage home and now that we wit be spend we will quit thee friend stefano for some other less skilful in answer cospetto thou knowest not what thou sayest whisper gino when he find that the wary annina be not dispose to remain the man never enter the meanest creek in italy without have something useful secrete in the felucca on he own account one purchase of he would settle the question between the quality of thy father 's wine and those of battista there be not a gondolier in venice but will resort to thy shop if the intercourse with this fellow can be fairly settle annina hesitate long practice in the small but secret exceedingly hazardous commerce which she father notwithstanding the vigilance and severity of the venetian police have thus far successfully drive she neither like to risk a exposure of she view to a utter stranger nor to abandon a bargain that promise to be lucrative that gino trifle with she as to he true errand need no confirmation since a servant of the duke of sant ' aga be not likely to need a disguise to search a priest but she know he zeal for she personal welfare too well to distrust he faith in a matter that concern she own safety if thou distrust that any here be the spy of the authority she observe to the padrone with a manner that readily betray she wish it will be in gino 's power to undeceive thee thou wilt testify gino that i be not to be suspect of treachery in a affair like this leave I to put a word into the private ear of the calabrian say the gondolier significantly -- stefano milano if thou love I he continue when they be a little apart keep the girl in parley and treat with she fairly for thy adventure shall i sell the vintage of don camillo or that of the viceroy of sicily caro there be as much wine of each on board the bellum sorrentina as would float the fleet of the republic if in truth thou art dry then feign that thou hast it and differ in thy price entertain she but a minute with fair word while i can get unseen into my gondola and then for the sake of a old and try friend put she tenderly on the quay in the best manner thou art able i begin to see into the nature of the trade return the pliant padrone place a finger on the side of he nose i will discourse the woman by the hour about the flavor of the liquor or if thou wilt of she own beauty but to squeeze a drop of anything better than the water of the lagune out of the rib of the felucca would be a miracle worthy of san teodoro there be but little need to touch on aught but the quality of thy wine the girl be not like most of she sex and she take sudden offence when there be question of she appearance indeed the mask she wear be as much to hide a face that have little to tempt the eye as from any wish at concealment since gino have enter frankly into the matter resume the quick-witted calabrian cheerfully and with a air of sudden confidence to the expectant annina i begin to see more probability of we understanding each other 's meaning deign bellum donna to go into my poor cabin where we will speak more at we ease and something more to we mutual profit and mutual security annina be not without secret doubt but she suffer the padrone to lead she to the stair of the cabin as if she be dispose to descend she back be no sooner turn than gino slide into the gondola which one shove of he vigorous arm send far beyond the leap of man the action be sudden rapid and noiseless but the jealous eye of annina detect the escape of the gondolier though not in time to prevent it without betray uneasiness she submit to be lead below as if the whole be do by previous concert gino have say that you have a boat which will do the friendly office to put I on the quay when we conference be over she remark with a presence of mind that luckily meet the expedient of she late companion the felucca itself should do that much be there want of other means gallantly return the manner when they disappear in the cabin free to discharge he duty gino now ply he task with redoubled zeal the light boat glide among the vessel incline by the skilful management of he single oar in a manner to avoid all collision until it enter the narrow canal which separate the palace of the doge from the more beautiful and classic structure that contain the prison of the republic the bridge which continue the communication of the quay be first pass and then he be steal beneath that far-famed arch which support a covered gallery lead from the upper story of the palace into that of the prison and which from its be appropriate to the passage of the accuse from they cell to the presence of they judge have be so poetically and it may be add so pathetically call the bridge of sigh the oar of gino now relax its effort and the gondola approach a flight of step over which as usual the water cast its little wave step on the lowest flag he thrust a small iron spike to which a cord be attach into a crevice between two of the stone and leave he boat to the security of this characteristic fastening when this little precaution be observe the gondolier pass up lightly beneath the massive arch of the water-gate of the palace and enter its large but gloomy court at that hour and with the temptation of the gay scene which offer in the adjoining square the place be nearly desert a single female water-carrier be at the well wait for the element to filter into its basin in order to fill she bucket while she ear listen in dull attention to the hum of the move crowd without a halberdier pace the open gallery at the head of the giant 's stair and here and there the footfall of other sentinel might be hear among the hollow and ponderous arch of the long corridor no light be shed from the window but the entire building present a fit emblem of that mysterious power which be know to preside over the fortune of venice and she citizen ere gino trust himself without the shadow of the passage by which he have enter two or three curious face have appear at the opposite entrance of the court where they pause a moment to gaze at the melancholy and impose air of the dreaded palace before they vanish in the throng which trifle in the immediate proximity of that secret and ruthless tribunal as man riot in security even on the verge of a endless and unforeseen future disappointed in he expectation of meet he he seek on the instant the gondolier advance and take courage by the possibility of he escape altogether from the interview he venture to furnish audible evidence of he presence by a loud hem at that instant a figure glide into the court from the side of the quay and walk swiftly towards its center the heart of gino beat violently but he muster resolution to meet the stranger as they draw near each other it become evident by the light of the moon which penetrate even to that gloomy spot that the latter be also mask san teodoro and san marco have you in mind commence the gondolier if i mistake not you be the man i be send to meet the stranger start and first manifest a intention to pass on quickly he suddenly arrest the movement to reply this may be so or not unmask that i may judge by thy countenance if what thou sayest be true by you good leave most worthy and honorable signora and if it be equally agreeable to you and my master i would choose to keep off the evening air by this bit of pasteboard and silk here be none to betray thee wert thou naked as at thy birth unless certain of thy character in what manner may i confide in thy honesty i have no distrust of the virtue of a undisguised face signora and therefore do i invite you yourself to exhibit what nature have do for you in the way of feature that i who be to make the confidence be sure it be to the right person this be well and give assurance of thy prudence i may not unmask however and as there seemeth little probability of we come to a understanding i will go my way a most happy night to thee cospetto -- signora you be far too quick in you idea and movement for one little used to negotiation of this sort here be a ring whose signet may help we to understand each other the stranger take the jewel and hold the stone in a manner to receive the light of the moon he start in a manner to betray both surprise and pleasure this be the falcon crest of the neapolitan -- he that be the lord of sant ' aga and of many other fief good signora to say nothing of the honor he claim in venice be i right in suppose my errand with you thou hast find one whose present business have no other object than don camillo monforte but thy errand be not solely to exhibit the signet so little so that i have a packet here which wait only for a certainty of the person with whom i speak to be place into he hand the stranger muse a moment then glance a look about he he answer hurriedly -- this be no place to unmask friend even though we only wear we disguise in pleasantry tarry here and at my return i will conduct thee to a more fitting spot the word be scarcely utter when gino find himself stand in the middle of the court alone the mask stranger have pass swiftly on and be at the bottom of the giant 's stair ere the gondolier have time for reflection he ascend with a light and rapid step and without regard the halberdier he approach the first of three or four orifice which open into the wall of the palace and which from the head of the animal be carve in relief around they have become famous as the receptacle of secret accusation under the name of the lion 's mouth something he drop into the grin aperture of the marble though what the distance and the obscurity of the gallery prevent gino from perceive and then he form be see glide like a phantom down the flight of massive step gino have retire towards the arch of the water-gate in expectation that the stranger would rejoin he within its shadow but to he great alarm he see the form dart through the outer portal of the palace into the square of st mark it be not a moment ere gino breathless with haste be in chase on reach the bright and gay scene of the piazza which contrast with the gloomy court he have just quit like morning with night he see the utter fruitlessness of further pursuit frighten at the loss of he master 's signet however the indiscreet but well intentioned gondolier rush into the crowd and try in vain to select the delinquent from among a thousand mask harkee signora utter the half-distracted gondolier to one who have first examine he person with distrust evidently betray a wish to avoid he if thou hast sufficiently pleased thy finger with my master 's signet the occasion offer to return it i know thee not return a voice in which gino 's ear could detect no familiar sound it may not be well to trifle with the displeasure of a noble as powerful as he you know he whisper at the elbow of another who have come under he suspicion the signet if thou pleasest and the affair need go no further he who would meddle in it with or without that gage would do well to pause the gondolier again turn away disappoint the ring be not suit to thy masquerade friend of mine he essay with a third and it would be wise not to trouble the podestà about such a trifle then name it not lest he hear thee the answer prove like all the other unsatisfactory and bootless gino now cease to question any but he thread the throng with a active and eager eye fifty time be he tempt to speak but as often do some difference in stature or dress some laugh or trifle utter in levity warn he of he mistake he penetrate to the very head of the piazza and return by the opposite side he find he way through the throng of the portico look into every coffee-house and examine each figure that float by until he again issue into the piazzetta without success a slight jerk at the elbow of he jacket arrest he step and he turn to look at the person who have detain he a female attired like a contadina address he in the feigned voice common to all whither so fast and what hast thou lose in this merry crowd if a heart ` twill be wise to use diligence for many here may be willing to wear the jewel corpo di bacco exclaim the disappointed gondolier any who find such a bauble of mine under foot be welcome to they luck hast thou see a domino of a size like that of any other man with a gait that might pass for the step of a senator padre or jew and a mask that look as much like a thousand of these in the square as one side of the campanile be like the other thy picture be so well draw that one can not fail to know the original he stand beside thee gino wheel suddenly and see that a grinning harlequin be play he antic in the place where he have expect to find the stranger and thy eye bella contadina be as dull as a mole 's he cease speak for deceive in he person she who have salute he be no longer visible in this manner do the disappointed gondolier thread he way towards the water now answer to the boisterous salute of some clown and now repel the advance of female less disguised than the pretended contadina until he gain a space near the quay where there be more room for observation here he pause undetermined whether to return and confess he indiscretion to he master or whether he should make still another effort to regain the ring which have be so sillily lose the vacant space between the two granite column be leave to the quiet possession of himself and one other who stand near the base of that which sustain the lion of st mark as motionless as if he too be merely a form of stone two or three straggler either lead by idle curiosity or expect to meet one appoint to await they come draw near this immovable man but all glide away as if there be repulsion in he marble-like countenance gino have witness several instance of this evident dislike to remain near the unknown figure ere he feel induce to cross the space between they in order to inquire into its cause a slow movement at the sound of he footstep bring the ray of the moon full upon the calm countenance and search eye of the very man he seek the first impulse of the gondolier like that of all the other he have see approach the spot be to retreat but the recollection of he errand and

interview with the bravo chapter iv ' t will make I think the world be full of rub and that my fortune run ` gainst the bias richard the second though venice at that hour be so gay in she square the rest of the town be silent as the grave a city in which the hoof of horse or the rolling of wheel be never hear necessarily possess a character of its own but the peculiar form of the government and the long training of the people in habit of caution weigh on the spirit of the gay there be time and place it be true when the buoyancy of youthful blood and the levity of the thoughtless find occasion for they display -- nor be they rare but when man find themselves remove from the temptation and perhaps from the support of society they appear to imbibe the character of they sombre city such be the state of most of the town while the scene describe in the previous chapter be exhibit in the lively piazza of san marco the moon have rise so high that its light fall between the range of wall here and there touch the surface of the water to which it impart a quiver brightness while the dome and tower rest beneath its light in a solemn but grand repose occasionally the front of a palace receive the ray on its heavy cornice and labor column the gloomy stillness of the interior of the edifice furnish in every such instance a striking contrast to the richness and architectural beauty without we narrative now lead we to one of these patrician abode of the first class a heavy magnificence pervade the style of the dwelling the vestibule be vast vaulted and massive the stair rich in marble heavy and grand the apartment be impose in they gilding and sculpture while the wall sustain countless work on which the highest genius of italy have lavishly diffuse they power among these relic of a age more happy in this respect than that of which we write the connoisseur would readily have know the pencil of titian paul veronese and tintoretto -- the three great name in which the subject of st mark so justly pride themselves among these work of the higher master be mingled other by the pencil of bellino and montegna and palma vecchio -- artist who be secondary only to the more renowned colorist of the venetian school vast sheet of mirror line the wall wherever the still more precious painting have no place while the ordinary hanging of velvet and silk become object of secondary admiration in a scene of nearly royal magnificence the cool and beautiful floor make of a composition in which all the prize marble of italy and of the east polish to the last degree of art be curiously embedded form a suitable finish to a style so gorgeous and in which luxury and taste be blended in equal profusion the building which on two of its side literally rise from out the water be as usual erect around a dark court follow its different face the eye might penetrate by many a door open at that hour for the passage of the air from off the sea through long suite of room furnish and fit in the manner describe all light by shaded lamp that spread a soft and gentle glow around pass without notice range of reception and sleep room -- the latter of a magnificence to mock the ordinary want of the body -- we shall at once introduce the reader into the part of the palace where the business of the tale conduct we at the angle of the dwelling on the side of the smaller of the two canal and most remote from the principal water-avenue of the city on which the edifice front there be a suite of apartment which while it exhibit the same style of luxury and magnificence as those first mention in its general character discover greater attention in its detail to the want of ordinary life the hanging be of the richest velvet or of glossy silk the mirror be large and of exquisite truth the floor of the same gay and please color and the wall be adorn with they appropriate work of art but the whole be soften down to a picture of domestic comfort the tapestry and curtain hang in careless fold the bed admit of sleep and the picture be delicate copy by the pencil of some youthful amateur whose leisure have be exercise in this gentle and feminine employment the fair be herself whose early instruction have give birth to so many skilful imitation of the divine expression of raphael or to the vivid tint of titian be at that hour in she privacy discourse with she ghostly adviser and one of she own sex who have long discharge the joint trust of instructor and parent the year of the lady of the palace be so tender that in a more northern region she would scarcely have be deem past the period of childhood though in she native land the justness and maturity of she form and the expression of a dark eloquent eye indicate both the growth and the intelligence of womanhood for this good counsel i thank you my father and my excellent donna florinda will thank you still more for you opinion be so like she own that i sometimes admire the secret means by which experience enable the wise and the good to think so much alike on a matter of so little personal interest a slight but furtive smile struggle around the mortified mouth of the carmelite as he listen to the naive observation of he ingenuous pupil thou wilt learn my child he answer as time heap wisdom on thy head that it be in concern which touch we passion and interest least we be most apt to decide with discretion and impartiality though donna florinda be not yet past the age when the heart be finally subdue and there be still so much to bind she to the world she will assure thee of this truth or i greatly mistake the excellence of that mind which have hitherto lead she so far blameless in this err pilgrimage to which we be all doom though the cowl be over the head of the speaker who be evidently prepare to depart and he deeply-seated eye never vary from its friendly look at the fair face of she he instruct the blood steal into the pale cheek of the maternal companion and she whole countenance betray some such reflection of feeling at he praise as a wintry sky exhibit at a sudden gleam from the setting sun i trust that violetta do not now hear this for the first time observe donna florinda in a voice so meek and tremulous as to be observe little that can be profitably tell one of my inexperience have be leave untaught quickly answer the pupil unconscious herself that she reach she hand towards that of she constant monitor though too intent on she object to change she look from the feature of the carmelite but why this desire in the senate to dispose of a girl who would be satisfy to live for ever as she be now happy in she youth and contented with the privacy which become she sex the relentless year will not stay they advance that even one innocent as thou may never know the unhappiness and trial of a more mature age this life be one of imperious and oftentimes of tyrannical duty thou art not ignorant of the policy that rule a state which have make its name so illustrious by high deed in arm its riches and its widely-spread influence there be a law in venice which commandeth that none claim a interest in its affair shall so bind himself to the stranger as to endanger the devotion all owe to the republic thus may not the patrician of st mark be a lord in other land nor may the heiress of a name great and value as thine be give in marriage to any of note in a foreign state without counsel and consent from those who be appoint to watch over the interest of all have providence cast my lot in a humbler class this would not have be methink it ill comport with the happiness of woman to be the especial care of the council of ten there be indiscretion and i lament to say impiety in thy word we duty bid we submit to earthly law and more than duty reverence teach we not to repine at the will of providence but i do not see the weight of this grievance against which thou murmurest daughter thou art youthful wealthy beyond the indulgence of all healthful desire of a lineage to excite a unwholesome worldly pride and fair enough to render thee the most dangerous of thine own enemy -- and thou repinest at a lot to which all of thy sex and station be of necessity subject for the offence against providence i be already a penitent return the donna violetta but surely it would be less embarrassing to a girl of sixteen be the father of the state so much occupy with more weighty affair as to forget she birth and year and haply she wealth there would be little merit in be content with a world fashion after we own caprice though it may be question if we should be happier by have all thing as we desire than by be compel to submit to they as they be the interest take by the republic in thy particular welfare daughter be the price thou payest for the ease and magnificence with which thou art encircle one more obscure and less endowed by fortune might have greater freedom of will but it would be accompany by none of the pomp which adorn the dwelling of thy father i would there be less of luxury and more of liberty within its wall time will enable thee to see differently at thy age all be view in color of gold or life be render bootless because we be thwart in we ill-digested wish i deny not however that thy fortune be temper by some peculiar passage venice be rule by a policy that be often calculate and haply some deem it remorseless though the voice of the carmelite have fall he pause and glance a uneasy look from beneath he cowl ere he continue the caution of the senate teach it to preclude as far as in it lie the union of interest that may not only oppose each other but which may endanger those of the state thus as i have say none of senatorial rank may hold land without the limit of the republic nor may any of account connect themselves by the tie of marriage with stranger of dangerous influence without the consent and supervision of the republic the latter be thy situation for of the several foreign lord who seek thy hand the council see none to whom the favor may be extend without the apprehension of create a influence here in the center of the canal which ought not to be give to a stranger don camillo monforte the cavalier to whom thou art indebted for thy life and of whom thou hast so lately speak with gratitude have far more cause to complain of these hard decree than thou mayest have in any reason ` twould make my grief still heavier do i know that one who have show so much courage in my behalf have equal reason to feel they justice return violetta quickly what be the affair that so fortunately for I have bring the lord of sant ' aga to venice if a grateful girl may without indiscretion inquire thy interest in he behalf be both natural and commendable answer the carmelite with a simplicity which do more credit to he cowl than to he observation he be young and doubtless he be tempt by the gift of fortune and the passion of he year to diver act of weakness remember he daughter in thy prayer that part of the debt of gratitude may be repay he worldly interest here be one of general notoriety and i can ascribe thy ignorance of it only to a retired manner of life my charge have other matter to occupy she thought than the concern of a young stranger who cometh to venice for affair mildly observe donna florinda but if i be to remember he in my prayer father it might enlighten my petition to know in what the young noble be most want i would have thee remember he spiritual necessity only he wanteth of a truth little in temporality that the world can offer though the desire of life often lead he who have most in quest of more it would seem that a ancestor of don camillo be anciently a senator of venice when the death of a relation bring many calabrian signory into he possession the younger of he son by a especial decree which favor a family that have well serve the state take these estate while the elder transmit the senatorial rank and the venetian fortune to he posterity time have extinguish the elder branch and don camillo have for year besiege the council to be restore to those rights which he predecessor renounce can they refuse he he demand involve a departure from establish law be he to renounce the calabrian lordship the neapolitan might lose more than he would gain and to keep both be to infringe a law that be rarely suffer to be dormant i know little daughter of the interest of life but there be enemy of the republic who say that its servitude be not easy and that it seldom bestow favor of this sort without seek a ample equivalent be this as it should be if don camillo monforte have claim in venice whether it be to palace on the canal or to land on the main to honor in the state or voice in the senate justice should be render without delay lest it be say the republic vaunt more of the sacred quality than it practise thou speakest as a guileless nature prompt it be the frailty of man my daughter to separate he public act from the fearful responsibility of he private deed as if god in endow he be with reason and the glorious hope of christianity have also endowed he with two soul of which only one be to be care for be there not those father who believe that while the evil we commit as individual be visit on we own person that which be do by state fall on the nation the pride of human reason have invent diverse subtlety to satisfy its own longing but it can never feed itself on a delusion more fatal than this the crime which involve other in its guilt or consequence be doubly a crime and though it be a property of sin to entail its own punishment even in we present life he trust to a vain hope who think the magnitude of the offence will ever be its apology the chief security of we nature be to remove it beyond temptation and he be safest from the allurement of the world who be farthest remove from its vice though i would wish justice do to the noble neapolitan it may be for he everlasting peace that the additional wealth he seek should be withhold i be unwilling to believe father that a cavalier who have show himself so ready to assist the distressed will easily abuse the gift of fortune the carmelite fasten a uneasy look on the bright feature of the young venetian parental solicitude and prophetic foresight be in he glance but the expression be relieve by the charity of a chastened spirit gratitude to the preserver of thy life become thy station and sex it be a duty cherish the feeling for it be akin to the holy obligation of man to he creator be it enough to feel grateful demand violetta one of my name and alliance might do more we can move the patrician of my family in behalf of the stranger that he protracted suit may come to a more speedy end daughter beware the intercession of one in whom st mark feel so lively a interest may raise up enemy to don camillo instead of friend donna violetta be silent while the monk and donna florinda both regard she with affectionate concern the former then adjust he cowl and prepare to depart the noble maiden approach the carmelite and look into he face with ingenuous confidence and habitual reverence she beseech he blessing when the solemn and customary office be perform the monk turn towards the companion of he spiritual charge donna florinda permit the silk on which she needle have be busy to fall into she lap and she sit in meek silence while the carmelite raise he open palm towards she bended head he lip move but the word of benediction be inaudible have the ardent be intrust to they joint care be less occupy with she own feeling or more practice in the interest of that world into which she be about to enter it be probable she would have detect some evidence of that deep but smother sympathy which so often betray itself in the silent intelligence of she ghostly father and she female mentor thou wilt not forget we father say violetta with win earnestness a orphan girl in whose fate the sage of the republic so seriously busy themselves have need of every friend in whom she can confide bless be thy intercessor say the monk and the peace of the innocent be with thee once more he wave he hand and turn he slowly quit the room the eye of donna florinda follow the white robe of the carmelite while they be visible and when it fall again upon the silk it be for a moment close as if look at the movement of the rebuke spirit within the young mistress of the palace summon a menial and bid he do honor to she confessor by see he to he gondola she then move to the open balcony a long pause succeed it be such a silence breathing thoughtful and luxurious with the repose of italy as suit the city and the hour suddenly violetta recede from the open window and withdraw a step in alarm be there a boat beneath demand she companion whose glance be unavoidably attract to the movement the water be never more quiet but thou hearest those strain of the hautboy be they so rare on the canal that they drive thee from the balcony there be cavalier beneath the window of the mentonus palace doubtless they compliment we friend olivium even that gallantry be common thou knowest that olivium be shortly to be unite to she kinsman and he take the usual means to show he admiration dost thou not find this public announcement of a passion painful be i to be woo i could wish it might only be to my own ear that be a unhappy sentiment for one whose hand be in the gift of the senate i fear that a maiden of thy rank must be content to hear she beauty extol and she merit sing if not exaggerate even by hireling beneath a balcony i would that they be do exclaimed violetta stop she ear none know the excellence of we friend better than i but this open exposure of thought that ought to be so private must wind she thou mayest go again into the balcony the music cease there be gondolier singing near the rialto -- these be sound i love sweet in themselves they do no violence to we sacred feeling art thou for the water to-night my florinda whither would ` st thou i know not but the evening be brilliant and i pine to mingle with the splendor and pleasure without while thousand on the canal pine to mingle with the splendor and pleasure within thus be it ever with life : that which be possess be little value and that which we have not be without price i owe my duty to my guardian say violetta we will row to he palace though donna florinda have utter so grave a moral she speak without severity casting aside she work she prepare to gratify the desire of she charge it be the usual hour for the high in rank and the secluded to go abroad and neither venice with its gay throng nor italy with its soft climate ever offer greater temptation to seek the open air the groom of the chamber be call the gondolier be summon and the lady cloak and take they mask be quickly in the boat chapter v if you master would have a queen he beggar you must tell he that majesty to keep decorum must no less beg than a kingdom antony and cleopatra the silent movement of the hearse-like gondola soon bring the fair venetian and she female mentor to the water-gate of the noble who have be intrust by the senate with the especial guardianship of the person of the heiress it be a residence of more than common gloom possess all the solemn but stately magnificence which then characterize the private dwelling of the patrician in that city of riches and pride its magnitude and architecture though rather less impose than those which distinguish the palace of the donna violetta place it among the private edifice of the first order and all its external decoration show it to be the habitation of one of high importance within the noiseless step and the air of silent distrust among the domestic add to the gloomy grandeur of the apartment render the abode no bad type of the republic itself as neither of he present visitor be a stranger beneath the roof of the signor gradenigo -- for so the proprietor of the palace be call -- they ascend its massive stair without pause to consider any of those novelty of construction that would attract the eye of one unaccustomed to such a dwelling the rank and the known consequence of the donna violetta assure she of a ready reception and while she be usher to the suite of room above by a crowd of bow menial one have go with become speed to announce she approach to he master when in the ante-chamber however the ward stop decline to proceed any further in deference to the convenience and privacy of she guardian the delay be short for no sooner be the old senator apprise of she presence than he hasten from he closet to do she honor with a zeal that do credit to he fitness for the trust he fill the countenance of the old patrician -- a face in which thought and care have draw as many line as time -- light with unequivocal satisfaction as he press forward to receive he beautiful ward to she half-uttered apology for the intrusion he would not listen but as he lead she within he gallantly profess he pleasure at be honor with she visit even at moment that to she scrupulous delicacy might appear the most ill-timed thou canst never come amiss child as thou art of my ancient friend and the especial care of the state he add the gate of the gradenigo palace would open of themselves at the latest period of the night to receive such a guest besides the hour be most suit to the convenience of one of thy quality who would breathe the fresh evening air on the canal be i to limit thee to hour and minute some truant wish of the moment -- some innocent caprice of thy sex and year might go ungratified ah donna florinda we may well pray that all we affection -- not to call it weakness -- for this persuasive girl shall not in the end lead to she own disadvantage for the indulgence of both i be grateful return violetta i only fear to urge my little request at moment when you precious time be more worthily occupy in behalf of the state thou overratest my consequence i sometimes visit the council of three hundred but my year and infirmity preclude I now from serve the republic as i could wish praise be to st mark we patron its affair be not unprosperous for we decline fortune we have deal bravely with the infidel of late the treaty with the emperor be not to we wrong and the anger of the church for the late seeming breach of confidence on we part have be divert we owe something in the latter affair to a young neapolitan who sojourn here at venice and who be not without interest at the holy see by reason of he uncle the cardinal secretary much good be do by the influence of friend properly employ ` tis the secret of we success in the actual condition of venice for that which power can not achieve must be trust to favor and a wise moderation you declaration encourage I to become once more a suitor for i will confess that in addition to the desire of do you honor i have come equally with the wish to urge you great influence in behalf of a earnest suit i have what now we young charge donna florinda have inherit with the fortune of she family its ancient habit of patronage and protection but we will not discourage the feeling for it have a worthy origin and use with discretion it fortify the noble and powerful in they station and may we not say mildly observe donna florinda that when the affluent and happy employ themselves with the care of the less fortunate they not only discharge a duty but they cultivate a wholesome and useful state of mind doubt it not nothing can be more useful than to give to each class in society a proper sense of its obligation and a just sentiment of its duty these be opinion i greatly approve and which i desire my ward may thoroughly understand she be happy in possess instructor so able and so willing to teach all she should know rejoin violetta with this admission may i ask the signor gradenigo to give ear to my petition thy little request be ever welcome i would merely observe that generous and ardent temperament sometimes regard a distant object so steadily as to overlook other that be not only nearer and perhaps of still more urgent importance but more attainable in do a benefit to one we should be wary not to do injury to many the relative of some one of thy household may have thoughtlessly enlist for the war should it be so i trust the recruit will have the manhood not to quit he color thy nurse who be one little likely to forget the service she do thy infancy urge the claim of some kinsman to a employment in the custom i believe all of that family be long since place say violetta laughing unless we might establish the good mother herself in some station of honor i have naught to ask in they behalf she who have rear thee to this goodly and healthful beauty would prefer a well-supported suit but still be she better as she be indolent and i fear pampered by thy liberality thy private purse be drain by demand on thy charity -- or perhaps the waywardness of a female taste have cost thee dear of late neither i have little need of gold for one of my year can not properly maintain the magnificence of she condition i come guardian with a far graver solicitation than any of these i hope none in thy favor have be indiscreet of speech exclaim the signor gradenigo cast a hasty and suspicious look at he ward if any have be so thoughtless let they abide the punishment of they fault i commend thy justice in this age of novel opinion innovation of all description can not be too severely check be the senate to shut its ear to all the wild theory that be utter by the unthinking and vain they language would soon penetrate to the ill-regulated mind of the ignorant and idle ask I if thou wilt for purse in score but do not move I to forgetfulness of the guilt of the disturber of the public peace not a sequin my errand be of nobler quality speak without riddle that i may know its object now that nothing stand between she wish to speak and she own manner of make know the request donna violetta appear to shrink from express it she color go and come and she seek support from the eye of she attentive and wonder companion as the latter be ignorant of she intention however she could do no more than encourage the supplicant by such a expression of sympathy as woman rarely refuse to she sex in any trial that involve they peculiar and distinctive feeling violetta struggle with she diffidence and then laugh at she own want of self-possession she continue -- you know signor gradenigo she say with a loftiness that be not less puzzling though far more intelligible than the agitation which a moment before have embarrass she manner that i be the last of a line eminent for century in the state of venice so sayeth we history that i bear a name long know and which it become I to shield from all imputation of discredit in my own person this be so true that it scarce need so clear a exposure drily return the senator and that though thus gifted by the accident of fortune and birth i have receive a boon that remain still unrequited in a manner to do no honor to the house of thiepolo this becometh serious donna florinda we ward be more earnest than intelligible and i must ask a explanation at you hand it becometh she not to receive boon of this nature from any though unprepared for this request mildly reply the companion i think she speak of the boon of life the signor gradenigo 's countenance assume a dark expression i understand you he say coldly it be true that the neapolitan be ready to rescue thee when the calamity befall thy uncle of florence but don camillo monforte be not a common diver of the lido to be reward like he who find a bauble drop from a gondola thou hast thank the cavalier i trust that a noble maiden can do no more in a case like this that i have thank he and thank he from my soul be true fervently exclaim violetta when i forget the service marium santissima and the good saint forget I i doubt signora florinda that you charge have spend more hour among the light work of she late father 's library and less time with she missal than become she birth the eye of violetta kindle and she fold a arm around the form of she shrinking companion who draw down she veil at this reproof though she forbear to answer signor gradenigo say the young heiress i may have do discredit to my instructor but if the pupil have be idle the fault should not be visit on the innocent it be some evidence that the command of holy church have not be neglect that i now come to entreat favor in behalf of one to whom i owe my life don camillo monforte have long pursue without success a claim so just that be there no other motive to concede it the character of venice should teach the senator the danger of delay my ward have spend lier leisure with the doctor of padua the republic have its law and none who have right on they side appeal to they in vain thy gratitude be not to be censure it be rather worthy of thy origin and hope still donna violetta we should remember how difficult it be to winnow the truth from the chaff of imposition and legal subtlety and most of all should a judge be certain before he give he decree that in confirm the claim of one applicant he do not defeat those of another they tamper with he rights be bear in a foreign realm he be require to renounce more in the land of the stranger than he will gain within the limit of the republic he waste life and youth in pursue a phantom you be of weight in the senate my guardian and be you to lend he the support of you powerful voice and great instruction a wrong noble would have justice and venice though she might lose a trifle from she store would better deserve the character of which she be so jealous thou art a persuasive advocate and i will think of what thou urgest say the signor gradenigo change the frown which have be gather about he brow to a look of indulgence with a facility that betray much practice in adapt the expression of he feature to he policy i ought only to hearken to the neapolitan in my public character of a judge but he service to thee and my weakness in thy behalf extort that thou would ` st have donna violetta receive the promise with a bright and guileless smile she kiss the hand he extend as the pledge of he faith with a fervor that give she attentive guardian serious uneasiness thou art too win even to be resist by one wearied with rebut plausible pretension he add the young and the generous donna florinda believe all to be as they own wish and simplicity would have they as for this right of don camillo -- but no matter -- thou wilt have it so and it shall be examine with that blindness which be say to be the fail of justice i have understand the metaphor to mean blind to favor but not insensible to the right i fear that be a sense which might defeat we hope -- but we will look into it my son have be mindful of he duty and respect of late donna violetta as i would have he the boy want little urge i know to do honor to my ward and the fairest of venice thou wilt receive he with friendship for the love thou bearest he father donna violetta curtsy but it be with womanly reserve the door of my palace be never shut on the signor giacomo on all proper occasion she say coldly signore the son of my guardian could hardly be other than a honor visitor i would have the boy attentive -- and even more i would have he prove some little of that great esteem -- but we live in a jealous city donna florinda and one in which prudence be a virtue of the highest price if the youth be less urgent than i could wish believe I it be from the apprehension of give premature alarm to those who interest themselves in the fortune of we charge both the lady bow and by the manner in which they draw they cloak about they they make evident they wish to retire donna violetta crave a blessing and after the usual compliment and a short dialogue of courtesy she and she companion withdraw to they boat the signor gradenigo pace the room in which he have receive he ward for several minute in silence not a sound of any sort be audible throughout the whole of that vast abode the stillness and cautious tread of those within answer to the quiet town without but a young man in whose countenance and air be to be see most of the usual sign of a well-bred profligacy

earnestness as i have yet to learn he errand before i go further signore it may be well to know more of he wish this reserve be uncalled for thou art not to distrust the prudence of the republic 's minister and i should be sorry be the inquisitor to get a unfavorable opinion of thy zeal the individual must be denounce i denounce he not the most that i can say be that he have a desire to deal privately with one with whom it be almost criminal to deal at all the prevention of crime be better than its punishment and such be the true object of all government thou wilt not withhold the name of thy correspondent it be a noble neapolitan who have long sojourn in venice on matter touch a great succession and some right even to the senate 's dignity ha don camillo monforte be i right sirrah signora the same the pause which follow be only break by the clock of the great square striking eleven or the fourth hour of the night as it be term by the usage of italy the senator start consult a time-piece in he own apartment and again address he companion this be well he say thy faith and punctuality shall be remembered look to the fisherman antonio the murmur of the old man must not be permit to awaken discontent for a cause so trifling as this transfer of he descendant from a gondola to a galley and most of all keep thy ear attentive to any rumor on the rialto the glory and credit of a patrician name must not be weaken by the error of boyhood as to this stranger -- quickly thy mask and cloak -- depart as if thou wert merely a friend bent on some of the idle pleasantry of the hour the bravo resume he disguise with the readiness of one long practice in its use but with a composure that be not so easily disconcert as that of the more sensitive senator the latter do not speak again though he hurry jacopo from he presence by a impatient movement of the hand when the door be close and the signor gradenigo be again alone he once more consult the time-piece pass he hand slowly and thoughtfully across he brow and resume he walk for nearly a hour this exercise or nervous sympathy of the body with a mind that be possibly overworked continue without any interruption from without then come a gentle tap at the door and at the usual bidding one enter closely mask like he who have depart as be so much the usage of that city in the age of which we write a glance at the figure of he guest seem to apprise the senator of he character for the reception while it be distinguish by the quaint courtesy of the age be that of one expect i be honor in the visit of don camillo monforte say the host while the individual name lay aside he cloak and silken visor though the lateness of the hour have give I reason to apprehend that some casualty have interfere between I and the pleasure a thousand excuse noble senator but the coolness of the canal and the gaiety of the square together with some apprehension of intrude prematurely on time so precious have i fear keep I out of season but i trust to the known goodness of the signor gradenigo for my apology the punctuality of the great lord of lower italy be not they greatest merit the signor gradenigo drily answer the young esteem life so endless that they take little heed of the minute that escape they while we whom age begin to menace think chiefly of repair the omission of youth in this manner signor duca do man sin and repent daily until the opportunity of do either be imperceptibly lose but we will not be more prodigal of the moment than there be need -- be we to hope for better view of the spaniard i have neglect little that can move the mind of a reasonable man and i have in particular lay before he the advantage of conciliate the senate 's esteem therein have you do wisely signora both as respects he interest and you own the senate be a liberal paymaster to he who serve it well and a fearful enemy to those who do harm to the state i hope the matter of the succession draw near a conclusion i wish it be possible to say it do i urge the tribunal in all proper assiduity omit no duty of personal respect nor of private solicitation padua have not a doctor more learn than he who present my right to they wisdom and yet the affair linger like life in the hectic if i have not show myself a worthy son of st mark in this affair with the spaniard it be more from the want of a habit of manage political interest than from any want of zeal the scale of justice must be nicely balance to hang so long without determine to one side or the other you will have need of further assiduity don camillo and of great discretion in dispose the mind of the patrician in you favor it will be well to make you attachment to the state be observe by further service near the ambassador you be know to have he esteem and counsel come from such a quarter will enter deeply into he mind it should also quicken the exertion of so benevolent and generous a young spirit to know that in serve he country he also aid the cause of humanity don camillo do not appear to be strongly impressed with the justice of the latter remark he bow however in courtesy to he companion 's opinion it be pleasant signora to be thus persuade he answer my kinsman of castile be a man to hear reason let it come from what quarter it may though he meet my argument with some allusion to the decline power of the republic i do not see less of deep respect for the influence of a state that have long make itself remarkable by its energy and will venice be no longer what the city of the isle have be signer duca still she be not powerless the wing of we lion be a little clip but he leap be still far and he tooth dangerous if the new-made prince would have he ducal coronet sit easily on he brow he would do well to secure the esteem of he nearest neighbor this be obviously true and little that my influence can do towards effect the object shall be want and now may i entreat of you friendship advice as to the manner of further urge my own long-neglected claim you will do well don camillo to remind the senator of you presence by frequent observance of the courtesy due to they rank and yours this do i never neglect as seemly both in my station and my object the judge should not be forget young man for it be wise to remember that justice have ever a ear for solicitation none can be more assiduous in the duty nor be it common to see a suppliant so mindful of those whom he troubleth by more substantial proof of respect but chiefly should we be particular to earn the senate 's esteem no act of service to the state be overlook by that body and the smallest good deed find its way into the recess of the two council would i could have communication with those reverend father i think the justice of my claim would speedily work out its own right that be impossible gravely return the senator those August body be secret that they majesty may not be tarnish by communication with vulgar interest they rule like the unseen influence of mind over matter and form as it be the soul of the state whose seat like that of reason remain a problem exceed human penetration i express the desire rather as a wish than with

and in return i commit my affair to the justice of the patrician and you own good friendship signor gradenigo bow he guest through all the room of the long suite but the last where he commit he to the care of the groom of he chamber the youth must be stir to greater industry in this matter by clog the wheel of the law he that would ask favor of st mark must first earn they by show zealous disposition in he behalf such be the reflection of the signor gradenigo as he slowly return towards he closet after a ceremonious leave-taking with he guest in the outer apartment close the door he commence pacing the small apartment with the step and eye of a man who again muse with some anxiety after a minute of profound stillness a door conceal by the hanging of the room be cautiously open and the face of still another visitor appear enter say the senator betray no surprise at the apparition the hour be past and i wait for thee the flow dress the gray and venerable beard the noble outline of feature the quick greedy and suspicious eye with a expression of countenance that be perhaps equally mark by worldly sagacity and feeling often rudely rebuke proclaim a hebrew of the rialto

levity none have die wrongfully and the square be gay as the fragrant vineyard of engedus holy abraham what a place be venice for its pleasure and how the heart of old and young revel in they merriment it be almost sufficient to fix the font in the synagogue to witness so joyous a dispensation in behalf of the people of these island i have not hope for the honor of a interview to-night

mark which accompany private confidence thou hast the signet say the noble stretch out a arm it be here and a goodly stone it be a turquoise of price whence come it -- and why be it send to thee it come signora as i gather more through hint and intimation of the messenger than by he word from a place resemble that which the righteous daniel escape in virtue of he godliness and birth thou meanest the lion 's mouth so say we ancient book signore in reference to the prophet and so would the council 's agent seem to intimate in reference to the ring here be naught but a crest with the equestrian helmet -- come it of any in venice the upright solomon guide the judgment of he servant in a matter of this delicacy the jewel be of rare beauty such as few possess but those who have gold in store for other purpose do but regard the soft lustre in this light noble signora and remark the please color that rise by the change of view ay -- ` tis well -- but who claimeth the bearing it be wonderful to contemplate how great a value may lie conceal in so small a compass i have know sequin of full weight and heavy amount give for bauble less precious wilt thou never forget thy stall and the wayfarer of the rialto i bid thee name he who beareth these symbol as mark of he family and rank noble signora i obey the crest be of the family of monforte the last senator of which die some fifteen year since and he jewel they have pass with other movable of which the state taketh no account into the keep of he kinsman and successor -- if it be the senate 's pleasure that there shall be a successor to that ancient name -- don camillo of st agata the wealthy neapolitan who now urge he rights here in venice be the present owner of this precious stone give I the ring this must be look to -- hast thou more to say nothing signora -- unless to petition if there be to be any condemnation and sale of the jewel that it may first be offer to a ancient servitor of the republic who have much reason to regret that he age have be less prosperous than he youth thou shalt not be forget i hear it say hosea that diver of we young noble frequent thy hebrew shop with intent to borrow gold which lavish in present prodigality be to be bitterly repay at a later day by self-denial and such embarrassment as suit not the heir of noble name take heed of this matter -- for if the displeasure of the council should alight on any of thy race there would be long and serious account to settle hast thou have employment of late with other signet besides this of the neapolitan unless in the vulgar way of we daily occupation none of note illustrious signora regard this continue the signor gradenigo first search in a secret drawer whence he draw a small bit of paper to which a morsel of wax adhered canst thou form any conjecture by the impression concern he who use that seal the jeweller take the paper and hold it towards the light while he glittering eye intently examine the conceit this would surpass the wisdom of the son of david he say after a long and seemingly fruitless examination here be naught but some fanciful device of gallantry such as the light-hearted cavalier of the city be fond of use when they tempt the weaker sex with fair word and seductive vanity it be a heart pierce with the dart of love and the motto of _ ` pensa al cuore trafitto d'amore ' _ naught else as my eye do they duty i should think there be but very little mean by those word signore that as may be thou hast never sell a jewel with that conceit just samuel we dispose of they daily to christian of both sex and all age i know no device of greater frequency whereby i conceive there be much commerce in this light fidelity he who use it do well in conceal he thought beneath so general a dress there will be a reward of a hundred sequin to he who trace the owner hosea be about to return the seal as beyond he knowledge when this remark fall casually from the lip of the signor gradenigo in a moment he eye be fortify with a glass of microscopic power and the paper be again before the lamp i dispose of a cornelian of no great price which bear this conceit to the wife of the emperor 's ambassador but conceive there be no more in the purchase than some waywardness of fancy i take no precaution to note the stone a gentleman in the family of the legate of ravenna also traffic with I for a amethyst of the same design but with he neither do i hold it important to be particular ha here be a private mark that in truth seemeth to be of my own hand dost thou find a clue what be the sign of which thou speakest naught noble senator but a slur in a letter which would not be apt to catch the eye of a over-credulous maiden and thou part with the seal to -- hosea hesitate for he foresee some danger of lose he reward by a too hasty communication of the truth if it be important that the fact be know signora he say i will consult my book in a matter of this gravity the senate should not be mislead thou sayest well the affair be grave and the reward a sufficient pledge that we so esteem it something be say illustrious signora of a hundred sequin but my mind taketh little heed of such particulars when the good of venice be in question a hundred be the sum i promise i part with a signet-ring bear some such design to a female in the service of the nuncio 's first gentleman but this seal can not come of that since a woman of she station -- art sure eagerly interrupt the signor gradenigo hosea look earnestly at he companion and reading in he eye and countenance that the clue be agreeable he answer promptly -- as that i live under the law of mose the bauble have be long on hand without a offer and i abandon it to the use of my money the sequin be thine excellent jew this clear the mystery of every doubt go thou shalt have thy reward and if thou hast any particulars in thy secret register let I be quickly possess of they go to good hosea and be punctual as of wont i tire of these constant exercise of the spirit the hebrew exult in he success now take he leave with a manner in which habitual cupidity and subdue policy completely master every other feeling he disappear by the passage through which he have enter it seem by the manner of the signor gradenigo that the reception for that evening have now end he carefully examine the lock of several secret drawer in he cabinet

the great square of san marco we never know the reason of the senate some say thy time be not yet come while other think thou art too powerful for judgment thou dost equal credit to the justice and the activity of the inquisition but should i go with thee to-night wilt thou be more discreet in speech among thy fellow of the lido and the island when the heart have its load the tongue will strive to lighten it i would do anything to turn the child of my friend from he evil way but forget my own thou art use to deal with the patrician jacopo would there be possibility for one clothe in this

of the state and such a one should gladly listen to justice this be a hard bed jacopo continue the fisherman seat himself at the foot of the column of st theodore but i have sleep on colder and as hard when there be less reason to do it -- a happy night the bravo linger a minute near the old man who fold he arm on he naked breast which be fan by the sea-breeze and disposed of he person to take he rest in the square a practice not unusual among man of he class but when he find that antonio be incline to be alone he move on leave the fisherman to himself the night be now get to be advance and few of the reveller remain in the area of the two square jacopo cast a glance around and note the hour and the situation of the place he proceed to the edge of the quay the public gondolier have leave they boat moor as usual at this spot and a profound stillness reign over the whole bay the water be scarce darken by the air which rather breathe upon than ruffle its surface and no sound of oar be audible amid the forest of picturesque and classical spar which crowd the view between the piazzetta and the giudecca the bravo hesitate cast another wary glance around he settle he mask undo the slight fastening of a boat and presently he be glide away into the center of the basin who cometh demand one who seemingly stand at watch in a felucca anchor a little apart from all other one expect be the answer roderigo the same thou art late say the mariner of calabrium as jacopo step upon the low deck of the bellum sorrentina my people have long be below and i have dream thrice of shipwreck and twice of a heavy sirocco since thou hast be expect thou hast have more time to wrong the custom be the felucca ready for she work as for the custom there be little chance of gain in this greedy city the senator secure all profit to themselves and they friend while we of the bark be tie down to low freight and hard bargain i have send a dozen cask of lachryma christus up the canal since the masquer come abroad and beyond that i have not occasion there be enough leave for thy comfort at need wilt drink i be swear to sobriety be thy vessel ready as wont for the errand be the senate as ready with its money this be the fourth of my voyage in they service and they have only to look into they own secret to know the manner in which the work have be do they be content and thou hast be well reward say it not i have gain more gold by one lucky shipment of fruit from the isle than by all they night-work would those who employ I give a little especial traffic on the entrance of the felucca there might be advantage in the trade there be nothing which st mark visit with a heavier punishment than fraud on he receipt have a care with thy wine or thou wilt lose not only thy bark and thy voyage but thy liberty this be just the ground of my complaint signor roderigo rogue and no rogue be the republic 's motto here they be as close in justice as a father amid he child and there it be better that what be do should be do at midnight i like not the contradiction for just as my hope be a little raise by what i have witness perhaps a little too near they be all blow to the wind by such a frown as san gennero himself might cast upon a sinner remember thou art not in thy wide mediterranean but on a canal of venice this language might be unsafe be it hear by less friendly ear i thank thee for thy care though the sight of yonder old palace be as good a hint to the loose tongue as the sight of a gibbet on the sea-shore to a pirate i meet a ancient fellow in the piazzetta about the time the masquer come in and we have some word on this matter by he tally every second man in venice be well pay for report what the other say and do ` tis a pity with all they seeming love of justice good roderigo that the senate should let diver knave go at large man whose very face cause the stone to redden with anger and shame i do not know that any such be openly see in venice what be secretly do may be favor for a time through difficulty of proof but -- cospetto they tell I the council have a short manner of make a sinner give up he misdeed now here be the miscreant jacopo what aileth thee man the anchor on which thou leanest be not heat nor be it of feather one 's bone may ache from its touch without offence i hope the iron be of elba and be forge in a volcano this jacopo be one that should not go at large in a honest city and yet be he see pacing the square with as much ease as a noble in the broglio i know he not not to know the boldest hand and surest stiletto in venice honest roderigo be to thy praise but he be well marked among we of the port and we never see the man but we begin to think of we sin and of penance forget i marvel much that the inquisitor do not give he to the devil on some public ceremony for the benefit of small offender be he deed so notorious that they might pronounce on he fate without proof go ask that question in the street not a christian lose he life in venice without warning and the number be not few to say nothing of those who die with state fever but man see the work of he sure hand in the blow signor roderigo you canal be convenient grave for sudden death methink there be contradiction in this thou speakest of proof of the hand that give it in the manner of the blow and then thou callest in the aid of the canal to cover the whole deed truly there be some wrong do this jacopo who be haply a man slander i have hear of slander a priest for they be christian bind to keep good name for the church 's honor but to utter a injury against a bravo would a little exceed the tongue of a avocato what mattereth it whether the hand be a shade deeper in color or not when blood be on it thou sayest truly answer the pretended roderigo draw a heavy breath it mattereth little indeed to he condemn whether the sentence cometh of one or of many crime dost know friend roderigo that this very argument have make I less scrupulous concern the freight i be call on to carry in this secret trade of ours thou art fairly in the senate 's business worthy stefano i say to myself and therefore the less reason that thou should ` st be particular in the quality of the merchandise that jacopo have a eye and a scowl that would betray he be he choose to the chair of st peter but doff thy mask signor roderigo that the sea-air may cool thy cheek ` tis time there should no longer be this suspicion between old and try friend my duty to those that send I forbid the liberty else would i gladly stand face to face with thee master stefano well notwithstanding thy caution cunning signora i would hazard ten of the sequin thou art to pay to I that i will go on the morrow into the crowd of san marco and challenge thee openly by name among a thousand thou mayest as well unmask for i tell thee thou art as well know to I as the lateen yard of my felucca the less need to uncover there be certain sign no doubt by which man who meet so often should be know to each other thou hast a goodly countenance signora and the less need to hide it i have note thee among the reveller when thou hast think thyself unseen and i will say of thee this much without wish to gain aught in we bargain one of appearance fair as thine signor roderigo have better be see openly than go thus for ever behind a cloud my answer have be make what the state will can not be overlook but since i see thou knowest I take heed not to betray thy knowledge thou would ` st not be more safe with thy confessor diamine i be not a man to gad about among the water-seller with a secret at the top of my voice but thou didst leer aside when i wink at thee dancing among the masquer on the quay be it not so roderigo there be more cleverness in thee master stefano than i have think though thy readiness with the felucca be no secret there be two thing signor roderigo on which i value myself but always i hope with christian moderation as a mariner of the coast in mistral or sirocco levanter or zephyr few can claim more practice and for know a acquaintance in a carnival i believe the father of evil himself could not be so disguise that eye of mine should not see he foot for anticipate a gale or look behind a mask signor roderigo i know not my own equal among man of small learn these faculty be great gift in one who liveth by the sea and a critical trade here come one gino a gondolier of don camillo monforte and a ancient fellow of mine aboard the felucca attend by a woman in mask he throw off the girl dexterously enough and as he think among stranger but i know she at a glance for the daughter of a wine-seller who have already taste lachryma christus of mine the woman be anger at the trick but make the best of luck we drive a bargain for the few cask which lay beneath the ballast while gino do he master 's business in san marco and what that business be thou didst not learn good stefano how should i master roderigo when the gondolier scarce left time for greet but annina -- annina the same thou knowest annina old tomaso 's daughter for she dance in the very set in which i detect thy countenance i would not speak thus of the girl but that i know thou art not backward to receive liquor that do not visit the custom-house thyself for that fear nothing i have swear to thee that no secret of this nature shall pass my lip but this annina be a girl of quick wit and much boldness between ourselves signor roderigo it be not easy to tell who be in the senate 's pay here in venice or who be not i have sometimes fancy by thy manner of start and the tone of thy voice that thou wert thyself no less than the lieutenant-general of the galley a little disguised and this with thy knowledge of man if faith be always equal where would be its merit thou hast never be hotly chase by a infidel master roderigo or thou would ` st know how the mind of man can change from hope to fear from the big voice to the humble prayer i remember once in the confusion and hurry of baffling wind and whistle shot have always turban before the eye and the bastinado in mind to have beseech st stefano in some such voice as one would use to a dog and to have bully the man with the whine of a young kitten corpo di bacco one have need of experience in these affair signor roderigo to know even he own merit i believe thee but who be this gino of whom thou hast speak and what have he occupation as a gondolier to do with one know in thy youth in calabrium therein lie matter exceed my knowledge he master and i may say my master for i be bear on he estate be the young duca di sant ' agata -- the same that push he fortune with the senate in a claim to the riches and honor of the last monforte that sit in thy council the debate have so long endure that the lad have make himself a gondolier by sheer shove a oar between he master 's palace and those of the noble he move with interest -- at least such be gino 's own history of he education i know the man he wear the color of he he serve be he of quick wit signor roderigo all who come of calabrium can not boast that advantage we be no more than we neighbor and there be exception in all community as in all family gino be ready enough with he oar and as good a youth in he way as need be but as to look into thing beyond they surface why we should not expect the delicacy of a beccafica in a goose nature make man though king make noble gino be a gondolier and of good skill i say nothing of he arm or he leg both of which be well enough in they place but when it come to know man and thing -- poor gino be but a gondolier the lad have a most excellent heart and be never backward to serve a friend i love he but thou would ` st not have I say more than the truth will warrant well keep thy felucca in readiness for we know not the moment it may be need thou hast only to bring thy freight signora to have the bargain fulfil adieu i would recommend to thee to keep apart from all other trade and to see that the revelry of to-morrow do not debauch thy people god speed thee signor roderigo naught shall be want the bravo step into he gondola which glide from the felucca 's side with a facility which show that a arm skilled in its use hold the oar he wave he hand in adieu to stefano and then the boat disappear among the hull that crowd the port for a few minute the padrone of the bellum sorrentina continue to pace she deck snuff the fresh breeze that come in over the lido and then he seek he rest by this time the dark silent gondola which have be float by hundred through the basin be all go the sound of music be hear no longer on the canal and venice at all time noiseless and peculiar seem to sleep the sleep of the dead chapter viii the fisher

populace the bucentaur row out of the channel of the arsenal and come sweep to she station at the quay of st mark these preliminary which occupy some hour be observe the javelin-man and other employ about the person of the head of the republic be see open a avenue through the throng after which the rich strain of a hundred instrument proclaim the approach of the doge we shall not detain the narrative to describe the pomp in which a luxurious and affluent aristocracy that in general hold itself aloof from familiar intercourse with those it rule display its magnificence to the eye of the multitude on a occasion of popular rejoice long line of senator dress in they robe of office and attend by crowd of liveried follower come from under the gallery of the palace and descend by the giant 's stairway into the sombre court thence the whole issue into the piazzetta in order and proceed to they several station on the canopied deck of the well know bark each patrician have he allotted place and before the rear of the cortège have yet quit the quay there be a long and impose row of grave legislator seat in the established order of they precedency the ambassador the high dignitary of the state and the aged man who have be choose to bear the empty honor of sovereignty still remain on the land wait with the quiet of trained docility the moment to embark at this moment a man of a embrowned visage leg bare to the knee and breast open to the breeze rush through the guard and knelt on the stone of the quay at he foot justice -- great prince cry the bold stranger justice and mercy listen to one who have bleed for st mark and who have he scar for he witness justice and mercy be not always companion calmly observe he who wear the horn bonnet motion to he officious attendant to let the intruder stay mighty prince i come for the last who and what art thou a fisherman of the lagune one name antonio who seeketh the liberty of the prop of he year -- a glorious boy that force and the policy of the state have tear from I this should not be violence be not the attribute of justice -- but the youth have offend the law and he suffereth for he crime he be guilty excellent and most serene highness of youth and health and strength with some skill in the craft of the mariner they have take he without warn or consent for the service of the galley and have leave I in my age alone the expression of pity which have take possession of the venerable feature of the prince change instantly to a look of uneasiness and distrust the eye which just before have melt with compassion become cold and set in its meaning and signing to he guard he bow with dignity to the attentive and curious auditor among the foreign agent to proceed bear he away say a officer who take he master 's meaning from the glance the ceremony may not be retard for a prayer so idle antonio offer no resistance but yield to the pressure of those around he he sink back meekly among the crowd disappointment and sorrow give place for a instant to a awe and a admiration of the gorgeous spectacle that be perhaps in some degree inseparable from he condition and habit in a few moment the slight interruption produce by this short scene be forget in the higher interest of the occasion when the ducal party have take they place and a admiral of reputation be in possession of the helm the vast and gorgeous bark with its gilded gallery throng with attendant sweep away from the quay with a grand and stately movement its departure be the signal for a new burst of trumpet and clarion and for fresh acclamation from the people the latter rush to the edge of the water and by the time the bucentaur have reach the middle of the port the stream be black with the gondola that follow in she train in this manner do the gay and shout cortège sweep on some dart ahead of the principal bark and some cling like smaller fish swim around the leviathan as near to she side as the fall of the ponderous oar would allow as each effort of the crew send the galley further from the land the living train seem to extend itself by some secret principle of expansion nor be the chain of its apparent connexion entirely break until the bucentaur have pass the island long famous for its convent of religious arminian here the movement become slower in order to permit the thousand gondola to approach and then the whole move forward in nearly one solid phalanx to the landing of the lido the marriage of the adriatic as the ceremony be quaintly term have be too often describe to need a repetition here we business be rather with incident of a private and personal nature than with description of public event and we shall pass over all that have no immediate connexion with the interest of the tale when the bucentaur become stationary a space around she stern be clear and the doge appear in a rich gallery so construct as to exhibit the action to all in sight he hold a ring glitter with precious stone on high and pronounce the word of betrothal he drop it upon the bosom of he fancied spouse shout arise trumpet blow they blast and each lady wave she handkerchief in felicitation of the happy union in the midst of the fracas -- which be greatly heighten by the roar of cannon on board the cruiser in the channel and from the gun in the arsenal -- a boat glide into the open space beneath the gallery of the bucentaur the movement of the arm which direct the light gondola be dexterous and still strong though the hair of he who hold the oar be thin and white a suppliant eye be cast up at the happy face that adorn the state of the prince and then the look be change intently to the water a small fisherman 's buoy fall from the boat which glide away so soon that amid the animation and uproar of that moment the action be scarce heed by the excited throng the aquatic procession now return towards the city the multitude rend the air with shout at the happy termination of a ceremony to which time and the sanction of the sovereign pontiff have give a species of sanctity that be somewhat increase by superstition it be true that a few among the venetian themselves regard these famous nuptials of the adriatic with indifference and that several of the minister of the northern and more maritime state who be witness on the occasion have scarcely conceal as they cast glance of intelligence and pride among themselves they smile still such be the influence of habit -- for so much do even arrogant assumption when long and perseveringly maintain count among man -- that neither the increase feebleness of the republic nor the known superiority of other power on the very element which this pageant be intend to represent as the peculiar property of st mark could yet cover the lofty pretension with the ridicule it merit time have since teach the world that venice continue this idle deception for age after both reason and modesty should have dictate its discontinuance but at the period of which we write that ambitious crapulous and factitious state be rather begin to feel the symptomatic evidence of its fading circumstance than to be fully conscious of the swift progress of a downward course in this manner do community like individual draw near they dissolution inattentive to the symptom of decay until they be overtake with that fate which finally overwhelm empire and they power in the common lot of man the bucentaur do not return directly to the quay to disburden itself of its grave and dignified load the gaudy galley anchor in the center of the port and opposite to the wide mouth of the great canal officer have be busy throughout the morning in cause all the shipping and heavy boat of which hundred lay in that principal artery of the city to remove from the center of the passage and herald now summon the citizen to witness the regatta with which the public ceremony of the day be to terminate venice from she peculiar formation and the vast number of she waterman have long be celebrate for this species of amusement family be know and celebrate in she tradition for dexterous skill with the oar as they be know in rome for feat of a far less useful and of a more barbarous nature it be usual to select from these race of waterman the most vigorous and skilful and after invoke the aid of patron-saint and arouse they pride and recollection by song that recount the feat of they ancestor to start they for the goal with every incitement that pride and the love of victory could awaken most of these ancient usage be still observe as soon as the bucentaur be in its station some thirty or forty gondolier be bring forth clothe in they gayest habiliment and surround and support by crowd of anxious friend and relative the intended competitor be expect to sustain the long-established reputation of they several name and they be admonish of the disgrace of defeat they be cheer by the man and stimulate by the smile and tear of the other sex the reward be recall to they mind they be fortify by prayer to the saint and then they be dismiss amid the cry and the wish of the multitude to seek they allotted place beneath the stern of the galley of state it have already be mention in these page that the city of venice be divide into two nearly equal part by a channel much broader than that of the ordinary passage of the town this divide artery from its superior size and depth and its greater importance be call the grand canal its course be not unlike that of a undulating line which greatly increase its length as it be much use by the larger boat of the bay -- be in fact a sort of secondary port -- and its width be so considerable it have throughout the whole distance but one bridge the celebrated rialto the regatta be to be hold on this canal which offer the requisite of length and space and which as it be line with most of the palace of the principal senator afford all the facility necessary for view the struggle in pass from one end of this long course to the other the man destine for the race be not permit to make any exertion they eye roam over the gorgeous hanging which as be still wont throughout italy on all day of festa float from every window and on group of female in rich attire brilliant with the peculiar charm of the famed venetian beauty that cluster in the balcony those who be domestic rise and answer to the encouraging signal throw from above as they pass the palace of they master while those who be waterman of the public endeavor to gather hope among the sympathize face of the multitude at length every formality have be duly observe and the competitor assume they place the gondola be much larger than those commonly use and each be man by three waterman in the center direct by a fourth who stand on the little deck in the stern steer while he aid to impel the boat there be light low staff in the bow with flag that bear the distinguish color of several noble family of the republic or which have such other simple device as have be suggest by the fancy of those to whom they belong a few flourish of the oar resemble the preparatory movement which the master of fence make ere he begin to push and parry be give a whirling of the boat like the prance of curb racer succeed and then at the report of a gun the whole dart away as if the gondola be impel by volition the start be follow by a shout which pass swiftly along the canal and a eager agitation of head that go from balcony to balcony till the sympathetic movement be communicate to the grave load under which the bucentaur labor for a few minute the difference in force and skill be not very obvious each gondola glide along the element apparently with that ease with which a light-winged swallow skim the lake and with no visible advantage to any one of the ten then as more art in he who steer or greater power of endurance in those who row or some of the latent property of the boat itself come into service the cluster of little bark which have come off like a closely-united flock of bird take flight together in alarm begin to open till they form a long and vacillate line in the center of the passage the whole train shot beneath the bridge so near each other as to render it still doubtful which be to conquer and the exciting strife come more in view of the principal personage of the city but here those radical quality which insure success in effort of this nature manifest themselves the weaker begin to yield the train to lengthen and hope and fear to increase until those in front present the exhilarating spectacle of success while those behind offer the still more noble sight of man struggle without hope gradually the distance between the boat increase while that between they and the goal grow rapidly less until three of those in advance come in like glance arrow beneath the stern of the bucentaur with scarce a length between they the prize be win the conqueror be reward and the artillery give forth the usual signal of rejoice music answer to the roar of cannon and the peal of bell while sympathy with success that predominant and so often dangerous principle of we nature draw shout even from the disappointed the clamor cease and a herald proclaimed aloud the commencement of a new and different struggle the last and what might be term the national race have be limit by a ancient usage to the know and recognize gondolier of venice the prize have be award by the state and the whole affair have somewhat of a official and political character it be now announce however that a race be to

be allow to each on whom would necessarily fall the whole duty of guide while he impel he little bark any of those who have be engage in the previous trial be admit to this and all desirous of take part in the new struggle be command to come beneath the stern of the bucentaur within a prescribed number of minute that note might be have of they wish as notice of this arrangement have be

selfish thou hearest -- he highness who be the voice of a mighty state say thou mayest remain -- though thou art still advise to withdraw i will then see what virtue be leave in this naked arm return antonio cast a mournful glance and one that be not entirely free from the latent vanity of man at he meager and threadbare attire the limb have its scar but the infidel may have spare enough for the little i ask in whom be thy faith bless st anthony of the miraculous draught take thy place -- ha here cometh one unwilling to be know how now who appear with so false a face call I mask so neat and

security of he own abode such be the high privilege of liberty and such it be to be a citizen of a generous a magnanimous and a free state a thousand bow in approbation of the sentiment and a rumor pass from mouth to mouth that a young noble be about to try he strength in the regatta in compliment to some wayward beauty such be justice exclaim the herald in a loud voice admiration apparently overcome respect in the ardor of the moment happy be he that be bear in venice and envy be the people in whose council wisdom and mercy preside like lovely and benignant sister on whom dost thou rely

multitude the child of the republic be protect by a even hand observe the venerable prince it formeth we just pride and bless st mark forbid that aught resemble vain-glory should be utter but it be truly we boast that we know no difference between we subject of the island or those of the dalmatian coast between padua or candium corfu or st giorgio still it be not permit for any to refuse the

namest one of bless memory i name he who may have pity on I in this living desert the temper of thy soul be best know to thyself but this reverend rank of patrician yonder brilliant show of beauty and that goodly multitude may claim another name -- take thy place while the herald proceed to take the name of three or four more applicant all gondolier in private service a murmur run through the spectator which prove how much they interest and curiosity have be awaken by the reply and appearance of the two last competitor in the meantime the young noble who entertain those who come last begin to move among the throng of boat with the intention of make such manifestation of they gallant desire and personal devotion as suit the custom and opinion of the age the list be now proclaim to be full and the gondola be tow off as before towards the start point leave the place beneath the stern of the bucentaur vacant the scene that follow consequently pass directly before the eye of those grave man who charge themselves with most of the private interest as well as with the public concern of venice there be many unmask and high-born dame whirling about in they boat attend by cavalier in rich attire and here and there appear a pair of dark lustrous eye peep through the silk of a visor that conceal some countenance too youthful for exposure in so gay a scene one gondola in particular be remark for the singular grace and beauty of the form it hold quality which make themselves apparent even through the half-disguise of the simple habiliment she wear the boat the servant and the lady for there be two be alike distinguish for that air of severe but finish simplicity which oftener denote the presence of high quality and true taste than a more lavish expenditure of vulgar ornament a carmelite whose feature be conceal by he cowl testify that they condition be high and lend a dignity to they presence by he reverend and grave protection a hundred gondola approach this party and after as many fruitless effort to penetrate the disguise glide away while whisper and interrogatory pass from one to another to learn the name and station of the youthful beauty at length a gay bark with waterman in gorgeous livery and in whose equipment there be a study display of magnificence come into the little circle that curiosity have draw together the single cavalier who occupy the seat arise for few gondola appear that day with they gloomy-looking and mysterious pavilion and salute the mask female with the ease of one accustomed to all presence but with the reserve of deep respect i have a favorite follower in this race he say gallantly and one in whose skill and force i put great trust until now i have uselessly seek a lady of a beauty and merit so rare as to warrant that i should place he fortune on she smile but i seek no further you be gifted with a keen sight signora that you discover all you seek beneath these mask return one of the two female while they companion the carmelite bow graciously to the compliment which seem little more than be warrant by the usage of such scene there be other means of recognition than the eye and other source of admiration than the sens lady conceal yourselve as you will here do i know that i be near the fairest face the warmest heart and the purest mind of venice this be bold augury signora return she who be evidently the oldest of the two glance a look at she companion as if to note the effect of this gallant speech venice have a name for the beauty of its dame and the sun of italy warm many a generous heart better that such noble gift should be direct to the worship of the creator than of the creature murmur the monk some there be holy father who have admiration for both such i would fain hope be the happy lot of she who be favor with the spiritual counsel of one so virtuous and wise as yourself here i place my fortune let what may follow and here would i gladly place a heavier stake be it permit as the cavalier speak he tender to the silent fair a bouquet of the sweetest and most fragrant flower and among they be those to which poet and custom have ascribe the emblematic quality of constancy and love she to whom this offering of gallantry be make hesitate to accept it it much exceed the reserve impose on one of she station and year to allow of such homage from the other sex though the occasion be generally deem one that admit of more than usual gallantry and she evidently shrink with the sensitiveness of one whose feeling be unpractised from a homage so public receive the flower my love mildly whisper she companion -- the cavalier who offer they simply intend to show the quality of he breed that will be see in the end hastily return don camillo -- for it be he signora adieu we have meet on this water when there be less restraint between we he bow and sign to he gondolier be quickly lose in the crowd of boat ere the bark however be separate the mask of the silent fair be slightly move as if she seek relief from the air and the neapolitan be reward for he gallantry by a momentary glance at the glowing countenance of violetta thy guardian have a displeased eye hurriedly observe donna florinda i wonder that we should be know i should more wonder that we be not i could recall the noble neapolitan cavalier amid a million thou dost not remember all that i owe to he donna florinda do not answer but in secret she offer up a fervent prayer that the obligation might be bless to the future happiness of she who have receive it there be a furtive and uneasy glance between she and the carmelite but as neither speak a long and thoughtful silence succeed the rencontre from this muse the party in common with all the gay and laughing multitude by which they be surround be remind of the business on which they be assemble by the signal-gun the agitation on the great canal nearest the scene of strife and a clear blast of the trumpet but in order that the narrative may proceed regularly it be fit that we should return a little in the order of time chapter ix here art thou in appointment fresh and fair anticipate time with start courage shakspeare it have be see that the gondola which be to contend in the race have be tow towards the place of start in order that the man might enter on the struggle with undiminished vigor in this precaution even the humble and half-clad fisherman have not be neglect but he boat like the other be attach to the larger barge to which this duty have be assign still as he pass along the canal before the crowded balcony and groan vessel which line its side there arise that scornful and deride laugh which seem ever to grow more strong and bold as misfortune weigh most heavily on its subject the old man be not unconscious of the remark of which he be the subject and as it be rare indeed that we sensibility do not survive we better fortune even he be so far conscious of a fall as not to be callous to contempt thus openly express he look wistfully on every side of he and seem to seek in every eye he encounter some portion of the sympathy which he meek and humble feeling still crave but even the man of he caste and profession throw jibe upon he ear and though of all the competitor perhaps the one whose motive most hallowed he ambition he be hold to be the only proper subject of mirth for the solution of this revolting trait of human character we be not to look to venice and she institution since it be know that none be so arrogant on occasion as the ridden and that the abject and insolent spirit be usually tenant of the same bosom the movement of the boat bring those of the mask waterman and the subject of those taunt side by side thou art not the favorite in this strife observe the former when a fresh burst of jibe be shower on the head of he unresisting associate thou hast not be sufficiently heedful of thy attire for this be a town of luxury and he who would meet applause must appear on the canal in the guise of one less bear upon by fortune i know they i know they return the fisherman they be lead away by they pride and they think ill of one who can not share in they vanity but friend unknown i have bring with I a face which old though it be and wrinkled and worn by the weather like the stone of the sea-shore be uncover to the eye and without shame there may be reason which thou knowest not why i wear a mask but if my face be hide the limb be bare and thou seest there be no lack of sinew to make good that which i have undertake thou should ` st have think better of the matter ere thou puttest thyself in the way of so much mortification defeat will not cause the people to treat thee more tenderly if my sinew be old and stiffen signor mask they be long use to toil as to shame if it be a shame to be below the rest of mankind in fortune it will not now come for the first time a heavy sorrow have befall I and this race may lighten the burden of grief i shall not pretend that i hear this laughter and all these scornful speech as one listen to the evening breeze on the lagune -- for a man be still a man though he live with the humblest and eat of the coarsest but let it pass sant ' antonio will give I heart to bear it thou hast a stout mind fisherman and i would gladly pray my patron to grant thee a stronger arm but that i have much need of this victory myself wilt thou be content with the second prize if by any manner of skill i might aid thy effort for i suppose the metal of the third be as little to thy taste as it be to my own nay i count not on gold or silver can the honor of such a struggle awaken the pride of one like thee the old man look earnestly at he companion but he shake he head without answer fresh merriment at he expense cause he to bend he face towards the scoffer and he perceive they be just then pass a numerous group of he fellow of the lagune who seem to feel that he unjustifiable ambition reflect in some degree on the honor of they whole body how now old antonio shout the boldest of the band be it not enough that thou hast win the honor of the net but thou would ` st have a golden oar at thy neck we shall yet see he of the senate cry a second he standeth in need of the horn bonnet for he naked head continue a third we shall see the brave admiral antonio sailing in the bucentaur with the noble of the land they sally be succeed by coarse laughter even the fair in the balcony be not uninfluenced by these constant jibe and the apparent discrepancy between the condition and the means of so unusual a pretender to the honor of the regatta the purpose of the old man waver but he seem goad by some inward incentive that still enable he to maintain he ground he companion closely watch the vary expression of a countenance that be far too little trained in deception to conceal the feeling within and as they approach the place of start he again speak thou mayest yet withdraw he say why should one of thy year make the little time he have to stay bitter by bear the ridicule of he associate for the rest of he life st anthony do a greater wonder when he cause the fish to come up on the water to hear he preach and i will not show a cowardly heart at a moment when there be most need of resolution the mask waterman cross himself devoutly and relinquish all further design to persuade the other to abandon the fruitless contest he give all he thought to he own interest in the come struggle the narrowness of most of the canal of venice with the innumerable angle and the constant passing have give rise to a fashion of construction and of rowing that be so peculiar to that city and its immediate dependency as to require some explanation the reader have doubtless already understand that a gondola be a long narrow and light boat adapt to the use of the place and distinct from the wherry of all other town the distance between the dwelling on most of the canal be so small that the width of the latter do not admit of the use of oar on both side at the same time the necessity of constantly turn aside to give room for other and the frequency of the bridge and the corner have suggest the expediency of place the face of the waterman in the direction in which the boat be steer and of course of keep he on he foot as every gondola when fully equip have its pavilion in the center the height of the latter render it necessary to place he who steer on such a elevation as will enable he to overlook it from these several cause a one-oared boat in venice be propel by a gondolier who stand on a little angular deck in its stern form like the low roof of a house and the stroke of the oar be give by a push instead of a pull as be common elsewhere this habit of rowing erect however which be usually do by a forward instead of a backward movement of the body be not unfrequent in all the port of the mediterranean though in no other be there a boat which resemble the gondola in all its property or use the upright position of the gondolier require that the pivot on which the oar rest should have a corresponding elevation and there be consequently a species of bumkin raise from the side of the boat to the desire height and which be form of a crooked and very irregular knee of wood have two or three row-lock one above the other to suit the stature of different individual or to give a broader or a narrower sweep of the blade as the movement shall require as there be frequent occasion to cast the oar from one of these row-lock to the other and not unfrequently to change its side it rest in a very open bed and the instrument be keep in its place by great dexterity alone and by a perfect knowledge of the means of accommodate the force and the rapidity of the effort to the forward movement of the boat and the resistance of the water all these difficulty unite render skill in a gondolier one of the most delicate branch of a waterman 's art as it be clear that muscular strength alone though of great aid can avail but little in such a practice the great canal of venice follow its winding be more than a league in length the distance in the present race be reduce nearly half by cause the boat to start from the rialto at this point then the gondola be all assemble attend by those who be to place they as the whole of the population which before have be extend along the entire course of the water be now crowd between the bridge and the bucentaur the long and graceful avenue resemble a vista of human head it be a impose sight to look along that bright and live lane and the heart of each competitor beat high as hope or pride or apprehension become the feeling of the moment gino of calabrium cry the marshal who place the gondola thy station be on the right take it and st januarius speed thee the servitor of don camillo assume he oar and the boat glide gracefully into its berth thou comest next enrico of fusina call stoutly on thy paduan patron and husband thy strength for none of the main have ever yet bear away a prize in venice he then summon in succession those whose name have not be mention and place they side by side in the center of the canal here be place for thee signora continue the officer incline he head to the unknown gondolier for he have imbibe the general impression that the face of some young patrician be conceal beneath the mask to humor the fancy of some capricious fair -- chance have give thee the extreme left thou hast forget to call the fisherman observe the masker as he drive he own gondola into its station do the hoary fool persist in expose he vanity and he rag to the best of venice i can take place in the rear meekly observe antonio there may be those in the line it doth not become one like I to crowd and a few stroke of the oar more or less can differ but little in so long a strife thou hadst better push modesty to discretion and remain if it be you pleasure signora i would rather see what st anthony may do for a old fisherman who have pray to he night and morning these sixty year it be thy right and as thou seemest content with it keep the place thou hast in the rear it be only occupy it a little earlier than thou would ` st otherwise now recall the rule of the game hardy gondolier and make you last appeal to you patron there be to be no cross or other foul expedient naught except ready oar and nimble wrist he who vary needlessly from he line until he leadeth shall be recall by name and whoever be guilty of any act to spoil the sport or otherwise to offend the patrician shall be both check and punish be ready for the signal the assistant who be in a strongly man boat fall back a little while runner similarly equip go ahead to order the curious from the water these preparation be scarcely make when a signal float on the nearest dome it be repeat on the campanile and a gun be fire at the arsenal a deep but suppress murmur arise in the throng which be as quickly succeed by suspense each gondolier have suffer the bow of he boat to incline slightly towards the left shore of the canal as the jockey be see at the starting-post to turn he courser aside in order to repress its ardor or divert its attention but the first long and broad sweep of the oar bring they all in a line again and away they glide in a body for the first few minute there be no difference in speed nor any sign by which the instruct might detect the probable evidence of defeat or success the whole ten which form the front line skim the water with a equal velocity beak to beak as if some secret attraction hold each in its place while the humble though equally light bark of the fisherman steadily keep its position in the rear the boat be soon hold in command the oar get they justest poise and widest sweep and the wrist of the man accustom to they play the line begin to waver it undulate the glittering prow of one protrude beyond the other and then it change its form enrico of fusina shot ahead and privileged by success he insensibly sheer more into the center of the canal avoid by the change the eddy and the other obstruction of the shore this maneuver which in the language of the course would have be call take the track have the additional advantage of throw upon those who follow some trifling impediment from the back-water the sturdy and practice bartolomeo of the lido as he companion usually call he come next occupy the space on he leader 's quarter where he suffer least from the reaction cause by the stroke of he oar the gondolier of don camillo also soon shoot out of the crowd and be see ply he arm vigorously still farther to the right and a little in the rear of bartolomeo then come in the center of the canal and near as might be in the rear of the triumphant waterman of the main a dense body with little order and vary position compelling each other to give way and otherwise increase the difficulty of they struggle more to the left and so near to the palace as barely to allow room for the sweep of he oar be the mask competitor whose progress seem retard by some unseen cause for he gradually fall behind all the other until several boat ' length of open water lay between he and even the group of he nameless opponent still he ply he arm steadily and with sufficient skill as the interest of mystery have be excite in he favor a rumor pass up the canal that the young cavalier have be little favor by fortune in the choice of a boat other who reflect more deeply on cause whisper of the folly of one of he habit take the risk of mortification by a competition with man whose daily labor have harden they sinew and whose practice enable they to judge closely of every chance of the race but when the eye of the multitude turn from the cluster of pass boat to the solitary barge of the fisherman who come singly on in the rear admiration be again turn to derision antonio have cast aside the cap he wear of wont and the few straggle hair that be leave stream about he hollow temple leave the whole of he swarthy feature expose to view more than once as the gondola come on he eye turn aside reproachfully as if he keenly feel the sting of so many unlicensed tongue apply to feeling which though blunt by he habit and condition be far from extinguish laugh arise above laugh however and taunt succeed taunt more bitterly as the boat come among the gorgeous palace which line the canal nearer to the goal it be not that the owner of these lordly pile indulge in the unfeeling triumph but they dependant constantly subject themselves to the degrading influence of a superior presence let loose the long-pent torrent of they arrogance on the head of the first unresisting subject which offer antonio bear all these jibe manfully if not in tranquillity and always without retort until he again approach the spot occupy by he companion of the lagune here he eye sink under the reproach and he oar falter the taunt and denunciation increase as he lose ground and there be a moment when the rebuke and humble spirit of the old man seem about to relinquish the contest but dash a hand across he brow as if to clear a sight which have become dim and confuse he continue to ply the oar and happily he be soon past the point most try to he resolution from this moment the cry against the fisherman diminish and as the bucentaur though still distant be now in sight interest in the issue of the race absorb all other feeling enrico still keep the lead but the judge of the gondolier 's skill begin to detect sign of exhaustion in he falter stroke the waterman of the lido press he hard and the calabrian be draw more into a line with they both at this moment too the mask competitor exhibit a force and skill that none have expect to see in one of he suppose rank he body be throw more upon the effort of the oar and as he leg be stretch behind to aid the stroke it discover a volume of muscle and a excellence of proportion that excite murmur of applause the consequence be soon apparent he gondola glide past the crowd in the center of the canal and by a change that be nearly insensible he become the fourth in the race the shout which reward he success have scarcely part from the multitude ere they admiration be call to a new and a entirely unexpected aspect in the struggle leave to he own exertion and less annoy by that derision and contempt which often defeat even more generous effort antonio have draw nearer to the crowd of nameless competitor though undistinguished in this narrative there be see in that group of gondolier face well know on the canal of venice as belong to waterman in whose dexterity and force the city take pride either favor by he isolate position or avail himself of the embarrassment these man give to each other the despise fisherman be see a little on they leave coin up abreast with a stroke and velocity that promise further success the expectation be quickly realize he pass they all amid a dead and wonder silence and take he station as fifth in the struggle from this moment all interest in those who form the vulgar mass be lose every eye be turn towards the front where the strife increase at each stroke of the oar and where the issue begin to assume a new and doubtful character the exertion of the waterman of fusina be seemingly redoubled though he boat go no faster the gondola of bartolomeo shot past he it be follow by those of gino and the mask gondolier while not a cry betray the breathless interest of the multitude but when the boat of antonio also sweep ahead there arise such a hum of voice as escape a throng when a sudden and violent change of feeling be produce in they wayward sentiment enrico be frantic with the disgrace he urge every power of he frame to avert the dishonor with the desperate energy of a italian and then he cast himself into the bottom of the gondola tear he hair and weep in agony he example be follow by those in the rear though with more govern feeling for they shoot aside among the boat which line the canal and be lose to view from this open and unexpected abandonment of the struggle the spectator get the surest evidence of its desperate character but as a man have little sympathy for the unfortunate when he feeling be excite by competition the defeat be quickly forget the name of bartolomeo be bear high upon the wind by a thousand voice and he fellow of the piazzetta and the lido call upon he aloud to die for the honor of they craft well do the sturdy gondolier answer to they wish for palace after palace be leave behind and no further change be make in the relative position of the boat but like he predecessor the leader redouble he effort with a diminished effect and venice have the mortification of see a stranger lead one of the most brilliant of she regatta bartolomeo no sooner lose place than gino the masker and the despise antonio in turn shoot by leave he who have so lately be first in the race the last he do not however relinquish the strife but continue to struggle with the energy of one who merit a better fortune when this unexpected and entirely new character be give to the contest there still remain a broad sheet of water between the advance gondola and the goal gino lead and with many favorable symptom of he be able to maintain he advantage he be encourage by the shout of the multitude who now forget he calabrian origin in he success while many of the serving-man of he master cheer he on by name all would not do the mask waterman for the first time throw the grandeur of he skill and force into the oar the ashen instrument bent to the power of a arm whose strength appear to increase at will and the movement of he body become rapid as the leap of the greyhound the pliant gondola obey and amid a shout which pass from the piazzetta to the rialto it glide ahead if success give force and increase the physical and moral energy there be a fearful and certain reaction in defeat the follower of don camillo be no exception to the general law and when the mask competitor pass he the boat of antonio follow as if it be impel by the same stroke the distance between the two lead gondola even now seem to lessen and there be a moment of breathless interest when all there expect to see the fisherman in despite of he year and boat shooting past he rival but expectation be deceive he of the mask notwithstanding he previous effort seem to sport with the toil so ready be the sweep of he oar so sure its stroke and so vigorous the arm by which it be impel nor be antonio a antagonist to despise if there be less of the grace of a practice gondolier of the canal in he attitude than in those of he companion there be no relaxation in the

force into he gondola with very unequivocal sign of disgrace this unwonted interruption of the ceremony cloud many a brow for the sensibility of a venetian noble be quick indeed to reprehend the immorality of political discontent though the conventional dignity of the class suppress all other ill-timed exhibition of dissatisfaction let the next competitor draw near continue the sovereign with a composure that constant practice in dissimulation render easy the unknown waterman to whose secret favor antonio owe he success approach still conceal by the licensed mask thou art the gainer of the

little and in the end it may cost the republic less than that which be now offer name it i too and on my knee in dutiful homage to the chief of the state beg that the prayer of the old fisherman be hear and that the father and son may be restore to each other for the service will corrupt the tender year of the boy and make the age of he parent miserable this touch on importunity who art thou that comest in this hidden manner to support a petition once refuse highness -- the second victor in the ducal regatta dost trifle in thy answer the protection of a mask in all that do not tend to unsettle the peace of the city be sacred but here seemeth matter to be look into remove thy disguise that we see thee eye to eye i have hear that he who keep civil speech and in naught offend against the law might be see at will disguise in venice without question of he affair or name most true in all that do not offend st mark but here be a concert worthy of inquiry : i command thee unmask the waterman reading in every face around he the necessity of obedience slowly withdraw the means of concealment and discover the pallid countenance and glitter eye of jacopo a involuntary movement of all near leave this dreaded person stand singly confront with the prince of venice in a wide circle of wonder and curious listener i know thee not exclaim the doge with a open amazement that prove he sincerity after regard the other earnestly for a moment thy reason for the disguise should be better than thy reason for refuse the prize the signor gradenigo draw near to the sovereign and whisper in he ear when he have do the latter cast one look in which curiosity and aversion be in singular union at the marked countenance of the bravo and then he silently motion to he to depart the throng draw about the royal person with instinctive readiness close the space in he front we shall look into this at we leisure say the doge let the festivity proceed jacopo bow low and withdraw as he move along the deck of the bucentaur the senator make way as if pestilence be in he path though it be quite apparent by the expression of they face that it be in obedience to a feeling of a mixed character the avoid but still tolerate bravo descend to he gondola and the usual signal be give to the multitude beneath who believe the customary ceremony be end let the gondolier of don camillo monforte stand forth cry a herald obedient to the beck of a superior highness here answer gino trouble and hurry thou art of calabrium highness yes but of long practice on we venetian canal or thy gondola could never have outstrip those of the readiest oarsman thou servest a noble master highness yes and it would seem that the duke of st aga be happy in the possession of a honest and faithful follower highness too happy kneel and receive the reward of thy resolution and skill gino unlike those who have precede he bent a willing knee to the deck and take the prize with a low and humble inclination of the body at this moment the attention of the spectator be draw from the short and simple ceremony by a loud shout which arise from the water at no great distance from the privileged bark of the senate a common movement draw all to the side of the galley and the successful gondolier be quickly forget a hundred boat be move in a body towards the lido while the space they cover on the water present one compact mass of the red cap of fisherman in the midst of this marine picture be see the bare head of antonio bear along in the float multitude without any effort of he own the general impulsion be receive from the vigorous arm of some thirty or forty of they number who tow those in the rear by apply they force to three or four large gondola in advance there be no mistake the object of this singular and characteristic procession the tenant of the lagune with the fickleness with which extreme ignorance act on human passion have suddenly experience a violent revolution in they feeling towards they ancient comrade he who a hour before have be deride as a vain and ridiculous pretender and on whose head bitter imprecation have be so lavishly pour be now laud with cry of triumph the gondolier of the canal be laugh to scorn and the ear of even the haughty noble be not respect as the exult band taunt they pampered menial in short by a process which be common enough with man in all the division and subdivision of society the merit of one be at once intimately and inseparably connect with the glory and exultation of all have the triumph of the fisherman confine itself to this natural and commonplace exhibition it would not have give grave offence to the vigilant and jealous power that watch over the peace of venice but amid the shout of approbation be mingled cry of censure word of grave import be even hear denounce those who refuse to restore to antonio he child and it be whisper on the deck of the bucentaur that fill with the imaginary importance of they pass victory the hardy band of rioter have dare to menace a forcible appeal to obtain what they audaciously term the justice of the case this ebullition of popular feeling be witness by the assemble senate in ominous and brooding silence one unaccustomed to reflection on such a subject or unpractised in the world might have fancy alarm and uneasiness be paint on the grave countenance of the patrician and that the sign of the time be little favorable to the continuance of a ascendency that be dependent more on the force of convention than on the possession of any physical superiority but on the other hand one who be capable of judge between the power of political ascendency strengthen by its combination and order and the mere ebullition of passion however loud and clamorous might readily have see that the latter be not yet display in sufficient energy to break down the barrier which the first have erect the fisherman be permit to go they way unmolested though here and there a gondola be see steal towards the lido bear certain of those secret agent of the police whose duty it be to forewarn the exist power of the presence of danger among the latter be the boat of the wine-seller which depart from the piazzetta contain a stock of he merchandise with annina under the pretence of make he profit out of the present turbulent temper of they ordinary customer in the meantime the sport proceed and the momentary interruption be forget or if remember it be in a manner suit to the secret and fearful power which direct the destiny of that remarkable republic there as another regatta in which man of inferior power contend but we deem it unworthy to detain the narrative by a description though the grave tenant of the bucentaur seem to take a interest in what be pass immediately before they eye they have ear for every shout that be bear on the evening breeze from the distant lido and more than once the doge himself be see to bend he look in that direction in a manner which betray the concern that be uppermost in he mind still the day pass on as usual the conqueror triumph the crowd applaud and the collect senate appear to sympathize with the pleasure of a people over whom they rule with a certainty of power that resemble the fearful and mysterious march of destiny chapter xi which be the merchant here and which the jew shakspeare the evening of such a day in a city with the habit of venice be not likely to be spend in the dulness of retirement the great square of st mark be again fill with its active and motley crowd and the scene already describe in the opening chapter of this work be resume if possible with more apparent devotion to the levity of the hour than on the occasion mention the tumbler and juggler renew they antic the cry of the fruit-seller and other vender of light luxury be again mingle with the tone of the flute and the note of the guitar and harp while the idle and the busy the thoughtless and the design the conspirator and the agent of the police once more meet in privileged security the night have advance beyond its turn when a gondola come glide through the shipping of the port with that easy and swan-like motion which be peculiar to its slow movement and touch the quay with its beak at the point where the canal of st mark form its junction with the bay thou art welcome antonio say one who approach the solitary individual that have direct the gondola when the latter have thrust the iron spike of he painter between the crevice of the stone as gondolier be accustom to secure they barge thou art welcome antonio though late i begin to know the sound of that voice though they come from a mask face say the fisherman friend i owe my success to-day to thy kindness and though it have not have the end for which i have both hope and pray i ought not to thank thee less thou hast thyself be bear hard upon by the world or thou would ` st not have bethought thee of a old and despise man when the shout of triumph be ring in thy ear and when thy own young blood be stir with the feeling of pride and victory nature give thee strong language fisherman i have not pass the hour truly in the game and levity of my year life have be no festa to I -- but no matter the senate be not pleased to hear of lessen the number of the galley ' crew and thou wilt bethink thee of some other reward i have here the chain and golden oar in the hope that it will still be welcome antonio look amaze but yield to a natural curiosity he gaze a moment with a longing at the prize then recoil with a shudder he utter moodily and with the tone of one whose determination be make : i should think the bauble coin of my grandchild 's blood keep it they have trust it to thee for it be thine of right and now that they refuse to hear my prayer it will be useless to all but to he who fairly earn it thou makest no allowance fisherman for difference of year and for sinew that be in they vigor methink that in adjudging such a prize think should be have to these matter and then wouldest thou be find outstrip we all holy st theodore i pass my childhood with the oar in hand and never before have i meet one in venice who have drive my gondola so hard thou touchest the water with the delicacy of a lady finger she harp and yet with the force of the wave rolling on the lido i have see the hour jacopo when even thy young arm would have tire in such a strife between we that be before the birth of my eldest son who die in battle with the ottoman when the dear boy he leave I be but a infant in arm thou never sawest the comely lad good jacopo i be not so happy old man but if he resemble thee well mayest thou mourn he loss body of diana i have little cause to boast of the small advantage youth and strength give I there be a force within that bear I and the boat on but of what use have it be thy kindness and the pain give to a old frame that have be long rack by hardship and poverty be both throw away on the rocky heart of the noble we know not yet antonio the good saint will hear we prayer when we least think they be listen come with I for i be send to seek thee the fisherman regard he new acquaintance with surprise and then turn to bestow a instant of habitual care on he boat he cheerfully profess himself ready to proceed the place where they stand be a little apart from the thoroughfare of the quay and though there be a brilliant moon the circumstance of two man in they garb be there be not likely to attract observation but jacopo do not appear to be satisfy with this security from remark he wait until antonio have leave the gondola and then unfold a cloak which have lie on he arm he throw it without ask permission over the shoulder of the other a cap like that he wear himself be next produce and be place on the gray hair of the fisherman effectually complete he metamorphosis there be no need of a mask he say examine he companion attentively when he task be accomplish none would know thee antonio in this garb and be there need of what thou hast do jacopo i owe thee thanks for a well mean and but for the hardness of heart of the rich and powerful for what would have prove a great kindness still i must tell thee that a mask be never yet put before my face for what reason can there be why one who rise with the sun to go to he toil who trusteth to the favor of the bless st anthony for the little he have should go abroad like a gallant ready to steal the good name of a virgin or a robber at night thou knowest we venetian custom and it may be well to use some caution in the business we be on thou forgettest that thy intention be yet a secret to I i say it again and i say it with truth and gratitude that i owe thee many thanks though the end be defeat and the boy be still a prisoner in the floating-school of wickedness but thou hast a name jacopo that i could wish do not belong to thee i find it hard to believe all that they have this day say on the lido of one who have so much feeling for the weak and wrong the bravo cease to adjust the disguise of he companion and the profound stillness which succeed he remark prove so painful to antonio that he feel like one reprieve from suffocation when he hear the deep respiration that announce the relief of he companion i would not willingly say -- no matter interrupted jacopo in a hollow voice no matter fisherman we will speak of these thing on some other occasion at present follow and be silent as he cease the self-appointed guide of antonio beckon for the latter to come on when he lead the way from the water side the fisherman obey for little do it matter to one poor and heart-stricken as he whither he be conduct jacopo take the first entrance into the court of the doge 's palace he footstep be leisurely and to the pass multitude they appear like any other of the thousand who be abroad to breathe the soft air of the night or to enter into the pleasure of the piazza when within the dimmer and broken light of the court jacopo pause evidently to scan the person of those it contain it be to be presume he see no reason to delay for with a secret sign to he companion to follow he cross the area and mount the well known step down which the head of the faliero have roll and which from the statue on the summit be call the giant 's stair the celebrated mouth of the lion be pass and they be walk swiftly along the open gallery when they encounter a halberdier of the ducal guard who come demand the mercenary throw forward he long and dangerous weapon friend to the state and to st mark none pass at this hour without the word jacopo motion to antonio to stand fast while he draw nearer to the halberdier and whisper the weapon be instantly throw up and the sentinel again pace the long gallery with practice indifference the way be no sooner clear than they proceed antonio not a little amaze at what he have already see eagerly follow he guide for he heart begin to beat high with a exciting but undefined hope he be not so ignorant of human affair as to require to be tell that those who rule would sometimes concede that in secret which policy forbid they to yield openly full therefore of the expectation of be usher into the presence of the doge himself and of have he child restore to he arm the old man step lightly along the gloomy gallery and dart through a entrance at the heel of jacopo he find himself at the foot of another flight of massive step the route now become confuse to the fisherman for quit the more public vomitory of the palace he companion hold he way by a secret door through many dimly light and obscure passage they ascend and descend frequently as often quit or enter room of but ordinary dimension and decoration until the head of antonio be completely turn and he no longer know the general direction of they course at length they stop in a apartment of inferior ornament and of a dusky color which the feeble light render still more gloomy thou art well acquaint with the dwelling of we prince say the fisherman when he companion enable he to speak by check he swift movement the oldest gondolier of venice be not more ready on the canal than thou appearest to be among these gallery and corridor ` tis my business to bring thee hither and what i be to do i endeavor to do well antonio thou art a man that feareth not to stand in the presence of the great as this day have show summon thy courage for a moment of trial be before thee i have speak boldly to the doge except the holy father himself what power be there on earth besides to fear thou mayest have speak fisherman too boldly temper thy language for the great love not word of disrespect be truth unpleasant to they that be as may be they love to hear they own act praise when they act have merit praise but they do not like to hear they condemn even though they know what be say to be just i fear I say the old man look with simplicity at the other there be little difference between the powerful and the weak when the garment be strip from both and the man stand naked to the eye that truth may not be speak here how do they deny that they be christian and mortal and sinner they make a merit of the first antonio -- they forget the second and they never like to be call the last by any but themselves i doubt jacopo after all if i get from they the freedom of the boy speak they fair and say naught to wind they self-esteem or to menace they authority -- they will pardon much if the last in particular be respect but it be that authority which have take away my child can i speak in favor of the power which i know to be unjust thou must feign it or thy suit will fail i will go back to the lagune good jacopo for this tongue of mine have ever move at the bidding of the heart i fear i be too old to say that a son may righteously be tear from the father by violence tell they thou from I that i come thus far in order to do they respect but that see the hopelessness of beseech further i have go to my net and to my prayer to bless st anthony as he cease speak antonio wring the hand of he motionless companion and turn away as if to retire two halberd fall to the level of he breast ere he foot have quit the marble floor and he now see for the first time that arm man cross he passage and that in truth he be a prisoner nature have endow the fisherman with a quick and just perception and long habit have give great steadiness to he nerve when he perceive he real situation instead of enter into useless remonstrance or in any manner betray alarm he again turn to jacopo with a air of patience and resignation it must be that the illustrious signora wish to do I justice he say smooth the remnant of he hair as man of he class prepare themselves for the presence of they superior and it would not be decent in a humble fisherman to refuse they the opportunity it would be better however if there be less force use here in venice in a matter of simple right and wrong but the great love to show they power and the weak must submit we shall see answer jacopo who have manifest no emotion during the abortive attempt of the other to retire a profound stillness succeed the halberdier maintain they rigid attitude within the shadow of the wall look like two insensible statue in the attire and armor of the age while jacopo and he companion occupy the center of the room with scarcely more of the appearance of consciousness and animation it may be well to explain here to the reader some of the peculiar machinery of the state in the country of which we write and which be connect with the scene that be about to follow : for the name of a republic a word which if it mean anything strictly imply the representation and supremacy of the general interest but which have so frequently be prostitute to the protection and monopoly of privileged class may have induce he to believe that there be at least a resemblance between the outline of that government and the more just because more popular institution of he own country in a age when ruler be profane enough to assert and the rule weak enough to allow that the right of a man to govern he fellow be a direct gift from god a departure from the bold and selfish principle though it be only in profession be think sufficient to give a character of freedom and common sense to the polity of a nation this belief be not without some justification since it establish in theory at least the foundation of government on a base sufficiently different from that which suppose all power to be the property of one and that one to be the representative of the faultless and omnipotent ruler of the universe with the first of these principle we have nothing to do except it be to add that there be proposition so inherently false that they only require to be fairly state to produce they own refutation but we subject necessarily draw we into a short digression on the error of the second as they exist in venice it be probable that when the patrician of st mark create a community of political rights in they own body they believe they state have do all that be necessary to merit the high and generous title it assume they have innovate on a generally receive principle and they can not claim the distinction of be either the first or the last who have imagine that to take the incipient step in political improvement be at once to reach the goal of perfection venice have no doctrine of divine right and as she prince be little more than a pageant she boldly lay claim to be call a republic she believe that a representation of the most prominent and brilliant interest in society be the paramount object of government and faithful to the seductive but dangerous error she mistake to the last collective power for social happiness it may be take as a govern principle in all civil relation that the strong will grow stronger and the feeble more weak until the first become unfit to rule or the last unable to endure in this important truth be contain the secret of the downfall of all those state which have crumble beneath the weight of they own abuse it teach the necessity of widen the foundation of society until the base shall have a breadth capable of secure the just representation of every interest without which the social machine be liable to interruption from its own movement and eventually to destruction from its own excess venice though ambitious and tenacious of the name of a republic be in truth a narrow a vulgar and a exceedingly heartless oligarchy to the former title she have no other claim than she denial of the naked principle already mention while she practice be liable to the reproach of the two latter in the unmanly and narrow character of its exclusion in every act of she foreign policy and in every measure of she internal police a aristocracy must ever want the high personal feeling which often temper despotism by the quality of the chief or the generous and human impulse of a popular rule it have the merit of substitute thing for man it be true but unhappily it substitute the thing of a few man for those of the whole it partake and it always have partake though necessarily temper by circumstance and the opinion of different age of the selfishness of all corporation in which the responsibility of the individual while he act be professedly submit to the temporize expedient of a collective interest be lose in the subdivision of number at the period of which we write italy have several of these self-styled commonwealth in not one of which however be there ever a fair and just confide of power to the body of the people though perhaps there be not one that have not be cite sooner or later in proof of the inability of man to govern himself in order to demonstrate the fallacy of a reasoning which be so fond of predict the downfall of we own liberal system support by example draw from transatlantic state of the middle age it be necessary only to recount here a little in detail the form in which power be obtain and exercise in the most important of they all distinction in rank as separated entirely from the will of the nation form the basis of venetian polity authority though divide be not less a birthright than in those government in which it be openly avow to be a dispensation of providence the patrician order have its high and exclusive privilege which be guard and maintain with a most selfish and engrossing spirit he who be not bear to govern have little hope of ever enter into the possession of he natural rights : while he who be by the intervention of chance might wield a power of the most fearful and despotic character at a certain age all of senatorial rank -lrb- for by a specious fallacy nobility do not take its usual appellation -rrb- be admit into the council of the nation the name of the lead family be inscribe in a register which be well entitle the golden book and he who enjoy the envied distinction of have a ancestor thus enrol could with a few exception -lrb- such as that name in the case of don camillo -rrb- present himself in the senate and lay claim to the honor of the horn bonnet neither we limit nor we object will permit a digression of sufficient length to point out the whole of the lead feature of a system so vicious and which be perhaps only render tolerable to those it govern by the extraneous contribution of capture and subsidiary province of which in truth as in all case of metropolitan rule the oppression weigh most grievously the reader will at once see that the very reason why the despotism of the self-styled republic be tolerable to its own citizen be but another cause of its eventual destruction as the senate become too numerous to conduct with sufficient secresy and dispatch the affair of a state that pursue a policy alike tortuous and complicated the most general of its important interest be intrust to a council compose of three hundred of its member in order to avoid the publicity and delay of a body large even as this a second selection be make which be know as the council of ten and to which much of the executive power that aristocratical jealousy withhold from the titular chief of the state be confide to this point the political economy of the venetian republic however faulty have at least some merit for simplicity and frankness the ostensible agent of the administration be know and though all real responsibility to the nation be lose in the superior influence and narrow policy of the patrician the ruler could not entirely escape from the odium that public opinion might attach to they unjust or illegal proceedings but a state whose prosperity be chiefly found on the contribution and support of dependant and whose existence be equally menace by its own false principle and by the growth of other and neighboring power have need of a still more efficient body in the absence of that executive which its own republican pretension deny to venice a political inquisition which come in time to be one of the most fearful engine of police ever know be the consequence a authority as irresponsible as it be absolute be periodically confide to another and still smaller body which meet and exercise its despotic and secret function under the name of the council of three the choice of these temporary ruler be decide by lot and in a manner that prevent the result from be know to any but to they own number and to a few of the most confidential of the more permanent officer of the government thus there exist at all time in the heart of venice a mysterious and despotic power that be wield by man who move in society unknown and apparently surround by all the ordinary charity of life but which in truth be influence by a set of political maxim that be perhaps as ruthless as tyrannic and as selfish as ever be invent by the evil ingenuity of man it be in short a power that could only be intrust without abuse to infallible virtue and infinite intelligence use the term in a sense limit by human means and yet it be here confide to man whose title be found on the double accident of birth and the color of ball and by whom it be wield without even the check of publicity the council of three meet in secret ordinarily issue its decree without communicate with any other body and have they enforce with a fearfulness of mystery and a suddenness of execution that resemble the blow of fate the doge himself be not superior to its authority nor protect from its decision while it have be know that one of the privileged three have be denounce by he companion there be still in existence a long list of the state maxim which this secret tribunal recognize as its rule of conduct and it be not say too much to affirm that they set at defiance every other consideration but expediency -- all the recognize law of god and every principle of justice which be esteem among man the advance of the human intellect support by the means of publicity may temper the exercise of a similar irresponsible power in we own age but in no country have this substitution of a soulless corporation for a elective representation be make in which a system of rule have not be establish that set at naught the law of natural justice and the rights of the citizen any pretension to the contrary by place profession in opposition to practice be only add hypocrisy to usurpation it appear to be a unavoidable general consequence that abuse should follow when power be exercise by a permanent and irresponsible body from whom there be no appeal when this power be secretly exercise the abuse become still more grave it be also worthy of remark that in the nation which submit or have submit to these undue and dangerous influence the pretension to justice and generosity be of the most exaggerated character for while the fearless democrat vent he personal complaint aloud and the voice of the subject of profess despotism be smother entirely necessity itself dictate to the oligarchist the policy of seemliness as one of the condition of he own safety thus venice prided herself on the justice of st mark and few state maintain a greater show or put forth a more lofty claim to the possession of the sacred quality than that whose real maxim of government be veil in a mystery that even the loose morality of the age exact chapter xii a power that if but name in casual converse be it where it might the speaker lower at once he voice he eye and point upward as at god in heaven roger the reader have probably anticipate that antonio be now stand in a antechamber of the secret and stern tribunal describe in the precede chapter in common with all of he class the fisherman have a vague idea of the existence and of the attribute of the council before which he be to appear but he simple apprehension be far from comprehend the extent or the nature of function that equally take cognizance of the most important interest of the republic and of the more trifling concern of a patrician family while conjecture on the probable result of the expect interview be pass through he mind a inner door open and a attendant sign for jacopo to advance the deep and impose silence which instantly succeed the entrance of the summon into the presence of the council of three give time for a slight examination of the apartment and of those it contain the room be not large for that country and climate but rather of a size suit to the closeness of the council that have place within its wall the floor be tessellate with alternate piece of black and white marble the wall be drape in one common and sombre dress of black cloth a single lamp of dark bronze be suspend over a solitary table in its center which like every other article of the scanty furniture have the same melancholy cover as the wall in the angle of the room there be project closet which might have be what they seem or merely passage into the other apartment of the palace all the door be conceal from casual observation by the hanging which give one general and chilling aspect of gloom to the whole scene on the side of the room opposite to that on which antonio stand three man be seat in curule chair but they mask and the drapery which conceal they form prevent all recognition of they person one of this powerful body wear a robe of crimson as the representative that fortune have give to the select council of the doge and the other robe of black be those which have draw the lucky or rather the unlucky ball in the council of ten itself a temporary and chance-created body of the senate there be one or two subordinate near the table but these as well as the still more humble official of the place be hide from all ordinary knowledge by disguise similar to those of the chief jacopo regard the scene like one accustomed to its effect though with evident reverence and awe but the impression on antonio be too manifest to be lose it be probable that the long pause which follow he introduction be intend to produce and to note this effect for keen eye be intently watch he countenance during its continuance thou art call antonio of the lagune demand one of the secretary near the table when a sign have be secretly make from the crimson member of that fearful tribunal to proceed a poor fisherman eccellenza who owe much to bless saint antonio of the miraculous draught and thou hast a son who bear thine own name and who follow the same pursuit it be the duty of a christian to submit to the will of god my boy have be dead twelve year come the day when the republic 's galley chase the infidel from corfu to candium he be slay noble signora with many other of he call in that bloody fight there be a movement of surprise among the clerk who whisper together and appear to examine the papers in they hand with some haste and confusion glance be send back at the judge who sate motionless wrap in the impenetrable mystery of they function a secret sign however soon cause the armed attendant of the place to lead antonio and he companion from the room here be some inadvertency say a stern voice from one of the mask three so soon as the fall of the footstep of those who retire be no longer audible it be not seemly that the inquisition of st mark should show this ignorance it touch merely the family of a obscure fisherman illustrious signora return the tremble dependant and it may be that he art would wish to deceive we in the opening interrogatory thou art in error interrupted another of the three the man be name antonio vecchio and as he sayeth he only child die in the hot affair with the ottoman he of whom there be question be a grandson and still a boy the noble signora be right return the clerk -- in the hurry of affair we have misconceive a fact which the wisdom of the council have be quick to rectify st mark be happy in have among he proudest and oldest name senator who enter thus familiarly into the interest of he meanest child let the man be again introduce resume the judge slightly bend he head to the compliment these accident be unavoidable in the press of affair the necessary order be give and antonio with he companion constantly at he elbow be bring once more into the presence thy son die in the service of the republic antonio demand the secretary signora he do holy marium have pity on he early fate and listen to my prayer so good a child and so brave a man can have no great need of mass for he soul or he death would have be doubly grievous to I since i be too poor to buy they thou hast a grandson i have one noble senator i hope he still live he be not with thee in thy labor on the lagune san teodoro grant that he be he be take signora with many more of tender year into the galley whence may we lady give he a save deliverance if you eccellenza have a opportunity to speak with the general of the galley or with any other who may have authority in such a matter on my knee i pray you to speak in behalf of the child who be a good and pious lad that seldom cast a line into the water without a ave or a prayer to st anthony and who have never give I uneasiness until he fall into the grip of st mark rise -- this be not the affair in which i have to question thee thou hast this day speak of thy prayer to we most illustrious prince the doge i have pray he highness to give the boy liberty and this thou hast do openly and with little deference to the high dignity and sacred character of the chief of the republic i do it like a father and a man if but half what they say of the justice and kindness of the state be true he highness would have hear I as a father and a man a slight movement among the fearful three cause the secretary to pause when he see however that he superior choose to maintain they silence he continue -- this didst thou once in public and among the senator but when repulse as urge a petition both out of place and out of reason thou soughtest other to prefer thy request true illustrious signora thou camest among the gondolier of the regatta in a unseemly garb and place thyself foremost with those who contend for the favor of the senate and its prince i come in the garb which i wear before the virgin and st antonio and if i be foremost in the race it be more owe to the goodness and favor of the man at my side than any virtue which be still leave in these withered sinew and dry bone san marco remember he in he need for the kind wish and soften the heart of the great to hear the prayer of a childless parent there be another slight expression of surprise or curiosity among the inquisitor and once more the secretary suspend he examination thou hearest jacopo say one of the three what answer dost thou make the fisherman signora he speaketh truth and thou hast dare to trifle with the pleasure of the city and to set at naught the wish of the doge if it be a crime illustrious senator to have pity a old man who mourn for he offspring and to have give up my own solitary triumph to he love for the boy i be guilty there be along and silent pause after he reply jacopo have speak with habitual reverence but with the grave composure that appear to enter deeply into the composition of he character the paleness of the cheek be the same and the glowing eye which so singularly light and animated a countenance that possess a hue not unlike that of death scarce vary its gaze while he answer a secret sign cause the secretary to proceed with he duty and thou owest thy success in the regatta antonio to the favor of thy competitor -- he who be now with thee in the presence of the council under san teodoro and st antonio the city 's patron and my own and thy whole desire be to urge again thy reject petition in behalf of the young sailor signora i have no other what be the vanity of a triumph among the gondolier or the bauble of a mimic oar and chain to one of my year and condition thou forgettest that the oar and chain be gold excellent gentleman gold can not heal the wound which misery have leave on a heavy heart give I back the child that my eye may not be close by stranger and that i may speak good counsel into he young ear while there be hope my word may be remembered and i care not for all the metal of the rialto thou mayest see that i utter no vain vaunt by this jewel which i offer to the noble with the reverence due to they greatness and wisdom when the fisherman have do speak he advance with the timid step of a man unaccustomed to move in superior presence and lay upon the dark cloth of the table a ring that sparkle with what at least seem to be very precious stone the astonished secretary raise the jewel and hold it in suspense before the eye of the judge how be this exclaim he of the three who have oftenest interfere in the examination that seemeth the pledge of we nuptials it be no other illustrious senator : with this ring do the doge wed the adriatic in the presence of the ambassador and the people hadst thou aught to do with this also jacopo sternly demand the judge the bravo turn he eye on the jewel with a look of interest but he voice maintain its usual depth and steadiness as he answer -- signora no -- until now i know not the fortune of the fisherman a sign to the secretary cause he to resume he question thou must account and clearly account antonio he say for the manner in which the sacred ring come into thy possession hadst thou any one to aid thee in obtain it signora i have name he at once that we take measure for he security ` twill be useless signora he be far above the power of venice what meanest thou fellow none be superior to the right and the force of the republic that dwell within she limit answer without evasion as thou valuest thy person i should prize that which be of little value signora and be guilty of a great folly as well as of a great sin be i to deceive you to save a body old and worthless as mine from stripe if you excellency be willing to hear you will find that i be no less willing to tell the manner in which i get the ring speak then and trifle not i know not signori whether you be use to hear untruth that you caution I so much not to deal with they but we of the lagune be not afraid to say what we have see and do for most of we business be with the wind and wave which take they order from god himself there be a tradition signor among we fisherman that in time past one of we body bring up from the bay the ring with which the doge be accustom to marry the adriatic a jewel of that value be of little use to one who cast he net daily for bread and oil and he bring it to the doge as become a fisherman into whose hand the saint have throw a prize to which he have no title as it be to prove he honesty this act of we companion be much speak of on the lagune and at the lido and it be say there be a noble painting do by some of we venetian master in the hall of the palace which tell the story as it happen show the prince on he throne and the lucky fisherman with he naked leg render back to he highness that which have be lose i hope there be foundation for this belief signora which greatly flatter we pride and be not without use in keep some among we truer to the right and better favor in the eye of st anthony than might otherwise be the fact be so and the painting excellent signora i hope we vanity have not deceive we concern the picture neither the picture you mention be to be see within the palace corpo di bacco i have have my misgiving on that point for it be not common that the rich and happy should take such note of what the humble and the poor have do be the work from the hand of the great tiziana himself eccellenza it be not one of little name have put he pencil to the canvas they say that tiziano have the art of give to he work the look and richness of flesh and one would think that a just man might find in the honesty of the poor fisherman a color bright enough to have satisfy even he eye but it may be that the senate see danger in thus flattering we of the lagune proceed with the account of thine own fortune with the ring illustrious noble i have often dream of the luck of my fellow of the old time and more than once have i draw the net with a eager hand in my sleep think to find that very jewel entangled in its mesh or embowell by some fish what i have so often fancy have at last happen i be a old man signora and there be few pool or bank between fusina and giorgio that my line of my net have not fathom or cover the spot to which the bucentoro be wont to steer in these ceremony be well know to I and i have a care to cover the bottom round about with all my net in the hope of draw up the ring when he highness cast the jewel i drop a buoy to mark the spot -- signora this be all -- my accomplice be st anthony for do this you have a motive holy mother of god be it not sufficient to get back my boy from the gripe of the galley exclaim antonio with a energy and a simplicity that be often find to be in the same character i think that if the doge and the senate be willing to cause picture to be paint and honor to be give to one poor fisherman for the ring they might be glad to reward another by release a lad who can be of no great service to the republic but who be all to he parent thy petition to he highness thy strife in the regatta and thy search for the ring have the same object to I signore life have but one there be a slight but suppress movement among the council when thy request be refuse by he highness as ill-timed -- ah eccellenza when one have a white head and a fail arm he can not stop to look for the proper moment in such a cause interrupt the fisherman with a gleam of that impetuosity which form the true base of italian character when thy request be deny and thou hadst refuse the reward of the victor thou go among thy fellow and feed they ear with complaint of the injustice of st mark and of the senate 's tyranny signora no i go away sad and heart-broken for i have not think the doge and noble would have refuse a successful gondolier so light a boon and this thou didst not hesitate to proclaim among the fisherman and idler of the lido eccellenza it be not need -- my fellow know my unhappiness and tongue be not want to tell the worst there be a tumult with thee at its head and sedition be utter with much vain-boasting of what the fleet of the lagune could perform against the fleet of the republic there be little difference signora between the two except that the man of the one go in gondola with net and the man of the other be in the galley of the state why should brother seek each other 's blood the movement among the judge be more manifest than ever they whisper together and a paper contain a few line rapidly write in pencil be put into the hand of the examine secretary thou didst address thy fellow and speak openly of thy fancy wrong thou didst comment on the law which require the service of the citizen when the republic be compel to send forth a fleet against its enemy it be not easy to be silent signora when the heart be full and there be a consultation among thee of come to the palace in a body and of ask the discharge of thy grandson from the doge in the name of the rabble of the lido signora there be some generous enough to make the offer but other be of advice it would be well to reflect before they take so bold a measure and thou -- what be thine own counsel on that point eccellenza i be old and though unused to be thus question by illustrious senator i have see enough of the manner in which st mark govern to believe a few unarmed fisherman and gondolier would not be listen to with -- ha do the gondolier become of thy party i should have believe they jealous and displeased with the triumph of one who be not of they body a gondolier be a man and though they have the feeling of human nature on be beat they have also the feeling of human nature when they hear that a father be rob of he son -- signora continue antonio with great earnestness and a singular simplicity there will be great discontent on the canal if the galley sail with the boy aboard they such be thy opinion be the gondolier on the lido numerous when the sport end eccellenza they come over by hundred and i will do the generous fellow the justice to say that they have forget they want of luck in the love of justice diamine these gondolier be not so bad a class as some pretend but they be man like ourselves and can feel for a christian as well as another the secretary pause for he task be do and a deep silence pervade the gloomy apartment after a short pause one of the three resume -- antonio vecchio he say thou hast serve thyself in these say galley to which thou now seemest so averse -- and serve bravely as i learn signora i have do my duty by st mark i play my part against the infidel but it be after my beard be grow and at a age when i have learn to know good from evil there be no duty more cheerfully perform by we all than to defend the island and the lagune against the enemy and all the republic 's dominion -- thou canst make no distinction between any of the rights of the state there be wisdom grant to the great which god have deny the poor and the weak signora to I it do not seem clear that venice a city build on a few island have any more right to carry she rule into crete or candium than the turk have to come here how dost thou dare on the lido to question the claim of the republic to she conquest or do the irreverent fisherman dare thus to speak lightly of she glory eccellenza i know little of rights that come by violence god have give we the lagune but i know not that he have give we more this glory of which you speak may sit lightly on the shoulder of a senator but it weigh heavily on a fisherman 's heart thou speakest bold man of that which thou dost not comprehend it be unfortunate signora that the power to understand have not be give to those who have so much power to suffer a anxious pause succeed this reply thou mayest withdraw antonio say he who apparently preside in the dread council of the three thou wilt not speak of what have happen and thou wilt await the inevitable justice of st mark in full confidence of its execution thanks illustrious senator i will obey you excellency but my heart be full and i would fain say a few word concern the child before i quit this noble company thou mayest speak -- and here thou mayest give free vent to all thy wish or to all thy grief if any thou hast st mark have no greater pleasure than to listen to the wish of he child i believe they have revile the republic in call its chief heartless and sell to ambition say the old man with generous warmth disregard the stern rebuke which gleam in the eye of jacopo a senator be but a man and there be father and child among they as among we of the lagune speak but refrain from seditious or discreditable discourse utter a secretary in a half-whisper proceed i have little now to offer signor i be not use to boast of my service to the state excellent gentleman but there be a time when human modesty must give way to human nature these scar be get in one of the proudest day of st mark and in the foremost of all the galley that fight among the greek island the father of my boy weep over I then as i have since weep over he own son -- yes -- i might be ashamed to own it among man but if the truth must be speak the loss of the boy have draw bitter tear from I in the darkness of night and in the solitude of the lagune i lay many week signori less a man than a corpse and when i get back again to my net and my toil i do not withhold my son from the call of the republic he go in my place to meet the infidel -- a service from which he never come back this be the duty of man who have grow in experience and who be not to be delude into wickedness by the evil company of the galley but this calling of child into the snare of the devil grieve a father and -- i will own the weakness if such it be -- i be not of a courage and pride to send forth my own flesh and blood into the danger and corruption of war and evil society as in day when the stoutness of the heart be like the stoutness of the limb give I back then my boy till he have see my old head lay beneath the sand and until by the aid of bless st anthony and such counsel as a poor man can offer i may give he more steadiness in he love of the right and until i may have so shaped he life that he will not be drive about by every pleasant or treacherous wind that may happen to blow upon he bark signor you be rich and powerful and honor and though you may be place in the way of temptation to do wrong that be suit to you high name and illustrious fortune ye know little of the trial of the poor what be the temptation of the bless st anthony himself to those of the evil company of the galley and now signori though you may be angry to hear it i will say that when a aged man have no other kin on earth or none so near as to feel the glow of the thin blood of the poor than one poor boy st mark would do well to remember that even a fisherman of the lagune can feel as well as the doge on he throne this much i say illustrious senator in sorrow and not in anger for i would get back the child and die in peace with my superior as with my equal thou mayest depart say one of the three not yet signora i have still more to say of the man of the lagune who speak with loud voice concern this drag of boy into the service of the galley we will hear they opinion noble gentleman if i be to utter all they have say word for word i might do some disfavor to you ear man be man though the virgin and the saint listen to he ave and prayer from beneath a jacket of serge and a fisherman 's cap but i know too well my duty to the senate to speak so plainly but signori they say save the bluntness of they language that st mark should have ear for the meanest of he people as well as for the richest noble and that not a hair should fall from the head of a fisherman without its be count as if it be a lock from beneath the horn bonnet and that where god have not make mark of he displeasure man should not do they dare to reason thus i know not if it be reason illustrious signora but it be what they say and eccellenza it be holy truth we be poor workman of the lagune who rise with the day to cast we net and return at night to hard bed and harder fare but with this we might be content do the senate count we as christian and man that god have not give to all the same chance in life i well know for it often happen that i draw a empty net when my comrade be groan with the weight of they draught but this be do to punish my sin or to humble my heart whereas it exceed the power of man to look into the secret of the soul or to foretell the evil of the still innocent child bless st anthony know how many year of suffer this visit to the galley may cause to the child in the end think of these thing i pray you signori and send man of try principle to the war thou mayest retire rejoin the judge i should be sorry that any who cometh of my blood continue the inattentive antonio should be the cause of ill-will between they that rule and they that be bear to obey but nature be stronger even than the law and i should discredit she feeling be i to go without speak as become a father ye have take my child and send he to serve the state at the hazard of body and soul without give opportunity for a parting kiss or a parting blessing -- ye have use my flesh and blood as ye would use the wood of the arsenal and send it forth upon the sea as if it be the insensible metal of the ball ye throw against the infidel ye have shut you ear to my prayer as if they be word utter by the wicked and when i have exhort you on my knee weary my stiffened limb to do ye pleasure render ye the jewel which st anthony give to my net that it might soften you heart and reason with you calmly on the nature of you act you turn from I coldly as if i be unfit to stand forth in defense of the offspring that god have left my age this be not the boast justice of st mark venetian senator but hardness of heart and a wasting of the means of the poor that would ill become the most grasp hebrew of the rialto hast thou aught more to urge antonio ask the judge with the wily design of unmask the fisherman 's entire soul be it not enough signora that i urge my year my poverty my scar and my love for the boy i know ye not but though ye be hide behind the fold of you robe and mask still must ye be man there may be among ye a father or perhaps some one who have a still more sacred charge the child of a dead son to he i speak in vain ye talk of justice when the weight of you power fall on they least able to bear it and though ye may delude yourselve the meanest gondolier of the canal know -- he be stop from utter more by he companion who rudely place a hand on he mouth why hast thou presume to stop the complaint of antonio sternly demand the judge it be not decent illustrious senator to listen to such disrespect in so noble a presence jacopo answer bend reverently as he speak this old fisherman dread signor be warm by love for he offspring and he will utter that which in he cooler moment he will repent st mark fear not the truth if he have more to say let he declare it but the excited antonio begin to reflect the flush which have ascend to he weather-beaten cheek disappear and he naked breast cease to heave he stand like one rebuke more by he discretion than he conscience with a calmer eye and a face that exhibit the composure of he year and the respect of he condition if i have offend great patrician he say more mildly i pray you to forget the zeal of a ignorant old man whose feeling be master of he breeding and who know less how to render the truth agreeable to noble ear than to utter it thou mayest depart the armed attendant advance and obedient to a sign from the secretary they lead antonio and he companion through the door by which they have enter the other official of the place follow and the secret judge be leave by themselves in the chamber of doom chapter xiii oh the day that we have see shelton a pause like that which accompany self-contemplation and perhaps conscious distrust of purpose succeed then the three arise together and begin to lay aside the instrument of they disguise when the mask be remove they expose the grave visage of man in the decline of life athwart which worldly care and worldly passion have draw those deep line which no subsequent ease or resignation can erase during the process of unrobing neither speak for the affair on which they have just be employ cause novel and disagreeable sensation to they all when they be deliver from they superfluous garment and they mask however they draw near the table and each seek that relief for he limb and person which be natural to the long restraint he have undergo there be letter from the french king intercept say one after time have permit they to rally they thought -- it would appear they treat of the new intention of the emperor have they be restore to the ambassador or be the original to go before the senate demand another on that we must take counsel at we leisure i have naught else to communicate except that the order give to intercept the messenger of the holy see have fail of its object of this the secretary advertise I we must look into the negligence of the agent for there be good reason to believe much useful knowledge would have come from that seizure as the attempt be already know and much speak of care must be have to issue order for the arrest of the robber else may the republic fall into disrepute with its friend there be name on we list which might be readily mark for punishment for that quarter of we patrimony be never in want of proscribe to conceal a accident of this nature good heed will be have to this since as you say the affair be weighty the government or the individual that be negligent of reputation can not expect long to retain the respect of its equal the ambition of the house of hapsburgh rob I of my sleep exclaim the other throw aside some papers over which he eye have glance in disgust holy st theodore what a scourge to the race be the desire to augment territory and to extend a unjust rule beyond the bound of reason and nature here have we in venice be in undisputed possession of province

become object of a covetous ambition to we neighbor under a vain pretext of a policy that i fear be strengthen by we increase weakness i sicken signor of my esteem for man as i dive deeper into they temper and desire and often wish myself a dog as i study they propensity in he appetite for power be not the austrian the most rapacious of all the prince of the earth more so think you worthy signora than the castilian you overlook the unsatiated desire of the spanish king to extend he sway in italy hapsburgh or bourbon turk or englishman they all seem actuate by the same fall appetite for dominion and now that venice have no more to hope than to preserve she present advantage the least of all we enjoyment become a subject of covetous envy to we enemy there be passion to weary one of a interference with government and to send he to he cord of penitence and the cloister i never listen to you observation signora without quit the chamber a edify man truly this desire in the stranger to trespass on we privilege and it may be well say privilege which have be gain by we treasure and we blood become more manifest daily should it not be check st mark will be strip in the end of even a landing-place for a gondola on the main the leap of the winged lion be much curtail excellent sir or these thing might not be it be no longer in we power to persuade or to command as of old and we canal begin to be encumber with slimy weed instead of well freighted argosy and swift-sailing felucca the portuguese have do we irretrievable harm for without he african discovery we might yet have

should kindle feeling unbecome a man and a christian how now signor gradenigo thou art thoughtful the third member of the secret council who have not speak since the disappearance of the accuse and who be no other than the reader 's old acquaintance of the name just mention slowly lift he head from a meditative position at this address the examination of the fisherman have recall scene of my boyhood he answer with a touch of nature that seldom find place in that chamber i hear thee say he be thy foster-brother return the other struggle to conceal a gape we drink of the same milk and for the first year of life we spoil at the same game these imaginary kindred often give great uneasiness i be glad you trouble have no other source for i have hear that the young heir of you house have show a prodigal disposition of late and i fear that matter might have come to you knowledge as one of the council that a father might not wish to learn the selfish feature of the signor gradenigo instantly undergo a change he glance curiously and with a strong distrust but in a covert manner at the fall eye of he two companion anxious to penetrate they secret thought ere he venture to expose he own be there aught of complaint against the youth he demand in a voice of hesitation you understand a father 's interest and will not conceal the truth signora you know that the agent of the police be active and little that come to they knowledge fail to reach the ear of the council but at the worst the matter be not of life or death it can only cost the inconsiderate young man a visit to dalmatium or a order to waste the summer at the foot of the alp youth be the season of indiscretion as ye know signor return the father breathing more freely -- and as none become old that have not be young i have little need to awaken you recollection of its weakness i trust my son be incapable of design aught against the republic of that he be not suspect a slight expression of irony cross the feature of the old senator as he speak but he be represent as aim too freely at the person and wealth of you ward and that she who be the especial care of st mark be not to be solicit without the consent of the senate be a usage well know to one of its most ancient and most honorable member such be the law and none come of I shall show it disrespect i have prefer my claim to that connexion openly but with diffidence and i await the decision of the state in respectful confidence he associate bow in courteous acknowledgment of the justice of what he say and of the loyalty of he conduct but it be in the manner of man too long accustom to duplicity to be easily dupe none doubt it worthy signor gradenigo for thy faith to the state be ever quote as a model for the young and as a subject for the approbation of the more experienced hast thou any communication to make on the interest of the young heiress thyself i be pained to say that the deep obligation confer by don camillo monforte seem to have work upon she youthful imagination and i apprehend that in dispose of my ward the state will have to contend with the caprice of a female mind the waywardness of that age will give more trouble than the conduct of far graver matter be the lady attend by suitable companion in she daily life she companion be know to the senate in so grave a interest i would not act without they authority and sanction but the affair have great need of delicacy in its government the circumstance that so much of my ward 's fortune lie in the state of the church render it necessary to await the proper moment for dispose of she rights and of transfer they substance within the limit of the republic before we proceed to any act of decision once assure of she wealth she may be dispose of as seemeth best to the welfare of the state without further delay the lady have a lineage and riches and a excellence of person that might render she of great account in some of these knotty negotiation which so much fetter we movement of late the time have be when a daughter of venice not more fair be woo to the bed of a sovereign signora those day of glory and greatness exist no longer should it be think expedient to overlook the natural claim of my son and to bestow my ward to the advantage of the republic the most that can be expect through she means be a favorable concession in some future treaty or a new prop to some of the many decaying interest of the city in this particular she maybe render of as much or even more use than the oldest and wisest of we body but that she will may be free and the child may have no obstacle to she happiness it will be necessary to make a speedy determination of the claim prefer by don camillo can we do better than to recommend a compromise that he may return without delay to he own calabrium the concern be weighty and it demand deliberation he complain of we tardiness already and not without show of reason it be five year since the claim be first prefer signor gradenigo it be for the vigorous and healthful to display they activity -- the aged and the totter must move with caution be we in venice to betray precipitation in so weighty a concern without see a immediate interest in the judgment we should trifle with a gale of fortune that every sirocco will not blow into the canal we must have term with the lord of sant ' aga or we greatly slight we own advantage i hint of the matter to you excellency as a consideration for you wisdom methink it will be something gain to remove one so dangerous from the recollection and from before the eye of a love-sick maiden be the damsel so amorous she be of italy signora and we sun bestow warm fancy and fervent mind let she to the confessional and she prayer the godly prior of st mark will discipline she imagination till she shall conceit the neapolitan a moor and a infidel just san teodoro forgive I but thou canst remember the time my friend when the penance of the church be

doubt of a meeting that occupy the coterie for a month as it have be a victory of the power signor gradenigo it be a pleasure to call he countryman at that time for i do assure thee a sprightlier or more gallant gentleman do not walk the terrace thou tellest I of what my own eye have be a witness do i not arrive when man 's voice speak of nothing else a beautiful court and a pleasant capital be

never quit thee while a piece of it all remain there be diver means of dispense gold in those northern capital and the task be quickly accomplish they be pleasant country for a few year of youth and idleness it be a pity that they climate be so rude a slight and general shudder express they italian sympathy but the discourse do not the less proceed they might have a better sun and a clearer sky but there be excellent cheer and no want of hospitality observe the signor gradenigo who maintain he full share of the dialogue though we have not find it necessary to separate sentiment that be so common among the different speaker i have see pleasant hour even with the genoese though they town have a cast of reflection and sobriety that be not always suit to the disposition of youth nay stockholm and copenhagen have they pleasure too i do assure thee i pass a season between they you dane be a good joker and a hearty bottle companion in that the englishman surpasseth all if i be to relate they power of live in this manner dear friend ye would discredit I that which i have see often seemeth impossible even to myself ` tis a gloomy abode and one that we of italy little like in common name it not in comparison with holland -- wert ever in holland friend do ever enjoy the fashion of amsterdam and the hague i remember to have hear a young roman urge a friend to pass a winter there for the witty rogue term it the beau-ideal of the land of petticoat the three old italian in whom this sally excite a multitude of absurd recollection and pleasant fancy break out into a general and hearty fit of laughter the sound of they crack merriment echo in that gloomy and solemn room suddenly recall they to the recollection of they duty each listen a instant as if in expectation that some extraordinary consequence be to follow so extraordinary a interruption of the usual silence of the place like a child whose truant propensity be about to draw detection on he offence and then the principal of the council furtively wipe the tear from he eye and resume he gravity signor he say fumble in a bundle of papers we must take up the matter of the fisherman -- but we will first inquire into the circumstance of the signet leave the past night in the lion 's mouth signor gradenigo you be charge with the examination the duty have be execute noble sir and with a success i have not hope to meet with haste at we last meeting prevent a perusal of the paper to which it be attach but it will now be see that the two have a connexion here be a accusation which charge don camillo monforte with a design to bear away beyond the power of the senate the donna violetta my ward in order to possess she person and riches it speaketh of proof in possession of the accuser as if he be a agent intrust by the neapolitan as a pledge of he truth i suppose for there be no mention make of any other use he send the signet of don camillo himself which can not have be obtain without that noble 's confidence be it certain that he own the ring of that i be well assure you know i be especially charge with conduct he personal demand with the senate and frequent interview have give I opportunity to note that he be wont to wear a signet which be now want my jeweller of the rialto have sufficiently identify this as the miss ring thus far it be clear though there be a obscurity in the circumstance that the signet of the accuse should be find with the accusation which be unexplained render the charge vague and uncertain have you any clue to the writing or any means of know whence it come there be a small but nearly imperceptible red spot on the cheek of the signor gradenigo that do not escape the keen distrust of he companion but he conceal he alarm answer distinctly that he have none we must then defer a decision for further proof the justice of st mark have be too much vaunted to endanger its reputation by a hasty decree in a question which so closely touch the interest of a powerful noble of italy don camillo monforte have a name of distinction and counteth too many of note among he kindred to be deal with as we might dispose of a gondolier or the messenger of some foreign state as respects he signore you be undoubtedly right but may we not endanger we heiress by too much tenderness there be many convent in venice signora the monastic life be ill suit to the temper of my ward the signor gradenigo drily observe and i fear to hazard the experiment gold be a key to unlock the strongest cell besides we can not with due observance of propriety place a child of the state in durance signor gradenigo we have have this matter under long and grave consideration and agreeably to we law when one of we number have a palpable interest in the affair we have take counsel of he highness who be of accord with as in sentiment you personal interest in the lady might have warped you usually excellent judgment else be assure we should have summon you to the conference the old senator who thus unexpectedly find himself exclude from consultation on the very matter that of all other make he most value he temporary authority stand abashed and silent reading in he countenance however a desire to know more he associate proceed to communicate all it be they intention he should hear it have be determine to remove the lady to a suitable retirement and for this purpose care have be already have to provide the means thou wilt be temporarily relieve of a most grievous charge which can not but have weigh heavily on thy spirit and in other particulars have lessen thy much-valued usefulness to the republic this unexpected communication be make with marked courtesy of manner but with a emphasis and tone that sufficiently acquaint the signor gradenigo with the nature of the suspicion that beset he he have too long be familiar with the sinuous policy of the council in which at interval he have so often sit not to understand that he would run the risk of a more serious accusation be he to hesitate in acknowledge its justice teach he feature therefore to wear a smile as treacherous as that of he wily companion he answer with seeming gratitude : he highness and you my excellent colleague have take counsel of you good wish and kindness of heart rather than of the duty of a poor subject of st mark to toil on in he service while he have strength and reason for the task he say the management of a capricious female mind be a concern of no light moment and while i thank you for this consideration of my case you will permit I to express my readiness to resume the charge whenever it shall please the state again to confer it of this none be more persuade than we nor be any better satisfied of you ability to discharge the trust faithfully but you enter signora into all we motive and will join we in the opinion that it be equally unbecome the republic and one of its most illustrious citizen to leave a ward of the former in a position that shall subject the latter to unmerited censure believe I we have think less of venice in this matter than of the honor and the interest of the house of gradenigo for should this neapolitan thwart we view you of we all would be most liable to be disapprove of a thousand thanks excellent sir return the depose guardian you have take a load from my mind and restore some of the freshness and elasticity of youth the claim of don camillo now be no longer urgent since it be you pleasure to remove the lady for a season from the city ` twere better to hold it in deeper suspense if it be only to occupy he mind keep up thy communication as of wont and withhold not hope which be a powerful exciter in mind that be not deaden by experience we shall not conceal from one of we number that a negotiation be already near a termination which will relieve the state from the care of the damsel and at some benefit to the republic she estate lie without we limit greatly facilitate the treaty which have only be withhold from you knowledge by the consideration that of late we have rather too much overloaded thee with affair again the signor gradenigo bow submissively and with apparent joy he see that he secret design have be penetrate notwithstanding all he practiced duplicity and specious candor and he submit with that species of desperate resignation which become a habit if not a virtue in man long accustom to be govern despotically when this delicate subject which require the utmost finesse of venetian policy since it involve the interest of one who happen at that moment to be in the dreaded council itself be dispose of the three turn they attention to other matter with that semblance of indifference to personal feeling which practice in tortuous path of state-intrigue enable man to assume since we be so happily of opinion concern the disposition of the donna violetta coolly observe the oldest senator a rare specimen of hackneyed and worldly morality we may look into we list of daily duty -- what say the lion ' mouth to-night a few of the ordinary and unmeaning accusation that spring from personal hatred return another one chargeth he neighbor with oversight in religious duty and with some carelessness of the fast of holy church -- a foolish scandal fit for the ear of a curate be there naught else another complaineth of neglect in a husband the scrawl be in a woman 's hand and beareth on its face the evidence of woman 's resentment sudden to rise and easy to be appease let the neighborhood quiet the household by its sneer -- what next a suitor in the court maketh complaint of the tardiness of the judge this toucheth the reputation of st mark it must be look to hold interrupted the signor gradenigo the tribunal act advisedly -- ` tis in the matter of a hebrew who be think to have secret of importance the affair have need of deliberation i do assure you destroy the charge -- have we more nothing of note the usual number of pleasantry and hobble verse which tend to nothing if we get some useful gleanings by these secret accusation we gain much nonsense i would whip a youngster of ten who could not mould we soft italian into better rhyme than this ` tis the wantonness of security let it pass for all that serveth to amuse suppresseth turbulent thought shall we now see he highness signor you forget the fisherman gravely observe the signor gradenigo you honor sayeth true what a head for business have he nothing that be useful escapeth he ready mind the old senator while he be too experienced to be cajole by such language see the necessity of appear flattered again he bow and protest aloud and frequently against the justice of compliment that he so little merit when this little byplay be over they proceed gravely to consider the matter before they as the decision of the council of three will be make apparent in the course of the narrative we shall not continue to detail the conversation that accompany they deliberation the sit be long so long indeed that when they arise have complete they business the heavy clock of the square toll the hour of midnight the doge will be impatient say one of the two nameless member as they throw on they cloak before leave the chamber i think he highness wear a more fatigued and feeble air to-day than he be wont to exhibit at the festivity of the city he highness be no longer young signora if i remember right he greatly outnumber either of we in year we lady of loretto lend he strength long to wear the ducal bonnet and wisdom to wear it well he have lately send offering to she shrine signora he have he confessor have go in person with the offering as i know of certainty ` tis not a serious gift but a mere remembrance to keep himself in the odor of sanctity i doubt that he reign will not be long there be truly sign of decay in he system he be a worthy prince and we shall lose a father when call to weep for he loss most true signora : but the horn bonnet be not a invulnerable shield against the arrow of death age and infirmity be more potent than we wish thou art moody to-night signor gradenigo thou art not use to be so silent with thy friend i be not the less grateful signora for they favor if i have a loaded countenance i bear a lighten heart one who have a daughter of he own so happily bestow in wedlock as thine may judge of the relief i feel by this disposition of my ward joy affect the exterior frequently like sorrow aye even to tear he two companion look at the speaker with much obvious sympathy in they manners they then leave the chamber of doom together the menial enter and extinguish the light leave all behind they in a obscurity that be no bad type of the gloomy mystery of the place chapter xiv then methought a serenade break silence breathing hope through wall of stone italy notwithstanding the lateness of the hour the melody of music be rife on the water gondola continue to glide along the shadowed canal while the laugh or the song be echo among the arch of the palace the piazza and piazzetta be yet brilliant with light and gay with they multitude of unwearied reveller the habitation of donna violetta be far from the scene of general amusement though so remote the hum of the move throng and the higher strain of the wind-instrument come from time to time to the ear of its inmate mellow and thrilling by distance the position of the moon cast the whole of the narrow passage which flow beneath the window of she private apartment into shadow in a balcony which overhang the water stand the youthful and ardent girl listen with a charmed ear and a tearful eye to one of those soft strain in which venetian voice answer to each other from different point on the canal in the song of the gondolier she constant companion and mentor be near while the ghostly father of they both stand deeper in the room there may be pleasanter town on the main and capital of more revelry say the charm violetta withdraw she person from its lean attitude as the voice cease but in such a night and at this witching hour what city may compare with venice providence have be less partial in the distribution of its earthly favor than be apparent to a vulgar eye return the attentive carmelite if we have we peculiar enjoyment and we moment of divine contemplation other town have advantage of they own genoa and pisa firenze ancona roma palermo and chiefest of all napolus -- napoli father daughter napolus of all the town of sunny italy ` tis the fairest and the most bless in natural gift of every region i have visit during a life of wander and penitence that be the country on which the touch of the creator have be the most god-like thou art imaginative to-night good father anselmo the land must be fair indeed that can thus warm the fancy of a carmelite the rebuke be just i have speak more under the influence of recollection that come from day of idleness and levity than with the chasten spirit of one who should see the hand of the maker in the most simple and least lovely of all he wondrous work you reproach yourself causelessly holy father observe the mild donna florinda raise she eye towards the pale countenance of the monk to admire the beauty of nature be to worship he who give they be at that moment a burst of music rise on the air proceeding from the water beneath the balcony donna violetta start back abashed and as she hold she breath in wonder and haply with that delight which open admiration be apt to excite in a youthful female bosom the color mount to she temple there passeth a band calmly observe the donna florinda no it be a cavalier there be gondolier servitor in he color this be as hardy as it may be gallant return the monk who listen to the air with a evident and grave displeasure there be no longer any doubt but that a serenade be mean though the custom be of much use it be the first time that a similar honor have be pay beneath the window of donna violetta the study privacy of she life she known destiny and the jealousy of the despotic state and perhaps the deep respect which encircle a maiden of she tender year and high condition have until that moment keep the aspire the vain and the interested equally in awe it be for I whisper the tremble the distressed the delighted violetta it be for one of we indeed answer the cautious friend be it for whom it may it be bold rejoin the monk donna violetta shrink from observation behind the drapery of the window but she raise a hand in pleasure as the rich strain roll through the wide apartment what a taste rule the band she half-whisper afraid to trust she voice lest a sound should escape she ear they touch a air of petrarch 's sonata how indiscreet and yet how noble more noble than wise say the donna florinda who enter the balcony and look intently on the water beneath here be musician in the color of a noble in one gondola she continue and a single cavalier in another have he no servitor doth he ply the oar himself truly that decency have not be overlook one in a flowered jacket guide the boat speak then dearest florinda i pray thee would it be seemly indeed i think it speak they fair say that i be the senate 's -- that it be not discreet to urge a daughter of the state thus -- say what thou wilt -- but speak they fair ha it be don camillo monforte i know he by he noble stature and the gallant wave of he hand this temerity will undo he he claim will be refuse -- himself banish be it not near the hour when the gondola of the police pass admonish he to depart good florinda -- and yet can we use this rudeness to a signor of he rank father counsel we you know the hazard of this rash gallantry in the neapolitan -- aid we with thy wisdom for there be not a moment to lose the carmelite have be a attentive and a indulgent observer of the emotion which sensation so novel have awaken in the ardent but unpractised breast of the fair venetian pity sorrow and sympathy be paint on he mortified face as he witness the mastery of feeling over a mind so guileless and a heart so warm but the look be rather that of one who know the danger of the passion than of one who condemn they without thought of they origin or power at the appeal of the governess he turn away and silently quit the room donna florinda leave the balcony and draw near she charge there be no explanation nor any audible or visible means of make they sentiment know to each other violetta throw herself into the arm of she more experienced friend and struggle to conceal she face in she bosom at this moment the music suddenly cease and the plash of oar fall into the water succeed he be go exclaim the young creature who have be the object of the serenade and whose faculty spite of she confusion have lose none of they acuteness the gondola be move away and we have not make even the customary acknowledgment for they civility it be not need -- or rather it might increase a hazard that be already too weighty remember thy high destiny my child and let they depart and yet methink one of my station should not fail in courtesy the compliment may mean no more than any other idle usage and they should not quit we unthanked rest you within i will watch the movement of the boat for it surpasseth female endurance not to note they aspect thanks dearest florinda hasten lest they enter the other canal ere thou seest they the governess be quickly in the balcony active as be she movement she eye be scarcely cast upon the shadow beneath before a hurry question demand what she behold

recede a pace like one prick in conscience and the paleness of he ascetic feature take a deadly hue he lip move as if he would have speak but the sound be smother by a oppression that deny he utterance the gentle florinda see he distress and she endeavor to interpose between the impetuous youth and she charge it may be as you say signor monforte she say -- and that the senate in its fatherly care search a partner worthy of a heiress of a house so illustrious and so endowed as that of tiepolo but in this what be there more than of wont do not the noble of all italy seek they equal in condition and in the gift of fortune in order that they union may be fittingly assorted how know we that the estate of my young friend have not a value in the eye of the duke of st aga as well as

i esteem giacomo gradenigo least this interview must have a end say the monk impose effectually and compelling the lover to rise it would be easier to escape the toil of sin than to elude the agent of the police i tremble lest this visit should be know for we be encircle with the minister of the state and not a palace in venice be more narrowly watch than this be thy presence here detect indiscreet young man thy youth might pine in a prison while thou would ` st be the cause of persecution and unmerited sorrow to this innocent and inexperienced maiden a prison sayest thou father no less daughter

music be now turn on other object signora and you must break you faith or depart alone father be the donna violetta to quit the roof of she father with as little warning as a unfavored dependant nay signor monforte you could not in reason have expect more in this interview than the hope of some future termination to you suit -- some pledge -- and that pledge the eye of violetta turn from she governess to she lover from she lover to the monk and from the latter to the floor be thine camillo a common cry escape the carmelite and the governess thy mercy excellent friend continue the blush but decide violetta if i have encourage don camillo in a manner that thy counsel and maiden modesty would reprove reflect that have he hesitate to cast himself into the giudecca i should have want the power to confer this trifling grace why should i be less generous than my preserver no camillo when the senate condemn I to wed another than thee it pronounce the doom of celibacy i will hide my grief in a convent till i die there be a solemn and fearful interruption to a discourse which be so rapidly become explicit by the sound of the bell that the groom of the chamber a long-tried and confidential domestic have be command to ring before he enter as this injunction have be accompany by another not to appear unless summon or urge by some grave motive the signal cause a sudden pause even at that interesting moment how now exclaim the carmelite to the servant who abruptly enter what mean this disregard of my injunction father the republic be st mark in jeopardy that female and

guilty of this indiscretion without participation of mine he have not presume beyond he encouragement the monk and donna florinda regard each other in mute amazement and haply there be some admixture of feeling in the look that denote the uselessness of caution when the passion be intent to elude the vigilance of those who be merely prompt by prudence the former simply motion for silence while he turn to the domestic of what character be these minister of the state he demand father they be its known officer and wear the badge of they condition and they request be to be admit to the presence of

in adieu holy st anthony watch over my own child lest he come to some such miserable life he add in a audible prayer -- there have be good seed cast on a rock in that youth for a warmer or kinder heart be not in man that one like jacopo should live by strike the assassin 's blow the near approach of the strange gondola now attract the whole attention of the old man it come swiftly towards he impel by six strong oar and he eye turn feverishly in the direction of the fugitive jacopo with a readiness that necessity and long practice render nearly instinctive have take a direction which blended he wake in a line with one of those bright streak that the moon draw on the water and which by dazzling the eye effectually conceal the object within its width when the fisherman see that the bravo have disappear he smile and seem at ease aye let they come here he say it will give jacopo more time i doubt not the poor fellow have strike a blow since quit the palace that the council will not forgive the sight of gold have be too strong and he have offend those who have so long bear with he god forgive I that i have have communion with such a man but when the heart be heavy the pity of even a dog will warm we feeling few care for I now or the friendship of such as he could never have be welcome antonio cease for the gondola of the state come with a rush noise to the side of he own boat where it be suddenly stop by a backward sweep of the oar the water be still in ebullition when a form pass into the gondola of the fisherman the larger boat shot away again to the distance of a few hundred foot and remain at rest antonio witness this movement in silent curiosity but when he see the gondolier of the state lie on they oar he glance he eye again furtively in the direction of jacopo see that all be safe and face he companion with confidence the brightness of the moon enable he to distinguish the dress and aspect of a bare-footed carmelite the latter seem more confound than he companion by the rapidity of the movement and the novelty of he situation notwithstanding he confusion however a evident look of wonder cross he mortified feature when he first behold the humble condition the thin and whitened lock and the general air and bearing of the old man with whom he now find himself who art thou escape he in the impulse of surprise antonio of the lamine a fisherman that owe much to st anthony for favor little deserve and why have one like thee fall beneath the senate 's displeasure i be honest and ready to do justice to other if that offend the great they be man more to be pity than envy the convict be always more disposed to believe themselves unfortunate than guilty the error be fatal and it should be eradicate from the mind lest it lead to death go tell this to the patrician they have need of plain counsel and a warning from the church my son there be pride and anger and a perverse heart in thy reply the sin of the senator -- and as they be man they be not without spot -- can in no manner whiten thine own though a unjust sentence should condemn one to punishment it leave the offence against god in they native deformity man may pity he who have wrongfully undergo the anger of the world but the church will only pronounce pardon on he who confesseth he error with a sincere admission of they magnitude have you come father to shrive a penitent such be my errand i lament the occasion and if what i fear be true still more must i regret that one so aged should have bring he devoted head beneath the arm of justice antonio smile and again he bent he eye along that dazzling streak of light which have swallow up the gondola and the person of the bravo father he say when a long and earnest look be end there can be little harm in speak truth to one of thy holy office they have tell thee there be a criminal here in the lagune who have provoke the anger of st mark thou art right it be not easy to know when st mark be pleased or when he be not continue antonio ply he line with indifference for the very man he now seek have he long tolerate aye even in presence of the doge the senate have its reason which lie beyond the reach of the ignorant but it would have be better for the soul of the poor youth and more seemly for the republic have it turn a discouraging countenance on he deed from the first thou speakest of another thou art not then the criminal they seek i be a sinner like all bear of woman reverend carmelite but my hand have never hold any other weapon than the good sword with which i strike the infidel there be one

have rise instantly reseat himself like one actuate by a strong impulse i think he have already be far beyond pursuit he mutter unconsciously apologize for he apparent haste he be over bold and i fear he will row back to the canal in which case you might meet nearer to the city -- or there may be more gondola of the state out -- in short father thou wilt be more certain to escape hear the confession of a bravo by listen to that of a fisherman who have long want a occasion to acknowledge he sin man who ardently wish the same result require few word to understand each other the carmelite

officer release the person of the monk who pass quickly beneath the canopy and he turn to cast a hasty glance at the feature of the fisherman the rubbing of a rope be audible and the anchor of antonio be lift by a sudden jerk a heavy plashing of the water follow and the two boat shoot away together obedient to a violent effort of the crew the gondola of the state exhibit its usual number of gondolier bend to they toil with its dark and hearse-like canopy but that of the fisherman be empty the sweep of the oar and the plunge of the body of antonio have be blended in a common wash of the surge when the fisherman come to the surface after he fall he be alone in the center of the vast but tranquil sheet of water there might have be a glimmering of hope as he arise from the darkness of the sea to the bright beauty of that moonlit night but the sleep dome be too far for human strength and the gondola be sweeping madly towards the town he turn and swim feebly for hunger and previous exertion have undermine he strength he bent he eye on the dark spot which he have constantly recognize as the boat of the bravo jacopo have not cease to watch the interview with the utmost intentness of he faculty favor by position he could see without be distinctly visible he see the carmelite pronounce the absolution and he witness the approach of the larger boat he hear a plunge heavier than

its wing hither jacopo -- thou steerest wide the beak of the gondola turn and the glaring eye of the bravo catch a glimpse of the fisherman 's head quickly good jacopo -- i fail the murmuring of the water again drown the stifled word the effort of the oar be frenzied and at each stroke the light gondola appear to rise from its element jacopo -- hither -- dear jacopo the mother of god aid thee

it reflect antonio -- burst from the lip of the bravo a frightful silence succeed the call there be neither answer nor human form jacopo compress the handle of he oar with finger of iron and he own breathing cause he to start on every side he bent a frenzied eye and on every side he behold the profound repose of that treacherous element which be so terrible in its wrath like the human heart it seem to sympathize with the tranquil beauty of the midnight view but like the human heart it keep its own fearful secret chapter xvi yet a few day and dream-perturbed night and i shall slumber well --

glance that the mask gondolier have neglect none of the precaution he have prescribe and he inwardly commend they punctuality each wear a short rapier at he girdle and he fancy he could trace beneath the fold of they garment evidence of the presence of the clumsy fire-arm in use at that period these observation be make while the carmelite and violetta enter the boat donna florinda follow and annina be about to imitate she example when she be arrest by the arm of don camillo thy service end here whisper the bridegroom seek another mistress in fault of a better thou mayest devote thyself to

friend he add those among ye who love you mistress shall be remember he would have say more but a rude seizure of he arm cause he to turn hastily away he be firm in the grasp of the two gondolier who have land while he be yet in too much astonishment to struggle annina obedient to a signal dart past he and leap into the boat the oar fall into the water don camillo be repel by a violent shove backwards into the hall the gondolier step lightly into they place and the gondola sweep away from the step beyond the power of he they leave to follow gino -- miscreant -- what mean this treachery the moving of the parting gondola be accompany by no other sound than the usual wash of the water in speechless agony don camillo see the boat glide swifter and swifter at each stroke of the oar along the canal and then whirling round the angle of a palace disappear venice admit not of pursuit like another city for there be no passage along the canal take by the gondola but by water several of the boat use by the family lay within the pile on the great canal at the principal entrance and don camillo be about to rush into one and to seize its oar with he own hand when the usual sound announce the approach of a gondola from the direction of the bridge that have so long serve as a place of concealment to he own domestic it soon issue from the obscurity cast by the shadow of the house and prove to be a large gondola pull like the one which have just disappear by six mask gondolier the resemblance between the equipment of the two be so exact that at first not only the wonder camillo but all the other present fancy the latter by some extraordinary speed have already make the tour of the adjoining palace and be once more approach the private entrance of that of donna violetta gino cry the bewildered bridegroom signora mio answer the faithful domestic draw nearer varlet what meaneth this idle trifling at a moment like this don camillo leap a fearful distance and happily he reach the gondola to pass the man and rush into the canopy need but a moment to perceive that it be empty be the work of a glance villain have you dare to be false cry the confound noble at that instant the clock of the city begin to tell the hour of two and it be only as that appoint signal sound heavy and melancholy on the night-air that the undeceived camillo get a certain glimpse of the truth gino he say repress he voice like one summon a desperate resolution -- be thy fellow true as faithful as you own vassal signora and thou didst not fail to deliver the note to my agent he have it before the ink be dry eccellenza the mercenary villain he tell thee where to find the gondola equip as i see it signora he do and i do the man the justice to say that nothing be want either to speed or comfort aye he even deal in duplicate so tender be he care mutter don camillo between he tooth pull away man you own safety and my happiness now depend on you arm a thousand ducat if you equal my hope -- my just anger if you disappoint they don camillo throw himself on the cushion as he speak in bitterness of heart though he second he word by a gesture which bid the man proceed gino who occupy the stern and manage the direct oar open a small window in the canopy which communicate with the interior and bent to take he master 's direction as the boat spring ahead rise from he stoop posture the practice gondolier give a sweep with he blade which cause the sluggish element of the narrow canal to whirl in eddy and then the gondola glide into the great canal as if it obey a instinct chapter xvii why liest thou so on the green earth ` tis not the hour of slumber : -- why so pale cain notwithstanding he apparent decision the duke of sant ' aga be completely at a loss in what manner to direct he future movement that he have be dupe by one or more of the agent to whom he have be compel to confide he necessary preparation for the flight he have meditate several day be too certain to admit of he deceive himself with the hope that some unaccountable mistake be the cause of he loss he see at once that the senate be master of the person of he bride and he too well know its power and its utter disregard of human obligation when any paramount interest of the state be to be consult to doubt for a instant its willingness to use its advantage in any manner that be most likely to contribute to its own view by the premature death of she uncle donna violetta have become the heiress of vast estate in the dominion of the church and a compliance with that jealous and arbitrary law of venice which command all of its noble to dispose of any foreign possession they might acquire be only suspend on account of she sex and as have already be see with the hope of dispose of she hand in a manner that would prove more profitable to the republic with this object still before they and with the means of accomplish it in they own hand the bridegroom well know that he marriage would not only be deny but he fear the witness of the ceremony would be so disposed of as to give little reason ever to expect embarrassment from they testimony for himself personally he feel less apprehension though he foresee that he have furnish he opponent with a argument that be likely to defer to a indefinite period if it do not entirely defeat he claim to the dispute succession but he have already make up he mind to this result though it be probable that he passion for violetta have not entirely blind he to the fact that she roman signory would be no unequal offset for the loss he believe that he might possibly return to he palace with impunity so far as any personal injury be concern for the great consideration he enjoy in he native land and the high interest he possess at the court of rome be sufficient pledge that no open violence would be do he the chief reason why he claim have be keep in suspense be the wish to profit by he near connexion with the favorite cardinal and though he have never be able entirely to satisfy the ever-increasing demand of the council in this respect he think it probable that the power of the vatican would not be spare to save he from any very imminent personal hazard still he have give the state of venice plausible reason for severity and liberty just at that moment be of so much importance that he dread fall into the hand of the official as one of the greatest misfortune which could momentarily overtake he he so well know the crooked policy of those with whom he have to deal that he believe he might be arrest solely that the government could make a especial merit of he future release under circumstance of so seeming gravity he order to gino therefore have be to pull down the principal passage towards the port before the gondola which spring at each unite effort of its crew like some bound animal enter among the shipping its master have time to recover he self-possession and to form some hasty plan for the future make a signal for the crew to cease rowing he come from beneath the canopy notwithstanding the lateness of the hour boat be ply on the water within the town and the song be still audible on the canal but among the mariner a general stillness prevail such as befitted they toil during the day and they ordinary habit call the first idle gondolier of thy acquaintance hither gino say don camillo with assume calmness

of shipping when gino bent forward and draw the attention of he master to a large gondola which be pull with a lazy oar towards they from the direction of the lido both boat be in a wide avenue in the midst of the vessel the usual track of those who go to sea and there be no object whatever between they by change the course of he own boat don camillo soon find himself within a oar 's length of the

entirely beyond the tier of the shipping it be so late that the moon have begin to fall and its light be cast obliquely on the bay throw the eastern side of the building and the other object into shadow a dozen different vessel be see aid by the land-breeze steering towards the entrance of the port the ray of the moon fall upon the broad surface of those side of they canvas which be nearest to

remain for we to establish she in the castle of sant ' aga where i shall defy venice and its agent gino bow he head in submission though he cast a look behind to make sure that none of those agent whom he master set so openly at defiance be within ear-shot in the meantime the gondola proceed for the dialogue in no manner interrupt the exertion of gino still hold the direction of the lido as the land-breeze freshen the different vessel in sight glide away and by the time don camillo reach the barrier of sand which separate the lagune from the adriatic most of they have glide through the passage and be now shape they course accord to they different destination across the open gulf the young noble have permit he people to pursue the direction originally take in pure indecision he be certain that he bride be in one of the many barque in sight but he possess no clue to lead he towards the right one nor any sufficient means of pursuit be he even master of that important secret when

interest of venice be master of she dearest secret of state for what she wish she will do unless the service cost too dear as for the means -- how can they be want in a household like yours signora i trust none but those deepest in my confidence don camillo there be not a servitor in you palace gino alone except who be not a hireling of the senate or of its agent the very gondolier who row you to you daily pleasure have have they haud cross with the republic 's sequin nay they be not only pay to watch you but to watch each other can this be true have you ever doubt it signora ask jacopo look up like one who admire another 's simplicity i know they to be false -- pretender to a faith that in secret they mock but i have not believe they dare to tamper with the very menial of my person this undermine of the security of family be to destroy society at its core you talk like one who have not be long a bridegroom signora say the bravo with a hollow laugh a year hence you may know what it be to have you own wife turn you secret thought into gold and thou servest they jacopo who do not in some manner suit to he habit we be not master of we fortune don camillo or the duke of sant ' aga would not be turn he influence with a relative to the advantage of the republic what i have do have not be do without bitter penitence and a agony of soul that you own light servitude may have spare you signore poor jacopo if i have live through it all ` tis because one mightier than the state have not desert I but don camillo monforte there be crime which pass beyond the power of man to endure the bravo shudder and he move among the despise grave in silence they have then prove too ruthless even for thee say don camillo who watch the contracting eye and heaving form of he companion in wonder signora they have i have witness this night a proof of they heartlessness and bad faith that have cause I to look forward to my own fate the delusion be over from this hour i serve they no longer the bravo speak with deep feeling and he companion fancy strange as it be come from such a man with a air of wounded integrity don camillo know that there be no condition of life however degrade or lose to the world which have not its own particular opinion of the faith due to its fellow and he have see enough of the sinuous course of the oligarchy of venice to understand that it be quite possible its shameless and irresponsible duplicity might offend the principle of even a assassin less odium be attach to man of that class in italy and at that day than will be easily imagine in a country like this for the radical defect and the vicious administration of the law cause a irritable and sensitive people too often to take into they own hand the right of redress they own wrong custom have lessen the odium of the crime and though society denounce the assassin himself it be scarcely too much to say that he employer be regard with little more disgust than the religious of we time regard the survivor of a private combat still it be not usual for noble like don camillo to hold intercourse beyond that which the required service exact with man of jacopo 's cast but the language and manner of the bravo so strongly attract the curiosity and even the sympathy of he companion that the latter unconsciously sheathe he rapier and draw nearer thy penitence and regret jacopo may lead thee yet nearer to virtue he say than mere abandonment of the senate 's service seek out some godly priest and ease thy soul by confession and prayer the bravo tremble in every limb and he eye turn wistfully to the countenance of the other speak jacopo even i will hear thee if thou would ` st remove the mountain from thy breast thanks noble signora a thousand thanks for this glimpse of sympathy to which i have long be a stranger none know how dear a word of kindness be to one who have be condemn by all as i have be i have pray -- i have crave -- i have weep for some ear to listen to my tale and i think i have find one who would have hear I without scorn when the cold policy of the senate strike he i come here to commune with the hate dead when chance bring we together could i -- the bravo pause and look doubtfully again at he companion say on jacopo i have not dare to trust my secret even to the confessional signora and can i be so bold as to offer they to you truly it be a strange behest signora it be you be noble i be of humble blood you ancestor be senator and doge of venice while mine have be since the fisherman first build they hut in the lagune laborer on the canal and rower of gondola you be powerful and rich and court while i be denounce and in secret i fear condemn in short you be don camillo monforte and i be jacopo frontonus don camillo be touch for the bravo speak without bitterness and in deep sorrow i would thou wert at the confessional poor jacopo he say i be little able to give ease to such a burden signora i have live too long shut out from the good wish of my fellow and i can bear with it no longer the accursed senate may cut I off without warning and then who will stop to look at my grave signora i must speak or die thy case be piteous jacopo thou hast need of ghostly counsel here be no priest signora and i carry a weight past bear the only man who have show interest in I for three long and dreadful year be go but he will return poor jacopo signora he will never return he be with the fish of the lagune by thy hand monster by the justice of the illustrious republic say the bravo with a smother but bitter smile ha they be then awake to the act of thy class thy repentance be the fruit of fear jacopo seem choke he have evidently count on the awaken sympathy of he companion notwithstanding the difference in they situation and to be thus throw off again unmanned he he shudder and every muscle and nerve appear about to yield its power touch by so unequivocal sign of suffer don camillo keep close at he side reluctant to enter more deeply into the feeling of one of he known character and yet unable to desert a fellow-creature in so grievous agony signor duca say the bravo with a pathos in he voice that go to the heart of he auditor leave I if they ask for a proscribed man let they come here in the morning they will find my body near the grave of the heretic speak i will hear thee jacopo look up with doubt express on he feature unburden thyself i will listen though thou recount the assassination of my dearest friend the oppressed bravo gaze at he as if he still distrust he sincerity he face work and he look become still more wistful but as don camillo face the moon and betray the extent of he sympathy the other burst into tear jacopo i will hear thee -- i will hear thee poor jacopo cry don camillo shock at this exhibition of distress in one so stern by nature a wave from the hand of the bravo silence he and jacopo struggle with himself for a moment speak you have save a soul from perdition signora he say smother he emotion if the happy know how much power belong to a single word of kindness -- a glance of feeling when give to the despise they would not look so coldly on the miserable this night must have be my last have you cast I off without pity -- but you will hear my tale signora -- you will not scorn the confession of a bravo i have promise be brief for at this moment i have great care of my own signora i know not the whole of you wrong but they will not be less likely to be redress for this grace jacopo make a effort to command himself when he commence he tale the course of the narrative do not require that we should accompany this extraordinary man though the relation of the secret he impart to don camillo it be enough for we present purpose to say that as he proceed the young calabrian noble draw nearer to he side and listen with grow interest the duke of sant ' agata scarcely breathe while he companion with that energy of language and feeling which mark italian character recount he secret sorrow and the scene in which he have be a actor long before he be do don camillo have forget he own private cause of concern and by the time the tale be finish every shade of disgust have give place to a ungovernable expression of pity in short so eloquent be the speaker and so interesting the fact with which he deal that he seem to play with the sympathy of the listener as the improvisatore of that region be know to lead captive the passion of the admire crowd during the time jacopo be speak he and he wonder auditor have pass the limit of the despise cemetery and as the voice of the former cease they stand on the outer beach of the lido when the low tone of the bravo be no longer audible they be succeed by the sullen wash of the adriatic this surpasseth belief don camillo exclaimed after a long pause which have only be disturb by the rush and retreat of the water signore as holy marium be kind it be true i doubt you not jacopo -- poor jacopo i can not distrust a tale thus tell thou hast indeed be a victim of they hellish duplicity and well mayest thou say the load be past bear what be thy intention i serve they no longer don camillo -- i wait only for the last solemn scene which be now certain and then i quit this city of deceit to seek my fortune in another region they have blast my youth and loaded my name with infamy -- god may yet lighten the load reproach not thyself beyond reason jacopo for the happiest and most fortunate of we all be not above the power of temptation thou knowest that even my name and rank have not altogether protect I from they art i know they capable signora of delude angel they art be only surpass by they means and they pretence of virtue by they indifference to its practice thou sayest true jacopo : the truth be never in greater danger than when whole community lend themselves to the vicious deception of seemliness and without truth there be no virtue this it be to substitute profession for practice -- to use the altar for a worldly purpose -- and to bestow power without any other responsibility than that which be exact by the selfishness of caste jacopo -- poor jacopo thou shalt be my servitor -- i be lord of my own seignory and once rid of this specious republic i charge myself with the care of thy safety and fortune be at peace as respects thy conscience : i have interest near the holy see and thou shalt not want absolution the gratitude of the bravo be more vivid in feeling than in expression he kiss the hand of don camillo but it be with a reservation of self-respect that belong to the character of the man a system like this of venice continue the muse noble leaf none of we master of we own act the wiles of such a combination be stronger than the will it cloak its offence against right in a thousand specious form and it enlist the support of every man under the pretence of a sacrifice for the common good we often fancy ourselves simple dealer in some justifiable state intrigue when in truth we be deep in sin falsehood be the parent of all crime and in no case have it a progeny so numerous as that in which its own birth be derive from the state i fear i may have make sacrifice to this treacherous influence i could wish forget though don camillo soliloquized rather than address he companion it be evident by the train of he thought that the narrative of jacopo have awaken disagreeable reflection on the manner in which he have push he own claim with the senate perhaps he feel the necessity of some apology to one who though so much he inferior in rank be so competent to appreciate he conduct and who have just denounce in the strongest language he own fatal subserviency to the art of that irresponsible and meretricious body jacopo utter a few word of a general nature but such as have a tendency to quiet the uneasiness of he companion after which with a readiness that prove he qualify for the many delicate mission with which he have be charge he ingeniously turn the discourse to the recent abduction of donna violetta with the offer of render he new employer all the service in he power to regain he bride that thou mayest know all thou hast undertake rejoin don camillo listen jacopo and i will conceal nothing from thy shrewdness the duke of sant ' aga now briefly but explicitly lay bare to he companion all he own view and measure with respect to she he love and all those event with which the reader have already become acquaint the bravo give great attention to the minutest part of the detail and more than once as the other proceed he smile to himself like a man who be able to trace the secret means by which this or that intrigue have be effect the whole be just relate when the sound of a footstep announce the return of gino chapter xviii pale she look yet cheerful though methought once if not twice she wipe away a tear that would be come roger the hour pass as if naught have occur within the barrier of the city to disturb they progress on the follow morning man proceed to they several pursuit of business or of pleasure as have be do for age and none stop to question he neighbor of the scene which might have take place during the night some be gay and other sorrow some idle and other occupy here one toil there another sport and venice present as of wont its noiseless suspicious busy mysterious and yet stir throng as it have before do at a thousand similar rising of the sun the menial linger around the water-gate of donna violetta 's palace with distrustful but cautious face scarce whispering among themselves they secret suspicion of the fate of they mistress the residence of the signor gradenigo present its usual gloomy magnificence while the abode of don camillo monforte betray no sign of the heavy disappointment which its master have sustain the bellum sorrentina still lay in the port with a yard on deck while the crew repair its sail in the lazy manner of mariner who work without excitement the lagune be dot with the boat of fisherman and traveller arrive and depart from the city by the well know channel of fusina and mestre here some adventurer from the north quit the canal on he return towards the alp carry with he a please picture of the ceremony he have witness mingle with some crude conjecture of that power which predominate in the suspect state and there a countryman of the main seek he little farm satisfy with the pageant and regatta of the previous day in short all seem as usual and the event we have relate remain a secret with the actor and that mysterious council which have so large a share in they existence as the day advance many a sail be spread for the pillar of hercule or the genial levant and felucca mystic and goletta go and come as the land or sea-breeze prevail still the mariner of calabrium lounge beneath the awning which sheltered he deck or take he siesta on a pile of old sail which be ragged with the force of many a hot sirocco as the sun fall the gondola of the great and idle begin to glide over the water and when the two square be cool by the air of the adriatic the broglio begin to fill with those privileged to pace its vaulted passage among these come the duke of sant ' aga who though a alien to the law of the republic being of so illustrious descent and of claim so equitable be receive among the senator in they moment of ease as a welcome sharer in this vain distinction he enter the broglio at the wonted hour and with he usual composure for he trust to he secret influence at rome and something to the success of he rival for impunity reflection have show don camillo that as he plan be know to the council they would long since have arrest he have such be they intention and it have also lead he to believe that the most efficient manner of avoid the personal consequence of he adventure be to show confidence in he own power to withstand they when he appear therefore lean on the arm of a high officer of the papal embassy and with a eye that speak assurance in himself he be greet as usual by all who know he as be due to he rank and expectation still don camillo walk among the patrician of the republic with novel sensation more than once he think he detect in the wander glance of those with whom he converse sign of they knowledge of he frustrated attempt and more than once when he least suspect such scrutiny he countenance be watch as if the observer seek some evidence of he future intention beyond this none might have discover that a heiress of so much importance have be so near be lose to the state or on the other hand that a bridegroom have be rob of he bride habitual art on the part of the state and resolute but wary intention on the part of the young noble conceal all else from observation in this manner the day pass not a tongue in venice beyond those which whisper in secret make any allusion to the incident of we tale just as the sun be set a gondola sweep slowly up to the water-gate of the ducal palace the gondolier land fasten he boat in the usual manner to the stepping-stone and enter the court he wear a mask for the hour of disguise have come and he attire be so like the ordinary fashion of man of he class as to defeat recognition by its simplicity glance a eye about he he enter the building by a private door the edifice in which the doge of venice dwelt still stand a gloomy monument of the policy of the republic furnish evidence in itself of the specious character of the prince whom it hold it be build around a vast but gloomy court as be usual with nearly all of the principal edifice of europe one of its front form a side of the piazzetta so often mention and another line the quay next the port the architecture of these two exterior face of the palace render the structure remarkable a low portico which form the broglio sustain a row of massive oriental window and above these again lie a pile of masonry slightly relieve by aperture which reverse the ordinary use of the art a third front be nearly conceal by the cathedral of st mark and the fourth be wash by its canal the public prison of the city form the other side of this canal eloquently proclaim the nature of the government by the close approximation of the power of legislation and of punishment the famous bridge of sigh be the material and we might add the metaphorical link between the two the latter edifice stand on the quay also and though less lofty and spacious in point of architectural beauty it be the superior structure though the quaintness and unusual style of the palace be most apt to attract attention the mask gondolier soon reappear beneath the arch of the water-gate and with a hurry step he seek he boat it require but a minute to cross the canal to land on the opposite quay and to enter the public door of the prison it would seem that he have some secret means of satisfy the vigilance of the different keeper for bolt be draw and door unlock with little question wherever he present himself in this manner he quickly pass all the outer barrier of the place and reach a part of the building which have the appearance of be fit for the accommodation of a family judge from the air of all around he those who dwell there take the luxury of they abode but little into the account though neither the furniture nor the room be want in most of the necessaries suit to people of they class and the climate and in that age the gondolier have ascend a private stairway and he be now before a door which have none of those sign of a prison that so freely abound in other part of the building he pause to listen and then tap with singular caution who be without ask a gentle female voice at the same instant that the latch move and fall again as if she within wait to be assure of the character of she visitor before she open the door a friend to thee gelsomina be the answer nay here all be friend to the keeper if word can be believe you must name yourself or go elsewhere for you answer the gondolier remove the mask a little which have alter he voice as well as conceal he face it be i gessina he say use the diminutive of she name the bolt grate and the door be hurriedly open it be wonderful that i do not know thee carlo say the female with eager simplicity but thou takest so many disguise of late and so counterfeitest strange voice that thine own mother might have distrust she ear the gondolier pause to make certain they be alone then lay aside the mask altogether he expose the feature of the bravo thou knowest the need of caution he add and wilt not judge I harshly i say not that carlo -- but thy voice be so familiar that i think it wonderful thou could ` st speak as a stranger hast thou aught for I the gentle girl -- for she be both young and gentle -- hesitate hast thou aught new gelsomina repeat the bravo read she innocent face with he search gaze thou art fortunate in not be sooner in the prison i have just have a visitor thou would ` st not have like to be see carlo thou knowest i have good reason for come mask i might or i might not have dislike thy acquaintance as he should have prove nay now thou judgest wrong return the female hastily -- i have no other here but my cousin annina dost thou think I jealous say the bravo smile in kindness as he take she hand have it be thy cousin pietro or michele or roberto or any other youth of venice i should have no other dread than that of be know but it be only annina -- my cousin annina whom thou hast never see -- and i have no cousin pietro and michele and roberto we be not many carlo annina have a brother but he never come hither indeed it be long since she have find it convenient to quit she trade to come to this dreary place few child of sister see each other so seldom as annina and i thou art a good girl gessina and art always to be find near thy mother hast thou naught in particular for my ear again the soft eye of gelsomina or gessina as she be familiarly call drop to the floor but raise they ere he could note the circumstance she hurriedly continue the discourse i fear annina will return or i would go with thee at once be this cousin of thine still here then ask the bravo with uneasiness thou knowest i would not be see fear not she can not enter without touch that bell for she be above with my poor bed-ridden mother thou can ` st go into the inner room as usual when she come and listen to she idle discourse if thou wilt or -- but we have not time -- for annina come seldom and i know not why but she seem to love a sick room little as she never stay many minute with she aunt thou would ` st have say or i might go on my errand gessina i would carlo but i be certain we should be recall by my impatient cousin i can wait i be patient when with thee dearest gessina hist -- ` tis my cousin 's step thou canst go in while she speak a small bell ring and the bravo withdraw into the inner room like one accustomed to that place of retreat he leave the door ajar -- for the darkness of the closet sufficiently conceal he person in the meantime gelsomina open the outer door for the admission of she visitor at the first sound of the latter 's voice jacopo who have little suspect the fact from a name which be so common recognize the artful daughter of the wine-seller thou art at thy ease here gelsomina cry the latter enter and throw herself into a seat like one fatigued thy mother be better and thou art truly mistress of the house i would i be not annina for i be young to have this trust with this affliction it be not so insupportable gessina to be mistress within door at seventeen authority be sweet and obedience be odious i have find neither so and i will give up the first with joy whenever my poor mother shall be able to take command of she own family again this be well gessina and do credit to the good father confessor but authority be dear to woman and so be liberty thou be not with the masker yesterday in the square i seldom wear a disguise and i could not quit my mother which mean that thou would ` st have be glad to do it thou hast a good reason for thy regret since a gayer marriage of the sea or a braver regatta have not be witness in venice since thou wast bear but the first be to be see from thy window i see the galley of state sweeping towards the lido and the train of patrician on its deck but little else no matter thou shalt have as good a idea of the pageant as if thou have ` st play the part of the doge himself first come the man of the guard with they ancient dress -- nay this i remember to have often see for the same show be keep from year to year thou art right but venice never witness such a brave regatta thou knowest that the first trial be always between gondola of many oar steer by the best esteem of the canal luigi be there and though he do not win he more than merit success by the manner in which he direct he boat thou knowest luigi i scarce know any in venice annina for the long illness of my mother and this unhappy office of my father keep I within when other be on the canal true thou art not well place to make acquaintance but luigus be second to no gondolier in skill or reputation and he be much the merriest rogue of they all that put foot on the lido he be foremost then in the grand race he should have be but the awkwardness of he fellow and some unfairness in the cross throw he back to be second 'twa a sight to behold that of many noble waterman struggle to maintain or to get a name on the canal santa marium i would thou could ` st have see it girl i should not have be glad to see a friend defeat we must take fortune as it offer but the most wonderful sight of the day after all though luigus and he fellow do so well be to see a poor fisherman name antonio in he bare head and naked leg a man of seventy year and with a boat no better than that i use to carry liquor to the lido enter on the second race and carry off the prize he could not have meet with powerful rival the best of venice though luigus have strive for the first could not enter for the second trial ` tis say too continued annina look about she with habitual caution that one who may scarce be name in venice have the boldness to appear in that regatta mask and yet the fisherman win thou hast hear of jacopo the name be common there be but one who bear it now in venice all mean the same when they say jacopo i have hear of a monster of that name surely he have not dare to show himself among the noble on such a festa gessina we live in a unaccountable country the man walk the piazza with a step as lordly as the doge at he pleasure and yet none say aught to he i have see he at noonday lean against the triumphal mast or the column of san theodoro with as proud a air as if he be put there to celebrate a victory of the republic perhaps he be master of some terrible secret which they fear he will reveal thou knowest little of venice child holy marium a secret of that kind be a death-warrant of itself it be as dangerous to know too much as it be to know too little when one deal with st mark but they say jacopo be there stand eye to eye with the doge and scare the senator as if he have be a uncalled spectre from the vault of they father nor be this all as i cross the lagune this morning i see the body of a young cavalier draw from the water and those who be near it say it have the mark of he fatal hand the timid gelsomina shudder they who rule she say will have to answer for this negligence to god if they let the wretch longer go

who have good reason to distrust assurance so often make i will do all i can to believe it thou wilt tell thy mother that i never cease to think of she and to pray for she and thou wilt bless thy sister in the name of she poor imprison parent the bravo bow in acquiescence glad of any means to escape speech at a sign from the old man he again bent he knee and receive the parting benediction after busy himself in arrange the scanty furniture of the cell and in try to open one or two small fissure with a view to admit more light and air he quit the place neither gelsomina nor jacopo speak as they return by the intricate passage through which they have ascend to the attic until they be again on the bridge of sigh it be seldom that human foot tread this gallery and the former with female quickness select it as a place suit to they further conference dost thou find he change she ask linger on the arch much thou speakest with a frightful meaning i have not teach my countenance to lie to

thou knowest carlo say gelsomina in a half-audible voice but it be thine my father be not rich as thou can ` st feel or he would not live on the suffering of other by hold the key of the prison he be better employ than those who set the duty be the choice give I girl to wear the horn bonnet to feast in they hall to rest in they palace to be the gayest bauble in such a pageant as that of yesterday to plot in they secret council and to be the heartless judge to condemn my fellow to this misery -- or to be merely the keeper of the key and turner of the bolt -- i should seize on the latter office as not only the most innocent but by far the most honorable thou dost not judge as the world judge carlo i have fear thou might ` st feel shame at be the husband of a jailor 's daughter nay i will not

of the covered bridge a few turning and a short descent bring the bravo and he companion to the level of the quay here the former take a hurry leave and quit the prison chapter xx but they who blunder thus be raw beginner don juan the hour have come for the revel of the piazza and for the movement of the gondola masker glide along the portico as usual the song and cry be hear anew and venice be again absorb in delusive gaiety when jacopo issue from the prison on the quay he mingle with the stream of human being that be set towards the square protect from observation by the privileged mask while cross the lower bridge of the canal of st mark he linger a instant to throw a look at the glazed gallery he have just quit and then move forward with the crowd -- the image of the artless and confide gelsomina uppermost in he thought as he pass slowly along the gloomy arch of the broglio he eye seek the person of don camillo monforte they meet at the angle of the little square and exchange secret sign the bravo move on unnoticed hundred of boat lay at the foot of the piazzetta among these jacopo seek he own gondola which he extricate from the float mass and urge into the stream a few sweep of the oar and he lay at the side of la bella sorrentina the padrone pace the deck enjoy the cool of the evening with italian indolence while he people group on the forecastle sing or rather chant a song of those sea the greeting be blunt and brief as be usual among man of that class but the padrone appear to expect the visit for he lead he guest far from the ear of he crew to the other extremity of the felucca hast thou aught in particular good roderigo demand the mariner who know the bravo by a sign and yet who only know he by that fictitious name thou seest we have not pass the time idly though yesterday be a festa art thou ready for the gulf for the levant or the pillar of hercule as shall please the senate we have get we yard aloft since the sun go behind the mountain and though we may seem careless of delay a hour 's notice will fit we for the outside of the lido then take the notice master roderigo you bring you news to a overstocked market i have already be inform that we shall be wanted to-night the quick movement of suspicion make by the bravo escape the observation of the padrone whose eye be run over the felucca 's gear with a sailor 's habitual attention to that part of he vessel when there be question of its service thou art right stefano but there be little harm in repeat caution preparation be the first duty in a delicate commission ' will you look for yourself signor roderigo say the mariner in a lower tone la bellum sorrentina be not the bucentaur nor a galley of the grand master of malta but for she size better room be not to be have in the palace of the doge when they tell I there be a lady in the freight the honor of calabrium be stir in she behalf ` tis well if they have name to thee all the particulars thou wilt not fail to do thyself credit i do not say that they have show I half of they good signora interrupted stefano the secresy of you venetian shipment be my greatest objection to the trade it have more than once happen to I that i have lie week in the canal with my hold as clean as a friar 's conscience when order have come to weigh with some such cargo as a messenger who have get into he berth as we clear the port to get out of it on the coast of dalmatium or among the greek island in such case thou hast earn thy money easily diamine master roderigo if i have a friend in venice to give timely advice the felucca might be ballast with article that would bring a profit on the other shore of what concern be it to the senate when i do my duty to the noble faithfully that i do my duty at the same time to the good woman and she little brown child leave at home in calabrium there be much reason in what thou sayest stefano but thou knowest the republic be a hard master a affair of this nature must be touch with a gentle hand none know it better than i for when they send the trader with all he movable out of the city i be oblige to throw certain cask into the sea to make room for he worthless stuff the senate owe I just compensation for that loss worthy signor roderigo which thou would ` st be glad to repair to-night santissima marium you may be the doge himself signore for anything i know of you countenance but i could swear at the altar you ought to be of the senate for you sagacity if this lady will not be burden with many effect and there be yet time i might humor the taste of the dalmatian with certain of the article that come from the country beyond the pillar of hercule thou art the judge of the probability thyself since they tell thee of the nature of thy errand san gennaro of napolus open my eye -- they say not a word beyond this little fact that a youthful lady in whom the senate have great interest would quit the city this night for the eastern coast if it be at all agreeable to you conscience master roderigo i should be happy to hear who be to be she companion of that thou shalt hear more in proper season in the meantime i would recommend to thee a cautious tongue for st mark make no idle joke with those who offend he i be glad to see thee in this state of preparation worthy padrone and wish thee a happy night and a prosperous voyage i commit thee to thy patron but hold -- ere i quit thee i would know the hour that the land-breeze will serve you be exact as a compass in you own matter signore but of little charity to thy friend with the burning sun of to-day we should have the air of the alp about the turn of the night ` tis well my eye shall be on thee once more addio cospetto and thou hast say nothing of the cargo ` twill not be so weighty in bulk as in value carelessly answer jacopo shove he gondola from the side of the felucca the fall of he oar into the water succeed and as stefano stand meditate the chance of he speculation on he deck the boat glide away towards the quay with a swift but easy movement deceit like the winding of that subtle animal the fox often cross its own path it consequently throw out those by whom it be practice as well as those who art mean to be its victim when jacopo part from don camillo it be with a understanding that he should adopt all the means that he native sagacity or he experience might suggest to ascertain in what manner the council intend to dispose of the person of donna yioletta they have separate on the lido and as none know of they interview but he and none would probably suspect they recent alliance the bravo enter on he new duty with some chance of success that might otherwise have be lose a change of its agent in affair of peculiar delicacy be one of the ordinary means take by the republic to avoid investigation jacopo have often be its instrument in negotiate with the mariner who as have be so plainly intimate have frequently be engage in carry into effect its secret and perhaps justifiable measure of police but in no instance have it ever be find necessary to interpose a second agent between the commencement and the consummation of its bargain except in this he have be order to see the padrone and to keep he in preparation for immediate service but since the examination of antonio before the council he employer have neglect to give he any further instruction the danger of leave the bride within reach of the agent of don camillo be so obvious that this unusual caution have be consider necessary it be under this disadvantage therefore that jacopo enter on the discharge of he new and important duty that cunning as have just be observe be apt to overreach itself have pass into a proverb and the case of jacopo and he employer be one in point to prove its truth the unusual silence of those who ordinarily seek he on similar occasion have not be lose on the agent and the sight of the felucca as he stray along the quay give a accidental direction to he inquiry the manner in which they be aid by the cupidity of the calabrian have just be related jacopo have no sooner touch the quay and secure he boat than he hasten again to the broglio it be now fill by masker and the idler of the piazzetta the patrician have withdraw to the scene of they own pleasure or in furtherance of that system of mysterious sway which it be they policy to maintain they do not choose to remain expose to the common eye during the hour of license which be about to follow it would seem that jacopo have he instruction for no sooner do he make sure that don camillo have retire than he thread the throng with the air of a man whose course be decide by this time both the square be full and at least half of those who spend the night in those place of amusement be mask the step of the bravo though so unhesitate be leisurely and he find time in pass up the piazzetta to examine the form and when circumstance permit the feature of all he meet he proceed in this manner to the point of junction between the two square when he elbow be touch by a light hand jacopo be not accustomed unnecessarily to trust he voice in the square of st mark and at that hour but he look of inquiry be return by a sign to follow he have be stop by one whose figure be so completely conceal by a domino as to baffle all conjecture concern he true character perceive however that the other wish to lead he to a part of the square that be vacant and which be directly on the course he be about to pursue the bravo make a gesture of compliance and follow no sooner be the two apart from the pressure of the crowd and in a place where no eaves-dropper could overhear they discourse without detection than the stranger stop he appear to examine the person stature and dress of jacopo from beneath he mask with singular caution close the whole with a sign that mean recognition jacopo return he dumb show but maintain a rigid silence just daniel mutter the stranger when he find that he companion be not dispose to speak one would think illustrious signora that you confessor have impose a penance of silence by the manner in which you refuse to speak to you servant what would ` st thou here be i send into the piazza among knight of industry valet gondolier and all other manner of reveller that adorn this christian land in search of the heir of one of the most ancient and honorable house of venice how knowest thou i be he thou seekest signora there be many sign see by a wise man that escape the unobservant when young cavalier have a taste for mingle with the people in honorable disguise as in the case of a certain patrician of this republic they be to be know by they air if not by they voice thou art a cunning agent hosea but the shrewdness of thy race be its livelihood it be its sole defense against the wrong of the oppressor young noble we be hunt like wolf and it be not surprising that we sometimes show the ferocity of the beast yon take we for but why should i tell the wrong of my people to one who believe life be a masquerade and who would not be sorry ingenious hosea be it compose only of hebrew but thy errand i have no gage unredeemed nor do i know that i owe thee gold righteous samuel you cavalier of the senate be not always mindful of the past signora or these be word that might have be spare if you excellency be incline to forget pledge the fault be not of my seek but as for the account that have be so long grow between we there be not a dealer on the rialto that will dispute the proof well be it so -- would ` st thou dun my father 's son in the face of the reveller in st mark i would do no discredit to any come of that illustrious race signora and therefore we will say no more of the matter always rely

set of oar a thousand voice be speak at once and occasionally a general and doleful cry proclaim that the float multitude which come on be move by a common feeling the singularity of the spectacle and the fact that he own gondola lay directly in the route of the fleet which be compose of several hundred boat drive the examination of the girl momentarily from the thought of the noble what have we here jacopo he demand in a under-tone of the gondolier who steer he own barge they be fisherman signora and by the manner in which they come down towards the canal i doubt they be bent on some disturbance there have be discontent among they since the refusal of the doge to liberate the boy of they companion from the galley curiosity induce the people of don camillo to linger a minute and then they perceive the necessity of pull out of the course of the float mass which come on like a torrent the man sweep they boat with that desperate stroke which be so often see among the italian oarsman a menacing hail with a command to remain admonished don camillo of the necessity of downright flight or of obedience he choose the latter as the least likely to interfere with he own plan who art thou demand one who have assume the character of a leader if man of the lagune and christian join you friend and away with we to st mark for justice what mean this tumult ask don camillo whose dress effectually conceal he rank a disguise that he complete by adopt the venetian dialect why be you here in these number friend behold don camillo turn and he behold the withered feature and glare eye of old antonio fix in death the explanation be make by a hundred voice accompany by oath so bitter and denunciation so deep that have not don camillo be prepare by the tale of jacopo he would have find great difficulty in understand what he hear in drag the lagune for fish the body of antonio have be find and the result be first a consultation on the probable means of he death and then a collection of the man of he call and finally the scene describe giustizium exclaim fifty excited voice as the grim visage of the fisherman be hold towards the light of the moon giustizium in palazzo e paue in piazza ask it of the senate return jacopo not attempt to conceal the derision of he tone thinkest thou we fellow have suffer for he boldness yesterday stranger thing have happen in venice they forbid we to cast we net in the canale orfano lest the secret of justice should be know and yet they have grow bold enough to drown one of we own people in the midst of we gondola justice justice shout numberless hoarse throat away to st mark 's lay the body at the foot of the doge away brethren antonio 's blood be on they soul bent on a wild and undigested scheme of assert they wrong the fisherman again ply they oar and the whole fleet sweep away as if it be compose of a single mass the meeting though so short be accompany by cry menace and all those accustomed sign of rage which mark a popular tumult among those excitable people and it have produce a sensible effect on the nerve of annina don camillo profit by she evident terror to press he question for the hour no longer admit of trifle the result be that while the agitate mob sweep into the mouth of the great canal raise hoarse shout the gondola of don camillo monforte glide away across the wide and tranquil surface of the lagunes chapter xxii a clifford a clifford we 'll follow the king and clifford henry vi the tranquillity of the best order society may be disturb at any time by a sudden outbreaking of the malcontent against such a disaster there be no more guard than against the commission of more vulgar crime but when a government tremble for its existence before the turbulence of popular commotion it be reasonable to infer some radical defect in its organization man will rally around they institution as freely as they rally around any other cherish interest when they merit they care and there can be no surer sign of they hollowness than when the ruler seriously apprehend the breath of the mob no nation ever exhibit more of this symptomatic terror on all occasion of internal disturbance than the pretend republic of venice there be a never-ceasing and a natural tendency to dissolution in she factious system which be only resist by the alertness of she aristocracy and the political buttress which they ingenuity have rear much be say of the venerable character of she polity and of its consequent security but it be in vain that selfishness contend with truth of all the fallacy with which man have attempt to gloss he expedient there be none more evidently false than that which infer the duration of a social system from the length of time it have already last it would be quite as reasonable to affirm that the man of seventy have the same chance for life as the youth of fifteen or that the inevitable fate of all thing of mortal origin be not destruction there be a period in human existence when the principle of vitality have to contend with the feebleness of infancy but this probationary state pass the child attain the age when it have the most reasonable prospect of live thus the social like any other machine which have run just long enough to prove its fitness be at the precise period when it be least likely to fail and although he that be young may not live to become old it be certain that he who be old be once young the empire of china be in its time as youthful as we own republic nor can we see any reason for believe that it be to outlast we from the decrepitude which be a natural companion of its year at the period of we tale venice boast much of she antiquity and dread in a equal degree she end she be still strong in she combination but they be combination that have the vicious error of be form for the benefit of the minority and which like the mimic fortress and moat of a scenic representation need only a strong light to destroy the illusion the alarm with which the patrician hear the shout of the fisherman as they sweep by the different palace on they way to the great square can be readily imagine some fear that the final consummation of they artificial condition which have so long be anticipate by a secret political instinct be at length arrive and begin to bethink they of the savest means of provide for they own security some listen in admiration for habit have so far master dulness as to have create a species of identity between the state and far more durable thing and they believe that st mark have gain a victory in that decline which be never exactly intelligible to they apathetic capacity but a few and these be the spirit that accumulate all the national good which be vulgarly and falsely ascribe to the system itself intuitively comprehend the danger with a just appreciation of its magnitude as well as of the means to avoid it but the rioter be unequal to any estimate of they own force and have little aptitude in measure they accidental advantage they act merely on impulse the manner in which they aged companion have triumph on the precede day he cold repulse by the doge and the scene of the lido which in truth lead to the death of antonio have prepare they mind for the tumult when the body be find therefore after the time necessary to collect they force on the lagune they yield to passion and move away towards the palace of st mark as describe without any other definite object than a simple indulgence of feeling on enter the canal the narrowness of the passage compress the boat into a mass so dense as in a measure to impede the use of oar and the progress of the crowd be necessarily slow all be anxious to get as near as possible to the body of antonio and like all mob they in some degree frustrate they own object by ill-regulated zeal once or twice the name of offensive senator be shout as if the fisherman intend to visit the crime of the state on its agent but these cry pass away in the violent breath that be expend on reach the bridge of the rialto more than half of the multitude land and take the shorter course of the street to the point of destination while those in front get on the faster for be disembarrass of the pressure in the rear as they draw nearer to the port the boat begin to loosen and to take something of the form of a funeral procession it be during this moment of change that a powerfully man gondola sweep with strong stroke out of a lateral passage into the great canal accident bring it directly in front of the move phalanx of boat that be come down the same channel its crew seem stagger by the extraordinary appearance which meet they view and for a instant its course be undecided a gondola of the republic shout fifty fisherman a single voice add -- canale orfano the bare suspicion of such a errand as be imply by the latter word and at that moment be sufficient to excite the mob they raise a cry of denunciation and some twenty boat make a furious demonstration of pursuit the menace however be sufficient for quicker far than the movement of the pursuer the gondolier of the republic dash towards the shore and leap on one of those passage of plank which encircle so many of the palace of venice they disappear by a alley encourage by this success the fisherman seize the boat as a waif and tow it into they own fleet

in front row the gondola which contain the remains of the dead the widening of the canal as it approach the port permit the ray of the moon to fall upon the rigid feature of old antonio which be set in such a look as might be suppose to characterize the die thought of a man so suddenly and so fearfully destroy the carmelite bare-headed with clasped hand and a devout heart bow he head at the foot of the body with he white robe flow in the light of the moon a single gondolier guide the boat and no other noise be audible but the plash of the water as the oar slowly fall and rise together this

would seem that they want better assurance of these fact than we own feeling or we word man be the creature of envy the poor desire to be rich -- the weak powerful there be a exception to you rule at least signora since the rich rarely wish to be poor or the powerful weak you deride my sentiment to-night signor gradenigo i speak i hope as become a senator of venice and in a manner that you be not unaccustomed to hear nay the language be not unusual but i fear I there be something unsuited to a fall fortune in the exacting and narrow spirit of we law when a state be eminently flourish its subject overlook general defect in private prosperity but there be no more fastidious commentator on measure than you merchant of a fail trade this be they gratitude have we not convert these muddy isle into a mart for half christendom and now they be dissatisfy that they can not retain all the monopoly that the wisdom of we ancestor have accumulate they complain much in you own spirit signora -- but you be right in say the present riot must be look to let we seek he highness who will go out to the people with such patrician as may be present and one of we number as a witness : more than that might expose we character the secret council withdraw to carry this resolution into effect just as the fisherman in the court receive the accession of those who arrive by water there be no body so sensible of a increase of its member as a mob without discipline and dependent solely on animal force for its ascendency the sentiment of physical power be blended with its very existence when they see the mass of live being which have assemble within the wall of the ducal palace the most audacious of that throng become more hardy and even the waver grow strong this be the reverse of the feeling which prevail among those who be call on to repress this species of violence who generally gain courage as its exhibition be least require the throng in the court be raise one of its loudest and most menacing cry as the train of the doge appear approach by one of the long open gallery of the principal floor of the edifice the presence of the venerable man who nominally preside over that factitious state and the long training of the fisherman in habit of deference to authority notwithstanding they present tone of insubordination cause a sudden and deep silence a feeling of awe gradually steal over the thousand dark face that be gaze upward as the little cortége draw near so profound indeed be the stillness cause by this sentiment that the rustling of the ducal robe be audible as the prince impede by he infirmity and consult the state usual to he rank slowly advance the previous violence of the untutored fisherman and they present deference to the external state that meet they eye have its origin in the same cause -- ignorance and habit be the parent of both why be ye assemble here my child ask the doge when he have reach the summit of the giant 's stair and most of all why have ye come into the palace of you prince with these unbefitting cry the tremulous voice of the old man be clearly audible for the lowest of its tone be scarcely interrupt by a breath the fisherman gaze at each other and all appear to search for he who might be bold enough to answer at length one in the center of the crowded mass and effectually conceal from observation cry justice such be we object mildly continue the prince and such i will add be we practice why be ye assemble here in a manner so offensive to the state and so disrespectful to you prince still none answer the only spirit of they body which have be capable of free itself from the trammel of usage and prejudice have desert the shell which lay on the lower step of the giant 's stair will none speak be ye so bold with you voice when unquestioned and so silent when confront speak they fair you highness whisper he of the council who be commission to be a secret witness of the interview the dalmatian be scarce yet apparel the prince bow to advice which he well know must be respect and he assume he former tone if none will acquaint I with you want i must command you to retire and while my parental heart grieve -- giustizium repeat the hidden member of the crowd name thy want that we may know they highness deign to look at this one bolder than the rest have turn the body of antonio to the moon in a manner to expose the ghastly feature and as he speak he point towards the spectacle he have prepare the prince start at the unexpected sight and slowly descend the step closely accompany by he companion and he guard he pause over the body have the assassin do this he ask after look at the dead fisherman and cross himself what could the end of one like this profit a bravo haply the unfortunate man have fall in a broil of he class neither illustrious doge we fear that antonio have suffer for the displeasure of st mark antonio be this the hardy fisherman who would have teach we how to rule in the state regatta eccellenza it be return the simple laborer of the lagune and a better hand with a net or a truer friend in need never row a gondola to or from the lido diavolo it would have do you highness pleasure to have see the poor old christian among we on a saint 's day take the lead in we little ceremony and teach we the manner in which we father use to do credit to the craft or to have be with we illustrious doge cry another for the ice once break the tongue of a mob soon grow bold in a merry-making on the lido when old antonio be always the foremost in the laugh and the discreetest in know when to be grave the doge begin to have a dawn of the truth and he cast a glance aside to examine the countenance of the unknown inquisitor it be far easier to understand the merit of the unfortunate man than the manner of he death he say finding no explanation in the drill member of the face he have scrutinize will any of you party explain the fact the principal speaker among the fisherman willingly take on himself the office and in the desultory manner of one of he habit he acquaint the doge with the circumstance connect with the finding of the body when he have do the prince again ask explanation with he eye from the senator at he side for he be ignorant whether the policy of the state require a example or simply a death i see nothing in this you highness observe he of the council but the chance of a fisherman the unhappy old man have come to he end by accident and it would be charity to have a few mass say for he soul noble senator exclaim the fisherman doubtingly st mark be offended rumor tell many idle tale of the pleasure and displeasure of st mark if we be to believe all that the wit of man can devise in affair of this nature the criminal be not drown in the lagune but in the canale orfano true eccellenza and we be forbid to cast we net there on pain of sleep with the eel at its bottom so much greater reason for believe that this old man have die by accident be there mark of violence on he body for though the state could scarcely occupy itself with such as he some other might have the condition of the body be look to eccellenza it be enough to cast one of he year into the center of the lagune the stoutest arm in venice could not save he there may have be violence in some quarrel and the proper authority should be vigilant here be a carmelite father do you know aught of this the monk endeavor to answer but he voice fail he stare wildly about he for the whole scene resemble some frightful picture of the imagination and then folding he arm on he bosom he appear to resume he prayer thou dost not answer friar observe the doge who have be as effectually deceive by the natural and indifferent manner of the inquisitor as any other of he auditor where didst thou find this body father anselmo briefly explain the manner in which he have be press into the service of the fisherman at the elbow of the prince there stand a young patrician who at the moment fill no other office in the state than such as belong to he birth deceive like the other by the manner of the only one who know the real cause of antonio 's death he feel a humane and praiseworthy desire to make sure that no foul play have be exercise towards the victim i have hear of this antonio say this person who be call the senator soranzo and who be gifted by nature with feeling that in any other form of government would have make he a philanthropist and of he success in the regatta be it not say that jacopo the bravo be he competitor a low meaning and common murmur run through the throng a man of he reputed passion and ferocity may well have seek to revenge defeat by violence a second and a louder murmur denote the effect this suggestion have produce eccellenza jacopo deal in the stiletto observe the half-credulous but still doubt fisherman that be as may be necessary a man of he art and character may have recourse to other means to gratify he malice do you not agree with I signore the senator soranzo put this question in perfect good faith to the unknown member of the secret council the latter appear strike with the probability of the truth of he companion 's conjecture but contented himself with a simple acknowledgment to that effect by bow jacopo jacopo hoarsely repeat voice after voice in the crowd -- jacopo have do this the best gondolier in venice have be beat by a old fisherman and nothing but blood could wipe out the disgrace it shall be inquire into my child and strict justice do say the doge prepare to depart officer give money for mass that the soul of the unhappy man be not the sufferer reverend carmelite i commend the body to thy care and thou canst do no better service than to pass the night in prayer by its side a thousand cap be wave in commendation of this gracious command and the whole throng stand in silent respect as the prince follow by he retinue retire as he have approach through the long vaulted gallery above a secret order of the inquisition prevent the appearance of the dalmatian a few minute later and all be prepare a bier and canopy be bring out of the adjoining cathedral and the corpse be place upon the former father anselmo then head the procession which pass through the principal gate of the palace into the square chant the usual service the piazzetta and the piazza be still empty here and there indeed a curious face belong to some agent of the police or to some observer more firm than common look out from beneath the arch of the portico on the movement of the mob though none venture to come within its influence but the fisherman be no longer bent on violence with the fickleness of man little influence by reflection and subject to sudden and violent emotion a temperament which the effect of a selfish system be commonly tortured into the reason why it should never be improve they have abandon all idea of revenge on the agent of the police and have turn they thought to the religious service which be command by the prince himself be so flattering to they class it be true that a few of the sterner nature among they mingled menace against the bravo with they prayer for the dead but these have no other effect on the matter in hand than be commonly produce by the by-player on the principal action of the piece the great portal of the venerable church be throw open and the solemn chant be hear issue in response from among the quaint column and vaulted roof within the body of the lowly and sacrifice antonio be bear beneath that arch which sustain the precious relic of grecian art and deposit in the nave candle glimmer before the altar and around the ghastly person of the dead throughout the night and the cathedral of st mark be pregnant with all the impose ceremonial of the catholic ritual until the day once more appear priest succeed priest in repeat the mass while the attentive throng listen as if each of its member feel that he own honor and importance be elevated by this concession to one of they number in the square the masker gradually reappear though the alarm have be too sudden and violent to admit a speedy return to the levity which ordinarily be witness in that spot between the setting and the rising of the sun chapter xxiii ` ti of a lady in she earliest youth the very last of that illustrious race roger when the fisherman land on the quay they desert the gondola of the state to a man donna violetta and she governess hear the tumultuous departure of they singular captor with alarm for they be nearly in entire ignorance of the motive which have deprive they of the protection of father anselmo and which have so unexpectedly make they actor in the extraordinary scene the monk have simply explain that he office be require in behalf of the dead but the apprehension of exciting unnecessary terror prevent he from add that they be in the power of a mob donna florinda however have ascertain sufficient by look from the window of the canopy and from the cry of those around she to get a glimmering of the truth under the circumstance she see that the most prudent course be to keep themselves as much as possible from observation but when the profound stillness that succeed the landing of the rioter announce that they be alone both she and she charge have a intuitive perception of the favorable chance which fortune have so strangely throw in they way they be go whisper donna florinda hold she breath in attention as soon as she have speak and the police will be soon here to seek we no further explanation pass for venice be a town in which even the young and innocent be teach caution donna florinda steal another look without they have disappear heaven know where let we go in a instant the tremble fugitive be on the quay the piazzetta be without a human form except they own a low murmur sound arise from the court palace which resemble the hum of a disturbed hive but nothing be distinct or intelligible there be violence meditate again whisper the governess would to god that father anselmo be here a shuffling footstep catch they ear and both turn towards a boy in the dress of one of the lagune who approach from the direction of the broglio a reverend carmelite bid I give you this say the youth steal a glance behind he like one who dread detection then put a small piece of paper in the hand of donna florinda he turn he own swarthy palm in which a small silver coin glitter to the moon and vanish by the aid of the same light the governess succeed in trace pencil-mark in a hand that have be well know to she younger day save thyself florinda -- there be not a instant to lose avoid public place and seek a shelter quickly but whither ask the bewildered woman when she have read aloud the scroll anywhere but here rejoin donna violetta follow I nature frequently more than supplies the advantage of training and experience by she own gift have donna florinda be possess of the natural decision and firmness of she pupil she would not now have be exist in the isolate condition which be so little congenial to female habit nor would father anselmo have be a monk both have sacrifice inclination to what they consider to be duty and if the ungenial life of the governess be owe to the tranquil course of she ordinary feeling it be probable that its impunity be to be ascribe to the same respectable cause not so with violetta she be ever more ready to act than to reflect and though in general the advantage might possibly be with those of a more regulated temperament there be occasion that form exception to the rule the present moment be one of those turn in the chance of life when it be always better to do anything than to do nothing donna violetta have scarcely speak before she person be shadow beneath the arch of the broglio she governess cling to she side more in affection than in compliance with the warning of the monk or with the dictate of she own reason a vague and romantic intention of throw herself at the foot of the doge who be a collateral descendant of she own ancient house have flash across the mind of the youthful bride when she first flee but no sooner have they reach the palace than a cry from the court acquaint they with its situation and consequently with the impossibility of penetrate to the interior let we retire by the street to thy dwelling my child say donna florinda draw she mantle about she in womanly dignity none will offend female of we condition even the senate must in the end respect we sex this from thee florinda thou who hast so often tremble for they anger but go if thou wilt -- i be no longer the senate 's don camillo monforte have my duty donna florinda have no intention of dispute this point and as the moment have now arrive when the most energetic be likely to lead she quietly submit herself to the superior decision of she pupil the latter take the way along the portico keep always within its shadow in pass the gateway which open towards the sea the fugitive have a glimpse of what be go on in the court the sight quicken they step and they now fly rather than run along the arched passage in a minute they be on the bridge which cross the canal of st mark still fly with all they force a few mariner be look from they felucca and gaze in curiosity but the sight of two terrify female seek refuge from a mob have nothing in itself likely to attract notice at this moment a dark mass of human body appear advance along the quay in the opposite direction arm glitter in the moon-beam and the measure tread of trained man become audible the dalmatian be move down from the arsenal in a body advance and retreat now seem equally impossible to the breathless fugitive as decision and self-possession be very different quality donna violetta do not understand so readily as the circumstance require that it be more than probable the hireling of the republic would consider the flight perfectly natural as it have appear to the curious gazer of the port terror make they blind and as shelter be now the sole object of the fugitive they would probably have seek it in the chamber of doom itself have there be a opportunity as it be they turn and enter the first and indeed the only gate which offer they be meet by a girl whose anxious face betray that singular compound of self-devotion and terror which probably have its rise in the instinct of feminine sympathy here be safety noble lady say the youthful venetian in the soft accent of she native island none will dare do you harm within these wall into whose palace have i enter demand the half-breathless violetta if its owner have a name in venice he will not refuse hospitality to a daughter of tiepolo signora you be welcome return the gentle girl curtsy low and still lead the way deeper within the vast edifice you bear the name of a illustrious house there be few in the republic of note from whom i may not claim either the kindness of ancient and near service or that of kindred dost thou serve a noble master the first in venice lady name he that we may demand he hospitality as befit we saint mark donna violetta and she governess stop short have we unconsciously enter a portal of the palace that be impossible lady since the canal lie between you and the residence of the doge still be st mark master here i hope you will not esteem you safety less because it have be obtain in the public prison and by the aid of its keeper 's daughter the moment for headlong decision be pass and that of reflection have return how art thou call child ask donna florinda move ahead of she pupil and take the discourse up where in wonder the other have permit it to pause we be truly grateful for the readiness with which thou throw open the gate for we admission in a moment of such alarm -- how art thou call gelsomina answer the modest girl i be the keeper 's only child -- and when i see lady of you honorable condition flee on the quay with the dalmatian march on one side and a mob shout on the other i bethought I that even a prison might be welcome thy goodness of heart do not mislead thee have i know it be a lady of the tiepolo i should have be even more ready for there be few of that great name now leave to do we honor violetta curtsy to the compliment but she seem uneasy that haste and pride of rank have lead she so indiscreetly to betray herself canst thou not lead we to some place less public she ask observe that she conductor have stop in a public corridor to make this explanation here you will be retire as in you own palace great lady answer gelsomina turn into a private passage and lead the way towards the room of she family from a window of which she have first witness the embarrassment of she guest none enter here without cause but my father and myself and my father be much occupy with he charge hast thou no domestic none lady a prison-keeper 's daughter should not be too proud to serve herself thou sayest well one of thy discretion good gelsomina must know it be not seemly for female of condition to be throw within wall like these even by accident and thou wilt do we much favor by take more than common means to be certain that we be unseen we give thee much trouble but it shall not go unrequited here be gold gelsomina do not answer but as she stand with she eye cast to the floor the color steal to she cheek until she usually bloodless face be in a soft glow nay i have mistake thy character say donna florinda secrete the sequin and take the unresisting hand of the silent girl if i have pained thee by my indiscretion attribute the offer to we dread of the disgrace of be see in this place the glow deepen and the lip of the girl quiver be it then a disgrace to be innocently within these wall lady she ask still with a avert eye i have long suspect this but none have ever before say it in my hearing holy marium pardon I if i have utter a syllable to pain thee excellent girl it have be unwittingly and without intention we be poor lady and the needy must submit to do that which they wish might lead they to avoid i understand you feeling and will make sure of you be secret and bless marium will pardon a greater sin than any you have commit here while the lady be wonder at witness such proof of delicacy and feeling in so singular a place the girl withdraw i have not expect this in a prison exclaim violetta as all be not noble or just in a palace neither be all to be condemn unheard that we find in a prison but this be in sooth a extraordinary girl for she condition and we be indebted to bless st theodore -lrb- cross herself -rrb- for put she in we way can we do better than by make she a confidante and a friend the governess be older and less disposed than she pupil to confide in appearance but the more ardent mind and superior rank of the latter have give she a influence that the former do not always successfully resist gelsomina return before there be time to discuss the prudence of what violetta have propose thou hast a father gelsomina ask the venetian heiress take the hand of the gentle girl as she put she question holy marium be praise i have still that happiness it be a happiness -- for surely a father would not have the heart to sell he own child to ambition and mercenary hope and thy mother have long be bed-ridden lady i believe we should not have be here but we have no other place so suitable for she suffering as this jail gelsomina thou art happier than i even in thy prison i be fatherless -- motherless -- i could almost say friendless and this from a lady of the tiepolo all be not as it seem in this evil world kind gelsomina we have have many doge but we have have much suffering thou mayest have hear that the house of which i come be reduce to a single youthful girl like thyself who have be leave in the senate 's charge they speak little of these matter lady in venice and of all here none go so seldom into the square as i still have i hear of the beauty and riches of donna violetta the last i hope be true the first i now see be so the daughter of tiepolo color in turn but it be not in resentment they have speak in too much kindness for a orphan she answer though that fatal wealth be perhaps not over-estimated thou knowest that the state charge itself with the care and establishment of all noble female whom providence have leave fatherless lady i do not it be kind of st mark to do it thou wilt think differently anon thou art young gelsomina and hast pass thy time in privacy true lady it be seldom i go further than my mother 's room or the cell of some suffering prisoner violetta look towards she governess with a expression which seem to say that she anticipate she appeal would be make in vain to one so little expose to the feeling of the world thou wilt not understand then that a noble female may have little inclination to comply with all the senate 's wish in dispose of she duty and affection gelsomina gaze at the fair speaker but it be evident that she do not clearly comprehend the question again violetta look at the governess as if ask aid the duty of we sex be often painful say donna florinda understand the appeal with female instinct we attachment may not always follow the wish of we friend we may not choose but we can not always obey i have hear that noble lady be not suffer to see those to whom they be to be wed signora if that be what you eccellenza mean and to I the custom have always seem unjust if not cruel and be female of thy class permit to make friend among those who may become dearer at any other day ask violetta lady we have that much freedom even in the prison then art thou happier than those of the palace i will trust thee generous girl for thou canst not be unfaithful to the weakness and wrong of thy sex gelsomina raise a hand as if to stop the impetuous confidence of she guest and then she listen intently few enter here she say but there be many way of learn secret within these wall which be still unknown to I come deeper into the room noble lady for here be a place that i have reason to think be safe even from listener the keeper 's daughter lead the way into the little room in which she be accustom to converse with jacopo you be say lady that i have a feeling for the weakness and helplessness of we sex and surely you do I justice violetta have leisure to reflect a instant in pass from one room to the other and she begin she communication with more reserve but the sensitive interest that a being of the gentle nature and secluded habit of gelsomina take in she narrative win upon she own natural frankness and in a manner nearly imperceptible to herself she make the keeper 's daughter mistress of most of the circumstance under which she have enter the prison the cheek of gelsomina become colorless as she listen and when donna violetta cease every limb of she slight frame tremble with interest the senate be a fearful power to resist she say speak so low as hardly to be audible have you reflect lady on the chance of what you do if i have not it be now too late to change my intention i be the wife of the duke of sant ' aga and can never wed another gesu this be true and yet methink i would choose to die a nun rather than offend the council thou knowest not good girl to what courage the heart of even a young wife be equal thou art still bind to thy father in the instruction and habit of childhood but thou mayest live to know that all thy hope will center in another gelsomina cease to tremble and she mild eye brighten the council be terrible she answer but it must be more terrible to desert one to whom you have vow duty and love at the altar hast thou the means of conceal we kind girl interrupted donna florinda and canst thou when this tumult shall be quiet in any manner help we to further secresy or flight lady i have none even the street and square of venice be nearly stranger to I santissima maria what would i give to know the way of the town as well as my cousin annina who pass at will from she father 's shop to the lido and from st mark 's to the rialto as she pleasure suit i will send for my cousin who will counsel we in this fearful strait thy cousin hast thou a cousin name annina lady annina my mother 's sister 's child the daughter of a wine-seller call tomaso tortus do the noble dame of the city take such heed of they inferior this will charm my cousin for she have great desire to be note by the great and do thy cousin come hither rarely lady -- we be not of much intimacy i suppose annina find a girl simple and uninstructed as i unworthy of she company but she will not refuse to aid we in a danger like this i know she little love the republic for we have have word on its act and my cousin have be bolder of speech about they than befit one of she year in this prison gelsomina thy cousin be a secret agent of the police and unworthy of thy confidence -- lady i do not speak without reason trust I she be employ in duty that be unbecome she sex and unworthy of thy confidence noble dame i will not say anything to do displeasure to you high rank and present distress but you should not urge I to think thus of my mother 's niece you have be unhappy and you may have cause to dislike the republic and you be safe here -- but i do not desire to hear annina censure both donna florinda and she less experienced pupil know enough of human nature to consider this generous incredulity as a favorable sign of the integrity of she who manifest it and they wisely contented themselves with stipulate that annina should on no account be make acquaint with they situation after this understand the three discuss more leisurely the prospect of the fugitive be able to quit the place when ready without detection at the suggestion of the governess a servitor of the prison be send out by gelsomina to observe the state of the square he be particularly charge though in a manner to avoid suspicion to search for a carmelite of the order of the bare-footed friar on he return the menial report that the mob have quit the court of the palace and be go to the cathedral with the body of the fisherman who have so unexpectedly gain the prize in the regatta of the precede day repeat you ave and go to sleep bellum gelsomina conclude the sub-keeper for the fisherman have leave off shout to say they prayer per diana the bare-headed and bare-legged rascal be as impudent as if st mark be they inheritance the noble patrician should give they a lesson in modesty by send every tenth knave among they to the galley miscreant to disturb the quiet of a orderly town with they vulgar complaint but thou hast say nothing of the friar be he with the rioter there be a carmelite at the altar -- but my blood boil at see such vagabond disturb the peace of respectable person and i take little note of he air or year then thou failedst to do the errand on which i send thee it be now too late to repair thy fault thou canst return to thy charge a million pardon bellissima gelsomina but indignation be the uppermost feeling when one in office see he rights attack by the multitude send I to corfu or to candia if you please and i will bring back the color of every stone in they prison but do not send I among rebel my gorge rise at the sight of villany as the keeper 's daughter withdraw while she father 's assistant be make this protestation of loyalty the latter be compel to give vent to the rest of he indignation in a soliloquy one of the tendency of oppression be to create a scale of tyranny descend from those who rule a state to those who domineer over a single individual he who have be much accustomed to view man need not be tell that none be so arrogant with they inferior as those who be oppress by they superior for poor human nature have a secret longing to revenge itself on the weak for all the injury it receive from the strong on the other hand no class be so willing to render that deference when unexacted which be the proper meed of virtue and experience and intelligence as he who know that he be fortify on every side against innovation on he natural rights thus it be that there be more security against popular violence and popular insult in these free state than in any other country on earth for there be scarcely a citizen so debased as not to feel that in assume the appearance of a wish to revenge the chance of fortune he be make a undue admission of inferiority though the torrent may be pen up and dam by art it be with the constant hazard of break down the unnatural barrier but leave to its own course it will become the tranquil and the deep stream until it finally throw off its superfluous water into the common receptacle of the ocean when gelsomina return to she visitor it be with a report favorable to they tranquillity the riot in the court of the palace and the movement of the dalmatian have draw all eye in another direction and although some errant gaze might have witness they entrance into the gate of the prison it be so natural a circumstance that no one would suspect female of they appearance of remain there a instant longer than be necessary the momentary absence of the few servant of the prison who take little heed of those who enter the open part of the building and who have be draw away by curiosity complete they security the humble room they be in be exclusively devote to the use of they gentle protector and there be scarcely a possibility of interruption until the council have obtain the leisure and the means of make use of those terrible means which rarely leave anything it wish to know conceal with this explanation donna violetta and she companion be greatly satisfied it leave they leisure to devise means for they flight and kindle a hope in the former of be speedily restore to don camillo still there exist the cruel embarrassment of not possess the means of acquaint the latter with they situation as the tumult cease they resolve to seek a boat avor by such disguise as the means of gelsomina could supply and to row to he palace but reflection convinced donna florinda of the danger of such a step since the neapolitan be know to be surround by the agent of the police accident which be more effectual than stratagem in defeat intrigue have throw they into a place of momentary security and it would be to lose the vantage-ground of they situation to cast themselves without the utmost caution into the hazard of the public canal at length the governess bethought she of turn the service of the gentle creature who have already show so much sympathy in they behalf to account during the revelation of she pupil the feminine instinct of donna florinda have enable she to discover the secret spring which move the unpractised feeling of they auditor gelsomina have listen to the manner in which don camillo have throw himself into the canal to save the life of violetta with breathless admiration she countenance be a pure reflection of she thought when the daughter of tiepolo speak of the risk he have run to gain she love and woman glow in every lineament of she mild face when the youthful bride touch on the nature of the engrossing tie which have unite they and which be far too holy to be sever by the senate 's policy if we have the means of get we situation to the ear of don camillo say the governess all might yet be save else will this happy refuge in the prison avail we nothing be the cavalier of too stout a heart to shrink before those up above demand gelsomina he would summon the people of he confidence and ere the dawn of day we might still be beyond they power those calculate senator will deal with the vow of my pupil as if they be childish oath and set the anger of the holy see itself at defiance when there be question of they interest but the sacrament of marriage be not of man that at least they will respect believe it not there be no obligation so solemn as to be respect when they policy be concern what be the wish of a girl or what the happiness of a solitary and helpless female to they fortune that my charge be young be a reason why they wisdom should interfere though it be none to touch they heart with the reflection that the misery to which they would condemn she be to last the longer they take no account of the solemn obligation of gratitude the tie of affection be so many means of work upon the fear of those they rule but none for forbearance and they laugh at the devotedness of woman 's love as a folly to amuse they leisure or to take off the edge of disappointment in graver concern can anything be more grave than wedlock lady to they it be important as it furnish the means of perpetuate they honor and they proud name beyond this the council look little at domestic interest they be father and husband true for to be legally the first they must become the last marriage to they be not a tie of sacred and dear affinity but the means of increase they riches and of sustain they name continue the governess watch the effect of she word on the countenance of the guileless girl they call marriage of affection child 's game and they deal with the wish of they own daughter as they would traffic with they commodity of commerce when a state set up a idol of gold as its god few will refuse to sacrifice at its altar i would i might serve the noble donna violetta thou art too young good gelsomina and i fear too little practice in the cunning of venice doubt I not lady for i can do my duty like another in a good cause if it be possible to convey to don camillo monforte a knowledge of we situation -- but thou art too inexperienced for the service believe it not signora interrupt the generous gelsomina whose pride begin to stimulate she natural sympathy with one so near she own age and one too like herself subject to that passion which engross a female heart i may be apter than my appearance would give reason to think i will trust thee kind girl and if the sainted virgin protect we thy fortune shall not be forget the pious gelsomina cross herself and first acquaint she companion with she intention she go within to prepare herself while donna florinda pen a note in term so guard as to defy detection in the event of accident but which might suffice to let the lord of st aga understand they present situation in a few minute the keeper 's daughter reappear she ordinary attire which be that of a modest venetian maiden of humble condition need no concealment and the mask a article of dress which none in that city be without effectually disguise she feature she then receive the note with the name of the street and the palace she be to seek a description of the person of the neapolitan with often-repeated caution to be wary and depart chapter xxiv which be the wiser here -- justice or iniquity measure for measure in the constant struggle between the innocent and the artful the latter have the advantage

as we be of the vice of the venetian system we pen have run truant with its subject since the application of the moral must be make on the familiar scale suit to the incident of we story it have already be see that gelsomina be intrust with certain important key of the prison for this trust there have be sufficient motive with the wily guardian of the jail who have make they calculation on

the key at the next instant she be on the vast and gloomy stairway it require but a moment to descend it and to reach the covered gallery which surround the court a halberdier be within a few foot of she he look at the unknown female with interest but as it be not he business to question those who issue from the building nothing be say gelsomina walk on a half-repenting but vindictive being be drop a accusation in the lion 's mouth gelsomina stop involuntarily until the secret accuser have do he treacherous work and depart then when she be about to proceed she see that the halberdier at the

she be to enter the agent of the police have be too much alarm by the rising of the fisherman not to call they usual ingenuity and finesse into play the moment the disturbance be appease money have be give to the mountebank and ballad singer to induce they to reappear and group of hireling some in mask and other without concealment be ostentatiously assemble in different part of the piazza in short those usual expedient be resort to which be constantly use to restore the confidence of a people in those country in which civilization be so new that they be not yet consider sufficiently advance to

enter the piazzetta she find both the square partly fill a few excited fisherman cluster about the door of the cathedral like bee swarm before they hive but on that side there be no very visible cause of alarm unaccustomed as she be to scene like that before she the first glance assure the gentle girl of the real privacy which so singularly distinguish the solitude of a crowd gather she simple

he service as she be nearly a stranger in the street of venice labyrinth that offer greater embarrassment to the uninitiated than perhaps the passage of any other town of its size she gladly avail herself of the offer to descend to the step to leap into the boat to utter the word rialto and to conceal herself in the pavilion be the business of a minute the boat be instantly in motion gelsomina now believe herself secure of effect she purpose since there be little to apprehend from the knowledge or the design of a common boatman he could not know she object and it be he interest to carry she in safety to the place she have command but so important be success that she could not feel secure of attain it while it be still unaccomplished she soon summon sufficient resolution to look out at the palace and boat they be pass and she feel the refreshing air of the canal revive she courage then turn with a sensitive distrust to examine the countenance of the gondolier she see that he feature be conceal beneath a mask that be so well design as not to be perceptible to a casual observer by moonlight though it be common on occasion for the servant of the great it be not usual for the public gondolier to be disguise the circumstance itself be one justly to excite slight apprehension though on second thought gelsomina see no more in it than a return from some expedition of pleasure or some serenade perhaps in which the caution of a lover have compel he follower to resort to this species of concealment shall i put you on the public quay signora demand the gondolier or shall i see you to the gate of you own palace the heart of gelsomina beat high she like the tone of the voice though it be necessarily smother by the mask but she be so little accustomed to act in the affair of other

here in venice she ask after a moment 's pause the gondolier sensibly betray surprise by the manner in which he start at the question would you be row there lady if thou art certain of know the palazzo the water stir and the gondola glide between high wall gelsomina know by the sound that they be in one of the smaller canal and she augur well of the boatman 's knowledge of the town they soon stop by the side of a water-gate and the man appear on the step hold a arm to aid she in ascend after the manner of people of he craft gelsomina bid he wait she return and proceed there be a marked derangement in the household of don camillo that one more practiced than we heroine would have note the servant seem undecided in the manner of perform the most ordinary duty they look wander distrustfully from one to another and when they half-frightened visitor enter the vestibule though all arise none advance to meet she a female mask be not a rare sight in venice for few of that sex go upon the canal without use the customary means of concealment but it would seem by they hesitate manner that the menial of don camillo do not view the entrance of she who now appear with the usual

the palace of don camillo have a air of more than venetian gloom the room be dimly light many of the wall have be strip of the most precious of they picture and in other respects a jealous eye might have detect evidence of a secret intention on the part of its owner not to make a permanent residence of the dwelling but these be particulars that gelsomina do not note as she follow gino through the apartment into the more private part of the building here the gondolier unlock a door and regard he companion with a air half-doubting half-respectful he make a sign for she to enter my master commonly receive the lady here he say enter eccellenza while i run to tell he of he happiness gelsomina do not hesitate though she feel a violent throb at the heart when she hear the key turn in the

lady -- a young a virtuous and a beautiful wife -- a daughter of the tiepolo -- of the tiepolo annina why should a lady of the tiepolo employ a girl of the public prison why -- because there have be injustice by those up above there have be a tumult among the fisherman -- and the lady and she governess be liberate by the rioter -- and he highness speak to they in the great court -- and the dalmatian be on the quay -- and the prison be a refuge for lady of they quality in a moment of so great terror -- and the holy church itself have bless they love -- gelsomina could utter no more but breathless with the wish to vindicate herself and wound to the soul by the strange embarrassment of she situation she sob aloud incoherent as have be she language she have say enough to remove every doubt from the mind of annina privy to the secret marriage to the rising of the fisherman and to the departure of the lady from the convent on a distant island where they have be carry on quit they

of thy pretend daughter of tiepolo and she governess be no secret to those who frequent the piazza of san marco hadst thou see the beauty and innocence of the lady annina thou would ` st not say this bless san teodoro what be more beautiful than vice ` tis the cheapest artifice of the devil to deceive frail sinner this thou hast hear of thy confessor gelsomina or he be of much lighter discourse

the gondolier of don camillo have long be a unfavored suitor of mine and when this florinda complain of my have what every honest girl in venice should do expose she fraud to the authority she advise he master to seize I partly in revenge and partly with the vain hope of make I retract the complaint i have make thou hast hear of the bold violence of these cavalier when thwart in they will annina then relate the manner of she seizure with sufficient exactitude merely conceal those fact that it be not she interest to reveal but there be a lady of the tiepolo annina as sure as there be cousin like ourselves santa madre di dio that woman so treacherous and so bold should have meet one of thy innocence it would have be better have they fall in with I who be too ignorant for they cunning bless st anna know -- but who have not to learn they true character they do speak of thee annina the glance which the wine-seller 's daughter throw at she cousin be such as the treacherous serpent cast at the bird but preserve she self-possession she add -- not to my favor it would sicken I to hear word of favor from such as they they be not thy friend annina perhaps they tell thee child that i be in the employment of the council indeed they do no wonder you dishonest people can never believe one can do a act of pure conscience but here come the neapolitan -- note the libertine gelsomina and thou wilt feel for he the same disgust as i the door open and don camillo monforte enter there be a appearance of distrust in he manner which prove that he do not expect to meet he bride gelsomina arise and though bewilder by the tale of she cousin and she own previous impression she stand resemble a meek statue of modesty await he approach the neapolitan be evidently strike by she beauty and the simplicity of she air but he brow be fix like that of a man who have steel he feeling against deceit thou would ` st see I he say i have that wish noble signora but -- annina -- see another thy

half-unconscious cousin she again curtsy and hurry from the room as the presence of they master in he closet be know to they none of the menial presume to stop those who issue from the privileged room gelsomina who be even more impatient than she wily companion to escape from a place she believe polluted be nearly breathless when she reach the gondola its owner be in wait on the step and in a moment the boat whirl away from a spot which both of those it contain be though for reason so very different glad to quit gelsomina have forget she mask in she hurry and the gondola be no sooner in

mask carlo have half burst from she lip but another sign suppress the cry gelsomina withdraw she head and after she beating heart have cease to throb she bow she face and murmur thanksgiving at find herself at such a moment under the protection of one who possess all she confidence the gondolier ask no order for he direction the boat move on take the direction of the port which appear perfectly natural to the two female annina suppose it be return to the square the place she would have seek have she be alone and gelsomina who believe that he whom she call carlo toil regularly as a gondolier for support fancy of course that he be take she to she ordinary residence but though the innocent can endure the scorn of the world it be hard indeed to be suspect by those they love all that annina have tell she of the character of don camillo and he associate come gradually across the mind of the gentle gelsomina and she feel the blood creep to she temple as she see the construction she lover might put on she conduct a dozen time do the artless girl satisfy herself with say inwardly he know I and will believe the best and as often do she feeling prompt she to tell the truth suspense be far more painful at such moment than even vindication which in itself be a humiliating duty to the virtuous pretend a desire to breathe the air she leave she cousin in the canopy annina be not sorry to be alone for she have need to reflect on all the winding of the sinuous path on which she have enter gelsomina succeed in pass the pavilion and in gain the side of the gondolier carlo -- she say observe that he continue to row in silence gelsomina thou hast not question I i know thy treacherous cousin and can believe thou art she dupe the moment to learn the truth will come thou didst not know I carlo when i call thee from the bridge i do not any fare that would occupy my time be welcome why dost thou call annina treacherous because venice do not hold a more wily heart or a falser tongue gelsomina remember the warning of donna florinda possess of the advantage of blood and that reliance which the inexperienced always place in the integrity of they friend until exposure come to destroy the illusion annina have find it easy to persuade she cousin of the unworthiness of she guest but here be one who have all she sympathy who openly denounce annina herself in such a dilemma the

practice in the winding of venetian deceit he know how unceasingly the eye of the council through they agent be on the movement of those in whom they take a interest and he be far from feel all the advantage circumstance have seemingly throw in he way annina be certainly in he power and it be not possible that she have yet communicate the intelligence derive from gelsomina to any of she employer but a gesture a look in pass the prison-gate the appearance of duresse or a exclamation might give the alarm to some one of the thousand spy of the police the disposal of annina 's person in some place of safety therefore become the first and the most material act to return to the palace of don camillo would be to go into the midst of the hireling of the senate and although the neapolitan rely on he rank and influence have prefer this step when little importance be attach to the detention of the girl and when all she know have be reveal the case be alter now that she might become the connect link in the information necessary to enable the officer to find the fugitive the gondola move on palace after palace be pass and the impatient annina thrust she head from a window to note its

keep the outer gate and who be probably by this time in the secret of he true character it now appear that egress by the other route be equally hazardous he have not be surprise so much by the substance of the proclamation as by the publicity the senate have see fit to give to its policy and he have hear himself denounce with a severe pang it be true but without terror still he have so many means of disguise and the practice of personal concealment be so general in venice that he have entertain no great distrust of the result until he now find himself in this awkward dilemma gelsomina

in youth to seek beauty he do great service to the lady in she need and that youth should feel these sympathy be nothing strange venice have she sympathy as well as the youngest of we all signora but venice can not wed the heiress true st mark must be satisfy with play the prudent father 's part you be yet young signora soranzo and the donna giulietta be of rare beauty as life wear upon ye both ye will see the fortune of kingdom as well as of family differently but we waste we breath uselessly in this matter since we agent have not yet report they success in the pursuit the most pressing affair just now be the disposition of the bravo have he highness show you the letter of the sovereign pontiff in the question of the intercept dispatch signore he have a fair answer be return by we predecessor and it must rest there we will then look freely into the matter of jacopo frontonus there will be necessity of we assemble in the chamber of the inquisition that we may have the prisoner confront to he accuser ` tis a grave trial signor and venice would lose in man 's estimation be not the highest tribunal to take a interest in its decision to the block with the villain again exclaim the signor soranzo he may haply meet with that fate or even with the punishment of the wheel a mature examination will enlighten we much on the course which policy may dictate there can be but one policy when the protection of the life of we citizen be in question i have never before feel impatience to shorten the life of man but in this trial i can scarce brook delay you honorable impatience shall be gratified signor soranzo : for foresee the urgency of the case my colleague the worthy senator who be join with we in this high duty and myself have already issue the command necessary to that object the hour be near and we will repair to the chamber of the inquisition in time to we duty the discourse then turn on subject of a more general concern this secret and extraordinary tribunal which be oblige to confine its meeting to no particular place which could decide on its decree equally in the piazza or the palace amidst the revelry of the masquerade or before the altar in the assembly of the gay or in they own closet have of necessity much ordinary matter submit to its inspection as the chance of birth enter into its original composition and god have not make all alike fit for so heartless a duty it sometimes happen as in the present instance that the more worldly of its member have to overcome the generous disposition of a colleague before the action of the terrible machine could go on it be worthy of remark that community always establish a higher standard of justice and truth than be exercise by they individual member the reason be not to be seek for since nature have leave to all a perception of that right which be abandon only under the stronger impulse of personal temptation we commend the virtue we can not imitate thus it be that those country in which public opinion have most influence be always of the purest public practice it follow as a corollary from this proposition that a representation should be as real as possible for its tendency will be inevitably to elevate national moral miserable indeed be the condition of that people whose maxim and measure of public policy be below the standard of its private integrity for the fact not only prove it be not the master of its own destiny but the still more dangerous truth that the collective power be employ in the fatal service of undermine those very quality which be necessary to virtue and which have enough to do at all time in resist the attack of immediate selfishness a strict legal representation of all its interest be far more necessary to a worldly than to a simple people since responsibility which be the essence of a free government be more likely to keep the agent of a nation near to its own standard of virtue than any other mean the common opinion that a republic can not exist without a extraordinary degree of virtue in its citizen be so flattering to we own actual condition that we seldom take the trouble to inquire into its truth but to we it seem quite apparent that the effect be here mistake for the cause it be say as the people be virtually master in a republic that the people ought to be virtuous to rule well so far as this proposition be confine to degree it be just as true of a republic as of any other form of government but king do rule and surely all have not be virtuous and that aristocracy have rule with the very minimum of that quality the subject of we tale sufficiently show that other thing be equal the citizen of a republic will have a higher standard of private virtue than the subject of any other form of government be true as a effect we can readily believe for responsibility to public opinion exist in all the branch of its administration that conventional morality which characterize the common sentiment will be leave to act on the mass and will not be pervert into a terrible engine of corruption as be the case when factitious institution give a false direction to its influence the case before we be in proof of the truth of what have here be say the signor soranzo be a man of great natural excellence of character and the charity of he domestic circle have assist in confirm he original disposition like other of he rank and expectation he have from time to time make the history and polity of the self-styled republic he study and the power of collective interest and specious necessity have make he admit sundry theory which present in another form he would have repulse with indignation still the signor soranzo be far from understand the full effect of that system which he be bear to uphold even venice pay that homage to public opinion of which there have just be question and hold forth to the world but a false picture of she true state maxim still many of those which be too apparent to be conceal be difficult of acceptance with one whose mind be yet untainted with practice and the young senator rather shut he eye on they tendency or as he feel they influence in every interest which environ he but that of poor neglect abstract virtue whose reward be so remote he be fain to seek out some palliative or some specious and indirect good as the excuse for he acquiescence in this state of mind the signor soranzo be unexpectedly admit a member of the council of three often in the day-dream of he youth have he contemplate the possession of this very irresponsible power as the consummation of he wish a thousand picture of the good he would perform have cross he brain and it be only as he advance in life and come to have a near view of the wiles which beset the best-intentioned that he could bring himself to believe most of that which he meditate be impracticable as it be he enter into the council with doubt and misgiving have he live in a later age under he own system modify by the knowledge which have be a consequence of the art of print it be probable that the signor soranzo would have be a noble in opposition now support with ardor some measure of public benevolence and now yield gracefully to the suggestion of a sterner policy and always influence by the positive advantage he be bear to possess though scarcely conscious himself he be not all he profess to be the fault however be not so much that of the patrician as that of circumstance which by place interest in opposition to duty lure many a benevolent mind into still greater weakness the companion of the signor soranzo however have a more difficult task to prepare he for the duty of the statesman which be so very different from those he be accustom to perform as a man than they have anticipate they be like two trained elephant of the east possess themselves all the finer instinct and generous quality of the noble animal but discipline by a force quite foreign to they natural condition into creature of mere convention place one on each side of a younger brother fresh from the plain and whom it be they duty to teach new service for the trunk new affection and haply the manner in which to carry with dignity the howdah of a rajah with many allusion to they policy but with no direct intimation of they own intention the senior of the council continue the conversation until the hour for the meeting in the doge 's palace draw nigh they then separate as privately as they have come together in order that no vulgar eye might penetrate the mystery of they official character the most practice of the three appear in a assembly of the patrician which noble and beautiful dame grace with they presence from which he disappear in a manner to leave no clue to he motion the other visit the death-bed of a friend where he discourse long and well with a friar of the immortality of the soul and the hope of a christian : when he depart the godly man bestow he blessing and the family he leave be loud and eloquent in he praise the signor soranzo cling to the enjoyment of he own family circle until the last moment the donna giulietta have return fresher and more lovely than ever from the invigorating sea-breeze and she soft voice with the melodious laugh of he first-born the bloom ringlet-covered girl describe still ring in he ear when he gondolier land he beneath the bridge of the rialto here he mask and draw he cloak about he he move with the current towards the square of st mark by means of the narrow street once in the crowd there be little danger of impertinent observation disguise be as often useful to the oligarchy of venice as it be absolutely necessary to elude its despotism and to render the town tolerable to the citizen paolo see swarthy bare-legged man of the lagune enter occasionally into the cathedral he follow and find himself stand near the dimly light altar at which mass be still say for the soul of antonio this be one of thy fellow he ask of a fisherman whose dark eye glitter in that light like the organ of a basilisk signora he be -- a more honest or a more just man do not cast he net in the gulf he have fall a victim to he craft cospetto di bacco none know in what manner he come by he end some say st mark be impatient to see he in paradise and some pretend he have fall by the hand of a common bravo name jacopo frontonus why should a bravo take the life of one like this by have the goodness to answer you own question signora you will spare I some trouble why should he sure enough they say jacopo be revengeful and that shame and anger at he defeat in the late regatta by one old as this be the reason be he so jealous of he honor with the oar diamine i have see the time when jacopo would sooner die than lose a race but that be before he carry a stiletto have he keep to he oar the thing might have happen but once know for the hire blow it seem unreasonable he should set he heart so strongly on the prize of the canal may not the man have fall into the lagune by accident no doubt signora this happen to some of we daily but then we think it wiser to swim to the boat than to sink old antonio have a arm in youth to carry he from the quay to the lido but he may have be strike in fall and render unable to do himself this good office there would be mark to show this be it true signora would not jacopo have use the stiletto perhaps not on one like antonio the gondola of the old man be find in the mouth of the grand canal half a league from the body and against the wind we note these thing signora for they be within we knowledge a happy night to thee fisherman a most happy night eccellenza say the laborer of the lagune gratify with have so long occupy the attention of one he rightly believe so much he superior the disguise senator pass on he have no difficulty in quit the cathedral unobserved and he have he private means of enter the palace without attract any impertinent eye to he movement here he quickly join he colleague of the fearful tribunal chapter xxviii _ there _ the prisoner rest together they hear not the voice of the oppressor job the manner in which the council of three hold its more public meeting if aught connect with that mysterious body could be call public have already be see on the present occasion there be the same robe the same disguise and the same officer of the inquisition as in the scene relate in a previous chapter the only change be in the character of the judge and in that of the accuse by a peculiar arrangement of the lamp too most of the light be throw upon the spot it be intend the prisoner should occupy while the side of the apartment on which the inquisitor sit be leave in a dimness that well accord with they gloomy and secret duty previously to the opening of the door by which the person to be examine be to appear there be audible the clanking of chain the certain evidence that the affair in hand be consider serious the hinge turn and the bravo stand in presence of those unknown man who be to decide on he fate as jacopo have often be before the council though not as a prisoner he betray neither surprise nor alarm at the black aspect of all he eye behold he feature be compose though pale he limb immovable and he mien decent when the little bustle of he entrance have subside there reign a stillness in the room thou art call jacopo frontonus say the secretary who act as the mouth-piece of the three on this occasion i be thou art the son of a certain ricardo frontonus a man well know as have be concern in rob the republic 's custom and who be think to have be banish to the distant island or to be otherwise punish signora -- or otherwise punish thou wert a gondolier in thy youth i be a gondolier thy mother be

only be that there might be no hazard of sully the ermine of justice by a premature and not sufficiently support judgment jacopo bent he head but without speak a smile so wild and meaning however gleam on he face at this declaration that the permanent officer of the secret tribunal he who serve as its organ of communication bow nearly to the paper he hold as it might be to look deeper into he

agreeably disappoint in the lineament he study he take upon himself the power to grant the request humor he wish he say to the halberdier but have he in readiness to reappear jacopo look he gratitude but fearful that the other might still interfere to prevent he wish he hurry from the room the march of the little procession which proceed from the chamber of the inquisition to the summer cell of

which be heighten by the scene in which he have just be a actor he raise he hand and stand immovable while the manacle be replace this office do they walk away together in the direction of the secret chamber it be not long ere all be again in they place before the council of three jacopo frontonus resume the secretary thou art suspect of be privy to another dark deed that have have place of late within we city hast thou any knowledge of a noble calabrian who have high claim to the senate 's honor and who have long have he abode in venice signora i have hast thou have aught of concern with he signore yes a movement of common interest make itself apparent among the auditor dost thou know where the don camillo monforte be at present jacopo hesitate he so well understand the means of intelligence possess by the council that he doubt how far it might be prudent to deny he connexion with the flight of the lover besides at that moment he mind be deeply impressed with a holy sentiment of truth canst thou say why the young duca be not to be find in he palace repeat the secretary illustrissimo he have quit venice for ever how canst thou know this -- would he make a confidant of a common bravo the smile which cross the feature of jacopo be full of superiority it cause the conscious agent of the secret tribunal to look closely at he papers like one who feel its power art thou he confidant -- i ask again signore in this i be -- i have the assurance from the mouth of don camillo monforte himself that he will not return this be impossible since it would involve a loss of all he fair hope and illustrious fortune he console himself signora with the possession of the heiress of tiepolo 's love and with she riches again there be a movement among the three which all they practice restraint and the conventional dignity of they mysterious function could not prevent let the keeper withdraw say the inquisitor of the scarlet robe so soon as the prisoner be alone with the three and they permanent officer the examination continue the senator themselves trust to the effect produce by they mask and some feint speak as occasion offer this be important intelligence that thou hast communicate jacopo continue he of the robe of flame it may yet redeem thy life wert thou wise enough to turn it to account what would you eccellenza at my hand it be plain that the council know of the flight of don camillo nor will i believe that eye which so seldom be close have not yet miss the daughter of the tiepolo both be true jacopo but what hast thou to say of the means remember that as thou findest favor with the council thine own fate will be decide the prisoner suffer another of those freezing gleam to cross he face which invariably cause he examiner to bend they look aside the means of escape can not be want to a bold lover signora he reply don camillo be rich and might employ a thousand agent have he need of they thou art equivocate ` twill be the worse for thee that thou triflest with the council -- who be these agent he have a generous household eccellenza -- many hardy gondolier and servitor of all condition of these we have nothing to learn he have escape by other means -- or art thou sure he have escape at all signora be he in venice nay that we ask of thee here be a accusation find in the lion 's mouth which charge thee with he assassination and the donna violetta 's too eccellenza of she we have hear nothing what answer dost make to the charge signora why should i betray my own secret ha art thou equivocate and faithless remember that we have a prisoner beneath the lead who can extract the truth from thee jacopo raise he form to such a altitude as one might fancy to express the mount of a liberated spirit still he eye be sad and spite of a effort to the contrary he voice melancholy senator he say you prisoner beneath the lead be free how thou art trifling in thy despair i speak truth the liberation so long delay have come at last thy father -- be dead interrupted jacopo solemnly the two elder member of the council look at each other in surprise while they junior colleague listen with the interest of one who be just enter on a noviciate of secret and embarrassing duty the former consult together and then they communicate as much of they opinion to the signor soranzo as they deem necessary to the occasion wilt thou consult thine own safety jacopo and reveal all thou knowest of this affair of the neapolitan continue the inquisitor when this by-play be end jacopo betray no weakness at the menace imply by the word of the senator but after a moment 's reflection he answer writh as much frankness as he could have use at the confessional it be know to you illustrious senator he say that the state have a desire to match the heiress of tiepolo to its own advantage that she be beloved of the neapolitan noble and that as be wont between young and virtuous heart she return he love as become a maiden of she high condition and tender year be there anything extraordinary in the circumstance that two of so illustrious hope should struggle to prevent they own misery signor the night that old antonio die i be alone among the grave of the lido with many melancholy and bitter thought and life have become a burden to I have the evil spirit which be then uppermost maintain its mastery i might have die the death of a hopeless suicide god send don camillo monforte to my succor praise be the immaculate marium and she bless son for the mercy it be there i learn the wish of the neapolitan and enlist myself in he service i swear to he senator of venice to be true -- to die in he cause should it be necessary and to help he to he bride this pledge have i redeem the happy lover be now in the state of the church and under the puissant protection of the cardinal secretary don camillo 's mother 's brother fool why do ` st thou this have ` st thou no thought for thyself eccellenza but little i think more of find a human bosom to pour out my suffering to than of you high displeasure i have not know so sweet a moment in year as that in which i see the lord of sant ' agata fold he beautiful and weep bride to he heart the inquisitor be strike with the quiet enthusiasm of the bravo and surprise once more hold they in suspense at length the elder of the three resume the examination wilt thou impart the manner of this escape jacopo he demand remember thou hast still a life to redeem signora it be scarce worth the trouble but to do you pleasure nothing shall be conceal jacopo then recount in simple and undisguised term the entire means employ by don camillo in effect he escape -- he hope he disappointment and he final success in this narrative nothing be conceal but the place in which the lady have temporarily take refuge and the name of gelsomina even the attempt of giacomo gradenigo on the life of the neapolitan and the agency of the hebrew be fully expose none listen to this explanation so intently as the young husband notwithstanding he public duty he pulse quicken as the prisoner dwell on the different chance of the lover and when they final union be proclaim he feel he heart bind with delight on the other hand he more practiced colleague hear the detail of the bravo with politic coolness the effect of all factitious system be to render the feeling subservient to expediency convention and fiction take place of passion and truth and like the mussulman with he doctrine of predestination there be no one more acquiescent in defeat than he who have obtain a advantage in the face of nature and justice he resignation be in common as perfect as he previous arrogance be insupportable the two old senator perceive at once that don camillo and he fair companion be completely beyond the reach of they power and they instantly admit the wisdom of make a merit of necessity have no farther occasion for jacopo they summon the keeper and dismiss he to he cell it will be seemly to send letter of congratulation to the cardinal secretary on the union of he nephew with so rich a heiress of we city say the inquisitor of the ten as the door close on the retire group so great a interest as that of the neapolitan should be propitiate but should he urge the state 's resistance to he hope return the signor soranzo in feeble objection to so bold a scheme we will excuse it as the act of a former council these misconception be the unavoidable consequence of the caprice of liberty signora the steed that range the plain in the freedom of nature can not be hold to perfect command like the dull beast that draw the car this be the first of you sitting in the three but experience will show you that excellent as we be in system we be not quite perfect in practice this be grave matter of the young gradenigo signor i have long know he unworthiness return he more aged colleague it be a thousand pity that so honorable and so noble a patrician should have produce so ignoble a child but neither the state nor the city can tolerate assassination would it be less frequent exclaim the signora soranzo in perfect sincerity would it be indeed there be hint in we secret information which tend to confirm the charge of jacopo though long experience have teach we to put full faith in he report how be jacopo then a agent of the police of that more at we leisure signor soranzo at present we must look to this attempt on the life of one protect by we law the three then enter into a serious discussion of the case of the two delinquent venice like all despotic government have the merit of great efficiency in its criminal police when it be dispose to exert it justice be sure enough in those instance in which the interest of the government itself be not involve or in which bribery could not well be use as to the latter through the jealousy of the state and the constant agency of those who be remove from temptation by be already in possession of a monopoly of benefit it be by no means as frequent as in some other community in which the affluent be less interested the signor soranzo have now a fair occasion for the exercise of he generous feeling though related to the house of gradenigo he be not backward in decry the conduct of its heir he first impulse be to make a terrible example of the accuse and to show the world that no station bring with it in venice impunity for crime from this view of the case however he be gradually entice by he companion who remind he that the law commonly make a distinction between the intention and the execution of a offence drive from he first determination by the cooler head of he colleague the young inquisitor next propose that the case should be send to the ordinary tribunal for judgment instance have not be want in which the aristocracy of venice sacrifice one of its body to the seemliness of justice for when such case be manage with discretion they rather strengthen than weaken they ascendency but the present crime be know to be too common to permit so lavish a expenditure of they immunity and the old inquisitor oppose the wish of they younger colleague with great plausibility and with some show of reason it be finally resolve that they should themselves decide on the case the next question be the degree of punishment the wily senior of the council begin by propose a banishment for a few month for giacomo gradenigo be already obnoxious to the anger of the state on more account than one but this punishment be resist by the signor soranzo with the ardor of a uncorrupted and generous mind the latter gradually prevail he companion take care that they compliance should have the air of a concession to he argument the result of all this management be that the heir of gradenigo be condemn to ten year ' retirement in the province and hosea to banishment for life should the reader be of opinion that strict justice be not mete out to the offender he should remember that the hebrew ought to be glad to have escape as he do we must not conceal this judgment nor its motive observe the inquisitor of the ten when the affair be conclude the state be never a loser for let its justice be know nor for its exercise i should hope return the signor soranzo as we affair be end for the night be it you pleasure signori that we return to we palace nay we have this matter of jacopo he may we now surely turn over to the ordinary tribunal as you may decide signor be this you pleasure both the other bow assent and the usual preparation be make for departure ere the two senior of the council leave the palace however they hold a long and secret conference together the result be a private order to the criminal judge and then they return each to he own abode like man who have the approbation of they own conscience on the other hand the signor soranzo hasten to he own luxurious and happy dwelling for the first time in he life he enter it with a distrust of himself without be conscious of the reason he feel sad for he have take the first step in that tortuous and corrupting path which eventually lead to the destruction of all those generous and noble sentiment which can only flourish apart from the sophistry and fiction of selfishness he would have rejoice to have be as light of heart as at the moment he hand he fair-haired partner into the gondola that night but he head have press the pillow for many hour before sleep draw a veil over the solemn trifling with the most serious of you duty in which he have be a actor chapter xxix art thou not guilty no indeed i be not roger the follow morning bring the funeral of antonio the agent of the police take the precaution to circulate in the city that the senate permit this honor to the memory of the old fisherman on account of he success in the regatta and as some atonement for he unmerited and mysterious death all the man of the lagune be assemble in the square at the appoint hour in decent guise flatter with the notice that they craft receive and more than half disposed to forget they former anger in the present favor thus easy be it for those who be elevated above they fellow-creature by the accident of birth or by the opinion of a factitious social organization to repair the wrong they do in deed by small concession of they conventional superiority mass be still chant for the soul of old antonio before the altar of st mark foremost among the priest be the good carmelite who have scarce known hunger or fatigue in he pious desire to do the office of the church in behalf of one whose fate he might be say to have witness he zeal however in that moment of excitement pass unnoticed by all but those whose business it be to suffer no unusual display of character nor any unwonted circumstance to have place without attract they suspicion as the carmelite finally withdraw from the altar previously to the removal of the body he feel the sleeve of he robe slightly draw aside and yield to the impulse he quickly find himself among the column of that gloomy church alone with a stranger father thou hast shrive many a parting soul observe rather than ask the other it be the duty of my holy office son the state will note thy service there will be need of thee when the body of this fisherman be commit to the earth the monk shudder but make the sign of the cross he bow he pale face in signification of he

abandon thee without a effort jacopo receive this assurance like one accustomed to exist in extreme jeopardy the smile which accompany he own adieu have in it as much of incredulity as of melancholy it be however full of the joy of a lighten heart chapter xxx you heart be free and quick with virtuous wrath to accuse appearance and view a criminal in innocence 's shadow werner the carmelite and gelsomina find the keeper in wait and when they quit the cell its door be secure for the night as they have no further concern with the jailor they pass on unquestioned but when the end of the

three drowsy inferior officer of the household in wait one arise quickly at the unexpected appearance of these unknown visitor express by the surprise and the confusion of he eye the wonder into which he be throw by so unlooked-for guest he highness wait for we i fear simply observe father anselmo who have know how to quiet he concern in a look of passive courtesy santa marium holy father you

reign this be the last in whose favor i could have imagine there be aught to be say -- speak freely carmelite for curiosity be as strong as wonder so truly do the doge give utterance to he feeling that he momentarily forget the presence of the inquisitor whose countenance might have show he that the subject be get to be grave the monk ejaculate a thanksgiving for it be not always easy in that city of mystery to bring truth to the ear of the great when man live under a system of duplicity more or less of the quality get interwoven with the habit of the most ingenuous although they may remain themselves unconscious of the taint thus father anselmo as he proceed with the desire explanation touch more tenderly on the practice of the state and use more of reserve in allude to those

hear of some such accusation but it occur in the reign of the last doge do it not father and he have endure to near the close of the reign of this highness how the senate when apprise of the error of its judgment be not slow to repair the wrong the monk regard the prince earnestly as if he would make certain whether the surprise he witness be not a piece of consummate act he feel convinced that the affair be one of that class of act which however oppressive unjust and destructive of personal happiness have not sufficient importance to come before they who govern under system which care more for they own preservation than for the good of the rule signor doge he say the state be discreet in matter that touch its own reputation there be reason that i shall not presume to examine why the cell of poor francesco be keep close long after the death and confession of he accuser leave he innocence beyond dispute the prince muse and then he bethink he to consult the countenance of he companion the marble of the pilaster against which he lean be not more cold and unmoved than the face of the inquisitor the man have learn to smother every natural impulse in the assume and factitious

until they command the door of the cell to be secretly open to a child so pious i well know great prince that they who rule can not have all-seeing eye else could this wrong never have happen but
