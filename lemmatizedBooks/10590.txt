frontispiece by aubrey hammond and sixteen other illustration _ to edith and john cabourn preface lady mary wortley montagu have she niche in the history of medicine as have introduce inoculation from the near east into england but she principal fame be as a letter-writer of she gift as a correspondent she be proud and with reason it be in all sincerity that in June 1726 she write to she sister lady mar : the last pleasure that fall in my way be madame sévigné 's letter : very pretty they be but i assert without the least vanity that mine will be full as entertaining forty year hence i advise you therefore to put none of they to the use of waste paper and again later in the year she say half-humorously to the same correspondent : i writ to you some time ago a long letter which i perceive never come to you hand : very provoke it be certainly a _ chef d'oeuvre _ of a letter and worthy any of the sévigné 's or grignan 's cram with news that lady mary 's belief in herself be well found no one have dispute even horace walpole who detest she and make attack on she whenever possible say that in most of she letter the wit and style be superior to any letter i have ever read but madame de sévigné 's a very pleasant tribute from one who have a goodly conceit of himself as a letter-writer walpole as a correspondent be perhaps more sarcastic and more witty cowper undoubtedly more tender and more gentle but lady mary have quality all she own she have power of observation and the gift of description which quality be especially to be remark in the letter she write when abroad with she husband on he mission to the porte she have a ironic wit which give point to the many society scandal she narrate a happy knack of gossip and a style so easy as to make read a pleasure some of the incident which lady mary retail with so much humor may be accept as not outrage the convention of the early eighteenth century when it be customary to call a spade a spade when gallantry be gallantry indeed and the pursuit of it openly conduct what be not mention by those who have write about she be that she be possess of a particularly unsavoury strain of impropriety which outrage even the canon of she age some twenty year after she death it be mention in the _ gentleman 's magazine _ that dr young the author of _ night thought _ have a little before he death destroy a great number of she letter assign as a reason of he do so that they be too indecent for public inspection only the other day i have confirmation of this from a distinguished man of letter who write to I : i have somewhere hide away a copy of a letter by lady mary wortley montagu which be send to I by a well-known collector about thirty-five year ago because he could not destroy it and would not for world be find dead with it in he possession -- so terrific be it in character i 'll tell you about it some day when we meet : i can not write it in any case you could not use it or even refer to it i suppose that my friend quite feel that the document however objectionable should not on literary grounds be destroy what my executor will think of I for have it in my possession the devil only know whether this strain permeate the diary which lady mary left behind she when she elope in 1712 and which be destroy by one of she sister no one can say but it be a curious fact that the diary she keep in later year be destroy by she devoted daughter lady bute though lady bute always speak of lady mary with great respect write lady louisa stuart yet it might be perceive that she know it have be too much she custom to note down and enlarge upon all the scandalous rumor of the day without weigh they truth or even they probability to record as certain fact story that perhaps spring up like mushroom from the dirt and have as brief a existence but tend to defame person of the most spotless character in this age she say everything get into print sooner or later the name of lady mary wortley would be sure to attract curiosity and be such detail ever make public they would neither edify the world nor do honor to she memory lady bute hear that she mother 's letter be in existence and fearful of what they might contain purchase they it be know that when on she way to die as it prove in she own country lady mary give a copy of the letter to mr snowden minister of the english church at rotterdam attest the gift by she signature lady louisa stuart have write this show it be she wish that they should eventually be publish but lady bute hearing only that a number of she mother 's letter be in a stranger 's hand and have no certainty what they might be to whom address or how little of a private matter could not but earnestly desire to obtain they and readily pay the price demand -- five hundred pound in a few month she see they appear in print such be the fact and how it come about nobody at this time of day need either care or inquire with regard to other correspondence of lady mary sir robert walpole return to she the letter she have write to he second wife molly skerritt after the death of that lady and when lord hervey die he eldest son seal up and send she she letter with a assurance that he have read none of they to lord hervey 's heir lady louisa stuart have mention lady mary write a letter of thanks for he honorable conduct add that she could almost regret he have not glance he eye over a correspondence which would have show he what so young a man might perhaps be incline to doubt -- the possibility of a long and steady friendship subsist between two person of different sex without the least mixture of love much pleased with this letter he preserve it and when lady mary come to england show it to lady bute desire she would ask leave for he to visit she mother it be to be presume that lady mary or she daughter lady bute destroy these collection for she part lady mary return letter that she have receive from lord hervey but only those that belong to the last fourteen year of a acquaintance that have endure twice so long these be for the greater number platonic in character although there be a few phrase of a freer kind croker who edit lord hervey 's _ memoirs _ mention that hervey answer one of she letter in 1737 in which she have complain that she be too old to inspire passion after pay a compliment to she charm more gallant than decorous say : i should think anybody a great fool that say he like spring better than summer merely because it be further from autumn or that they love green fruit better than ripe only because it be further from be rotten i ever do and believe ever shall like woman best -- just in the noon of life -- those golden day when the mind ripen as the form decay lady mary be then in she forty-ninth year be six year hervey 's senior lady louisa stuart write in 1837 -- that be seventy-five year after the death of she grandmother lady mary -- write indignantly of the attack that have be make upon she ancestress the multitude of story circulate about she -- as about all people who be object of note in they day -- increase instead of lessen the difficulty she say some of these may be confidently pronounced invention simple and purely false some if true concern a different person some be ground upon egregious blunder and not a few upon jest mistake by the dull and literal for earnest other again where a little truth and a great deal of falsehood be probably intermingled nobody now live can pretend to confirm or contradict or unravel nothing be so readily believe yet nothing be usually so unworthy of credit as tale learn from report or catch up in casual conversation a circumstance carelessly tell carelessly listen to half comprehended and imperfectly remember have a poor chance of be repeat accurately by the first hearer but when after pass through the moulding of countless hand it come with time place and person gloriously confound into those of a bookmaker ignorant of all its bearing it will be lucky indeed if any trace of the original groundwork remain distinguishable lady mary 's most redoubtable assailant be pope and horace walpole and both be biass the story of pope 's quarrel with she be tell in the follow page walpole it have be suggest dislike she much because she have champion he father 's mistress molly skerritt against the mother to whom he be devoted pope of course know she well but walpole who be twenty-eight year she junior only meet she in she late middle age walpole 's prejudice be so great what when lady mary say people wish they enemy dead -- but i do not i say give they the gout give they the stone he report it solemnly of course it be not to be assume that lady mary have not she full share of malice -- she be undoubtedly well equip with that useful quality -- and she do not turn the other cheek when she be assail she could even stand up to the vitriolic sarah duchess of marlborough and stand up so effectively that they tacitly agree to a armed neutrality that verge perilously upon friendship the young duke of wharton sometimes beat she in open fight but she harbour no very angry feeling towards he as regard pope if it be not tit-for-tat with he at least she give he hard knock pope great poet as he be never play fair in war lady mary quite contrary she might have be dub for she be frequently

be so well employ i hardly dare offer you this trifle to look over but then so well be i acquaint with the sweetness of temper which accompany you learning i dare ever assure myself of a pardon you have already forgive I greater impertinency and condescend yet further in give I instruction and bestow some of you minute in teaching I this surprising humility have all the effect it ought to have on my heart i be sensible of the gratitude i owe to so much goodness and how much i be ever bind to be you servant here be the work of one week of my solitude -- by the many fault in it you lordship will easily believe i spend no more time upon it it be hardly finish when i be oblige to begin my journey and i have not leisure to write it over again you have it here without any correction with all its blot and error : i endeavor at no beauty of style but to keep as literally as i could to the sense of the author my only intention in present it be to ask you lordship whether i have understand epictetus the fourth chapter particularly i be afraid i have mistake piety and greatness of soul set you above all misfortune that can happen to yourself and the calumny of false tongue but that same piety which render what happen to yourself indifferent to you yet soften the natural compassion in you temper to the greatest degree of tenderness for the interest of the church and the liberty and welfare of you country : the step that be now make towards the destruction of both the apparent danger we be in the manifest growth of injustice oppression and hypocrisy can not do otherwise than give you lordship those hour of sorrow which do not you fortitude of soul and reflection from religion and philosophy shorten would add to the national misfortune by injure the health of so great a supporter of we sink liberty i ought to ask pardon for this digression it be more proper for I in this place to say something to excuse a address that look so very presuming my sex be usually forbid study of this nature and folly reckon so much we proper sphere we be sooner pardon any excess of that than the least pretension to reading or good sense we be permit no book but such as tend to the weakening and effeminating of the mind we natural defect be every way indulge and it be look upon as in a degree criminal to improve we reason or fancy we have any we be teach to place all we art in adorn we outward form and permit without reproach to carry that custom even to extravagancy while we mind be entirely neglect and by disuse of reflection fill with nothing but the trifling object we eye be daily entertain with this custom so long establish and industriously uphold make it even ridiculous to go out of the common road and force one to find as many excuse as if it be a thing altogether criminal not to play the fool in concert with other woman of quality whose birth and leisure only serve to render they the most useless and most worthless part of the creation there be hardly a character in the world more despicable or more liable to universal ridicule than that of a learn woman those word imply accord to the receive sense a talk impertinent vain and conceited creature i believe nobody will deny that learning may have this effect but it must be a very superficial degree of it erasmus be certainly a man of great learning and good sense and he seem to have my opinion of it when he say _ foemina quus _ -lrb- sic -rrb- _ vere sapit non videtur sibus sapere contra quae cum nihil sapiat sibi videtur sapere ea demum bis stulta est _ the abbé bellegarde give a right reason for woman 's talk overmuch : they know nothing and every outward object strike they imagination and produce a multitude of thought which if they know more they would know not worth they

superior sex and any woman who suffer she vanity and folly to deny this rebel against the law of the creator and indisputable order of nature but there be a worse effect than this which follow the careless education give to woman of quality its be so easy for any man of sense that find it either he interest or he pleasure to corrupt they the common method be to begin by attack they religion : they bring they a thousand fallacious argument which they excessive ignorance hinder they from refute : and i speak now from my own knowledge and conversation among they there be more atheist among the fine lady than the loosest sort of rake and the same ignorance that generally work out into excess of superstition expose they to the snare of any who have a fancy to carry they to t ` other

and in favor with the leader of he party he sit in the house of common from 1705 to 1713 as member for huntingdon where there be family interest it be not however until after the accession of george i that he hold office at first it may be montagu take some kind of paternal interest in lady mary this attitude do not long endure when the change in he feeling take place there be no means of know he do not seem to have be a passionate man nor a very ardent lover but there be no doubt that at this period he inspire the girl with a very real devotion and respect even though perhaps she heart be not deeply engage montagu would have have the girl find she pleasure exclusively in book and in he own conversation she at the age of twenty on the other hand be full of the joy of life and like the various social pleasure that come she way naturally she try the effect of she good look and wit on man in fact she be fond of flirt and as it must probably have be impossible to flirt with montagu she indulge herself in that agreeable pastime with more than one other -- to the great annoyance of that pompous prig of a admirer of hers the following letter date September 5 1709 write to anne wortley for she brother 's perusal be clearly a endeavor to sooth away the man 's jealousy September 5 1709 my dear mr wortley as she have the entire power of raise can also with a word calm my passion the kindness of you last recompense I for the injustice of you former letter but you can not sure be angry at my little resentment you have read that a man who with patience hear himself call heretic can never be esteem a good christian to be capable of prefer the despicable wretch you mention to mr wortley be as ridiculous if not as criminal as forsake the deity to worship a calf do not tell I any body ever have so mean a opinion of my inclination ` tis among the number of those thing i would forget my tenderness be always build upon my esteem and when the foundation perish it fall : i must own i think it be so with every body -- but enough of this : you tell I it be mean for raillery -- be not the kindness mean so too i fear i be too apt to think what be amusement design in earnest -- no matter ` tis for my repose to be deceive and i will believe whatever you tell I i should be very glad to be inform of a right method or whether there be such a thing alone but be afraid to ask the question it may be reasonably call presumption in a girl to have she thought that way you be the only creature that i have make my confidante in that case : i 'll assure you i call it the greatest secret of my life adieu my dear the post stay my next shall be longer lady mary be probably more complaisant on paper than actually in she conduct of life she desire male as well as female companionship she like the admiration and the flattery of man and no doubt do she best to evoke it it be strange however that with she beauty -- for that she be in she early year beautiful have generally be accept -- she be not unduly attractive to man it may be that she good look bring young man to she foot and that she tongue drive they away in no age have a clever woman be very popular with the other sex and in the early year of the eighteenth century when girl could do little more than read and write -- and not always so much -- wit such as hers and the readiness of reply with which she be gifted must have be a deterrent what could the ordinary social butterfly think of a lady mary who have as a friend mary ansell the author of a _ serious proposal to lady -- _ what though perhaps not one of they have read the book still there be enough levity in lady mary 's behavior in society for she to think it desirable to make some explanation to montagu -lrb- indorsed ' 9 April ' 1711 -rrb- i think to return no answer to you letter but i find i be not so wise as i think myself i can not forbear fix my mind a little on that expression though perhaps the only insincere one in you whole letter -- i would die to be secure of you heart though but for a moment : -- be this but true what be there i would not do to secure you i will state the case to you as plainly as i can and then ask yourself if you use I well i have shew in every action of my life a esteem for you that at least challenge a grateful regard i have trust my reputation in you hand i have make no scruple of give you under my own hand a assurance of my friendship after all this i exact nothing from you : if you find it inconvenient for you affair to take so small a fortune i desire you to sacrifice nothing to I i pretend no tie upon you honor : but in recompence for so clear and so disinterested a proceeding must i ever receive injury and ill usage i have not the usual pride of my sex i can bear be tell i be in the wrong but tell it I gently perhaps i have be indiscreet i come young into the hurry of the world a great innocence and a undesigning gaiety may possibly have be construe coquetry and a desire of be follow though never mean by I i can not answer for the -lrb- reflection -rrb- that may be make on I : all who be malicious attack the careless and defenceless : i own myself to be both i not anything i can say more to shew my perfect desire of please you and make you easy than to proffer to be confine with you in what manner you please would any woman but I renounce all the world for one or would any man but you be insensible of such a proof of sincerity from a early age lady mary indulge she somewhat mordant humor not less in she letter than in she conversation and as that quality must have some subject upon which to exercise itself she be generally on the look-out for some tit-bit of scandal which she could relate in she own inimitable manner next to the great ball what make the most noise be the marriage of a old maid who live in this street without a portion to a man of # 7000 _ per annum _ and they say # 40000 in ready money she write to mr hewet about the beginning of 1709 she equipage and livery outshine anybody 's in town he have present she with # 3000 in jewel and never be man more smitten with these charm that have lie invisible for these forty year but with all he glory never bride have fewer envier the dear beast of a man be so filthy frightful odious and detestable i would turn away such a footman for fear of spoil my dinner while he wait at table they be marry on Friday and come to church _ en parade _ on Sunday i happen to sit in the pew with they and have the honor of see mr bride fall fast asleep in the middle of the sermon and snore very comfortably which make several woman in the church think the bridegroom not quite so ugly as they do before envious people say 'twa all counterfeit to please he but i believe that to be scandal for i dare swear nothing but downright necessity could make she miss one word of the sermon he profess to have marry she for she devotion patience meekness and other christian virtue he observe in she he first wife -lrb- who have leave no child -rrb- be very handsome and so good natured as to have venture she own salvation to secure he he have marry this lady to have a companion in that paradise where he first have give he a title i believe i have give you too much of this couple but they be not to be comprehend in few word here be another malicious story that appeal to lady mary 's wayward fancy mr braithwayte a yorkshire beauty she write to the same correspondent in march 1712 who have be but two day marry to a mr coleman run out of bed _ en chemise _ and she husband follow she in he in which pleasant dress they run as far as st jame 's street where they meet with a chair and prudently cram themselves both into it observe the rule of divide the good and bad fortune of this life resolve to run all hazard together and order the chairman to carry they both away perfectly represent both in love and nakedness and want of eye to see that they be naked we first happy parent Sunday last i have the pleasure of hear the whole history from the lady 's own mouth love-affair other people 's love-affair anyhow have a attraction for lady mary you talk of the duke of leed she write i hear that he have place he heroic love upon the bright charm of a pewterer 's wife and after a long amour and many perilous adventure have steal the fair lady which in spite of he wrinkle and grandchild persuade people of he youth and gallantry the nobleman in question peregrine osborne second duke of leed be then fifty-six -- which after all regard from the standpoint of to-day be not such a great age as be suggest by the story if montagu object to the indiscretion of lady mary it do not appear that he be in any hurry to get marry to she of course it may be -- it be only fair to he to say -- that lady mary hold he temporarily at bay prefer the frivolity of those of she own age to the austere attention of one who act as if he might have be she father for some year she and montagu be apparently content with write long letter to each other when they be not both in town when the correspondence start be uncertain the first letter of lady mary that have be preserve be date thoresby may 2 1709 but there can be no doubt that they have be in regular communication before then it be specially to be note that the earlier letter of lady mary be address to montagu 's sister anne it be evident however that they be definitely write for he perusal and it be equally clear that anne 's reply be inspire and sometimes if not always draft by he this practice continue until the death of anne wortley in march 1710 yet there seem to have be no reason for this camouflage in 1709 lady mary be twenty year of age and montagu be a very eligible _ partus _ the respectful highfalutin gallantry that be the key-note of the correspondence recall the correspondence that presently be exchange between henrietta howard countess of suffolk and the octogenarian earl of peterborough some typical passage from the letter to my dear mr wortley may be give -- it should be mention that it be the social custom of the day to address as mr maiden lady as well as married woman thoresby August 8 1709 i know no pretence i have to you good opinion but my hearty desire it i wish i have that imagination you talk of to render I a fitter correspondent for you who can write so well on every thing i be now so much alone i have leisure to pass whole day in reading but be not at all proper for so delicate a employment as choose you book you own fancy will better direct you my study at present be nothing but dictionary and grammar i be try whether it be possible to learn without a master i be not certain -lrb- and dare hardly hope -rrb- i shall make any great progress but i find the study so divert i be not only easy but pleased with the solitude that indulge it i forget there be such a place as london and wish for no company but yours you see my dear in make my pleasure consist of these unfashionable diversion i be not of the number who can not be easy out of the mode i believe more folly be commit out of complaisance to the world than in follow we own inclination -- nature be seldom in the wrong custom always it be with some regret i follow it in all the impertinency of dress the compliance be so trivial it comfort I but i be amaze to see it consult even in the most important occasion of we life and that people of good sense in other thing can make they happiness consist in the opinion of other and sacrifice every thing in the desire of appear in fashion i call all people who fall in love with furniture clothes and equipage of this number and i look upon they as no less in the wrong than when they be five year old and doat on shell pebble and hobby-horse : i believe you will expect this letter to be date from the other world for sure i be you never hear a inhabitant of this talk so before i suppose you expect too i should conclude with beg pardon for this extreme tedious and very nonsensical letter quite contrary i think you will be oblige to I for it i could not better show my great concern for you reproach I with neglect i know myself innocent of than prove myself mad in three page August 21 1709 i be infinitely oblige to you my dear mr wortley for the wit beauty and other fine quality you so generously bestow upon I next to receive they from heaven you be the person from whom i would chuse to receive gift and grace : i be very well satisfied to owe they to you own delicacy of imagination which represent to you the idea of a fine lady and you have good nature enough to fancy i be she all this be mighty well but you do not stop there imagination be boundless after give I imaginary wit and beauty you give I imaginary passion and you tell I i be in love : if i be ` tis a perfect sin of ignorance for i do not so much as know the man 's name : i have be study these three hour and can not guess who you mean i pass the day of nottingham race -lrb- at -rrb- thoresby without see or even wish to see one of the sex now if i be in love i have very hard fortune to conceal it so industriously from my own knowledge and yet discover it so much to other people ` tis against all form to have such a passion as that without give one sigh for the matter pray tell I the name of he i love that i may -lrb- accord to the laudable custom of lover -rrb- sigh to the wood and grove hereabouts and teach it to the echo you see be i be _ -lrb- sic -rrb- _ in love i be willing to be so in order and rule : i have be turn over god know how many book to look for precedent recommend a example to I and above all let I know whether ` tis most proper to walk in the wood encrease the wind with my sigh or to sit by a purling stream swell the rivulet with my tear may be both may do well in they turn : -- but to be a minute serious what do you mean by this reproach of inconstancy i confess you give I several good quality i have not and i be ready to thank you for they but then you must not take away those few i have no i will never exchange they take back the beauty and wit you bestow upon I leave I my own mediocrity of agreeableness and genius but leave I also my sincerity my constancy and my plain deal ` tis all i have to recommend I to the esteem either of other or myself how should i despise myself if i could think i be capable of either inconstancy or deceit i know not how i may appear to other people nor how much my face may belie my heart but i know that i never be or can be guilty of dissimulation or inconstancy -- you will think this vain but ` tis all that i pique myself upon tell I you believe I and repent of you harsh censure tell it I in pity to my uneasiness for you be one of those few people about whose good opinion i be in pain i have always take so little care to please the generality of the world that i be never mortified or delighted by its report which be a piece of stoicism bear with I but i can not be one minute easy while you think ill of you faithful -- this letter be a good deal grave and like other grave thing dull but i will not ask pardon for what i can not help be the sentiment express in the follow letter write about the same time as that print above intend for anne or she brother or both when i say it cost nothing to write tenderly i believe i speak of another sex i be sure not of myself : ` tis not in my power -lrb- i would to god it be -rrb- to hide a kindness where i have one or dissemble it where i have none i can not help answer you letter this minute and tell you i infinitely love you though it may be you 'll call the one impertinence and the other dissimulation but you may think what you please of I i must eternally think the same thing of you lady mary be occasionally wearisome owe to the reiteration of the assurance that she believe she letter to be dull the more so as she certainly be conscious of the skill with which she compose they what do you mean by complain i never write to you in the quiet situation of mind i do to other people she ask anne wortley my dear people never write calmly but when they write indifferently after a letter dated September 5 1709 a passage from which have be print here there be a break in the -lrb- preserved -rrb- correspondence in the spring of the following year anne wortley die and lady mary on march 28 pay tribute to she depart friend address herself for the first time direct to montagu perhaps you 'll be surprize at this letter i have have many debate with myself before i could resolve on it i know it be not act in form but i do not look upon you as i do upon the rest of the world and by what i do for _ you _ you be not to judge my manner of act with other you be brother to a woman i tenderly love my protestation of friendship be not like other people 's i never speak but what i mean and when i say i love ` tis for ever i have that real concern for mr wortley i look with some regard on every one that be related to she this and my long acquaintance with you may in some measure excuse what i be now do i be surprize at one of the ` tatler ' you send I be it possible to have any sort of esteem for a person one believe capable of have such trifling inclination mr bickerstaff have very wrong notion of we sex i can say there be some of we that despise charm of show and all the pageantry of greatness perhaps with more ease than any of the philosopher in contemn the world they seem to take pain to contemn it we despise it without take the pain to read lesson of morality to make we do it at least i know i have always look upon it with contempt without be at the expense of one serious reflection to oblige I to it i carry the matter yet farther be i to choose of two thousand pound a year or twenty thousand the first would be my choice there be something of a unavoidable _ embarras _ in make what be call a great figure in the world -lrb- it -rrb- take off from the happiness of life i hate the noise and hurry inseparable from great estate and title and look upon both as blessing that ought only to be give to fool for ` tis only to they that they be blessing the pretty fellow you speak of i own entertain I sometimes but be it impossible to be divert with what one despise i can laugh at a puppet-show at the same time i know there be nothing in it worth my attention or regard general notion be generally wrong ignorance and folly be think the best foundation for virtue as if not know what a good wife be be necessary to make one so i confess that can never be my way of reasoning as i always forgive a _ injury _ when i think it not do out of malice i never think myself _ oblige _ by what be do without design lady mary who be now one-and-twenty be no bread-and-butter miss she know she mind and have the gift to express herself and in this same letter she very prettily rebuke she laggard lover give I leave to say it -lrb- i know it sound vain -rrb- i know how to make a man of sense happy but then that man must resolve to contribute something towards it himself i have so much esteem for you i should be very sorry to hear you be unhappy but for the world i would not be the instrument of make you so which -lrb- of the humor you be -rrb- be hardly to be avoid if i be you wife you distrust I -- i can neither be easy nor love where i be distrust nor do i believe you passion for I be what you pretend it at least i be sure be i in love i could not talk as you do few woman would have speak so plainly as i have do but to dissemble be among the thing i never do i take more pain to approve my conduct to myself than to the world and would not have to accuse myself of a minute 's deceit i wish i love you enough to devote myself to be for ever miserable for the pleasure of a day or two 's happiness i can not resolve upon it you must think otherwise of I or not at all i do not enjoin you to burn this letter she say in conclusion i know you will ` ti the first i ever writ to one of you sex and shall be the last you must never expect another i resolve against all correspondence of the kind -- my resolution be seldom make and never break whatever happen to most of lady mary 's resolution this one at least be not keep actually lady mary be not quite so emancipate at this time of she life as she may have imagine she never send a letter except in fear and tremble i hazard a great deal if it fall into other hand and i write for all that be she constant cry yet there be nothing in the correspondence save the fact of it to offend even a most austere maiden aunt of the day the correspondence of course continue the lover if so they can be call now indulge in a slightly acid academic discussion or rather a number of slightly acid academic discussion about marriage it be evident that montagu hold strong view as to the duty of a wife so undoubtedly do lady mary -- only the trouble be the view be by no means identical if he be determine to set himself up as the strong loquacious man he _ fiancée _ be certainly not prepared meekly to obey he behest in silence they indulge in a somewhat candid examination of each other 's character -- and of they own it be really rather amusing this careful cold-blooded dissection of they feeling it be a safe guess that at this game lady mary score heavily i wish with all my soul i think as you do she write on April 25 1710 i endeavor to convince myself by you argument and be sorry my reason be so obstinate not to be delude into a opinion that ` tis impossible a man can esteem a woman i suppose i should then be very easy at you thought of I i should thank you for the wit and beauty you give I and not be angry at the folly and weakness but to my infinite affliction i can believe neither one nor t ` other one part of my character be not so good nor t ` other so bad as you fancy it should we ever live together you would be disappoint both way you would find a easy equality of temper you do not expect and a thousand fault you do not imagine you think if you marry I i should be passionately fond of you one month and of somebody else the next : neither would happen i can esteem i can be a friend but i do not know whether i can love expect all that be complaisant and easy but never what be fond in I you judge very wrong of my heart when you suppose I capable of view of interest and that anything could oblige I to flatter any body be i the most indigent creature in the world i should answer you as i do now without add or diminish i be incapable of art and ` tis because i will not be capable of it could i deceive one minute i should never regain my own good opinion and who could bear to live with one they despise if you can resolve to live with a companion that will have all the deference due to you superiority of good sense and that you proposal can be agreeable to those on whom i depend i have nothing to say against they chapter iii courtship elopement and marriage -lrb- 1710-1712 -rrb- a lengthy courtship -- montagu a laggard lover -- lady mary and montagu exchange view on married life -- montagu propose for she to lord dorchester -- dorchester refuse since montagu will not make settlement -- montagu 's view on settlement express -lrb- by steele -rrb- in the _ tatler _ -- although not engage the young people continue to correspond -- lord dorchester produce another suitor for he daughter -- she consent to a engagement -- the preparation for the wedding -- she confide the whole story to montagu -- she break off the engagement -- she and montagu decide to elope -- she run up to london -- marriage -- lady mary 's diary destroy by she sister lady france pierrepont after seven year or so of acquaintance matter at last look like come to a head it would appear that montagu tentatively at least have put the question because lady mary give she view as to the life they should lead after marriage she be not averse from travel she have no objection to leave london in fact she would be willing to spend a few month in the country if it so pleased he it be all so extraordinarily unloverlike there be too much philosophy about it love do not see so clearly where people be tie for life ` tis they mutual interest not to grow weary of one another she write on April 25 1710 if i have all the personal charm that i want a face be too slight a foundation for happiness you would be soon tired with see every day the same thing where you see nothing else you would have leisure to remark all the defect which would increase in proportion as the novelty lessen which be always a great charm i should have the displeasure of see a coldness which though i could not reasonably blame you for be involuntary yet it would render I uneasy and the more because i know a love may be revive which absence inconstancy or even infidelity have extinguish but there be no return from a _ dégout _ give by satiety perhaps lady mary believe that while it be well to hope for the best it be sound policy to prepare for the worst montagu may have find some comfort in the lady 's assurance that if she have a choice between two thousand a year or twenty thousand a year she would choose the smaller income a apartment in london would satisfy lady mary she would not choose to live in a crowd but would like to have a small circle of agreeable people -- she be very precise as to she desire : actually she want to see eight or nine pleasant folk she do not believe that she can find entire happiness in solitude not even -lrb- or perhaps especially not -rrb- in a solitude of two and she be at least as sure that he would not either anyhow she have not the slightest intention of take the chance it become increasingly clear that she have have about enough of this epistolary philandering and she indicate this in no uncertain manner i will never think of anything without the consent of my family she write make no answer to this if you can like I on my own term ` tis not to I you must make the proposal if not to what purpose be we correspondence and now come a touch of the spur : however preserve I you friendship which i think of with a great deal of pleasure if ever you see I married i flatter myself you 'll see a conduct you would not be sorry you wife should imitate even this do not bring montagu to the point of ask lord dorchester for the hand of he daughter the correspondence however still continue and soon they be hard at it again kindness you say would be you destruction she write in August 1710 in my opinion this be something contradictory to some other expression people talk of be in love just as widow do of affliction mr steele have observe in one of he play the most passionate among they have always calmness enough to drive a hard bargain with the upholder i never know a lover that would not willingly secure he interest as well as he mistress or if one must be abandon have not the prudence -lrb- among all he distraction -rrb- to consider a woman be but a woman and money be a thing of more real merit than the whole sex put together you letter be to tell I you should think yourself undo if you marry I but if i would be so tender as to confess i should break my heart if you do not then you would consider whether you would or no but yet you hope you should not i take this to be the right interpretation of -- even you kindness can not destroy I of a sudden -- i hope i be not in you power -- i would give a good deal to be satisfied & c as to write -- that any woman would do that thought she writ well now i say no woman of common sense would at best ` tis but do a silly thing well and i think it be much better not to do a silly thing at all you compare it to dress suppose the comparison just : perhaps the spanish dress would become my face very well yet the whole town would condemn I for the highest extravagance if i go to court in it though it improve I to a miracle there be a thousand thing not ill in themselves which custom make unfit to be do this be to convince you i be so far from applaud my own conduct my conscience fly in my face every time i think o not the generality of the world have a great indulgence to they own folly : without be a jot wiser than my neighbor i have the peculiar misfortune to know and condemn all the wrong thing i do you beg to know whether i would not be out of humor the expression be modest enough but that be not what you mean in say i could be easy i have already say i should not be out of humor : but you would have I say i be violently in love that be find you think better of I than you desire you would have I give you a just cause to contemn I i doubt much whether there be a creature in the world humble enough to do that i should not think you more unreasonable if you be in love with my face and ask I to disfigure it to make you easy i have hear of some nun that make use of that expedient to secure they own happiness but amongst all the popish saint and martyr i never read of one whose charity be sublime enough to make themselves deform or ridiculous to restore they lover to peace and quietness in short if nothing can content you but despise I heartily i be afraid i shall be always so barbarous to wish you may esteem I as long as you live at last montagu formally approach lord dorchester who have no objection whatever to he as a suitor for the hand of lady mary they could not come to term in the matter of settlement dorchester demand that the estate should be put into entail also he desire that he future son-in-law should provide a town residence for lady mary this do not seem unreasonable but montagu do not see he way to agree to they he be willing enough to make all proper provision for he wife but he decline absolutely to settle he land property upon a son who as he put it for aught he know might prove unworthy to inherit it who might be a spendthrift a idiot or a villain -- as a matter of fact the only son of the marriage turn out most thing he should not anyhow montagu hold strong view on the subject and these he expound to richard steele who present they in no 223 of the _ tatler _ -lrb- September 12 1710 -rrb- that this method of make settlement be first invent by a gripe lawyer who make use of the covetous temper of the parent of each side to force two young people into these vile measure of diffidence for no other end but to increase the skin of parchment by which they be put into each other 's possession out of each other 's power the law of we country have give a ample and generous provision for the wife even the third of she husband 's estate and leave to she good-humour and he gratitude the expectation of farther provision but the fantastical method of go farther with relation to the heir have a foundation in nothing but pride and folly : for as all man with they child as like themselves and as much better as they can possibly it seem monstrous that we should give out of ourselves the opportunity of rewarding and discourage they accord to they defect the wife institution have no more sense in it than if a man should begin a deed with ` whereas no man living know how long he shall continue to be a reasonable creature or a honest man and whereas ib be go to enter into the state of matrimony with mr d therefore i shall from henceforth make it indifferent to I whether from this time forward i shall be a fool or knave and therefore in full and perfect health of body and a sound mind not know which of my child will prove better or worse i give to my first-born be he perverse ungrateful impious or cruel the lump and bulk of my estate and leave one year 's purchase only to each of my younger child whether they shall be brave or beautiful modest or honorable from the time of the date hereof wherein i resign my sens and hereby promise to employ my judgment no farther in the distribution of my worldly goods from the date hereof hereby farther confess and covenant that i be henceforth married and dead in law ' how strangely man be sometimes partial to themselves appear by the rapine of he that have a daughter 's beauty under he direction he will make no scruple of use it to force from she lover as much of he estate as be worth ten thousand pound and at the same time as a justice on the bench will spare no pain to get a man hang that have take but a horse from he it be to be hope that the legislature will in due time take this kind of robbery into consideration and not suffer man to prey upon each other when they be about make the most solemn league and enter into the strictest bond the only sure remedy be to fix a certain rate on every woman 's fortune one price for that of a maid and another for that of a widow : for it be of infinite advantage that there should be no fraud or uncertainty in the sale of we woman unless montagu be tactless beyond the general the position as regard himself and lord dorchester must indeed have be hopeless before he inspire the paper in the _ tatler _ on settlement anyhow montagu who be use to have he way and be probably very cross at be thwart on this occasion would not yield a step and lord dorchester maintain he attitude that philosophic theory be all very well in they way but he would not sanction a marriage that involve the risk of he grandchild be leave beggar lady mary be powerless in the matter but although she father say there be no engagement between she and montagu the young people continue they correspondence with unabated vigor i be go to comply with you request and write with all the plainness i be capable of she reply in November 1710 to one of montagu 's effusion i know what may be say upon such a proceeding but be sure you will not say it why should you always put the worst construction upon my word believe I what you will but do not believe i can be ungenerous or ungrateful i wish i could tell you what answer you will receive from some people or upon what term if my opinion could sway nothing should displease you nobody ever be so disinterested as i be i would not have to reproach myself -lrb- i do not suppose you would -rrb- that i have any way make you uneasy in you circumstance let I beg you -lrb- which i do with the utmost sincerity -rrb- only to consider yourself in this affair and since i be so unfortunate to have nothing in my own disposal do not think i have any hand in make settlement people in my way be sell like slave and i can not tell what price my master will put on I if you do agree i shall endeavor to contribute as much as lie in my power to you happiness i so heartily despise a great figure i have no notion of spend money so foolishly though one have a great deal to throw away if this break off i shall not complain of you : and as whatever happen i shall still preserve the opinion you have behave yourself well let I entreat you if i have commit any folly to forgive they and be so just to think i would not do a ill thing shortly afterwards lady mary write again to montagu i have try to write plainly she say and she do not have to reproach herself with failure it have now come to a struggle for mastery and she would not yield a foot of she ground indeed i do not at all wonder that absence and variety of new face should make you forget I but i be a little surprised at you curiosity to know what pass in my heart -lrb- a thing wholly insignificant to you -rrb- except you propose to yourself a piece of ill-natured satisfaction in find I very much disquiet pray which way would you see into my heart you can frame no guess about it from either my speaking or write and suppose i should attempt to show it you i know no other way i begin to be tire of my humility : i have carry my complaisance to you farther than i ought you make new scruple you have a great deal of fancy and you distrust be all of you own making be more immovable than if there be some real ground for they we aunt and grandmother always tell we that man be a sort of animal that if they be constant ` tis only where they be ill use 'twa a kind of paradox i could never believe : experience have teach I the truth of it you be the first i ever have a correspondence with and i thank god i have do with it for all my life you need not to have tell I you be not what you have be : one must be stupid not to find a difference in you letter you seem in one part of you last to excuse yourself from have do I any injury in point of fortune do i accuse you of any i have not spirit to dispute any longer with you you say you be not yet determine : let I determine for you and save you the trouble of write again adieu for ever make no answer i wish among the variety of acquaintance you may find some one to please you and can not help the vanity of think should you try they all you will not find one that will be so sincere in they treatment though a thousand more deserving and every one happier ` tis a piece of vanity and injustice i never forgive in a woman to delight to give pain what must i think of a man that take pleasure in make I uneasy after the folly of let you know it be in you power i ought in prudence to let this go no farther except i think you have good nature enough never to make use of that power i have no reason to think so : however i be willing you see to do you the highest obligation ` tis possible for I to do that be to give you a fair occasion of be rid of I there be now another break in the -lrb- preserved -rrb- correspondence until the end of February 1711 and then lady mary write with more than a tinge of bitterness break off all relation with he -- or at least affect to do so i intend to make no answer to you letter it be something very ungrateful and i resolve to give over all thought of you i could easily have perform that resolve some time ago but then you take pain to please I now you have bring I to esteem you you make use of that esteem to give I uneasiness and i have the displeasure of see i esteem a man that dislike I farewell then : since you will have it so i renounce all the idea i have so long flattered myself with and will entertain my fancy no longer with the imaginary pleasure of please you how much wiser be all those woman i have despise than myself in place they happiness in trifle they have place it in what be attainable i fondly think fine clothes and gilt coach ball opera and public adoration rather the fatigue of life and that true happiness be justly define by mr dryden -lrb- pardon the romantic air of repeat verse -rrb- when he say ` whom heav 'n would bless it do from pomp remove and make they wealth in privacy and love ' these notion have corrupt my judgment as much as mr biddy tipkin 's accord to this scheme i propose to pass my life with you i yet do you the justice to believe if any man could have be contented with this manner of live it would have be you you indifference to I do not hinder I from think you capable of tenderness and the happiness of friendship but i find it be not to I you 'll ever have they you think I all that be detestable you accuse I of want of sincerity and generosity to convince you of you mistake i 'll show you the last extreme of both while i foolishly fancy you love I -lrb- which i confess i have never any great reason for more than that i wish it -rrb- there be no condition of life i could not have be happy in with you so very much i like you -- i may say loved since it be the last thing i 'll ever say to you this be tell you sincerely my greatest weakness and now i will oblige you with a new proof of generosity -- i 'll never see you more i shall avoid all public place and this be the last letter i shall send if you write be not displeased if i send it back unopened i force my inclination to oblige yours and remember that you have tell I i could not oblige you more than by refuse you have i intend ever to see you again i durst not have send this letter adieu the above letter be evidently send in a fit of pique certainly the position must have be almost unbearable to a young woman of spirit here be lady mary in she twenty-second or twenty-third year for all practical purpose betroth and she father and she lover quarrel over settlement she friend be all get married and have establishment of they own and she more or less in disgrace living at one or other of she father 's house nothing come of she announcement that she desire no further relation with montagu she could not bring herself definitely to break with montagu and he would neither wed she nor give she up the correspondence continue with unabated vigor i be in pain about the letter i send you this morning she write in march 1911 i fear you should think after what i have say you can not in point of honor break off with I be not scrupulous on that article nor affect to make I break first to excuse you do it i would owe nothing but to inclination : if you do not love I i may have the less esteem of myself but not of you : i be not of the number of those woman that have the opinion of they person mr baye have of he play that ` tis the touchstone of sense and they be to frame they judgment of people 's understand accord to what they think of they you may have wit good humor and good nature and not like I i allow a great deal for the inconstancy of mankind in general and my own want of merit in particular but ` tis a breach at least of the two last to deceive I i be sincere : i shall be sorry if i be not now what please but if i -lrb- as i could with joy -rrb- abandon all thing to the care of please you i be then undo if i do not succeed -- be generous it be about this time that she confide she trouble to mr hewet at present my domestic affair go on so ill i want spirit to look round she write i have get a cold that disable my eye and disorder I every other way mr mason have order I blood to which i have submit after long contestation you see how stupid i be i entertain you with discourse of physic but i have the oddest jumble of disagreeable thing in my head that ever plague poor mortal a great cold a bad peace people i love in disgrace sore eye the horrid prospect of a civil war and the thought of a filthy potion to take i believe nobody ever have such a _ mélange _ before the unsatisfactory situation apparently might have continue indefinitely for even if montagu have be more pressing lady mary in spite of she independent attitude be most reluctant indeed almost determine not to marry without she father 's consent in the early summer of 1712 however lord dorchester create a crisis think perhaps that he daughter might one day get out of hand and in despair defy he he decide to find she a husband other than montagu at first from a sense of weariness and from filial duty lady mary inclined to obey the parental injunction -- to she father 's great delight all the preparation for the wedding be put in train -- then ultimately lady mary declare that she could not and would not go through with it on any term who the bridegroom be she do not mention but in a manner somewhat involve she in a letter in July 1912 confide the whole story to montagu i be go to write you a plain long letter what i have already tell you be nothing but the truth i have no reason to believe i be go to be otherwise confine than by my duty but i that know my own mind know that be enough to make I miserable i see all the misfortune of marry where it be impossible to love i be go to confess a weakness may perhaps add to you contempt of I i want courage to resist at first the will of my relation but as every day add to my fear those at last grow strong enough to make I venture the disoblige they a harsh word damp my spirit to a degree of silencing all i have to say i know the folly of my own temper and take the method of write to the disposer of I i say everything in this letter i think proper to move he and proffer in atonement for not marry whom he would never to marry at all he do not think fit to answer this letter but send for I to he he tell I he be very much surprize that i do not depend on he judgment for my future happiness that he know nothing i have to complain of & c that he do not doubt i have some other fancy in my head which encourage I to this disobedience but he assure I if i refuse a settlement he have provide for I he give I he word whatever proposal be make he he would never so much as enter into a treaty with any other that if i found any hope upon he death i should find myself mistaken he never intend to leave I anything but a annuity of # 400 per annum that though another would proceed in this manner after i have give so just a pretence for it yet he have -lrb- the -rrb- goodness to leave my destiny yet in my own choice and at the same time command I to communicate my design to my relation and ask they advice as hard as this may sound it do not shock my resolution i be please to think at any price i have it in my power to be free from a man i hate i tell my intention to all my nearest relation i be surprise at they blame it to the greatest degree i be tell they be sorry i would ruin myself but if i be so unreasonable they could not blame my f -lrb- father -rrb- whatever he inflict on I i object i do not love he they make answer they find no necessity of loving if i live well with he that be all be require of I and that if i consider this town i should find very few woman in love with they husband and yet a many happy it be in vain to dispute with such prudent people they look upon I as a little romantic and i find it impossible to persuade they that live in london at liberty be not the height of happiness however they could not change my thought though i find i be to expect no protection from they when i be to give my final answer to -- i tell he that i prefer a single life to any other and if he please to permit I i would take that resolution he reply he could not hinder my resolution but i should not pretend after that to please he since please he be only to be do by obedience that if i would disobey i know the consequence he would not fail to confine I where i might repent at leisure that he have also consult my relation and find they all agree in he sentiment he speak this in a manner hinder my answering i retire to my chamber where i writ a letter to let he know my aversion to the man propose be too great to be overcome that i should be miserable beyond all thing could be imagine but i be in he hand and he might dispose of I as he think fit he be perfectly satisfy with this answer and proceed as if i have give a willing consent -- i forget to tell you he name you and say if i think that way i be very much mistaken that if he have no other engagement yet he would never have agree to you proposal have no inclination to see he grandchild beggar i do not speak this to endeavor to alter you opinion but to shew the improbability of he agree to it i confess i be entirely of you mind i reckon it among the absurdity of custom that a man must be oblige to settle he whole estate on a eldest son beyond he power to recall whatever he prove to be and make himself unable to make happy a younger child that may deserve to be so if i have a estate myself i should not make such ridiculous settlement and i can not blame you for be in the right i have tell you all my affair with a plain sincerity i have avoid to move you compassion and i have say nothing of what i suffer and i have not persuade you to a _ treaty _ which i be sure my family will never agree to i can have no fortune without a entire obedience whatever you business be may it end to you satisfaction i think of the public as you do as little as _ that _ be a woman 's care it may be permit into the number of a woman 's fear but wretched as i be i have no more to fear for myself i have still a concern for my friend and i be in pain for you danger i be far from take ill what you say i never value myself as the daughter of -- and ever despise those that esteem I on that account with pleasure i could barter all that and change to be any country gentleman 's daughter that would have reason enough to make happiness in privacy my letter be too long i beg you pardon you may see by the situation of my affair ` tis without design the marriage with the gentleman unknown be thus call off -- to the very considerable anger of lord dorchester lord pierrepont write offer to come to she aid by represent to she father the hardship he be inflict by endeavor to force she inclination he go so far as to say that he would assist she to marry a man of moderate means if there be such a one in she heart she be little used to sympathy and the proposal affect she deeply the generosity and goodness of this letter wholly determine my softest inclination on you side she write with unusual gentleness to montagu on a Thursday night in August you be in the wrong to suspect I of artifice plainly show I the kindness of you heart -lrb- if you have any there for I -rrb- be the surest way to touch mine and i be at this minute more inclined to speak tenderly to you than ever i be in my life -- so much inclined i will say nothing i could wish you would leave england but i know not how to object to anything that please you in this minute i have no will that do not agree with yours there be a reference in the letter just print to a meeting of lady anne and montagu but how often they see each other at this time there be no know however it must have be in August that fail the consent of lord dorchester to they marriage they make up they mind to elope from whom the suggestion first come who can say let it be hope for the sake of maiden modesty it come from montagu what drive they to this step may well have be the fear that lord dorchester might to all intent and purpose imprison he daughter on one of he estate even at the eleventh hour lady mary be determine that there should be no misunderstanding between she and she _ fiancé _ she write to he say that if she come to he in this way she would come to he without a portion to this part of she letter he vouchsafe no reply so she again touch upon the matter you make no reply to one part of my letter concern my fortune i be afraid you flatter yourself that my f -lrb- father -rrb- may be at length reconcile and bring to reasonable term i be convince by what i have often hear he say speaking of other case like this he never will the fortune he have engage to give with I be settle on my b -lrb- brother -rrb- 's marriage on my sister and on myself but in such a manner that it be leave in he power to give it all to either of we or divide as he think fit he have give it all to I nothing remain for my sister but the free bounty of my f -lrb- father -rrb- from what he can save which notwithstanding the greatness of he estate may be very little possibly after i have disoblige he so much he may be glad to have she so easily provide for with money already raise especially if he have a design to marry himself as i hear i do not speak this that you should not endeavor to come to term with he if you please but i be fully persuade it will be to no purpose lady mary assure montagu that lord dorchester 's attitude be this : she have consent to a engagement with another man that she have let he incur a expenditure of some four hundred pound for a trousseau and that by break it off have make he look foolish in fact she father she add have give she clearly to understand that he would entertain no dealings whatsoever with any suitor other than the one of he choice that he would send she to he estate in the north of england and that it be he intention to leave she on he death only a annuity of four hundred pound as a good sportsman she at the last moment give montagu a chance to retreat he -lrb- my father -rrb- will have a thousand plausible reason for be irreconcileable and ` tis very probable the world will be of he side reflect now for the last time in what manner you must take I i shall come to you with only a night-gown and petticoat and that be all you will get with I i tell a lady of my friend what i intend to do you will think she a very good friend when i tell you she have proffer to lend we she house if we would come there the first night i do not accept of this till i have let you know it if you think it more convenient to carry I to you lodgings make no scruple of it let it be where it will : if i be you wife i shall think no place unfit for I where you be i beg we may leave london next morning wherever you intend to go i should wish to go out of england if it suit with you affair you be the best judge of you father 's temper if you think it would be oblige to he or necessary for you i will go with you immediately to ask he pardon and he blessing if that be not proper at first i think the best scheme be go to the spa when you come back you may endeavor to make you father admit of see I and treat with mine -lrb- thought i persist in think it will be to no purpose -rrb- but i can not think of living in the midst of my relation and acquaintance after so unjustifiable a step : -- unjustifiable to the world -- but i think i can justify myself to myself i again beg you to hire a coach to be at the door early Monday morning to carry we some part of we way wherever you resolve we journey shall be if you determine to go to that lady 's house you have better come with a coach and six at seven o'clock to-morrow she and i will be in the balcony that look on the road : you have nothing to do but to stop under it and we will come down to you do in this what you like best after all think very seriously you letter which will be wait for be to determine everything i forgive you a coarse expression in you last which however i wish have not be there you might have say something like it without express it in that manner but there be so much complaisance in the rest of it i ought to be satisfy you can shew I no goodness i shall not be sensible of however think again and resolve never to think of I if you have the least doubt or that it be likely to make you uneasy in you fortune i believe to travel be the most likely way to make a solitude agreeable and not tiresome : remember you have promise it even in this hour of excitement lady mary do not lose she head and she ask for a settlement that would make she easy in she mind ti something odd for a woman that bring nothing to expect anything but after the way of my education i dare not pretend to live but in some degree suitable to it i have rather die than return to a dependancy upon relation i have disoblige save I from that fear if you love I if you can not or think i ought not to expect it be sincere and tell I so ` tis better i should not be yours at all than for a short happiness involve myself in age of misery i hope there will never be occasion for this precaution but however ` tis necessary to make it i depend entirely on you honor and i can not suspect you of any way do wrong do not imagine i shall be angry at anything you can tell I let it be sincere do not impose on a woman that leave all thing for you no woman could be more sensible than be lady mary at this time and she give expression to the most exemplary sentiment a woman that add nothing to a man 's fortune ought not to take from he happiness if possible i would add to it but i will not take from you any satisfaction you could enjoy without I if we marry we happiness must consist in loving one another : ` tis principally my concern to think of the most probable method of make the love eternal there be one article absolutely necessary -- to be ever beloved one must be ever agreeable very few people that have settle entirely in the country but have grow at length weary of one another the lady 's conversation generally fall into a thousand impertinent effect of idleness and the gentleman fall _ in _ love with he dog and horse and _ out _ of love with everything else and so on possibly if lady mary have have less brain and more passion if she have not so calmly work out the permutation and combination of married life the alliance might have be more successful she with all she intelligence do not seem to realize that matrimony be not a affair of rule and regulation of aphorism and epigram nor that the line on which husband and wife shall conduct themselves to a happy ending can be settle by a study of vulgar fraction anyhow the plunge be at last take -- with some not unnatural trepidation on the part of the twenty-three-year-old bride on Friday night August 15 1712 she write to montagu : i tremble for what we be do -- be you sure you will love I for ever shall we never repent i fear and i hope i forsee all that will happen on this occasion i shall incense my family in the highest degree the generality of the world will blame my conduct and the relation and friend of -- will invent a thousand story of I yet ` tis possible you may recompense everything to I in this letter which i be fond of you promise I all that i wish since i writ so far i receive you Friday letter i will be only yours and i will do what you please you shall hear from I again to-morrow not to contradict but to give some direction my resolution be take love I and use I well the wedding licence be date August 16 and the marriage take place in a day or two the bride have the active assistance of she uncle william feilding who may have be present at the ceremony and the full sympathy of she brother lord kingston who however do not accompany she perhaps deem it impolitic to quarrel with he father the family must have think that lord dorchester would examine lady mary 's papers for she sister lady france destroy all she could find include unfortunately a diary that lady mary have keep for several year chapter iv early married life -lrb- 1712-1714 -rrb- a uneventful existence -- montagu 's parliamentary duty take he to london -- lady mary stay mostly in the country -- correspondence -- montagu a careless husband but very careful of he money -- later he become a miser -- lady mary do not disguise the tedium of she existence -- concern a possible reconciliation with she father -- lord pierrepont of hanslope -- lord halifax -- birth of a son christen after he father edward wortley montagu -- the mother 's anxiety about he health -- family event -- lady evelyn pierrepont marry baron -lrb-

due course succeed to the dukedom of kingston -- elizabeth chudleigh -- the political situation in 1714 -- the death of queen anne -- the accession of george i -- the unrest in the country -- lady mary 's alarm for she son the record for the first year of the married life of edward and lady mary wortley montagu be scanty indeed from the wedding day until 1716 when they go abroad lady mary 's life be for month together as uneventful as that of the ordinary suburban housewife montagu 's parliamentary duty take he frequently to town and keep he there for prolonged period during which he certainly show no strong desire for she to join he lady mary indeed spend most of the time in the country sometimes she stay at the seat of she father-in-law wharncliffe lodge near sheffield occasionally she visit lord sandwich at hinchinbrooke for a while they stay at middlethorpe in the neighborhood of bishopthorpe and york from time to time they hire house in other part of yorkshire the honeymoon last from August until October 1712 when montagu have to go to westminster the first letter of this period be date characteristically : wall well October 22 which be the first post i could write Monday night be so fatigued and sick i go straight to bed from the coach it start : i do not know very well how to begin i be perfectly unacquainted with a proper matrimonial stile after all i think ` tis best to write as if we be not marry at all i lament you absence as if you be still my lover and i be impatient to hear you be get safe to durham and that you have fix a time for you return marriage make lady mary more human she no longer dwell upon the various point that in she maidenhood day she have think would be conducive to happiness in matrimonial life she be now anyhow for the moment in love with she husband or at least persuade herself that this be the case and be at pain to inform he of the fact i have not be very long in this family and i fancy myself in that describe in the ` spectator ' the letter of October 22 continue the good people here look upon they child with a fondness that more than recompense they care of they i do not perceive much distinction in regard to they merit and when they speak sense or nonsense it affect the parent with almost the same pleasure my friendship for the mother and kindness for miss biddy make I endure the squalling of miss nanny and miss mary with abundance of patience : and my foretell the future conquest of the eldest daughter make I very well with the family -- i do not know whether you will presently find out that this seem impertinent account be the tenderest expression of my love to you but it furnish my imagination with agreeable picture of we future life and i flatter myself with the hope of one day enjoy with you the same satisfaction and that after as many year together i may see you retain the same fondness for I as i shall certainly mine for you and the noise of a nursery may have more charm for we than the music of a opera -lrb- _ tear _ -rrb- as these be the sure effect of my sincere love since ` tis the nature of that passion to entertain the mind with pleasure in prospect and i check myself when i grieve for you absence by remember how much reason i have to rejoice in the hope of pass my whole life with you a good fortune not to be value -- i be afraid of tell you that i return thanks for it to heaven because you will charge I with hypocrisy but you be mistake : i assist every day at public prayer in this family and never forget in my private ejaculation how much i owe to heaven for make I yours ` tis candle-light or i should not conclude so soon pray my dear begin at the top and read till you come to the bottom montagu for he part be somewhat careless as regard correspondence -- for which offence she rebuke he more than once but in the most flattering manner i be at present in so much uneasiness my letter be not likely to be intelligible if it all resemble the confusion of my head i sometimes imagine you not well and sometimes that you think of it small importance to write or that greater matter have take up you thought this last imagination be too cruel for I i will rather fancy you letter have miscarry though i find little probability to think so i know not what to think and be very near be distract amongst my variety of dismal apprehension i be very ill company to the good people of the house who all bid I make you they compliment mr white begin you health twice every day you do not deserve all this if you can be so entirely forgetful of all this part of the world i be peevish with you by fit and divide my time between anger and sorrow which be equaly troublesome to I ` tis the most cruel thing in the world to think one have reason to complain of what one love how can you be so careless -- be it because you do not love write you should remember i want to know you be safe at durham i shall imagine you have have some fall from you horse or ill accident by the way without regard to probability there be nothing too extravagant for a woman 's and a lover 's fear do you receive my last letter if you do not the direction be wrong you will not receive this and my question be in vain i find i begin to talk nonsense and ` tis time to leave off pray my dear write to I or i shall be very mad montagu be not to put too fine a point on it a careless husband not only do he neglect to write to he wife but he neglect or forget to keep she adequately supply with money she have more than once to remind he of this i wish you would write again to mr phipp for i do not hear of any money and be in the utmost necessity for it she tell he in November 1712 montagu even at this time a well-to-do man find it difficult to part with he money a couple of year later lady mary have again to say to he : pray order I some money for i be in great want and must run into debt if you do not do it soon even in these day montagu evidently have begin to be miserly with all he riches he never spend a crown when a smaller sum would suffice and during most of he life he as sir leslie stephen put it devoted himself chiefly to save money in the winter of 1712 lady mary who be with child suffer much from ill-health and this be to some extent aggravate by intense boredom although of that boredom she write good-humouredly enough i do not believe you expect to hear from I so soon if i remember you do not so much as desire it but i will not be so nice to quarrel with you on that point perhaps you would laugh at that delicacy which be however a attendant of a tender friendship she write to she husband from hinchinbrooke at the beginning of December 1712 i open the closet where i expect to find so many book to my great disappointment there be only some few piece of the law and folio of mathematics my lord hinchinbrook and mr twiman have dispose of the rest but as there be no affliction no more than no happiness without alloy i discover a old trunk of papers which to my great diversion i find to be the letter of the first earl of sandwich and be in hope that those from he lady will tend much to my edification be the most extraordinary lesson of economy that ever i read in my life to the glory of you father i find that _ he _ look upon he as destine to be the honor of the family i walk yesterday two hour on the terrace these be the most considerable event that have happen in you absence except that a good-natured robin red-breast keep I company almost all the afternoon with so much good humor and humanity as give I faith for the piece of charity ascribe to these little creature in the child in the wood which i have hitherto think only a poetical ornament to that history i expect a letter next post to tell I you be well in london and that you business will not detain you long from she that can not be happy without you even in these early day of marriage montagu seem to have no love for domestic life and often he stay in london when he could have be in the country with he wife or have she with he in town as much as you say i love the town if you think it necessary for you interest to stay some time here i would not advise you to neglect a certainty for a uncertainty but i believe if you pass the christmas here great matter will be expect from you hospitality : however you be a better judge than i be so lady mary write from hinchinbrooke in the first week of December she do not disguise from he the tedium of she existence i continue indifferently well and endeavor as much as i can to preserve myself from spleen and melancholy not for my own sake i think that of little importance but in the condition i be i believe it may be of very ill consequence yet pass whole day alone as i do i do not always find it possible and my constitution will sometimes get the better of my reason human nature itself without any additional misfortune furnish disagreeable meditation enough life itself to make it supportable should not be consider too near my reason represent to I in vain the inutility of serious reflection the idle mind will sometimes fall into contemplation that serve for nothing but to ruin the health destroy good humor hasten old age and wrinkle and bring on a habitual melancholy ` tis a maxim with I to be young as long as one can : there be nothing can pay one for that invaluable ignorance which be the companion of youth those sanguine groundless hope and that lively vanity which make all the happiness of life to my extreme mortification i grow wiser every day than other -lrb- sic -rrb- i do not believe solomon be more convinced of the vanity of temporal affair than i be i lose all taste of this world and i suffer myself to be bewitch by the charm of the spleen though i know and foresee all the irremediable mischief arise from it i be insensibly fall into the write you a melancholy letter after all my resolution to the contrary but i do not enjoin you to read it : make no scruple of fling it into the fire at the first dull line forgive the ill effect of my solitude and think I as i be ever yours there be still hope in the heart of lady mary and she husband that it might be possible to effect a reconciliation with lord dorchester since apparently the marquess be not directly approachable by either of they they perforce have to seek a intermediary such a one they trust at one time would be one of lady mary 's relative lord pierrepont of hanslope to this matter there be many allusion in the correspondence the bishop of salisbury write I word that he hear my lord pierrepont declare very much for we lady mary write from hinchinbrooke early in December to she husband in town as the bishop be no infallible prelate i should not depend much on that intelligence but my sister france tell I the same thing since it be so i believe you 'll think it very proper to pay he a visit if he be in town and give he thanks for the good office you hear he have endeavor to do I unasked if he kindness be sincere ` tis too valuable to be neglect however the very appearance of it may be of use to we if i know he he desire of make my father appear in the wrong will make he zealous for we i think i ought to write he a letter of acknowledgment for what i hear he have already do very shortly after however it appear that lord pierrepont be a broken reed upon which to rely i do not expect lady mary say bitterly that my lord pierrepont would speak at all in we favor much less show zeal upon that occasion that never show any in he life you can not put it plainer than that one who do really endeavor to bring about the resumption of friendly relation be montagu 's cousin charle montagu first baron halifax of halifax who be afterwards create first earl of halifax to judge from lady mary 's comment sometimes when montagu do write it have be better he should not have do so i be alone without any amusement to take up my thought i be in circumstance in which melancholy be apt to prevail even over all amusement dispirited and alone and you write I quarrel letter she rebuke he on one occasion i hate complain ` tis no sign i be easy that i do not trouble you with my head-ache and my spleen to be reasonable one should never complain but when one hope redress a physician should be the only confidant of bodily pain and for those of the mind they should never be speak of but to they that can and will relieve 'em should i tell you that i be uneasy that i be out of humor and out of patience should i see you half a hour the sooner i believe you have kindness enough for I to be very sorry and so you would tell I and thing remain in they primitive state i chuse to spare you that pain i would always give you pleasure i know you be ready to tell I that i do not ever keep to these good maxim i confess i often speak impertinently but i always repent of it my last stupid letter be not come to you before i would have have it back again have it be in my power such as it be i beg you pardon for it in may 1713 lady mary be deliver of a boy who be christen after he father edward wortley montagu some account of he unsatisfactory career will be give in a later chapter as a infant he suffer from ill-health i be in abundance of pain about we dear child : though i be convince in my reason ` tis both silly and wicked to set one 's heart too fondly on anything in this world yet i can not overcome myself so far as to think of parting with he with the resignation that i ought to do the mother write from middlethorpe at the end of July i hope and i beg of god he may live to be a comfort to we both they tell I there be nothing extraordinary in want of tooth at he age but he weakness make I very apprehensive he be almost never out of my sight mr behn say that the cold bath be the best medicine for weak child but i be very fearful and unwilling to try any hazardous remedy he be very cheerful and full of play i hope the child be better than he be she mention a little later but i wish you would let dr garth know he have a bigness in he joint but not much he ankle seem chiefly to have a weakness i should be very glad of he advice upon it and whether he approve rub they with spirit which i be tell be good for he then come more favourable news about young edward i thank god this cold well agree with the child and he seem stronger and better every day lady mary be able to report but i should be very glad if you see dr garth if you ask he opinion concern the use of cold bath for young child i hope you love the child as well as i do but if you love I at all you 'll desire the preservation of he health for i should certainly break my heart for he garth it may be assume be the famous samuel garth afterwards physician-in-ordinary to george i and author of _ the dispensary _ he view on cold bath for child of fifteen month have not be hand down to posterity by lady mary meantime thing be happen in the pierrepont family lady mary 's sister lady france have on march 8 1712 marry john second baron gower who afterwards be create earl gower lady mary 's other sister lady evelyn on July 26 1714 become the second wife of john erskine sixth or eleventh earl of mar of the erskine line who presently come into prominence as a adherent of the pretender in the rebellion of '15 after which he flee the country he be create duke of mar by the pretender finally the marquess of dorchester be then in he fiftieth year take for he second wife on August 2 1714 lady isabellum bentinck fifth daughter of william first earl of portland and he first wife anne sister of edward first earl of jersey there be issue of this marriage two daughter : caroline who marry thoma brand of kempton hertfordshire and anne who die unmarried in 1739 at the age of twenty already on July 1 1723 have die lord dorchester 's only son and heir william who take the style of earl of kingston he have marry rachel daughter of thoma baynton of little chalfield wiltshire by whom he have one son name evelyn after he grandfather whom he succeed in 1726 as the second duke of kingston the career of evelyn be undistinguished bear in 1711 he aunt lady mary say of he at the age of fifteen : the duke of kingston have hitherto have so ill a education ` tis hard to make any judgment of he he have he spirit but i fear will never have he father 's sense as young gentleman go ` tis possible he may make a good figure among they than which it would be unkind to say anything more cutting of course honor come to he he be create knight of the garter in 1741 in which year he be appoint a lord of the bedchamber he rise to the rank of colonel in the army in 1745 and twenty-seven year later be promote general but it do not appear that he see any service the second duke of kingston will however always be remember for he marriage in 1769 with the beautiful and notorious elizabeth chudleigh who be nine year he junior she have in 1744 married secretly augustus john hervey afterwards sixth earl of bristol who survive until December 1779 she have long be live with the duke but in 1769 she obtain a divorce _ a mensa et thoro _ which she believe erroneously annul the marriage the duke die in 1773 when all he title become extinct he duchess be in the following year try before the house of lord for bigamy find guilty but plead benefit of peerage be discharge thus she carry out the prognostication of lord chief justice mansfield who have oppose the prosecution the argument about the place of trial suggest to my mind the question about the propriety of any trial at all he say in a debate in the house of lord _ cui bono _ what utility be to be obtain suppose a conviction to be the result -- the lady make you lordship a courtesy and you return a bow she survive live on the continent until 1788 as a epitaph for she there can be nothing better than a remark of horace walpole : i can tell you nothing more extraordinary nor would any history figure near hers it show genius to strike anything so new as she achievement though we have many uncommon personage it be not easy for they to be so superiorly particular more generally interesting than these domestic matter be the political situation queen anne 's life have for some time be hang in the balance it be think that she might linger for some time but there be no hope of she recovery the fight that be carry on between the supporter of the hanoverian succession and the adherent of the pretender be of course a matter of history on August 5 1714 come to the elector of hanover jame craggs junior with a letter from the privy council date July 31 announce the precarious state of anne 's health and convey assurance that in the event of she demise every precaution would be take to safeguard the rights of george lewi the same night messenger arrive at hanover from london with the news of the death of the queen who have pass away on July 31 shortly after the departure of cragg during the interval between the proclamation of the accession of george i and he arrival which do not take place until September 17 the country be in a disturbed state and it be not unnatural that lady mary in yorkshire be alarm for the safety of herself and the child i can not forbear take it something unkindly that you do not write to I when you may be assure i be in a great fright and know not certainly what to expect upon this sudden change she write from middlethorpe to montagu the archbishop of york have be come to bishopthorpe but three day i go with my cousin to-day to see the king proclaim which be do the archbishop walk next the lord mayor all the country gentry follow with greater crowd of people than i believe to be in york vast acclamation and the appearance of a general satisfaction the pretender afterwards drag about the street and burn ringing of bell bonfire and illuminations the mob cry liberty and property and long live king george this morning all the principal man of any figure take post for london and we be alarm with the fear of attempt from scotland though all protestant seem unanimous for the hanover succession the poor young lady at castle howard be as much afraid as i be be leave all alone without any hope of see they father again -lrb- though thing should prove well -rrb- this eight or nine month they have send to desire I very earnestly to come to they and bring my boy ` tis the same thing as pensioning in a nunnery for no mortal man ever enter the door in the absence of they father who be go post during this uncertainty i think it will be a safe retreat for middlethorpe stand expose to plunderer if there be any at all a day or two later this letter be follow by another : you make I cry two hour last night i can not imagine why you use I so ill for what reason you continue silent when you know at any time you silence can not fail of give I a great deal of pain and now to a higher degree because of the perplexity that i be in without know where you be what you be do or what to do with myself and my dear little boy however -lrb- persuade there can be no objection to it -rrb- i intend to go to-morrow to castle howard and remain there with the young lady 'till i know when i shall see you or what you would command the archbishop and everybody else be go to london we be alarm with a story of a fleet be see from the coast of scotland a express go from thence through york to the earl of mar i beg you would write to I 'till you do i shall not have a easy minute i be sure i do not deserve from you that you should make I uneasy i find i be scold ` tis better for I not to trouble you with it but i can not help take you silence very unkindly chapter v the accession of george i -lrb- 1714 -rrb- lady mary show a increase interest in politics -- she try to incite she husband to be ambitious -- montagu not return to the new parliament -- he lack of energy -- correspondence -- the council of regency -- the king command lord townshend to form a government -- the cabinet -- lord halifax first lord of the treasury -- montagu appoint a lord commissioner of the treasury -- correspondence -- the unsatisfactory relation between lady mary and montagu at the time of the death of queen anne lady mary begin to show a increase interest in polity at least in so far as the career of montagu be bind up with it she begin to try to persuade she husband to be to some extent at least ambitious it may be that she be not happy at the thought of be marry to a man who be regard as a nonentity she be always urge he to put he best foot forward sometimes she write to he as to a naughty child i be very much surprised that you do not tell I in you last letter that you have speak to my father she say in August 1714 i hope after stay in the town on purpose you do not intend to omit it i beg you would not leave any sort of business unfinished remember those two necessary maxim whatever you intend to do as long as you live do as soon as you can and to leave nothing to be do by another that ` tis possible to do yourself what sort of a man must montagu have be at the age of thirty-six that he wife should deem it necessary to give he such first-aid advice montagu be evidently of a procrastinating turn of mind he have as have be say sit for huntingdon in the house of common from 1705 until 1713 in the latter year parliament be dissolve on August 8 but montagu have make no definite plan as regard he future political career -- for some reason or other he father reserve for himself the seat for huntingdon montagu find no other constituency and consequently do not sit in the new parliament that assemble on the follow November 11 i suppose you may now come in at aldburgh and i heartily wish you be in parliament lady mary write to he i see the archbishop -lrb- of york -rrb- 's list of the lord regent appoint and perceive lord wharton be not one of they by which i guess the new scheme be not to make use of any man grossly infamous in either party consequently those who have be honest in regard to both will stand fairest for preferment you understand these thing much better than I but i hope you will be persuade by I and you other friend -lrb- who i do not doubt will be of opinion -rrb- that ` tis necessary for the common good for a honest man to endeavor to be powerful when he can be the one without lose the first more valuable title and remember that money be the source of power i hear that parliament sit but six month you know best whether ` tis worth any expense or bustle to be in for so short a time lady mary 's letter now contain many reference to political affair anyhow in so far as they directly concern montagu i hope you be convinced i be not mistake in my judgment of lord pelham he be very silly but very good-natured i do not see how it can be improper for you to get it represent to he that he be oblige in honor to get you choose at aldburgh and may more easily get mr jessop choose at another place i can not believe but you may manage it in such a manner mr jessop himself would not be against it nor would he have so much reason to take it ill if he should not be choose as you have after so much money fruitlessly spend i dare say you may order it so that it may be so if you talk to lord townshend about it & c i mention this because i can not think you can stand at york or anywhere else without a great expense lord morpeth be just now of age but i know not whether he 'll think it worth while to return from travel upon that occasion lord carlisle be in town you may if you think fit make he a visit and enquire concern it after all i look upon aldburgh to be the surest thing lord pelham be easily persuade to any thing and i be sure he may be tell by lord townshend that he have use you ill and i know he 'll be desirous to do all thing in he power to make it up in my opinion if yon resolve upon a extraordinary expense to be in parliament you should resolve to have it turn to some account you father be very surprizing if he persist in stand at huntingdon but there be nothing surprizing in such a world as this later in August lady mary write again on the same subject and this letter show that she have be at pain to acquire some practical knowledge of borough-mongering you seem not to have receive my letter or not to have understand they you have be choose undoubtedly at york if you have declare in time but there be not any gentleman or tradesman disengage at this time they be treat every night lord carlisle and the thompson have give they interest to mr jenkin i agree with you of the necessity of you standing this parliament which perhaps may be more considerable than any that be to follow it but as you proceed ` tis my opinion you will spend you money and not be choose i believe there be hardly a borough unengaged i expect every letter should tell I you be sure of some place and as far as i can perceive you be sure of none as it have be manage perhaps it will be the best way to deposit a certain sum in some friend 's hand and buy some little cornish borough : it would undoubtedly look better to be choose for a considerable town but i take it to be now too late if you have any thought of newark it will be absolutely necessary for you to enquire after lord lexington 's interest and you best way to apply yourself to lord holdernesse who be both a whig and a honest man he be now in town and you may enquire of he if brigadier sutton stand there and if not try to engage he for you lord lexington be so ill at the bath that it be a doubt if he will live 'till the election and if he die one of he heiress and the whole interest of he estate will probably fall on lord holdernesse ` tis a surprise to I that you can not make sure of some borough when so many of you friend bring in several parliament-man without trouble or expense ` tis too late to mention it now but you might have apply to lady winchester as sir joseph jekyl do last year and by she interest the duke of bolton bring he in for nothing i be sure she would be more zealous to serve I than lady jekyl you should understand these thing better than I i hear by a letter last post that lady m montagu and lady hinchinbrooke be to be bedchamber lady to the princess and lady townshend groom of the steal she must be a strange princess if she can pick a favorite out of they and as she will be one day queen and they say have a influence over she husband i wonder they do not think fit to place woman about she with a little common sense again in the middle of September lady mary return to the subject of montagu find a seat in the house : i can not be very sorry for you decline at newark be very uncertain of you success but i be surprize you do not mention where you intend to stand dispatch in thing of this nature if not a security at least delay be a sure way to lose as you have do be easily choose at york for not resolve in time and aldburgh for not apply soon enough to lord pelham here be people here have rather choose fairfax than jenkin and other that prefer jenkin to fairfax but both party separately have wish to I you would have stand with assurance of have prefer you to either of they at newark lord lexington have a very considerable interest if you have any thought of stand you must endeavor to know how he stand affect though i be afraid he will assist brigadier sutton or some other tory sir matthew jenison have the best interest of any whig but he stand last year himself and will perhaps do so again newdigate will certainly be choose there for one upon the whole ` tis the most expensive and uncertain place you can stand at ti surprize to I that you be all this while in the midst of you friend without be sure of a place when so many insignificant creature come in without any opposition they say mr strickland be sure at carlisle where he never stand before i believe most place be engage by this time i be very sorry for you sake that you spend so much money in vain last year and will not come in this when you might make a more considerable figure than you could have do then i wish lord pelham would compliment mr jessop with he newark interest and let you come in at aldburgh on the death of the queen the council which have assemble at kensington palace adjourn to st jame 's by the regency bill the administration of the government -lrb- in the event of the king be absent from the realm at the time of he accession to the

captain-general marlborough be in the cabinet lord halifax when make out the commission of the treasury invite he cousin montagu to be one of the commissioner although the latter have not secure a seat in parliament it will be surprize to add say lady mary that he hesitate to accept it at a time when he father be alive and he present income very small but he have certainly refuse it if he have not be persuade to it by a rich old uncle of mine lord pierrepont whose fondness for I give he expectation of a large legacy lady mary though glad enough that she husband have be give a place be not over and above delighted that it be one so modest _ lady mary wortley montagu to she husband _ -lrb- enclosed September 24 1714 -rrb- though i be very impatient to see you i would not have you by hasten to come down lose any part of you interest i be surprize you say nothing of where you stand i have a letter from mrs hewet last post who say she hear you stand at newark and would be choose without opposition but i fear she intelligence be not at all to be depend on i be glad you think of serve you friend i hope it will put you in mind of serve yourself i need not enlarge upon the advantage of money every thing we see and every thing we hear put we in remembrance of it if it be possible to restore liberty to you country or limit the encroachment of the prerogative by reduce yourself to a garret i should be please to share so glorious a poverty with you but as the world be and will be ` tis a sort of duty to be rich that it may be in one 's power to do good riches be another word for power towards the obtain of which the first necessary qualification be impudence and -lrb- as demosthene say of pronunciation in oratory -rrb- the second be impudence and the third still impudence no modest man ever do or ever will make he fortune you friend lord h -lrb- alifa -rrb- x r w -lrb- alpo -rrb- le and all other remarkable instance of quick advancement have be remarkably impudent the ministry be like a play at court there be a little door to get in and a great crowd without shove and thrust who shall be foremost : people who knock other with they elbow disregard a little kick of the shin and still thrust heartily forwards be sure of a good place you modest man stand behind in the crowd be shove about by every body he cloath tear almost squeeze to death and see a thousand get in before he that do not make so good a figure as himself i do not say it be impossible for a impudent man not to rise in the world but a moderate merit with a large share of impudence be more probable to be advance than the greatest qualification without it if this letter be impertinent it be found upon a opinion of you merit which it if be a mistake i would not be undeceived in : it be my interest to believe -lrb- as i do -rrb- that you deserve every thing and be capable of every thing but nobody else will believe you if they see you get nothing -lrb- postmark October 6 1714 -rrb- i can not imagine why you should desire that i should not be glad though from a mistake since at least it be a agreeable one i confess i shall ever be of opinion if you be in the treasury it will be a addition to you figure and facilitate you election though it be no otherwise advantageous and that if you have nothing when all you acquaintance be prefer the world generally will not be persuade that you neglect you fortune but that you be neglect -lrb- endorse October 9 1714 -rrb- you do I wrong in imagine -lrb- as i perceive you do -rrb- that my reason for be solicitous for you have that place be in view of spend more money than we do you have no cause of fancy I capable of such a thought i do not doubt but lord h -lrb- alifa -rrb- x will very soon have the staff and it be my belief you will not be at all the richer : but i think it look well and may facilitate you election and that be all the advantage i hope from it when all you intimate acquaintance be prefer i think you would have a ill air in have nothing upon that account only i be sorry so many considerable place be dispose on -lrb- _ sic _ -rrb- i suppose now you will certainly be choose somewhere or other and i can not see why you should not pretend to be speaker i believe all the whig would be for you and i fancy you have a considerable interest amongst the tory and for that reason would be very likely to carry it ` tis impossible for I to judge of this so well as you can do but the reputation of be thoroughly of no party be -lrb- i think -rrb- of use in this affair and i believe people generally esteem you impartial and be choose by you country be more honorable than hold _ any _ place from _ any _ king the relation between lady mary and she husband do not improve not only do he neglect to write to she when he leave she in the country but he do not at any time appear to have have any desire to have she with he in town lady mary show extreme in fact overmuch forbearance but towards the end of November she patience give out : i can not forbear any longer tell you i think you use I very unkindly i do not say so much of you absence as i should do if you be in the country and i in london because i would not have you believe i be impatient to be in town when i say i be impatient to be with you but i be very sensible i part with you in July and ` tis now the middle of November she go on to say as if this be not hardship enough you do not tell I you be sorry for it you write seldom and with so much indifference as shew you hardly think of I at all i complain of ill health and you only say you hope ` tis not so bad as i make it you never enquire after you child i would fain flatter myself you have more kindness for I and he than you express but i reflect with grief a man that be ashamed of passion that be natural and reasonable be generally proud of those that -lrb- be -rrb- shameful and silly lady mary once have give vent to she feeling of injustice be not concern to mince she word : you seem perfectly please with we separation and indifferent how long it continue when i reflect on you behavior i be ashamed of my own : i think i be play the part of my lady winchester at least be as generous as my lord and as he make early confession of he aversion own to I you inconstancy and upon my word i will give you no more trouble about it for my part as ` tis my first this be my last complaint and you next of the kind shall go back enclose to you in blank paper chapter vi lady mary wortley montagu 's account of the court of george i lady mary then have be in yorkshire when the queen die and be still in the country much against she will when the king arrive on September 18 soon after however she come to town and so to speak look around the court she account of the court of george i be not always accurate and be certainly often prejudice it be not the less interesting because the writer do not mince she word even when discuss the character of she friend dolly walpole notwithstanding this bird-eye view of the royal and political circle at the accession of the first of the hanoverian monarch be so valuable as to deserve inclusion in this work the new court with all they train be arrive before i leave the country the duke of marlborough be return in a sort of triumph with the apparent merit of have suffer for he fidelity in the succession and be reinstate in he office of general & c in short all people who have suffer any hardship or disgrace during the late ministry would have it believe that it be occasion by they attachment to the house of hanover even mr walpole who have be send to the tower for a piece of bribery prove upon he be call a confessor to the cause but he have another piece of good luck that yet more contribute to he advancement he have a very handsome sister whose folly have lose she reputation in london but the yet greater folly of lord townshend who happen to be a neighbor in norfolk to mr walpole have occasion he be draw in to marry she some month before the queen die lord townshend have that sort of understanding which commonly make man honest in the first part of they life they follow the instruction of they tutor and till somebody think it worth while to show they a new path go regularly on in the road where they be set lord townshend have then be many year a excellent husband to a sober wife a kind master to all he servant and dependant a serviceable relation whenever it be in he power and follow the instinct of nature in be fond of he child such a sort of behavior without any glaring absurdity either in prodigality or avarice always gain a man the reputation of reasonable and honest and this be he character when the earl of godolphin send he envoy to the state not doubt but he would be faithful to he order without give himself the trouble of criticise on they which be what all minister wish in a envoy robethon a french refugee -lrb- secretary to bernstorff one of the elector of hanover 's minister -rrb- happen to be at the hague and be civilly receive by lord townshend who treat he at he table with the english hospitality and he be charm with a reception which he birth and education do not entitle he to lord townshend be recall when the queen change she ministry he wife die and he retire into the country where -lrb- as i have say before -rrb- walpole have art enough to make he marry he sister dolly at that time i believe he do not propose much more advantage by the match than to get rid of a girl that lay heavy on he hand when king george ascend the throne he be surround by all he german minister and playfellow male and female baron goertz be the most considerable among they both for birth and fortune he have manage the king 's treasury for thirty year with the utmost fidelity and economy and have the true german honesty be a plain sincere and unambitious man bernstorff the secretary be of a different turn he be avaricious artful and design and have get he share in the king 's council by bribe he woman robethon be employ in these matter and have the sanguine ambition of a frenchman he resolve there should be a english ministry of he choosing and know none of they personally but townshend he have not fail to recommend he to he master and he master to the king as the only proper person for the important post of secretary of state and he enter upon that office with universal applause have at that time a very popular character which he might probably have retain for ever if he have not be entirely govern by he wife and she brother robert walpole whom he immediately advance to be paymaster esteem a post of exceed profit and very necessary for he indebted estate but he have yet higher view or rather he find it necessary to move higher lest he should not be able to keep that the earl of wharton now marqui both hate and despise he he large estate the whole income of which be spend in the service of the party and he own part make he considerable though he profligate life lessen that weight that a more regular conduct would have give he lord halifax who be now advance to the dignity of earl and grace with the garter and first commissioner of the treasury treat he with contempt the earl of nottingham who have the real merit of have renounce the ministry in queen anne 's reign when he think they be go to alter the succession be not to be reconcile to walpole whom he look upon as stigmatise for corruption the duke of marlborough who in he old age be make the same figure at court that he do when he first come into it -- i mean bow and smile in the antechamber while townshend be in the closet -- be not however please with the walpole who begin to behave to he with the insolence of new favor and he duchess who never restrain she tongue in she life use to make public joke of the beggary she first know he in when she caprice give he a considerable place against the opinion of lord godolphin and the duke of marlborough to balance these he have introduce some friend of he own by he recommendation to lord townshend -lrb- who do nothing but by he instigation -rrb- colonel stanhope be make the secretary of state he have be unfortunate in spain and there do not want those who attribute it to ill conduct but he be call generous brave true to he friend and have a air of probity which prejudice the world in he favor the king 's character may be comprise in very few word in private life he would have be call a honest blockhead and fortune that make he a king add nothing to he happiness only prejudice he honesty and shorten he day no man be ever more free from ambition he love money but love to keep he own without be rapacious of other man 's he would have grow rich by save but be incapable of lay scheme for get he be more properly dull than lazy and would have be so well contented to have remain in he little town of hanover that if the ambition of those about he have not be greater than he own we should never have see he in england and the natural honesty of he temper join with the narrow notion of a low education make he look upon he acceptance of the crown as a act of usurpation which be always uneasy to he but he be carry by the stream of the people about he in that as in every action of he life he could speak no english and be past the age of learn it we custom and law be all mystery to he which he neither try to understand nor be capable of understand if he have endeavor it he be passively good-natured and wish all mankind enjoy quiet if they would let he do so the mistress that follow he hither be so much of he own temper that i do not wonder at the engagement between they she be duller than himself and consequently do not find out that he be so and have live in that figure at hanover almost forty year -lrb- for she come hither at three score -rrb- without meddle in any affair of the electorate content with the small pension he allow she and the honor of he visit when he have nothing else to do which happen very often she even refuse come hither at first fear that the people of england who she think be accustom to use they king barbarously might chop off he head in the first fortnight and have not love or gratitude enough to venture be involve in he ruin and the poor man be in peril of come hither without know where to pass he evening which he be accustom to do in the apartment of woman free from business but madame keilmansegg save he from this misfortune she be tell that mademoiselle schulenburg scruple this terrible journey and take the opportunity of offer she service to he majesty who willingly accept it though he do not facilitate it to she by the payment of debt which make it very difficult for she to leave hanover without permission of she creditor but she be a woman of wit and spirit and know very well of what importance this step be to she fortune she get out of the town in disguise and make the best of she way in a post-chaise to holland from whence she embark with the king and arrive at the same time with he in england which be enough to make she call he mistress or at least so great a favorite that the whole court begin to pay she uncommon respect this lady deserve that i should be a little particular in she character there be something in it worth speaking of she be past forty she have never be a beauty but certainly very agreeable in she person when adorn with youth and have once appear so charming to the king that it be say the divorce and ruin of he beautiful princess the duke of celle 's daughter be owe to the hope she mother -lrb- who be declare mistress to the king 's father and all-powerful in he court -rrb- have of set she daughter in she place and that project do not succeed by the passion which madame kielmansegg take for m kielmansegg who be a son of a merchant of hamburg and after have a child by he there be nothing leave for she but to marry he she ambition run mad with the disappointment and die in that deplorable manner leave # 40000 which she have heap by the favor of the elector to this daughter which be very easily squander by one of she temper she be both luxurious and generous devoted to she pleasure and seem to have take lord rochester 's resolution of avoid all sort of self-denial she have a greater vivacity in conversation than ever i know in a german of either sex she love reading and have a taste of all polite learn she humor be easy and sociable she constitution incline she to gallantry she be well-bred and amusing in company she know both how to please and be pleased and have experience enough to know it be hard to do either without money she unlimited expense have leave she with very little remain and she make what haste she could to make advantage of the opinion the english have of she power with the king by receive the present that be make she from all quarter and which she know very well must cease when it be know that the king 's idleness carry he to she lodgings without either regard for she advice or affection for she person which time and very bad paint have leave without any of the charm which have once attract he he best-beloved mistress remain still at hanover which be the beautiful countess of platen perhaps it will be think a digression in this place to tell the story of he amour with she but as i write only for myself i shall always think i be at liberty to make what digression i think fit proper or improper besides that in my opinion can set the king 's character in a clearer light that lady be marry to madame kielmansegg 's brother the most considerable man in hanover for birth and fortune and she beauty be as far beyond that of any of the other woman that appear however the king see she every day without take notice of it and contented himself with he habitual commerce with mademoiselle schulenburg in those little court there be no distinction of much value but what arise from the favor of the prince and madame platen saw with great indignation that all she charm be pass over unregarded and she take a method to get over this misfortune which would never have enter into the head of a woman of sense and yet which meet with wonderful success she ask a audience of he highness who grant it without guess what she mean by it and she tell he that as nobody could refuse she the first rank in that place it be very mortifying to see he highness not show she any mark of favor and as no person could be more attach to he person than herself she beg with tear in she fine eye that he would alter he behavior to she the elector very much astonish at this complaint answer that he do not know any reason he have give she to believe he be want in respect for she and that he think she not only the greatest lady but the greatest beauty of the court ` if that be true sire ' reply she sob ` why do you pass all you time with mademoiselle schulenburg while i hardly receive the honor of a visit from you ' he highness promise to mend he manners and from that time be very assiduous in wait upon she this end in a fondness which she husband dislike so much that he part with she and she have the glory of possess the heart and person of she master and to turn the whole stream of courtier that use to attend mademoiselle schulenburg to she side however he do not break with he first love and often go to she apartment to cut paper which be he chief employment there which the countess of platen easily permit he have often occasion for he absence she be naturally gallant and after have thus satisfied she ambition pursue she warmer inclination young cragg come about this time to hanover where he father send he to take a view of that court in he tour of travel he be in he first bloom of youth and vigor and have so strong a appearance of that perfection that it be call beauty by the generality of woman : though in my opinion there be a coarseness in he face and shape that have more the air of a porter than a gentleman and if fortune have not interpose she almighty power he might by he birth have appear in that figure he father be nothing more considerable at he first appearance in the world than footman to lady mary mordaunt the gallant duchess of norfolk who have always half a dozen intrigue to manage some servant must always be trust in affair of that kind and jame cragg have the good fortune to be choose for that purpose she find he both faithful and discreet and he be soon advance to the dignity of _ valet-de-chambre _ king jame ii have a amour with she after he be upon the throne and respect the queen enough to endeavor to keep it entirely from she knowledge jame cragg be the messenger between the king and the duchess and do not fail to make the best use of so important a trust he scrape a great deal of money from the bounty of this royal lover and be too inconsiderable to be hurt by he ruin and do not concern much for that of he mistress which by lower intrigue happen soon after this fellow from the report of all party and even from that of he profess enemy have a very uncommon genius a head well turn for calculation great industry and be so just a observer of the world that the meanness of he education never appear in he conversation the duke of marlborough who be sensible how well he be qualify for affair that require secrecy employ he as he procurer both for woman and money and he acquit himself so well of these trust as to please he master and yet raise a considerable fortune by turn he money in the public fund the secret of which come often to he knowledge by the duke 's employ he he have this only son whom he look on with the partiality of a parent and resolve to spare nothing in he education that could add to he figure young cragg have great vivacity a happy memory and flow elocution he be brave and generous and have a appearance of open-heartedness in he manner that gain he a universal good-will if not a universal esteem it be true there appear a heat and want of judgment in all he word and action which do not make he valuable in the eye of cool judge but madame platen be not of that number he youth and fire make he appear very well worthy of he passionate address two people so well disposed towards each other be very soon in the closest engagement and the first proof madame platen give he of she affection be introduce he to the favor of the elector who take it on she word that he be a young man of extraordinary merit and he name he for cofferer at he first accession to the crown of england and i believe it be the only place that he then dispose of from any inclination of he own this proof of madame platen 's favor hinder she coming hither bernstorff be afraid she might meddle in the distribution of place that he be willing to keep in he own hand and he represent to the king that the roman catholic religion that she profess be a insuperable objection to she appearance at the court of england at least so early but he give she private hope that thing might be so arrange as to make she admittance easy when the king be settle in he new dominion and with this hope she consent without much concern to let he go without she not reflect that weak mind lose all impression by even short absence but as she own understanding do not furnish she with very great refinement she be trouble with none of the fear that would have affect a stronger head and have too good a opinion of she own beauty to believe anything in england could efface it while madame kielmansegg attach herself to the one thing necessary -- get what money she could by the sale of place and the credulity of those who think themselves very polite in secure she favor lord halifax be one of this number he ambition be unbounded and he aim at no less than the treasurer 's staff and think himself in a fine road for it by furnish madame kielmansegg both with money and a lover mr methuen be the man he pick out for that purpose he be one of the lord of the treasury he be handsome and well-made he have wit enough to be able to affect any part he please and a romantic turn in he conversation that could entertain a lady with as many adventure as othello -- and it be no ill way of gain desdemona woman be very apt to take they lover ' character from they own mouth and if you will believe mr methuen 's account of himself neither artamene nor oroondate ever have more valor honor constancy and discretion half of these bright quality be enough to charm madame kielmansegg and they be soon in the strictest familiarity which continue for different reason to the pleasure of both party till the arrival of mademoiselle schulenburg which be hasten by the german minister who envy the money accumulate by madame kielmansegg which they long to turn into another channel which they think would be more easily draw into they own hand they take care to inform mademoiselle schulenburg of the fond reception all the german meet with in england and give she a view of the immense fortune that wait she here this be enough to cure she fear and she arrive accompany by a young niece who have already make some noise at hanover she have project the conquest of the prince of wale and have so far succeed as to obtain he favor for some month but the princess who dread a rival to she power soon put a end to the correspondence and she be no longer possess of he good grace when she come hither i have not yet give the character of the prince the fire of he temper appear in every look and gesture which be unhappily under the direction of a small understanding be every day throw he upon some indiscretion he be naturally sincere and he pride tell he that he be place above constraint not reflect that a high rank carry along with it a necessity if a more decent and regular behavior than be expect from those who be not set in so conspicuous a light he be far from be of that opinion that he look on all man and woman he see as creature he might kick or kiss for he diversion and whenever he meet with any opposition in those design he think he opposer insolent rebel to the will of god who create they for he use and judge of the merit of all people by they submission to he order or the relation they have to he power and in this view he look upon the princess as the most meritorious of she sex and she take care to keep he in that sentiment by all the art she be mistress of he have marry she by inclination he good-natured father have be so complaisant as to let he choose a wife for himself she be of the house of anspach and bring he no great addition either of money or alliance but be at that time esteem a german beauty and have genius which qualify she for the government of a fool and make she despicable in the eye of man of sense i mean a low cunning which give she a inclination to cheat all the people she converse with and often cheated herself in the first place by show she the wrong side of she interest not have understanding enough to observe that falsehood in conversation like red on the face should be use very seldom and very sparingly or they destroy that interest and beauty which they be design to heighten she first thought on she marriage be to secure to herself the sole and whole direction of she spouse and to that purpose she counterfeit the most extravagant fondness for he person yet at the same time so devoted to he pleasure -lrb- which she often tell he be the rule of all she thought and action -rrb- that whenever he think proper to find they with other woman she even love whoever be instrumental to he entertainment and never resent anything but what appear to she a want of respect for he and in this light she really could not help take notice that the present make to she on she wedding be not worthy of he bride and at least she ought to have have all he mother 's jewel this be enough to make he lose all respect for he indulgent father he downright abuse he minister and talk impertinently to he old grandmother the princess sophium which end in such a coldness towards all he family as left he entirely under the government of he wife the indolent elector contented himself with show he resentment by he silence towards he and this be the situation the family first appear in when they come into england this behavior do not however hinder scheme be lay by various person of gratify they ambition or make they fortune by particular attachment to each of the royal family chapter vii at herrenhausen and st jame -lrb- 1714-1716 -rrb- the elector george lewi not delighted at he accession to the british throne -- a greater man in hanover than in london -- lady mary modify she first impression of the king -- she be in high favor at court -- a amusing incident at st jame 's -- the early unpopularity of george i in england generally and especially in the capital -- the hanoverian in the royal household -- the duchess of kendal -- the countess of darlington -- lady mary 's description of the hanoverian lady -- the duchess of kendal 's passion for money -- she influence with the king in political matter -- count de broglie -- the scandal about lady darlington refute -- lady mary and the prince of wale -- the king and the prince of wale -- the poet and wit of the day -- gay 's tribute to lady mary -- pope 's verse on she -- court poem it be beyond question that the accession to the british throne give no thrill of pleasure to the king he be fifty-four year of age and have no desire to change he state it be necessary for he as the present writer have say elsewhere now to go from a country where he be absolute to another where so far from be supreme when king and people differ on a matter of vital importance the monarch have to give way -- the price of resistance have be fix at worst at death at best exile or civil war he have to go from a country where he be the wealthiest and most important personage to another where he would be merely regard as a minor german princeling set up as a figurehead and where many of the gentry be wealthier than he this point be appreciate by lady mary when she go to hanover in November 1716 for she write from there to the countess of bristol : i have now make the tour of germany and can not help observe difference between travel here and in england one see none of those fine seat of nobleman that be so common among we nor anything like a country gentleman 's house though they have many situation perfectly fine but the whole people be divide into absolute sovereignty where all the riches and magnificence be at court or community of merchant such as nuremberg and frankfort where they live always in town for the convenience of trade worse than all george must set forth by no means sure of he reception and with no love nor even like for the people over whom he be call to reign that he do go at all be greatly to he credit for he be doubtful if he would be allow to remain and he never revisit hanover without some suspicion that he might not be able to return to england he would have be a much happier man if he could have remain at he beloved herrenhausen he never feel he owe britain anything and indeed he do not : the throne have be settle on he mother not for love of she but simply because she be the only alternative to the succession of the dreaded roman catholic heir so george come as a visitor rather submit to be king of england than anxious for the honor prepare to be force by circumstance to return little dream that two hundred year later he descendant would be firmly seat upon he throne it may be mention that lady mary as she become better acquaint with the king grow to like he in the letter from hanover just quote she say : he majesty dine and sup constantly in public the court be very numerous and he affability and goodness make it one of the most agreeable place in the world to I the king be indeed at he best when in residence at herrenhausen lord peterborough say that george be so happy there that he believe he have forget _ the accident that occur to he and he family on the 1st of August _ 1714 it may be that the king have take a great fancy to lady mary modify that lady 's earlier impression when she and she husband go to hanover the king as she mention in one of she letter to lady bristol have have the goodness to appoint we a lodging in one part of the palace without which we should be very ill accommodate for the vast number of english crowd the town so much it be very good luck to be able to get one sorry room in a miserable tavern i dine to-day with the portuguese ambassador who think himself very happy to have two wretched parlor in a inn lady mary be indeed in high favor at the court of hanover and st jame 's mr wortley and he lady be here the british minister at hanover john clavering write in December 1716 to lady cowper they be so very impatient to see he majesty that they travel night and day from vienna here she ladyship be mighty gay and airy and occasion a great deal of discourse since she arrival the king have take but little notice of any other lady not even of madame kielmansegg which the lady of hanover do not relish very much for my part i can not help rejoice to see he majesty prefer we to the german it be evidently before that the follow incident occur lady mary often go to st jame 's but as it be very dull there be often glad to go instead to some less August and more amusing assembly one evening lady mary particularly desire to leave early and induce the duchess of kendal to persuade the king to dismiss she the king reluctantly acquiesce though when lady mary make she bow he declare it be a act of perfidy to run away but in spite of that and other complimentary remark she at last contrived to make she escape at the foot of the staircase she meet mr secretary cragg who see she leave so early enquire if the king have retire but she reassure he on that point and dwelt complacently on the king 's reluctance to let she go cragg make no remark but take she in he arm run upstairs and deposit she in the ante-chamber whereupon the page at once throw open the door lead to the king 's apartment _ ah la re-voilà _ cry he majesty and the duchess of kendal and express they pleasure that she have change she mind but lady mary be so flustered that instead of maintain a discreet silence she burst out oh lord sir i have be so frightened and related she adventure she have scarcely finish relate she adventure when the door be throw open and mr secretary cragg be announce he enter calmly and make he bow as if nothing have happen but the king stride up to he and say angrily : _ mai comment donc monsieur cragg est ce que c'est l'usage de ce pay de porter des belle dame comme un sac de froment _ -lrb- be it the custom of this country to carry about fair lady as if they be a sack of wheat -rrb- the culprit be dumbfounded by the unexpected attack and glance reproachfully at lady mary for have betray he but soon find he wit parry with there be nothing i would not do for you majesty 's satisfaction one of the reason for the early unpopularity of george i be that he bring with he a large suite from hanover the household that accompany he number sixty-three there be baron von kielmansegg who be master of the horse count von platen son of the late prime minister of hanover and baron von hardenburg marshal of the court with they come the lutheran clergyman braun a group of physician surgeon and apothecary five body-servant include the turk mahomet and mustapha four page two trumpeter a carver twelve footman eighteen cook three cellarman two housemaid and one washerwoman it may be mention that in 1696 there be only two washerwoman for the three hundred and seven person exclusive of royalty that at this date make up the court of hanover the political staff that come include twenty-three person baron von bothmer be already in england now arrive baron von bernstorff prime minister of hanover baron von schlitz-goertz hanoverian finance minister baron von hattorf hanoverian minister of war and john robethon to these man who advise the king in he capacity of elector of hanover there would have be no objection have they confine they energy to administer that country this unfortunately be not the case some of they at least notably bernstorff and robethon meddle in english politics and most of they desire high office lucrative appointment peerage and other grant it be certain that they must have know that they be bar from such delight by a act of 1700 which carefully guard against foreigner acquire any share in the government of this country nothing in fact could be more definite than clause three of the act for the further limitation of the crown : no person bear out of the kingdom of england scotland or ireland or the dominion thereunto belong -lrb- although he be naturalised or make a denizen except such as be bear of english parent -rrb- so run clause three of the above-mentioned act shall be capable of the privy council or a member of either house of parliament or to enjoy any office or place of trust either civil or military or to have any grant of land tenement or hereditament from the crown to himself or to any other or other in trust for he still act of parliament have be repeal and the invader may well have hope that with the king 's support they influence might increase until they be strong enough to have the clause revoke as a matter of fact nothing of the kind happen and no hanoverian statesman or court officer be appoint to any place of profit under the crown or reward for he service in the electorate by the grant of a british peerage it may be note that the hanoverian official fond as all german be and be of wordy distinction style themselves koenigliche-gross-britannische-kurfuerstlich-braunschweig-lueneburgische -lrb- royal-british-electoral-brunswick-luenburg -rrb- councillor or magistrate the hanoverian who be on the political side or hold post in the household might by the exercise of a little tact have live down a unpopularity that be the result of circumstance rather than arise from any personal animosity that they do not do so may be ascribe partly anyhow to they own fault on the other hand nothing probably would have overcome the prejudice against the lady who follow george to this country these be the countess ehrengard melusina von der schulenburg who in 1716 be create duchess of munster in the irish peerage and three year after duchess of kendal by which latter title she be more generally know and the baroness von kielmansegg -lrb- _ née _ platen -rrb- who be presently elevated to the dignity of countess of darlington it be generally assure that these lady be the king 's mistress and they be accordingly dislike not only at court but also by the mob one of they when drive in london be assail by term of abuse -- as she understand scarcely any english she could only go by the tone of the voice -- and put she head out of the coach say : good people why abuse we we come for all you goods yes damn you cry someone and for we chattel too the man in the crowd only voice the general opinion and it must be say the general opinion be not far remove from the truth of course the jacobite make the most of this and as horace walpole have relate the seraglio be food for all the venom of the jacobite and indeed nothing could be grosser that be vomit out in lampoon libel and every channel of abuse against the sovereign and the new court and chant even in they hearing in the public street it be mention in _ walpoliana _ that this couple of rabbit the favorite as they be call occasion much jocularity on they first importation some of the jocularity be arouse by they appearance the style of beauty or what pass for beauty in each country be markedly different hear lady mary wortley montagu write from hanover in December 1716 : i have now get into the region of beauty she tell lady rich all the woman have literally rosy cheek snowy forehead and bosom jet eye-brow and scarlet lip to which they generally add coal-black hair these perfection never leave they till the hour of they death and have a very fine effect by candle-light but i could wish they be handsome with a little more variety they resemble one another as much as mr salmon 's court of great britain and be in much danger of melting away by too near approach the fire which they for that reason carefully avoid though it be now such excessively cold weather that i believe they suffer extremely by that piece of self-denial the duchess of kendal at the time of the accession of george i be forty-seven year of age the king 's mother the electress sophium have comment on she to mr howard : look at that mawkin and think of she be my son 's passion if a family portrait now in the possession of count werner schulenburg may be trust she be what be call a fine figure of a woman she have blue eye and fair hair she be so tall that she be nickname in england the may-pole she be certainly determine to make the most of she opportunity and the more eager because at the beginning of the reign she be very doubtful whether george i would not have hurriedly to retire to hanover for good and all so doubtful of the likelihood of the duration of the hanoverian line in this country be she that at first she decline to accompany the elector and she only change she mind when she find the baroness von kielmansegg have decide to go to england she be in high favor with george and take every advantage of she influence she leave a immense fortune which be acquire in way into which a eulogistic biographer of the lady would not enquire certainly she receive for she good office large sum of money from the promoter of the south sea act she accept bribe to secure peerage and it be say on the authority of sir robert walpole that bolingbroke present she with # 11000 to endeavor to secure he restoration to the royal favor it may be remark _ en passant _ that spence record that lady mary wortley montagu say to he : i would never be acquaint with lord bolingbroke because i always look upon he as a vile man duchess of kendal be not content with indulge she passion for money she in matter of politics act as the hidden hand behind the throne -- any service that she render be it be certain adequately remunerate she ascendancy over the king be unquestionable and walpole be compel to admit that she be in effect as much queen of england as ever any be that he do everything by she she not only use she power in connection with home affair but also in matter of foreign policy and the count de broglie french minister of the court of st jame be urgent in he endeavor to secure she support as the duchess of kendal seem to express a wish to see I often i have be very attentive to she be convince that it be highly essential to the advantage of you majesty 's service to be on good term with she for she be closely unite with the three minister who now govern the count write to loui xv on July 6 1724 and four day later return to the subject : the more i consider state affair the more i be convince that the government be entirely in the hand of mr walpole lord townshend and the duchess of newcastle who be on the best term with the duchess of kendal the king visit she every afternoon from five till eight and it be there that she endeavor to penetrate the sentiment of he britannic majesty for the purpose of consult the three minister and pursue the measure which may be think necessary for accomplish they design she send I word that she be desirous of my friendship and that i should place confidence in she i assure she that i would do everything in my power to merit she esteem and friendship i be convince that she may be advantageously employ in promote you majesty 's service and that it will be necessary to employ she though i will not trust she further than be absolutely necessary to these letter loui reply on July 18 : there be no doubt that the duchess of kendal have a great ascendancy over the king of great britain and maintain strict union with he minister must materially influence they principal resolution you will neglect nothing to acquire a share of she confidence from a conviction that nothing can be more conducive to my interest there be however a manner of give additional value to the mark of confidence you bestow on she in private by avoid in public all appearance which might seem too point by which mean you will avoid fall into the inconvenience of be suspect by those who be not friendly to the duchess at the same time that a kind of mysteriousness in public on the subject of you confidence will give rise to a firm belief of you have form a friendship mutually sincere the case of lady darlington be different it be assure generally that she too be a mistress of the king a view that lady mary wortley montagu accept and one which be endorse by the historian and biographer for more than a century the first english writer to discover the truth be carlyle who in he _ life of frederick the great _ say : miss kielmansegg countess of darlington be and be believe by the gossip english to have be a second simultaneous mistress of he majesty 's but seem after all to have be he half-sister and nothing more she be in fact a daughter of the countess of platen -lrb- _ née _ clara elizabeth von meysenbach -rrb- not indeed by that lady 's husband but by ernest augustus duke -lrb- afterwards elector -rrb- of hanover the father of george i only lady cowper seem to have know this and to have accept it as a fact yet there be no secrecy concern the paternity of the countess and it be of course well-known in the german court further it be overlook that in the patent of nobility in 1721 there be a reference to the royal blood of the recipient of the title and actually the patent in addition to the great seal have a miniature of the king and the arm of the house of platen kielmansegg and great britain -lrb- brunswick-lueneburg -rrb- with the bar-sinister -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : refutation of the scandal

kielmansegg -rrb- all this at this time must have be very distressing to lady darlington for she be very careful of she reputation as the follow amusing incident give in lady cowper 's diary -lrb- February 4 1716 -rrb- indicate : madame kielmansegg have be tell that the prince afterwards george ii have say that she intrigue with all the man at hanover she come to complain of this to the princess who reply she do not believe the prince have say so it not be he custom to speak in that manner madame kielmansegg cry and say it have make she despise and that many of she acquaintance have leave she upon that story but that she husband have take all the care she could to vindicate she reputation and thereupon she draw forth a certificate under she husband 's hand in which he certify in all the due form that she have always be a faithful wife to he and that he have never have any cause to suspect she honesty the princess smile and say she do not doubt it at all and that all the trouble be very unnecessary and that it be a very bad reputation that want such a support in appearance lady darlington be a contrast to the duchess of kendal she be in she youth a good-looking woman but as the year pass she become immensely corpulent and horace walpole who see she at he mother 's when he be a child thus describe she : two fierce black eye large and rolling between two lofty arched eye-brow two acre of cheek spread with crimson a ocean of neck that overflow and be not distinguish from the lower part of she body and no part restrain by stay he christen she elephant and castle for a while lady mary be popular also with the prince of wale who be attract by she look and she vivacity it be record that on one occasion when lady mary appear in a gown more than usually become the prince call he wife from the card table to admire she the princess come look and then say calmly lady mary always dress so well and go on with she game it be impossible however even for the most tactful person in the world to be on good term with the king and the prince of wale it be say of george i that he be of a affectionate disposition and that throughout he life he hate only three people in the world : he mother who be dead he wife who be imprison at ahlden and he son it have be say that the trouble begin when in he early youth the prince express sympathy with he mother it may be that it start from the fact that the prince be the son of a woman who have sully the honor of the royal house it be however unnecessary to look for reason to hate the heir-apparent be a tradition with the george matter do not improve after the accession of george i to the british throne he dislike he daughter-in-law caroline daughter of john frederick margrave of brandenburg-anspach and speak of she as _ cette diablesse madame la princesse _ the opposition be not slow to take advantage of the rift and plant itself on the side of he royal highness it propose on the civil list vote a separate revenue of # 100000 for the prince -- which infuriate the king as it be intend to do in 1716 george be anxious to visit he beloved hanover but he be tear between the desire to do so and the dislike to leave he son in england as regent during he absence indeed he almost decide not to go unless he could join other with the prince in the administration and limit he authority by the most rigorous restriction to this however the government could not consent and townshend state that on a careful persual of precedent find no instance of person be join in commission with the prince of wale and few if any restriction they be of opinion that the constant tenor of ancient practice could not conveniently be recede from lady mary like the rest of the world find the court dull and she much prefer to spend she time in the more congenial society of man of letter addison she know and steele and arbuthnot and jerva and gay who presently pay she a pretty compliment in _ mr pope 's welcome from greece _ wherein he insert tribute to the lady of the court : what lady 's that to whom he gently bend who know she not ah those be wortley 's eye how art thou honor would number would with she friend for she distinguish the good and wise pope too write of she with appreciation : to lady mary wortley montagu i in beauty or wit no mortal as yet to question you empire have dare but

have she what a punishment new shall be find out for you who tasting have robb have the whole tree the acquaintance with pope begin shortly after lady mary come to town in the autumn of 1714 it soon develop into friendship lady mary wortley jerva write to the poet probably in 1715 or early in the following year order I by express this morning _ cedente gayo et ridente fortescuvio _ to send you a letter or some other proper notice to come to she on Thursday about five which i suppose she mean in the evening there appear in march 1716 a volume bear the title _ court poem _ the authorship be attribute to a lady of quality who it soon become know be lady mary the book be issue by robert who have receive the three set of verse contain in it from the notorious piratical publisher edmund curll how the manuscript fall into the hand of curll it be not easy to imagine curll 's account be that they be find in a pocket-book take up in westminster hall on the last day of the trial of the jacobite lord winton anyhow however it come about the volume be publish in 1716 when it be find to contain the basset table the draw room and the toilet curll be a excellent publicity agent for he wares he write or cause to be write a most intriguing advertisement about the authorship of the poem : upon read they over at st jame ' coffee house they be attribute by the general voice to be the production of a lady of quality when i produce they at button 's the poetical jury there bring in a different verdict and the foreman strenuously insist upon it that mr gay be the man not content with these two decision i be resolve to call in a umpire and accordingly choose a gentleman of distinguished merit who live not far from chelsea i send he the papers which he return next day with this answer : sir depend upon it these line could come from no other hand than the judicious translator of homer thus have impartially give the sentiment of the town i hope i may deserve thanks for the pain i have take in endeavor to find out the author of these valuable performance and everybody be at liberty to bestow the laurel as they please pope be furious and there be a story that he invite curll to drink wine with he at a coffee-house and put in he glass some poison that act as a emetic what be certain be that the poet write a pamphlet with the title a full and true account of a horrid and barbarous revenge by poison on the body of edmund curll the three piece in _ court poem _ be claim by lady mary as she own but this claim be dispute pope declare himself the author of the basset table and it be print among he work and he assert that ` the toilet ' be almost wholly gay 's there be only five or six line in it by that lady the toilet be include in he collect edition of gay 's poem the whole matter be best explain by that sound student of the eighteenth century george paston who suggest that the truth seem to be that the verse be hand round in manuscript to be read and correct by the writer 's literary friend and therefore they owe something to the different hand george paston go on to say : lady mary be not unaware of the danger of this proceeding for richardson the painter relate that on one occasion she show pope a copy of she verse in which she intend to make some trifling alteration but refuse he help say ` no pope no touch for then whatever be good for

montagu be remove have not transpire it may indeed be that he resign for he have a strong dislike for the new minister there may also have be some family sentiment in the matter for while lady mary be a intimate friend of walpole 's harum-scarum sister dolly who be now lady townshend lady walpole be very decidedly she enemy lady mary presently have she tit-for-tat with lady walpole by take up

country be ignore he may even have approach the throne it be not inconceivable that he make himself a nuisance to all concerned anyhow it be ultimately decide that something must be do with he but what austrium and turkey be at war in 1716 what better than to send montagu as ambassador to the porte with a mission to endeavor to reconcile the protagonist he be appoint to this post on June 5 it be while accompany she husband on this mission that lady mary write she famous letter during the embassy to constantinople which constitute a very important document on the state of europe at the time it be by no means certain however that in the first instance these reflection be all cast in letter-form it be much more likely that some be write in a diary the letter appear as address to the countess of bristol to the princess of wale to mr thistlethwayte to lady rich to alexander pope to the abbé contus to miss sarah chiswell to mr hewet to lady mary 's sister the countess of mar and other at the beginning of August 1716 montagu with he wife and son and it be to be presume he suite leave england and after a very bad cross land at rotterdam from that city the cleanliness of which surprised and delighted lady mary -- you may see the dutch maid wash the pavement of the street with more application than ours do we bed-chamber -- the party proceed by way of the hague nimeguen cologne frankfort-on-the-main wurzberg and ratisbon to vienna where they arrive during the first week in September lady mary be all impatient to go to court for as she put it i be not without a great impatience to see a beauty that have be the admiration of so many nation but she be force to stay for a gown without which there be no wait on the empress presently the gown be ready and lady mary be present i be squeeze up in a gown -lrb- she write to she sister lady mar -rrb- and adorn with a gorget and the other implement thereunto belong : a dress very inconvenient but which certainly shew the neck and shape to great advantage i can not forbear in this place give you some description of the fashion here which be more monstrous and contrary to all common sense and reason than ` tis possible for you to imagine they build certain fabric of gauze on they head about a yard high consist of three or four story fortify with numberless yard of heavy ribbon the foundation of this structure be a thing they call a _ bourle _ which be exactly of the same shape and kind but about four time as big as those roll we prudent milk-maid make use of to fix they pail upon this machine they cover with they own hair which they mix with a great deal of false it be a particular beauty to have they head too large to go into a moderate tub they hair be prodigiously powdered to conceal the mixture and set out with three or four row of bodkin -lrb- wonderfully large that stick -lrb- out -rrb- two or three inch from they hair -rrb- make of diamond pearl red green and yellow stone that it certainly require as much art and experience to carry the load upright as to dance upon may-day with the garland they whalebone petticoat outdo ours by several yard circumference and cover some acre of ground you may easily suppose how much this extraordinary dress set off and improve the natural ugliness with which god almighty have be please to endow they all generally even the lovely empress herself be oblige to comply in some degree with these absurd fashion which they would not quit for all the world the above passage be the more interesting because it have so often be assert that lady mary take no interest in dress as a matter of fact however there be several indication in she letter that she think a good deal about clothes my little commission be hardly worth speaking of if you have not already lay out that small sum in st cloud ware i have rather have it in plain lutestring of any color she write in June 1721 to she sister lady mar at paris i would have no black silk have buy here she say on another occasion and again my paper be do and i will only put you in mind of my lutestring which i beg you will send I plain of what color you please dear sister adieu she write in 1723 i have be very free in this letter because i think i be sure of its go safe i wish my nightgown may do the same : i only choose that as most convenient to you but if it be equally so i have rather the money be lay out in plain lutestr if you could send I eight yard at a time of different color design it for lining but if this scheme be impracticable send I a nightgown _ à la mode _ apparently lady mar be careless or forgetful of the commission for a little later lady mary be write pathetically : i wish you would think of my lutestring for i be in terrible want of lining the account of the austrian court of the day as give by lady mary be invaluable for there be no other available write by a english person accustom to another court lady mary 's description of viennese society be also delightful and if she write of the royal circle with respect she bubble over with merriment when write of folk less highly place a letter of hers to lady rich be too delicious to be omit i have compassion for the mortification that you tell I befall we little friend and i pity she much more since i know that they be only owe to the barbarous custom of we country upon my word if she be here she would have no other fault but be something too young for the fashion and she have nothing to do but to transplant hither about seven year hence to be again a young and bloom beauty i can assure you that wrinkle or a small stoop in the shoulder nay even gray hair itself be no objection to the make new conquest i know you can not easily figure to yourself a young fellow of five-and-twenty ogle my lady suffolk with passion or press to lead the countess of oxford from a opera but such be the sight i see every day and i do not perceive any body surprise at they but myself a woman till five-and-thirty be only look upon as a raw girl and can possibly make no noise in the world till about forty i do not know what you ladyship may think of this matter but ` tis a considerable comfort to I to know there be upon earth such a paradise for old woman and i be content to be insignificant at present in the design of return when i be fit to appear nowhere else i can not help lament upon this occasion the pitiful case of too many good english lady long since retire to prudery and ratafium whom if they star have luckily conduct hither would still shine in the first rank of beauty and then that perplexing word reputation have quite another meaning here than what you give it at london and get a lover be so far from lose that ` tis properly get reputation lady be much more respect in regard to the rank of they lover than that of they husband but what you 'll think very odd the two sect that divide we whole nation of petticoat be utterly unknown here be neither coquette nor prude no woman dare appear coquette enough to encourage two lover at a time and i have not see any such prude as to pretend fidelity to they husband who be certainly the best-natured set of people in the world and they look upon they wife ' gallant as favourably as man do upon they deputy that take the troublesome part of they business off of they hand though they have not the less to do for they be generally deputy in another place themselves in one word ` tis the established custom for every lady to have two husband one that bear the name and another that perform the duty and these engagement be so well know that it would be a downright affront and publicly resent if you invite a woman of quality to dinner without at the same time invite she two attendant of lover and husband between whom she always sit in state with great gravity these sub-marriage generally last twenty year together and the lady often command the poor lover 's estate even to the utter ruin of he family though they be as seldom begin by any passion as other match but a man make but a ill figure who be not in some commerce of this nature and a woman look out for a lover as soon as she be marry as part of she equipage without which she could not be genteel and the first article of the treaty be establish the pension which remain to the lady though the gallant should prove inconstant and this chargeable point of honor i look upon as the real foundation of so many wonderful instance of constancy i really know several woman of the first quality whose pension be as well know as they annual rent and yet nobody esteem they the less on the contrary they discretion would be call in question if they should be suspect to be mistress for nothing and a great part of they emulation consist in try who shall get most and have no intrigue at all be so far a disgrace that i 'll assure you a lady who be very much my friend here tell I but yesterday how much i be oblige to she for justify my conduct in a conversation on my subject where it be publicly assert that i could not possibly have common sense that i have be about town above a fortnight and have make no step towards commence a amour my friend plead for I that my stay be uncertain and she believe that be the cause of my seeming stupidity and this be all she could find to say in my justification but lady mary though only twenty-seven and therefore accord to she own account much too youthful for the gallant of vienna yet have a experience : but one of the pleasantest adventure i ever meet in my life be last night and which will give you a just idea after what a delicate manner the _ belle passion _ be manage in this country i be at the assembly of the countess of -- and the young count of -- lead I down stair and he ask I how long i intend to stay here i make answer that my stay depend on the emperor and it be not in my power to determine it well madam -lrb- say he -rrb- whether you time here be to be long or short i think you ought to pass it agreeably and to that end you must engage in a little affair of the heart -- my heart -lrb- answer i gravely enough -rrb- do not engage very easily and i have no design of parting with it i see madam -lrb- say he sigh -rrb- by the ill nature of that answer that i be not to hope for it which be a great mortification to I that be charm with you but however i be still devote to you service and since i be not worthy of entertaining you myself do I the honor of let I know whom you like best among we and i 'll engage to manage the affair entirely to you satisfaction -- you may judge in what manner i should have receive this compliment in my own country but i be well enough acquaint with the way of this to know that he really intend I a obligation and thank he with a grave courtesy for he zeal to serve I and only assure he that i have no occasion to make use of it thus you see my dear gallantry and good-breeding be as different in different climate as morality and religion who have the rightest notion of both we shall never know till the day of judgment for which great day of _ éclaircissement _ i own there be very little impatience in you & c love-making be indeed one of the principal pastime at vienna there be count tarrocco -lrb- who be in attendance on the prince of portugal -rrb- and as she tell lady mar just such a roman catholic as you he succeed greatly with the devout beauty here she go on to say he first overture in gallantry be disguise under the luscious strain of spiritual love that be sing formerly by the sublimely voluptuous fenelon and the tender madam guion who turn the spirit of carnal love to divine object thus the count begin with the spirit and end generally with the flesh when he make he address to holy virgin presently she tease she sister about this same young man count tarrocco be just come in she write he be the only person i have except in my general order to receive no company -- i think i see you smile -- but i be not so far go as to stand in need of absolution though as my heart be deceitful and the count very agreeable you may think that even though i should not want a absolution i would nevertheless be glad to have a indulgence -- no such thing however as i be a heretic and you no confessor i shall make no more declaration on this head -- the design of the count 's visit be a ball -- more pleasure -- i shall be surfeit the phlegm of the country surprise lady mary who declare that it be not from austrium that one could write with vivacity -- and by she letter at once disprove she statement accord to she amours and quarrel be carry on calmly and almost good-temperedly strong feeling only come into play when point of ceremony be concern a man not only scorn to marry a woman of family less illustrious than he own but even to make love to she -- the pedigree be much more consider by they than either the complexion or feature of they mistress happy be the she that can number among they ancestor count of the empire they have neither occasion for beauty money or good conduct to get they husband how far this passion for rank and precedence go be indicate by a amusing incident relate by lady mary ` tis not long since two coach meeting in a narrow street at night the lady in they not be able to adjust the ceremonial of which should go back sit there with equal gallantry till two in the morning and be both so fully determine to die upon the spot rather than yield in a point of that importance that the street would never have be clear till they death if the emperor have not send he guard to part they and even then they refuse to stir till the expedient be find out of take they both out in chair exactly at the same moment after which it be with some difficulty the _ pas _ be decide between the two coachman no less tenacious of they rank than the lady lady mary herself be of course unaffected because as the wife of a ambassador she by they own custom have the _ pas _ before all other lady -- to the great envy of the town lady mary who have have enough of solitude during she long residence in yorkshire now in vienna be determine to enjoy herself and fling herself into all the social gaiety she go everywhere and meet everyone she dine at the villa of count schönbrunn the vice-chancellor she attend all the assembly of madame rabutin and the other leader of society and all the gala day she dance she go to the theater and then as a contrast to a nunnery which leave she unhappy as indeed she put on record : i be surprise to find here the only beautiful young woman i have see at vienna and not only beautiful but genteel witty and agreeable of a great family and who have be the admiration of the town i could not forbear shew my surprise at see a nun like she she make I a thousand oblige compliment and desire I to come often it will be a infinite pleasure to I -lrb- say she sigh -rrb- to see you but i avoid with the greatest care see any of my former acquaintance and whenever they come to we convent i lock myself in my cell i observe tear come into she eye which touch I extremely and i begin to talk to she in that strain of tender pity she inspire I with but she would not own to I that she be not perfectly happy i have since endeavor to learn the real cause of she retirement without be able to get any other account but that every body be surprise at it and nobody guess the reason i have be several time to see she but it give I too much melancholy to see so agreeable a young creature bury alive and i be not surprise that nun have so often inspired violent passion the pity one naturally feel for they when they seem worthy of another destiny make a easy way for yet more tender sentiment and i never in my life have so little charity for the roman-catholic religion as since i see the misery it occasion so many poor unhappy woman and the gross superstition of the common people who be some or other of they day and night offering bit of candle to the wooden figure that be set up almost in every street the procession i see very often be a pageantry as offensive and apparently contradictory to all common sense as the pagoda of china god know whether it be the womanly spirit of contradiction that work in I but there never before be so much zeal against popery in the heart of dear madam & c in November the montagus interrupt they stay at vienna to visit some of the german court they go to prague where the attire of the lady amuse lady mary i have be visit by some of the most considerable lady whose relation i know at vienna she write to lady mar they be dress after the fashion there as people at exeter imitate those of london that be the imitation be more excessive than the original ` tis not easy to describe what extraordinary figure they make the person be so much lose between head-dress and petticoat they have as much occasion to write upon they back ` this be a woman ' for the information of traveller as ever sign-post painter have to write ` this be a bear ' from prague to dresden travel thither by a most alarming route : you may imagine how heartily i be tire with twenty-four hour ' post-travelling -lrb- to dresden -rrb- without sleep or refreshment -lrb- for i can never sleep in a coach however fatigue -rrb- we pass by moonshine the frightful precipice that divide bohemia from saxony at the bottom of which run the river elbe but i can not say that i have reason to fear drown in it be perfectly convince that in case of a tumble it be utterly impossible to come alive to the bottom in many place the road be so narrow that i could not discern a inch of space between the wheel and the precipice yet i be so good a wife not to wake mr wortley who be fast asleep by my side to make he share in my fear since the danger be unavoidable till i perceive by the bright light of the moon we postilion nod on horseback while the horse be on a full gallop and i think it very convenient to call out to desire they to look where they be go my call wake mr wortley and he be much more surprised than myself at the situation we be in and assure I that he have pass the alp five time in different place without ever have go a road so dangerous i have be tell since it be common to find the body of traveller in the elbe but thank god that be not we destiny and we come safe to dresden so much tire with fear and fatigue it be not possible for I to compose myself to write from dresden the traveller visit leipzig and then go to brunswick and afterwards to hanover where they pay they respects to george i it be there that lady mary first make the acquaintance of the eldest son of the prince of wale frederick loui himself presently prince of wale and father of george iii he be then nine year of age i be extremely pleased that i can tell you without either flattery or partiality that we young prince have all the accomplishment that it be possible to have at he age with a air of sprightliness and understanding and something so very engaging and easy in he behavior that he need not the advantage of he rank to appear charming i have the honor of a long conversation with he last night before the king come in he governor retire on purpose -lrb- as he tell I afterwards -rrb- that i might make some judgment of he genius by hear he speak without constraint and i be surprise at the quickness and politeness that appear in every thing he say join to a person perfectly agreeable and the fine fair hair of the princess amaze as lady mary be at the size of the palace at hanover which she say be capable of hold a greater court than that of st jame 's and the opera-house which be larger than that at vienna what principally amaze she be the orangery at herrenhausen and what principally delight she be the use of stove then unknown in england i be very sorry that the ill weather do not permit I to see herrenhausen in all its beauty but in spite of the snow i think the garden very fine -lrb- she write with enthusiasm to lady mar -rrb- i be particularly surprise at the vast number of orange tree much larger than i have ever see in england though this climate be certainly colder but i have more reason to wonder that night at the king 's table there be bring to he from a gentleman of this country two large basket full of ripe orange and lemon of different sort many of which be quite new to I and what i think worth all the rest two ripe banana which to my taste be a fruit perfectly delicious you know they be naturally the growth of brazil and i could not imagine how they could come there but by enchantment upon enquiry i learn that they have bring they stove to such perfection they lengthen the summer as long as they please give to every plant the degree of heat it would receive from the sun in its native soil the effect be very near the same i be surprise we do not practice in england so useful a invention this reflection naturally lead I to consider we obstinacy in shake with cold six month in the year rather than make use of stove which be certainly one of the greatest convenience of life and so far from spoil the form of a room they add very much to the magnificence of it when they be paint and gilt as at vienna or at dresden where they be often in the shape of china jar statue or fine cabinet so naturally represent they be not to be distinguish if ever i return in defiance to the fashion you shall certainly see one in the chamber of dear sister & c chapter ix the embassy to the porte -- ii -lrb- 1717-1718 -rrb- adrianople -- turkish bath -- lady mary wear

impress she that she send home a long account of it it be not until about 1860 that they become popular in england a century and a half later i go to the bagnio about ten o'clock it be already full of woman it be build of stone in the shape of a dome with no window but in the roof which give light enough there be five of these dome join together the outmost be less than the rest and serve only as a hall where the portress stand at the door lady of quality generally give this woman the value of a crown or ten shilling and i do not forget that ceremony the next room be a very large one pave with marble and all round it raise two sofa of marble one above another there be four fountain of cold water in this room fall first into marble basin and then run on the floor in little channel make for that purpose which carry the stream into the next room something less than this with the same sort of marble sofa but so hot with steam of sulphur proceeding from the bath join to it it be impossible to stay there with one 's clothes on the two other dome be the hot bath one of which have cock of cold water turn into it to temper it to what degree of warmth the bather have a mind to i be in my travel habit which be a ride dress and certainly appear very extraordinary to they yet there be not one of they that shew the least surprise or impertinent curiosity but receive I with all the oblige civility possible i know no european court where the lady would have behave themselves in so polite a manner to a stranger i believe in the whole there be two hundred woman and yet none of those disdainful smile or satiric whisper that never fail in we assembly when any body appear that be not dress exactly in the fashion they repeat over and over to I uzelle pék uzelle which be nothing but charming very charming -- the first sofa be cover with cushion and rich carpet on which sit the lady and on the second they slave behind they but without any distinction of rank by they dress all be in the state of nature that be in plain english stark naked without any beauty or defect conceal yet there be not the least wanton smile or immodest gesture amongst they they walk and move with the same majestic grace which milton describe of we general mother there be many amongst they as exactly proportion as ever any goddess be draw by the pencil of guido or titian -- and most of they skin shiningly white only adorn by they beautiful hair divide into many tress hang on they shoulder braid either with pearl or ribbon perfectly represent the figure of the grace i be here convince of the truth of a reflection i have often make that if it be the fashion to go naked the face would be hardly observe i perceive that the lady with the finest skin and most delicate shape have the greatest share of my admiration though they face be sometimes less beautiful than those of they companion to tell you the truth i have wickedness enough to wish secretly that mr jerva -lrb- 3 -rrb- could have be there invisible i fancy it would have very much improve he art to see so many fine woman naked in different posture some in conversation some work other drink coffee or sherbet and many negligently lie on they cushion while they slave -lrb- generally pretty girl of seventeen or eighteen -rrb- be employ in braid they hair in several pretty fancy in short it be the woman 's coffee-house where all the news of the town be tell scandal invent & c -- they generally take this diversion once a-week and stay there at least four or five hour without get cold by immediate come out of the hot bath into the cold room which be very surprising to I the lady that seem the most considerable among they entreat I to sit by she and would fain have undress I for the bath i excused myself with some difficulty they be all so earnest in persuade I i be at last force to open my shirt and shew they my stay which satisfy they very well for i see they believe i be so lock up in that machine that it be not in my own power to open it which contrivance they attribute to my husband -lrb- footnote 3 : charle jerva -lrb- 1675-1739 -rrb- portrait painter and translator of _ don quixote _ the friend of pope -rrb- lady mary be much amuse by this last and refer to the incident in conversation with joseph spence one of the highest entertainment in turkey she tell he be have you to they bath and when i be introduce the lady of the house come to undress I which be another high compliment that they pay to stranger after she have slip off my gown and see my stay she be much strike at the sight of they and cry out to the other lady in the bath ` come hither and see how cruelly the poor english lady be use by they husband you need boast indeed of the superior liberty allow you when they lock you up in a box ' lady mary have a turkish dress make for she which she frequently wear when she find that the english costume make she unpleasantly conspicuous the lady at constantinople use to be extremely surprise to see I go always with my bosom uncovered she note it be in vain that i tell they that everybody do the same thing among we and allege everything i could in defense of it they could never be reconcile to so immodest a custom as they think it and one of they after i have be defend it to my utmost say : ` oh my sultana you can never defend the manners of you country even with all you wit but i see that you be in pain for they and shall therefore press it no further ' lady mary be proud of she appearance in she turkish clothes and have give a minute description of they : the first piece of my dress be a pair of drawer very full that reach to my shoe and conceal the leg more modestly than you petticoat they be of a thin rose-coloured damask brocade with silver flower my shoe be of white kid leather embroider with gold over this hang my smock of a fine white silk gauze edge with embroidery this smock have wide sleeve hang half way down the arm and be close at the neck with a diamond button but the shape and color of the bosom very well to be distinguish through it the _ antery _ be a waistcoat make close to the shape of white and gold damask with very long sleeve fall back and fringe with deep gold fringe and should have diamond or pearl button my _ caftan _ of the same stuff with my drawer be a robe exactly fit to my shape and reach to my foot with very long strait fall sleeve over this be the girdle of about four finger broad which all that can afford have entirely of diamond or other precious stone those who will not be at that expense have it of exquisite embroidery on satin but it must be fasten before with a clasp of diamond the _ curdee _ be a loose robe they throw off or put on accord to the weather being of a rich brocade -lrb- mine be green and gold -rrb- either line with ermine or sable the sleeve reach very little below the shoulder the head-dress be compose of a cap call _ talpock _ which be in winter of fine velvet embroider with pearl or diamond and in summer of a light shine silver stuff this be fix on one side of the head hang a little way down with a gold tassel and bind on either side with a circle of diamond -lrb- as i have see several -rrb- or a rich embroidered handkerchief on the other side of the head the hair be lay flat and here the lady be at liberty to shew they fancy some put flower other a plume of heron 's feather and in short what they please but the most general fashion be a large _ bouquet _ of jewel make like natural flower that be the bud of pearl the rose of different color ruby the jessamine of diamond the jonquil of topaze & c so well set and enamel ` tis hard to imagine any thing of that kind so beautiful the hair hang at its full length behind divide into tress braid with pearl or ribbon which be always in great quantity much that lady mary write be of great value in explode many ill-founded belief at home as regard turkish life and especially concern the manners and custom of turkish woman as to they morality or good conduct i can say like harlequin that ` tis just as it be with you and the turkish lady do not commit one sin the less for not be christian now i be a little acquaint with they way i can not forbear admire either the exemplary discretion or extreme stupidity of all the writer that have give account of they ` tis very easy to see they have more liberty than we have no woman of what rank soever be permit to go into the street without two muslin one that cover she face all but she eye and another that hide the whole dress of she head and hang half way down she back and they shape be wholly conceal by a thing they call a _ ferigee _ which no woman of any sort appear without this have strait sleeve that reach to they finger-end and it lap all round they not unlike a riding-hood in winter ` ti of cloth and in summer plain stuff or silk you may guess how effectually this disguise they -lrb- so -rrb- that there be no distinguish the great lady from she slave ` tis impossible for the most jealous husband to know he wife when he meet she and no man dare either touch or follow a woman in the street this perpetual masquerade give they entire liberty of follow they inclination without danger of discovery the most usual method of intrigue be to send a appointment to the lover to meet the lady at a jew 's shop which be as notoriously convenient as we indian-house and yet even those who do not make use of they do not scruple to go to buy pennyworth and tumble over rich goods which be chiefly to be find amongst that sort of people the great lady seldom let they gallant know who they be and it be so difficult to find it out that they can very seldom guess at she name they have correspond with above half a year together you may easily imagine the number of faithful wife very small in a country where they have nothing to fear from a lover 's indiscretion since we see so many that have the courage to expose themselves to that in this world and all the threatened punishment of the next which be never preach to the turkish damsel neither have they much to apprehend from the resentment of they husband those lady that be rich have all they money in they own hand which they take with they upon a divorce with a addition which he be oblige to give they upon the whole i look upon the turkish woman as the only free people in the empire : the very divan pay a respect to they and the grand signior himself when a pasha be execute never violate the privilege of the _ harem _ -lrb- or woman 's apartment -rrb- which remain unsearched and entire to the widow they be queen of they slave whom the husband have no permission so much as to look upon except it be a old woman or two that he lady choose ` tis true they law permit they four wife but there be no instance of a man of quality that make use of this liberty or of a woman of rank that would suffer it when a husband happen to be inconstant -lrb- as those thing will happen -rrb- he keep he mistress in a house apart and visit she as privately as he can just as it be with you amongst all the great man here i only know the _ tefterdar _ -lrb- ie treasurer -rrb- that keep a number of she slave for he own use -lrb- that be on he own side of the house for a slave once give to serve a lady be entirely at she disposal -rrb- and he be speak of as a libertine or what we should call a rake and he wife will not see he though she continue to live in he house thus you see dear sister the manners of mankind do not differ so widely as we voyage writer would make we believe perhaps it would be more entertaining to add a few surprising custom of my own invention but nothing seem to I so agreeable as truth and i believe nothing so acceptable to you the most fortunate thing that happen to lady mary and through she to england during she stay in adrianople be be make acquaint with the practice of inoculation then widely in vogue in turkey though she have no medical knowledge she make enquiry as to its effect and soon become convinced that it be very highly beneficial she be the more interested because a attack of small-pox have somewhat dim she beauty it be to miss sarah chiswell that she unburden herself of the discovery she have make those dreadful story you have hear of the plague have very little foundation in truth i own i have much ado to reconcile myself to the sound of a word which have always give I such terrible idea though i be convince there be little more in it than a fever as a proof of which we pass through two or three town most violently infect in the very next house where we lay -lrb- in one of those place -rrb- two person die of it luckily for I i be so well deceive that i know nothing of the matter and i be make believe that we second cook who fall ill here have only a great cold however we leave we doctor to take care of he and yesterday they both arrive here in good health and i be now let into the secret that he have have the _ plague _ there be many that escape it neither be the air ever infected i be persuade it would be as easy to root it out here as out of italy and france but it do so little mischief they be not very solicitous about it and be content to suffer this distemper instead of we variety which they be utterly unacquainted with _ a propo _ of distemper i be go to tell you a thing that i be sure will make you wish yourself here the small-pox so fatal and so general amongst we be here entirely harmless by the invention of _ ingraft _ which be the term they give it there be a set of old woman who make it they business to perform the operation every autumn in the month of September when the great heat be abate people send to one another to know if any of they family have a mind to have the small-pox they make party for this purpose and when they be meet -lrb- commonly fifteen or sixteen together -rrb- the old woman come with a nut-shell full of the matter of the best sort of small-pox and ask what vein you please to have open she immediately rip open that you offer to she with a large needle -lrb- which give you no more pain than a common scratch -rrb- and put into the vein as much venom as can lie upon the head of she needle and after bind up the little wound with a hollow bit of shell and in this manner open four or five vein the grecian have commonly the superstition of open one in the midde of the forehead in each arm and on the breast to mark the sign of the cross but this have a very ill effect all these wound leave little scar and be not do by those that be not superstitious who choose to have they in the leg or that part of the arm that be conceal the child or young patient play together all the rest of the day and be in perfect health to the eighth then the fever begin to seize they and they keep they bed two day very seldom three they have very rarely above twenty or thirty in they face which never mark and in eight day ' time they be as well as before they illness where they be wound there remain run sore during the distemper which i do not doubt be a great relief to it every year thousand undergo this operation and the french embassador say pleasantly that they take the small-pox here by way of diversion as they take the water in other country there be no example of any one that have die in it and you may believe i be very well satisfied of the safety of this experiment since i intend to try it on my dear little son i be patriot enough to take pain to bring this useful invention into fashion in england and i should not fail to write to some of we doctor very particularly about it if i know any one of they that i think have virtue enough to destroy such a considerable branch of they revenue for the good of mankind but that distemper be too beneficial to they not to expose to all they resentment the hardy wight that should undertake to put a end to it perhaps if i live to return i may however have courage to war with they upon this occasion admire the heroism in the heart of you friend & c the immediate history of inoculation so far as lady mary be concern may here briefly be give she first hear of the practice in march 1717 and within a year she faith in its effect be so strong that in the spring of the following year she have she son inoculate at pera -- he be the first english person to undergo the operation the boy be engraft last Tuesday she write to she husband the follow Sunday and be at this time singing and playing and very impatient for he supper i can not engraft the girl she nurse have not have the small-pox it be amusing to learn that the inoculation of the young edward wortley montagu prove presently to have a advantage which be certainly not at the time of the operation present to the mind of the mother at the age of six or thereabout the child run away from westminster school -- he be always run away from school -- and a reward of # 20 and expense be offer to whoever find he the advertisement give the follow clue : there be two mark by which he be easily know _ viz _ on the back of each arm about two or three inch above the wrist a small roundish scar less than a silver penny like a large mark of the small-pox when lady mary return to london she carry out she intention to introduce the operation dr maitland who have be physician to the mission to the porte set up in practice and inoculate under she patronage the heathen rite be vigorously preach against by the clergy and be violently abuse by the medical faculty undismay by the powerful opposition however she persevere in season and out until she effort be crown with success she be fortunate in enlist the co-operation of that distinguish doctor richard mead celebrate by pope in he epistle to bolingbroke i 'll do what mead and cheselden advise mead in 1720 when a epidemic of the plague be fear in london publish a treatise : a short discourse concern pestilential contagion and the method to be use to prevent it it be reprint seven time within a year and a eighth edition appease in 1722 lady mary obtain permission in 1721 to experiment on seven condemn criminal mead supervise the inoculation and all recover in the following year two member of the royal family undergo the operation successfully thereafter it become in most circle fashionable i suppose lady mary write with pardonable pride to lady mar in the spring of 1722 that the same faithful historian give you regular account of the growth and spreading of the inoculation of the small-pox which be become almost a general practice attend with great success elate as she be at the success that have result from she persistent effort she be correspondingly distressed when a young relative die of the disease i be sorry to inform you of the death of we nephew my sister gower 's son of the small-pox she say in a letter to lady mar in July 1723 i think she have a great deal of regret it in consideration of the offer i make she two year together of take the child home to my house where i would have inoculate he with the same care and safety i do my own i know nobody that have hitherto repent the operation though it have be very troublesome to some fool who have rather be sick by the doctor 's prescription than in health in rebellion to the college among those who support lady mary 's campaign be steele who congratulate she upon she godlike delight of save many thousand british life every year he write on the subject in the _ plain dealer _ -lrb- July 3 1724 -rrb- in a article that attract much attention : it be the observation of some historian but i forget where i meet with it : that _ england have ow would to woman the greatest blessing she have be distinguish would by _ in the case we be now upon this reflection will stand justified -- we be indebted to the reason and courage of a _ lady _ for the introduction of this art which give such strength in its progress that the memory of its illustrious foundress will be render would sacred by it to future age this ornament of she sex and country who ennoble she own _ nobility _ by she learning wit and vertue accompany she consort into _

we noblest and most ancient family in confirmation of she happy judgment add the daily experience of those who be most dear to they i have see a short poetical essay on the occasion we be now treat of

pass the time of day in the language of the country supervise the nurse of she child do not take a large share of she tune and she find only a mild excitement in go into the bazaar in native woman 's attire to collect oriental rug and whatnot to say truth i be sometimes very weary of this singing and dancing and sunshine and wish for the smoke and impertinency in which you toil though i endeavor to persuade myself that i live in a more agreeable variety than you do and that Monday setting of partridge -- Tuesday reading english -- Wednesday study the turkish language -lrb- in which by the way i be already very learn -rrb- -- Thursday classical author -- Friday spend in write -- Saturday at my needle -- and Sunday admit of visit and hear music be a better way of dispose the week than Monday at the drawing-room -- Tuesday lady mohun 's -- Wednesday the opera -- Thursday the play -- Friday mr chetwynd 's & c a perpetual round of hear the same scandal and see the same folly act over and over which here affect I no more than they do other dead people i can now hear of displease thing with pity and without indignation the reflection on the great gulf between you and I cool all news that come hither i can neither be sensibly touch with joy nor grief when i consider that possibly the cause of either be remove before the letter come to my hand but -lrb- as i say before -rrb- this indolence do not extend to my few friendship i be still warmly sensible of yours and mr congreve 's and desire to live in you \ remembrance though dead to all the world beside there be no doubt that it be to she pen that lady mary have recourse in she endeavor to overcome ennui a perusal of the letter write during this first sojourn in europe show that nothing escape she eye trivial or serious from the wash of the rotterdam pavement to the dwarf at the court of vienna from the palace of the great to the cosmetic use by the woman occasionally lady mary become impatient at the ignorance of she friend as regard the near east i heartily beg you ladyship 's pardon but i really could not forbear laugh heartily at you letter and the commission you be pleased to honor I with -lrb- she write to one of she acquaintance from belgrade village in June 1717 -rrb- you desire I to buy you a greek slave who be to be mistress of a thousand good quality the greek be subject and not slave those who be to be buy in that manner be either such as be take in war or steal by the tartar from russium circassium or georgium and be such miserable awkward poor wretch you would not think any of they worthy to be you housemaid ` tis true that many thousand be take in the morea but they have be most of they redeem by the charitable contribution of the christian or ransom by they own relation at venice the fine slave that wait upon the great lady or serve the pleasure of the great man be all buy at the age of eight or nine year old and educate with great care to accomplish they in singing dancing embroidery & c they be commonly circassian and they patron never sell they except it be as a punishment for some very great fault if ever they grow weary of they they either present they to a friend or give they they freedom those that be expose to sale at the market be always either guilty of some crime or so entirely worthless that they be of no use at all i be afraid you will doubt the truth of this account which i own be very different from we common notion in england but it be no less truth for all that you whole letter be full of mistake from one end to the other i see you have take you idea of turkey from that worthy author dumont who have write with equal ignorance and confidence ` tis a particular pleasure to I here to read the voyage to the levant which be generally so far remove from the truth and so full of absurdity i be very well divert with they they never fail give you a account of the woman whom ` tis certain they never see and talk very wisely of the genius of the man into whose company they be never admit and very often describe mosque which they dare not peep into the turk be very proud and will not converse with a stranger they be not assure be considerable in he own country i speak of the man of distinction for as to the ordinary fellow you may imagine what idea they conversation can give of the general genius of the people i be more incline out of a true female spirit of contradiction to tell you the falsehood of a great part of what you find in author as for example in the admirable mr hill who so gravely assert that he see in sancta sophium a sweating pillar very balsamic for disorder head there be not the least tradition of any such matter and i suppose it be reveal to he in a vision during he wonderful stay in the egyptian catacomb for i be sure he never hear of any such miracle here ` tis also very pleasant to observe how tenderly he and all he brethren voyage-writer lament the miserable confinement of the turkish lady who be perhaps freer than any lady in the universe and be the only woman in the world that lead a life of uninterrupted pleasure exempt from care they whole time be spend in visit bathing or the agreeable amusement of spend money and invent new fashion a husband would be think mad that exact any degree of economy from he wife whose expense be no way limited but by she own fancy ` tis he business to get money and hers to spend it : and this noble prerogative extend itself to the very meanest of the sex here be a fellow that carry embroidered handkerchief upon he back to sell as miserable a figure as you may suppose such a mean dealer yet i 'll assure you he wife scorn to wear anything less than cloth of gold have she ermine fur and a very handsome set of jewel for she head they go abroad when and where they please tis true they have no public place but the bagnio and there can only be see by they own sex however that be a diversion they take great pleasure in in the meantime montagu 's conduct of affair be much criticise at home and lord stanhope 's administration which have come into power in April 1717 decide to recall he this invidious task fall upon he old friend addison now secretary of state for the southern department the recall be notify to those concern in a circular letter date October 13 addison in a private letter date September 28 notify he of the impending change : have be confine to my chamber for some time by a dangerous fit of sickness i find upon my come abroad some thing have pass which i think myself oblige to communicate to you not as the secretary to the ambassador but as a humble servant to he friend we great man be of opinion that you be possess -lrb- of the reversion of certain place -rrb- -lrb- which they look upon as sure and sudden -rrb- it would be agreeable to you inclination as well as for the king 's service which you be so able to promote in parliament rather to return to you own country than to live at constantinople for this reason they have think of relieve mr stanyan who be now at the imperial court and of join sir robert sutton with he in the mediation of a peace between the emperor and the turk i need not suggest to you that mr stanyan be in great favor at vienna and how necessary it be to humor that court in the present juncture besides as it would have be for you honor to have act as sole mediator in such a negotiation perhaps it would not have be so agreeable to you to act only in commission this be suggest to I the other day by one of we first minister who tell I that he believe sir r sutton 's be join in a mediation which be carry on by my lord paget singly would be shocking to you but that they could be more free with a person of mr stanyan 's quality i find by he majesty 's way of speaking of you that you be much in he favor and esteem and i fancy you would find you ease and advantage more in be nearer he person than at the distance you be from he at present i omit no opportunity of do you justice where i think it be for you service and wish i could know you mind as to these several particulars by a more speedy and certain conveyance that i might act accordingly to the utmost of my power madame kielmansegg and my lady hervey desire I to forward the enclose to my lady mary wortley to whom i beg you will deliver they with my most humble regard what montagu 's feeling be can only be imagine it be almost certain that he feel himself vastly aggrieved nothing could have be more delicate or complimentary than addison 's letter but it do not and could not disguise the main fact it be easy for the secretary of state to suggest that at least one reason for the recall be that montagu must be anxious to return but that certainly could not have deceive the ambassador who be indeed so little anxious to get home that he remain at constantinople until the follow June likewise the statement that he would be able to promote the king 's service in parliament flattering as it read mean of course nothing at all certainly though montagu sit in the house of common until he death office be never offer he in any administration lady mary find herself again with child whether this pleased she or not no one can say but in a letter to mr thistlethwayte she treat the incident divertingly enough i wish i could return you goodness with some divert account from hence but i know not what part of the scene here would gratify you curiosity or whether you have any curiosity at all for thing so far distant to say the truth i be at this present write not very much turn for the recollection of what be divert my head be wholly fill with the preparation necessary for the increase of my family which i expect every day you may easily guess at my uneasy situation but i be however in some degree comfort by the glory that accrue to I from it and a reflection on the contempt i should otherwise fall under you will not know what to make of this speech : but in this country it be more despicable to be marry and not fruitful than it be with we to be fruitful before marriage they have a notion that whenever a woman leave off bring child it be because she be too old for that business whatever she face say to the contrary and this opinion make the lady here so ready to make proof of they youth -lrb- which be as necessary in order to be a receive beauty as it be to shew the proof of nobility to be admit knight of malta -rrb- that they do not content themselves with use the natural means but fly to all sort of quackery to avoid the scandal of be past child-bearing and often kill themselves by they without any exaggeration all the woman of my acquaintance that have be marry ten year have twelve or thirteen child and the old one boast of have have five-and-twenty or thirty a-piece and be respect accord to the number they have produce when they be with child it be they common expression to say they hope god will be so merciful to they to send two this time and when i have ask they sometimes how they expect to provide for such a flock as they desire they answer that the plague will certainly kill half of they which indeed generally happen without much concern to the parent who be satisfy with the vanity of have bring forth so plentifully the french ambassadress be force to comply with this fashion as well as myself she have not be here much above a year and have lie in once and be big again what be most wonderful be the exemption they seem to enjoy from the curse entail on the sex they see all company the day of they delivery and at the fortnight 's end return visit set out in they jewel and new clothes i wish i may find the influence of the climate in this particular but i fear i shall continue a englishwoman in that affair lady mary give birth to a daughter mary in February i do not mention this as one of my divert adventure she write to lady mar though i must own that it be not half so mortifying here as in england there be as much difference as there be between a little cold in the head which sometimes happen here and the consumptive cough so common in london nobody keep they house a month for lie in and i be not so fond of any of we custom to retain they when they be not necessary i return my visit at three week ' end so soon as possible after this domestic event preparation for the return journey be make the party go by sea to tuni thence to genoa turin lyon and pari they arrival at paris in October be notify by lady mar to she husband : you 'll be surprise to hear 657 -lrb- ie lady mary -rrb- be here she arrive the day after I you may believe how much incognito i be 'twa in vain to attempt be so twould fill a whole letter to tell you the people that have be to see I i be very much pleased at see 657 and she appear to be the same the sister have not meet for three year chapter x a scandal montagu re-enter the house of common -- he miserliness -- pope refer to it -- comment on society -- lady mary and a first-class scandal -- rémond -- he admiration for she -- she imprudent letter to he -- the south sea bubble -- lady mary speculate for rémond -- she lose money for he -- he demand to be re-imburse -- he threaten to publish she letter -- she state the case in letter to lady mar -- lady mary meet pope -- he letter to she when she be abroad -- he affect to be in love with she -- she matter-of-fact reply -- she parody of he verse on john hughe and sarah draw montagu on he return to england again enter the house of common where he represent huntingdon from 1722 to 1734 and then for peterborough from 1734 to 1747 and from 1754 to 1761 whether it be lack of ambition or just want of appreciation of he talent by the leader of he party there be no evidence even with he family connection and he wealth he be never offer a place in any administration nor it must be confess do he in any way distinguish himself in parliament as the year pass he chief pleasure if indeed it be not he only one be in the hoarding of money -- in this pursuit he be splendidly successful from reference to lady mary in contemporary correspondence it would appear that she too have no small streak of the miser in she pope after he quarrel with she refer to montagu as worldly shylock and gripus and in the fourth epistle of the _ essay on man _ write : be yellow dirt the passion of thy life look but on gripus and gripus ' wife also he lampoon they under the style of avidieu and avidieu 's wife who sell they present partridge or fruit and humbly live on rabbit and on root one half-pint bottle serve they both to dine and be at once they vinegar and wine but on some lucky day -lrb- as when they find a lose bank note or hear they son be drown -rrb- at such a feast old vinegar to spare be what two soul so generous can not bear : oil though it stink they drop by drop impart but souse the cabbage with a bounteous heart lady mary take she place as of right as a leader of society and for a while plunge into the gaiety of the town public place flourish more than ever she write to she sister we have assembly for every day in the week besides court opera and masquerade with youth and money ` tis certainly possible to be well divert in spite of malice and ill-nature though they be more and more powerful every day for my part as it be my established opinion that this globe of ours be no better than a holland cheese and the walker about in it mite i possess my soul in patience let what will happen -- and i should feel tolerably easy though a great rat come and eat half of it that be a philosophical outlook with a vengeance however lady mary manage on the whole to enjoy herself the town improve in gaiety every day the young people be younger than they use to be and all the old be grow young nothing be talk of but entertainment of gallantry by land and water and we insensibly begin to taste all the joy of arbitrary power politics be no more nobody pretend to wince or kick under they burden but we go on cheerfully with we bell at we ear ornament with riband and highly contented with we present condition so much for the general state of the nation she make she comment on polite circle we be much mistaken here as to we idea of paris -- to hear gallantry have desert it sound as extraordinary to I as a want of ice in greenland we have nothing but ugly face in this country but more lover than ever there be but three pretty man in england and they be all in love with I at this present write this will amaze you extremely but if you be to see the reign girl at present i will assure you there be very little difference between they and old woman lady mary could never resist a good story and indeed never make any attempt to do so and she usually write they down to amuse lady mar ` tis but reasonable i should conclude with a farce that i may not leave you in ill humor i have so good a opinion of you taste to believe harlequin in person will never make you laugh so much as the earl of stair 's furious passion for lady walpole -lrb- aged fourteen and some month -rrb- mr murray undertake to bring the business to bear and provide the opportunity -lrb- a great ingredient you 'll say -rrb- but the young lady prove skittish she do not only turn this heroic flame into present ridicule but expose all he generous sentiment to divert she husband and father-in-law he lordship be go to scotland and if there be anybody wicked enough to write about it there be a subject worthy the pen of the best ballad-maker in grub-street \* \* \* \* \* lord

may imagine kitty edwin have be the companion of he -lrb- she -rrb- pleasure there the alliance seem firmer than ever between they after they tunbridge battle which serve for the entertainment of the public the secret cause be variously guess at but it be certain lady townshend come into the great room gently behind she friend and tap she on the shoulder with she fan say aloud _ i know where how and who _ these mysterious word draw the attention of all the company and have such a effect upon poor kitty she be carry to she lodgings in strong hysteric however by the intercession of prudent mediator peace be conclude and if the conduct of these heroine be consider in a true light perhaps it might serve for a example even to higher power by show that the surest method to obtain a lasting and honorable peace be to begin with vigorous war but leave these reflection which be above my capacity permit I to repeat my desire of hearing often from you you letter would be my greatest pleasure if i have flourish in the first year of henry the eighth 's court judge then how welcome they be to I in the present desolate state of this desert town of london lady mary 's own moral be more than once assail but this do not prevent she humorous attack on society at large : those thing -lrb- bill of divorce -rrb- grow more fashionable every day and in a little time will not be at all scandalous the best expedient for the public and to prevent the expense of private family would be a general act of divorce all the people of england you know those that please might marry again and it would save the reputation of several lady that be now in peril of be expose every day not long after lady mary have return to england about the winter of 1720 she who love to retail malicious story about other find herself to she great dismay the subject of a first-class scandal when lady mary be in pari rémond be introduce to she by the abbé contus he have see a letter or two address by she to the abbé and express himself with enthusiasm of she brilliance as a correspondent presently he come to england and seek out lady mary who be no more immune from flattery than most folk of either sex how far the intimacy develop from the platonic to the amorous it be impossible to say that rémond make love to she there can be little doubt sir leslie stephen hold the view that she do not encourage he passion anyhow it be beyond question that she write he imprudent letter which he be prudent enough to keep lady mary bask in the admiration of rémond and think to reward he for he intelligence at no cost to herself by put he on to a good thing also get a little fearsome of he very marked attention or perhaps it be only wearying of they she think as she confess to she sister the countess of mar it would be the more easy to rid herself of this somewhat turbulent lover at this time the famous boom know as the south sea bubble be at the height of its brief career the south sea company have take over the national debt on term and its stock carefully manipulate rise by leap and bound in 1714 the stock stand at 85 after the defeat of the rebellion of 1715 it be quote at price vary from par to 106 in the autumn of 1719 when rumor of its great scheme be spread about the town it rise to 126 early in the following year it could not be purchase for less than 400 it fluctuate wildly go up and down hundred of point on June 2 1720 it go up in the morning to 890 in the afternoon fall to 640 and many who be speculate in difference be utterly ruin later in the day it recover though only to 770 ultimately it rise to 1000 of course the price be fictitious but everyone in society try they luck and while some come out of it with a fortune the majority lose practically every penny they have the director most of whom be guilty of fraud make vast sum of money that astute financier robert walpole speculate on a vast scale sell out before the slump and realize a fortune more than sufficient to enable he to rebuild houghton and to gather together he famous collection of picture on the other hand the duke of portland who hold on too long be so hard hit that he have to solicit the post of captain-general of jamaica rémond hold some south sea stock and act on lady mary 's advice sell out at a considerable profit not content with he gain however he insist just before he departure for france on leave in lady mary 's hand # 900 for investment as opportunity should arise reluctantly lady mary consent -- she would probably have agree almost to anything so anxious be she that rémond should leave the country on August 22 1720 pope with the best intention in the world write to lady mary : i be make acquaint last night that i might depend upon it as a certain gain to buy the south sea stock at the present price which will assuredly rise in some week or less i can be as sure of this as the nature of any such thing will allow from the first and best hand and therefore have despatch the bearer with all speed to you no doubt the phrase the first and best hand be intend to convey the fact that he informant be he friend and neighbor jame cragg the younger the secretary of state who be so deeply involve in the affair of the south sea company that when the bubble burst he only escape prosecution by conveniently die of small-pox act on the hint give by pope lady mary purchase stock for herself and rémond the stock fall rapidly -- in August it stand at 750 and in December at 130 what she lose be not know but she have be sufficiently involve to make she desire to sell she diamond and more than once she ask lady mar if there be a market for the jewel in pari rémond 's # 900 have dwindle to # 400 on receive these distressful tiding the frenchman believe or affect to believe that he have be swindle and he threaten unless he be repay in full he would publish lady mary 's letter to he lady mary 's fear be lest the matter should come to the cognisance of she husband : it would certainly be unfair to montagu to suggest that he might not have forgive he wife for a love-affair but he would certainly never have pardon she any transaction that cost he money many malicious thing be say about this business walpole give a version utterly discreditable to lady mary and pope after the quarrel refer to the matter in the second book of the _ dunciad _ : whence hapless monsieur much complain at pari of wrong from duchess and lady marie the case be put by lady mary in a series of letter to she sister lady mar to whom she could unburden herself freely and who might be able to influence rémond who be then at pari -lrb- 1721 -rrb- from the tranquil and easy situation in which you leave I dear sister i be reduce to that of the highest degree of vexation which i need not set out to you better than by the plain matter of fact which i heartily wish i have tell you long since and nothing hinder I but a certain _ mauvaise honte _ which you be reasonable enough to forgive as very natural though not very excusable where there be nothing to be ashamed of since i can only accuse myself of too much good-nature or at worst too much credulity though i believe there never be more pain take to deceive any body in short a person whose name be not necessary because you know it take all sort of method during almost two year -lrb- _ sic _ -rrb- to persuade I that there never be so extraordinary a attachment -lrb- or what you please to call it -rrb- as they have for I this end in come over to make I a visit against my will and as be pretended very much against they interest i can not deny i be very silly in give the least credit to this stuff but if people be so silly you 'll own ` tis natural for any body that be good-natured to pity and be glad to serve a person they believe unhappy upon they account it come into my head out of a high point of generosity -lrb- for which i wish myself hang -rrb- to do this creature all the good i possibly could since 'twa impossible to make they happy they own way i advise he very strenuously to sell out of the subscription and in compliance to my advice he do so and in less than two day see he have do very prudently after a piece of service of this nature i think i could more decently press he departure which he folly make I think necessary for I he take leave of I with so many tear and grimace -lrb- which i can not imagine how he could counterfeit -rrb- as really move my compassion and i have much ado to keep to my first resolution of exact he absence which he swear would be he death i tell he that there be no other way in the world i would not be glad to serve he in but that he extravagance make it utterly impossible for I to keep he company he say that he would put into my hand the money that i have win for he and desire I to improve it say that if he have enough to buy a small estate and retire from the world 'twa all the happiness he hope for in it i represent to he that if he have so little money as he say 'twa ridiculous to hazard at all he reply that 'twa too little to be of any value and he would either have it double or quit after many objection on my side and reply on he i be so weak to be overcome by he entreaty and flattered myself also that i be do a very heroic action in try to make a man 's fortune though i do not care for he address he leave I with these imagination and my first care be to employ he money to the best advantage i lay it all out in stock the general discourse and private intelligence then scatter about be of a great rise you may remember it be two or three day before the fourth subscription and you be with I when i pay away the money to mr binfield i think i have manage prodigious well in sell out the say stock the day after the shut the book -lrb- for a small profit -rrb- to cox and cleeve goldsmith of very good reputation when the opening of the book come my man go off leave the stock upon my hand which be already sink from near nine hundred pound to four hundred pound i immediately writ he word of this misfortune with the sincere sorrow natural to have upon such a occasion and ask he opinion as to the sell the stock remain in he make I no answer to this part of my letter but a long eloquent oration of misery of another nature i attribute this silence to he disinterested neglect of he money but however resolve to make no more step in he business without direct order after have be so unlucky this occasion many letter to no purpose but the very post after you leave london i receive a letter from he in which he tell I that he have discover all my trick that he be convinced i have all he money remain untouched : and he would have it again or he would print all my letter to he which though god know very innocent in the main yet may admit of ill construction besides the monstrousness of be expose in such a manner i hear from other people that he be liar enough to publish that i have borrow the money of he though i have a note under he hand by which he desire I to employ it in the fund and acquit I of be answerable for the loss that may happen at the same time i have attestation and witness of the bargain i make so that nothing can be clearer than my integrity in this business but that do not hinder I from be in the utmost terror for the consequence -lrb- as you may easily guess -rrb- of he villany the very story of which appear so monstrous to I i can hardly believe myself while i write it though i omit -lrb- not to tire you -rrb- a thousand aggravating circumstance i can not forgive myself the folly of ever regard one word he say and i see now that he lie have make I wrong several of my acquaintance and you among the rest for have say -lrb- as he tell I -rrb- horrid thing against I to he ` tis long since that you behavior have acquit you in my opinion but i think i ought not to mention to hurt he with you what be perhaps more misunderstanding or mistake than a design lie but he have very amply explain he character to I what be very pleasant be that but two post before i receive a letter from he full of higher flight than ever i beg you pardon -lrb- dear sister -rrb- for this tedious account but you see how necessary ` tis for I to get my letter from this madman perhaps the best way be by fair means at least they ought to be first try i would have you then -lrb- my dear sister -rrb- try to make the wretch sensible of the truth of what i advance without ask for the letter which i have already ask for perhaps you may make he ashamed of he infamous proceedings by talk of I without take notice that you know of he threat only of my dealings i take this method to be the most likely to work upon he i beg you would send I a full and true account of this detestable affair -lrb- enclose to mr murray -rrb- if i have not be the most unlucky creature in the world he letter would have come while you be here that i might have shew you both he note and the other people 's i know he be discontented but be far from imagine a possibility of this thing i give you a great deal of trouble but you see i shall owe you the highest obligation if you can serve I : the very endeavoring of it be a tie upon I to serve you the rest of my life without reserve and with eternal gratitude -lrb- twickenham 1721 -rrb- i be now at twickenham : ` tis impossible to tell you dear sister what agony i suffer every post-day my health really suffer so much from my fear that i have reason to apprehend the worst consequence if that monster act on the least principle of reason i should have nothing to fear since ` tis certain that after he have expose I he will get nothing by it mr wortley can do nothing for he satisfaction i be not willing to do myself i desire not the least indulgence of any kind let he put he affair into the hand of any lawyer whatever i be willing to submit to any examination ` tis impossible to make a fairer offer than this be : whoever he employ may come to I hither on several pretence i desire nothing from he but that he would send no letter nor message to my house at london where mr wortley now be i be come hither in hope of benefit from the air but i carry my distemper about I in a anguish of mind that visibly decay my body every day i be too melancholy to talk of any other subject let I beg you -lrb- dear sister -rrb- to take some care of this affair and think you have it in you power to do more than save the life of a sister that love you -lrb- twickenham 1721 -rrb- i give you many thanks -lrb- my dear sister -rrb- for the trouble you have give yourself in my affair but be afraid ` tis not yet effectual i must beg you to let he know i be now at twickenham and that whoever have he procuration may come here on diver pretence but must by no means go to my house at london i wonder you can think lady stafford have not writ to he she shew I a long plain letter to he several month ago as a demonstration he receive it i see he answer ` tis true she treat he with the contempt he deserve and tell he she would never give herself the trouble of write again to so despicable a wretch she be willing to do yet further and write to the duke of villerous about it if i think it proper rémond do nothing but lie and either do not or will not understand what be say to he you will forgive I troubling you so often with this business the importance of it be the best excuse in short ' -- ` tis joy or sorrow peace or strife ` tis all the color of remain life ' i can foresee nothing else to make I unhappy and i believe shall take care another time not to involve myself in difficulty by a overplus of heroic generosity i be dear sister ever yours with the utmost esteem and affection if i get over this cursed affair my style may enliven -lrb- June 1721 -rrb- i have just receive you letter of may 30th and be surprised since you own the receipt of my letter that you give I not the least hint concern the business that i writ so earnestly to you about till that be over i be as little capable of hearing or repeat news as i should be if my house be on fire i be sure a great deal must be in you power the hurt of I can be in no way he interest i be ready to assign or deliver the money for # 500 stock to whoever he will name if he will send my letter into lady stafford 's hand which be he sincere in he offer of burn they he would readily do instead of that he have writ a letter to mr w -lrb- wortley -rrb- to inform he of the whole affair : luckily for I the person he have send it to assure I it shall never be deliver but i be not the less oblige to he good intention for god 's sake do something to set my mind at ease from this business and then i will not fail to write you regular account of all you acquaintance -lrb- July -lrb- -rrb- 1721 -rrb- i can not enough thank you dear sister for the trouble you give yourself in my affair though i be still so unhappy to find you care very ineffectual i have actually in my present possession a formal letter direct to mr wortley to acquaint he with the whole business you may imagine the inevitable eternal misfortune it would have throw I into have it be deliver by the person to whom it be intrusted i wish you would make he sensible of the infamy of this proceeding which can no way in the world turn to he advantage do i refuse give the strictest account or have i not the clearest demonstration in my hand of the truth and sincerity with which i act there might be some temptation to this baseness but all he can expect by inform mr wortley be to hear he repeat the same thing i assert he will not retrieve one farthing and i be for ever miserable i beg no more of he than to direct any person man or woman either lawyer broker or a person of quality to examine I and as soon as he have send a proper authority to discharge I on enquiry i be ready to be examine i think no offer can be fairer from any person whatsoever he conduct towards I be so infamous that i be inform i might prosecute he by law if he be here he demand the whole sum as a debt from mr wortley at the same time i have a note under he hand sign to prove the contrary i beg with the utmost earnestness that you would make he sensible of he error i believe ` tis very necessary to say something to fright he i be persuade if he be talk to in a style of that kind he would not dare to attempt to ruin I i have a great inclination to write seriously to you lord about it since i desire to determine this affair in the fairest and the clearest manner i be not at all afraid of make any body acquaint with it and if i do not fear make mr wortley uneasy -lrb- who be the only person from whom i would conceal it -rrb- all the transaction should have be long since enrol in chancery i have already take care to have the broker 's deposition take before a lawyer of reputation and merit i deny give he no satisfaction and after that offer i think there be no man of honor that would refuse signify to he that as ` tis all he can desire so if he persist in do I a injury he may repent it you know how far ` tis proper to take this method i say nothing of the uneasiness i be under ` tis far beyond any expression my obligation would be proportionable to any body that would deliver I from it and i should not think it pay by all the service of my life -lrb- twickenham June -lrb- -rrb- 1721 -rrb- dear sister have this occasion i would not omit write though i have receive no answer to my two last the bearer be well acquaint with my affair though not from I till he mention it to I first have hear it from those to whom rémond have tell it with all the false color he please to lay on i shewed he the formal commission i have to employ the money and all the broker 's testimony take before delpeeke with he certificate you remonstrance have hitherto have so little effect that r -lrb- rémond -rrb- will neither send a letter of attorney to examine my account or let I be in peace i receive a letter from he but two post since in which he renew he threat except i send he the whole sum which be as much in my power as it be to send a million i can easily comprehend that he may be ashamed to send a procuration which must convince the world of all the lie he have tell for my part i be so willing to be rid of the plague of hearing from he i desire no better than to restore he with all expedition the money i have in my hand but i will not do it without a general acquittance in due form not to have fresh demand every time he want money if he think that he have a larger sum to receive than i offer why do he not name a procurator to examine I if he be content with that sum i only insist on the acquittance for my own safety i be ready to send it to he with full license to tell as many lie as he please afterwards i be weary with trouble you with repetition which can not be more disagreeable to you than they be to I i have have and still have so much vexation with this execrable affair ` tis impossible to describe it i have rather talk to you of any thing else but it fill my whole head lady mary be no coward but when she hear that rémond intend to come to london in connection with this business she be at first in despair however she summon she courage to aid and ask lady mar to tell he that if he be spoil for a fight she would do she best to indulge he i send you dear sister by lady lansdowne this letter accompany with the only present that be ever send I by that monster i beg you to return it immediately i be tell he be prepare to come to london let he know that ` tis not at all necessary for receive he money or examine my account he have nothing to do but to send a letter of attorney to whom he please -lrb- without exception -rrb- and i will readily deliver up what i have in my hand and he presence will not obtain one farthe more : he design then can only be to expose my letter here i desire you would assure he that my first step shall be to acquaint my lord stair -lrb- 4 -rrb- with all he obligation to he as soon as i hear he be in london and if he dare to give I further trouble i shall take care to have he reward in a stronger manner than he expect there be nothing more true than this and i solemnly swear that if all the credit or money that i have in the world can do it either for friendship or hire i shall not fail to have he use as he deserve and since i know this journey can only be design to expose I i shall not value what noise be make perhaps you may prevent it i leave you to judge of the most proper method ` tis certain no time should be lose fear be he predominant passion and i believe you may fright he from come hither where he will certainly find a reception very disagreeable to he -lrb- footnote 4 : john dalrymple second earl of stair -lrb- 1673-1747 -rrb- british ambassador at paris 1715-1720 -rrb- September 6 1721 i have consult my lawyer and he say i can not with safety to myself deposit the money i have receive into other hand without the express order of rémond and he be so unreasonable that he will neither send a procuration to examine my account or any order for I to transfer he stock into another name i be heartily weary of the trust which have give I so much trouble and can never think myself safe till i be quite get rid of it : rather than be plague any longer with the odious keep i be willing to abandon my letter to he discretion i desire nothing more of he than a order to place he money in other hand which methink should not be so hard to obtain since he be so dissatisfied with my management but he seem to be bent to torment I and will not even touch he money because i beg it of he i wish you would represent these thing to he for my own part i live in so much uneasiness about it that i sometimes weary of life itself -lrb- October -lrb- -rrb- 1721 -rrb- i can not forbear -lrb- dear sister -rrb- accuse you of unkindness that you take so little care of a business of the last consequence to I r -lrb- rémond -rrb- writ to I some time ago to say if i would immediately send he # 2000 sterling he would send I a acquittance as this be send he several hundred out of my own pocket i absolutely refuse it and in return i have just receive a threatening letter to print i know not what stuff against I i be too well acquaint with the world -lrb- of which poor mr murray 's affair be a fatal instance -rrb- not to know that the most groundless accusation be always of ill consequence to a woman besides the cruel misfortune it may bring upon I in my own family if you have any compassion either for I or my innocent child i be sure you will try to prevent it the thing be too serious to be delay i think -lrb- to say nothing either of blood or affection -rrb- that humanity and christianity be interested in my preservation i be sure i can answer for my hearty gratitude and everlasting acknowledgment of a service much more important than that of save my life in lady mary 's correspondence there be no further reference to this sorry business and so it can not be say how it end nor can it be decide whether rémond really believe he have be swindle or whether he be just a blackmailer the intimacy between lady mary and pope be especially interesting because it culminate in one of the most famous quarrel in the literary annals of this country and second only to that between pope and addison when lady mary go abroad in 1716 pope who always want to make the best of both world think it have be relate by he biographer of what dramatic situation describe the separation of lover would best suit he to express he feeling and he find exactly what he want on the suppose authentic letter of eloisa to abelard pope send lady mary a volume of he poem say : among the rest you have all i be worth that be my work there be few thing in they but what you have already see except the ` epistle of eloisa to abelard ' in which you will find one passage that i can not tell whether to wish you should understand or not pope correspond with lady mary during the two year of she stay abroad the first letter from pope begin : so natural as i find it be to I to neglect every body else in you company i be sensible i ought to do anything that might please you and i fancy upon recollection we write the letter you propose be of that nature i therefore sate down to my part of it last night when i should have go out of town whether or no you will order I in recompense to see you again i leave to you for indeed i find i begin to behave myself worse to you than to any other woman as i value you more and yet if i think i should not see you again i would say some thing here which i could not to you person for i would not have you die deceive in I that be go to constantinople without know that i be to some degree of extravagance as well as with the utmost reason madam you etc some passage from pope 's subsequent letter must be give to indicate the line on which this correspondence be conduct you may easily imagine how desirous i must be of correspondence with a person who have teach I long ago that it be as possible to esteem at first sight as to love and who have since ruin I for all the conversation of one sex and almost all the friendship of the other i be but too sensible through you means that the company of man want a certain softness to recommend it and that of woman want everything else how often have i be quietly go to take possession of that tranquility and indolence i have so long find in the country when one evening of you conversation have spoil I for a solitaire too book have lose they effect upon I and i be convince since i see you that there be something more powerful than philosophy and since i hear you that there be one alive wiser than all the sage a plague of female wisdom it make a man ten time more uneasy than he own what be very strange virtue herself when you have the dress of she be too amiable for one 's repose what a world of good might you have do in you time if you have allow half the fine gentleman who have see you to have but converse with you they would have be strangely catch while they think only to fall in love with a fair face and you have bewitch they with reason and virtue two beauty that the very fops pretend to have a acquaintance with August 20 1716 madam you will find I more troublesome than ever brutus do he evil genius i shall meet you in more place than one and often refreshen you memory before you arrive at you philippus these shadow of I -lrb- my letter -rrb- will be haunt you from time to time and put you in mind of the man who have really suffer by you and whom you have rob of the most valuable of he enjoyment you conversation the advantage of learn you sentiment by discover mine be what i always think a great one and even with the risk i run of manifest my own indiscretion you then reward my trust in you the moment it be give for you pleased and informed I the minute you answer i must now be contented with slow return however it be some pleasure that you thought upon paper will be a more lasting possession to I and that i shall no longer have cause to complain of a loss i have so often regret that of anything you say which i happen to forget in earnest madam if i be to write you as often as i think of you it must be every day of my life i attend you in spirit through all you way i follow in book of travel through every stage i wish for you fear for you through whole folio you make I shrink at the past danger of dead traveller and when i read a agreeable prospect or delightful place i hope it yet subsist to give you pleasure i inquire the road the amusement the company of every town and country you pass through with as much diligence as if i be to set out next week to overtake you in a word no one can have you more constantly in mind not even you guardian-angel -lrb- if you have one -rrb- and i be willing to indulge so much popery as to fancy some be take care of you who know you value better than you do yourself i be willing to think that heaven never give so much self-neglect and resolution to a woman to occasion she calamity but be pious enough to believe those quality must be intend to she benefit and she glory pope 's letter of this period to lady mary be all write in a strain of adulation which may well have please lady mary and must certainly have amuse she she can however scarcely have be lead into any self-deception as regard the sincerity of she correspondent in spite of the fact that in one of the earliest epistle he address to she he subscribe himself : i be with all unalterable esteem and sincerity madam you most faithful obedient humble servant yet no doubt she be please enough to read : i communicate you letter to mr congreve he think of you as he ought i mean as i do for one always think that to be just as it ought we never meet but we lament over you : we pay a kind of weekly rite to you memory when we strew flower of rhetoric and offer such libation to you name as if it be a profaneness to call toast well alcoholic refreshment by any other name be just as potent it must have be grateful and comforting to be tell when in exile : i must tell you too that the duke of buckingham have be more than once you high priest in perform the office of you praise : and upon the whole i believe there be few man who do not deplore you departure as woman that sincerely do most excellent pope who would play at make-believe it be almost a pity that he could not persuade the lady that he mean even a tithe of what he write to she listen to he again : for my part i hate a great many woman for you sake and undervalue all the rest ` tis you who be to blame and may god revenge it upon you with all those blessing and earthy prosperity which the divine tell we be the cause of we perdition : for if he make you happy in this world i dare trust you own virtue to do it in the other these poet lady mary take all this in the right way and as love-letter appraise they at they true value perhaps you 'll laugh at I for thank you very gravely for all the oblige concern you express for I she write from vienna in September with perhaps just a touch of irony ` tis certain that i may if i please take the fine thing you say to I for wit and raillery and it may be it would be take they right but i never in my life be half so well disposed to believe you in earnest and that distance which make the continuation of you friendship improbable have very much increase my faith for it and i find that i have -lrb- as well as the rest of my sex -rrb- whatever face i set o not a strong disposition to believe in miracle as regard the rest she side of the correspondence be matter-of-fact to such a degree that it suggest that she adopt that tone in order to lease he she reply can scarcely have give pope any satisfaction from vienna she give he a detailed account of the opera and the theater from belgrade she tell he of the war and of a arabic scholar and also of the climate from adrianople she discourse of the hebrus of the lad of the village of addison and theocritus pay he compliment on he translation of homer and a copy of some turkish verse and so on the most striking thing about she letter be the absence of the personal note which be so often introduce when she be write to other they read more like essay than communication to a friend pope in a letter dated September 1 1718 send lady mary a copy of he verse on john hughe and sarah draw when eastern lover fear would the fun ` eral

that they buy the small habitation lady mary divide she time between london and twickenham but apparently enjoy herself more at she country retreat i live in a sort of solitude that want very little of be such as i would have it she write to she sister lady mar in August 1721 as a matter of fact the solitude be more imaginary than real for round about there be a small colony of friend she be indeed very rarely lonely my time be melt away in almost perpetual concert she tell she sister i do not presume to judge but i 'll assure you i be a very hearty as well as a humble admirer i have take my little thread satin beauty into the house with I she be allow by bononcinus to have the finest voice he ever hear in england he and mr robinson and senesino lodge in this village and sup often with I : and this easy indolent life would make I the happiest in the world if i have not this execrable affair -lrb- of rémond -rrb- still hang over my head to anastasium robinson there be more than one allusion in lady mary 's correspondence and she give a most amusing account of a incident in that lady 's career could one believe that lady holdernesse be a beauty and in love and that mr robinson be at the same time a prude and a keep mistress and these thing in spite of nature and fortune the first of these lady be tenderly attach to the polite mr mildmay and sink in all the joy of happy love notwithstanding she want the use of she two hand by a rheumatism and he have a arm that he can not move i wish i could send you the particulars of this amour which seem to I as curious as that between two oyster and as well worth the serious enquiry of the naturalist the second heroine have engage half the town in arm from the nicety of she virtue which be not able to bear the too near approach of senesino in the opera and she condescension in accept of lord peterborough for she champion who have signalise both he love and courage upon this occasion in as many instance as ever don quixote do for dulcinea poor senesino like a vanquished giant be force to confess upon he knee that anastasium be a nonpariel of virtue and beauty lord stanhope as dwarf to the say giant joke of he side and be

so great a account besides half the house of peer be put under arrest by the providence of heaven and the wise care of he majesty no bloodshed ensue however thing be now tolerably accommodate and the fair lady ride through the town in triumph in the shine berlin of she hero not to reckon the essential advantage of # 100 a month which ` tis say he allow she this story be as a matter of fact not far remove from the truth it omit however the fact that lord peterborough then about sixty year of age have marry anastasium robinson in 1722 but the marriage be secret although lady oxford be present at the ceremony and it be not make public until thirteen year later although long before there be many who suspect it he die in the same year that the announcement be make he widow survive he by a score of year sir godfrey kneller have a house at twickenham and at the instigation of pope sit to he for she portrait upon which the follow line -lrb- generally ascribe to pope -rrb- be write : the playful smile around the dimpled mouth that happy air of majesty and truth so would i draw -lrb- but oh ` tis vain to try my narrow genius do the power deny -rrb- the equal lustre of the heav ` nly mind where ev'ry grace with every virtue 's join would learn not vain and wisdom not severe with greatness easy and with wit sincere with just description show the work divine and the whole princess in my work should shine mrs howard afterwards the countess of suffolk be a neighbor from 1723 when the prince of wale whose mistress she be provide she with fund for the purchase of marble hill however though of course she and lady mary be acquaint there be at no time any intimacy between they lady mary in fact do not appear to have like henrietta howard at least she on more than one occasion tittle-tattled about she the most surprising news be lord bathurst 's assiduous court to they royal highness which fill the coffee-house with profound speculation but i who smell a rat at a profound distance do believe in private that mr howard and he lordship have a friendship that border upon ` the tender ' and though in history learn ignorance attribute all to cunning or to chance love in that grave disguise do often smile know the cause be kindness all the while so lady mary write to lady mar in 1724 and shortly after return to the subject in another epistle : you may remember i mention in my last some suspicion of my own in relation to lord bathurst which i really never mention for fifty reason to anyone whatsoever but as there be never smoke without some fire there be very rarely fire without some smoke these smother flame though admirably cover with whole heap of politics lay over they be at last see feel hear and understand and the fair lady give to understand by she commanding officer that if she show under other color she must expect to have she pay retrench upon which the good lord be dismiss and have not attend the drawing-room since you know one can not help laugh when one see he next and i own i long for that pleasurable moment to twickenham come philip duke of wharton and lease a villa later call the grove at the farther end of the hamlet from london of all the lad of the village there be none for wildness like unto he bear in 1698 and therefore nine year younger than lady mary he have at a early age make himself conspicuous by unbridled excess soon after the death of he father thoma first marquess of wharton in 1715 he conduct create so much scandal at home that he guardian send he abroad in the custody of a tutor to the horror of that unfortunate person he charge enrol himself as a adherent of the pretender and go to pay he respects at avignon the duke have talent beyond the ordinary he could write fairly well make a excellent speech and have a keen sense of wit when he go to pari the british ambassador lord stair take it upon himself to give this madcap some sound advice he extol the virtue of the late marquess of wharton and i hope he say you will follow so illustrious a example of fidelity to you prince and love to you country i thank you excellency for you good counsel reply the visitor courteously and as you excellency have also a worthy and discerning father i hope that you will likewise copy so bright a example and tread in all he footstep -- a effective though a brutal rejoinder for the first lord stair have betray he sovereign young wharton on he return however show by he conduct that he visit to avignon have be little more than a prank for while he have accept a dukedom from the pretender he in 1718 be still a minor accept a dukedom from the british sovereign -- the single instance of such a dignity be confer upon a minor wharton who do everything in haste have in he seventeenth year elope with martha daughter of major-general richard holme and marry she in the fleet on march 2 1715 as be only to be expect from a person so volatile he from the begin neglect he wife but as be put quaintly in that unreliable work _ memoirs of a certain island adjacent to the kingdom of utopia _ which be concoct by mr eliza haywood after some year of continu would extravagance the duke either through the natural inconsistency of he temper or the reflection how much he have be draw in by he unworthy companion to embezel he estate begin to think there be comfort in retirement and fall into the conversation of the sober part of mankind more than he have do be persuade by they to take home he dutchess he bring she to he house but love have no part in he resolution he live with she indeed but she be with he as a housekeeper as a nurse the relation be however more intimate than mr haywood believe for in march 1719 a son be bear to they the duke of wharton have bring he duchess to town and be fond of she to distraction in order to break the heart of all other woman that have any claim on he lady mary write to lady mar he have public devotions twice a day and assist at they in person with exemplary devotion and there be nothing pleasanter than the remark of some pious lady on the conversion of such a sinner the letter from which the above passage be a extract must have be write not later than the early spring of 1720 for after that date the duke and duchess of wharton do not again live together the immediate cause of the separation be that wharton have forbid he wife to come to london where small-pox be rage at the time she however whether irk by the dulness of the country or thinking by she presence to guard she husband against those temptation to which he be prone follow he to the town where the infant sicken of the epidemic and die after one great scene they never meet again there be mention of the duke in another letter of lady mary to lady mar date February 1724 : in general gallantry never be in so elevated a figure as it be at present twenty very pretty fellow -lrb- the duke of wharton be president and chief director -rrb- have form themselves into a committee of gallantry they call themselves _ schemer _ and meet regularly three time a week to consult on gallant scheme for the advantage and advancement of that branch of happiness i consider the duty of a true englishwoman be to do what honor she can to she native country and that it would be a sin against the pious love i bear the land of my nativity to confine the renown due to the schemer within the small extent of this little island which ought to be spread wherever man can sigh or woman wish ` tis true they have the envy and curse of the old and ugly of both sex and a general persecution from all old woman but this be no more than all reformation must expect in they begin more than one writer have assert that it be the wit and beauty of lady mary that draw he thither at the time the duke be twenty-four and the lady nine year older certainly he pay she marked attention but as he pay marked attention to all woman who have not a hump or a squint -- sometimes maybe he even overlook the squint -- it be as impossible to say whether he be in love with she as it be to assert that she be in love with he from the little that be know of they intimacy it would seem that they be merely good comrade -- good comrade of the type that might bite or scratch at any moment horace walpole who be more than usually malicious where lady mary be concern could scarcely induce himself to allow she any quality my lady stafford -lrb- 5 -rrb- he write to george montagu in 1751 use to live at twickenham when lady mary wortley and the duke of wharton live there she have more wit than both of they what would i give to have have strawberry hill twenty year ago i think anything but twenty year lady stafford use to say to she sister ` well child i have come without my wit to-day ' that be she have not take she opium which she be force to do if she have any appointment to be in particular spirit -lrb- footnote 5 : claude charlotte countess of stafford wife of henry earl of stafford and daughter of philibert count of grammont and elizabeth hamilton he wife -rrb- horace walpole allude to lady mary and the duke in the parish register of twickenham : twickenham where frolic wharton revel where montagu with lock dishevelled conflict of dirt and warmth combin would invoke -- and scandalise the _ nine _ what pope thought of the duke he express with the utmost vigor : wharton the scorn and wonder of we day whose ruling passion be the lust of praise : bear with whate'er could win it from the wise woman and fool must like he or he die : though wonder senate hang on all he speak the club must hail he master of the joke shall part so various aim at nothing new he 'll shine a tully and a wilmot too then turn repentant and he god adore with the same spirit that he drink and whore enough

contemptible to shun contempt : he passion still to covet general praise he life to forfeit it a thousand way a constant bounty which no friend have make a angel tongue which no man can persuade a fool with more of wit than half mankind too rash for thought for action too refine : a tyrant to he wife he heart approve a rebel to the very king he love he die sad outcast of each church and state and harder still flagitious yet not great ask you why wharton break through every rule 'twa all for fear the knave should call he fool the duke write a play on mary queen of scot -- of which only four line have be preserve : sure be i free and norfolk be a prisoner i would fly with more impatience to he arm than the poor israelite gaz would on the serpent when life be the reward of every look it be usually state that this play be write at some time between 1728 and 1730 but it be certain that it be begin at this time -- probably it be never finish perhaps only the scenario be draw up and a few scene outline but that so much at least be do while the author be at twickenham be prove conclusively by the fact that at this time lady mary compose for the play a epilogue design to be speak by mr oldfield what could luxurious woman wish for more to fix she joy or to extend she pow ' r they every wish be in this mary see gay witty youthful beauteous and a queen vain useless blessing with

bear the affliction admirably two person with such impish humor could not but frequently find themselves at loggerheads but they liking for each other 's society be genuine and quarrel be follow by peace-making sophium -lrb- as she nickname the young man -rrb- and i have be quite reconcile and be now quite break and i believe not likely to piece up again lady mary write to she sister this be in February 1725 and a little later in the year the breach be widen by the really outrageous conduct of the duke : sophium and i have a immortal quarrel which though i resolve never to forgive i can hardly forbear laugh at a acquaintance of mine be marry whom i wish very well to : sophium have be please on this occasion to write the most infamous ballad that ever be write where both the bride and bridegroom be intolerably maul especially the last who be compliment with the hope of cuckoldom and forty other thing equally oblige and sophium have distribute this ballad in such a manner as to make it pass for mine on purpose to pique the poor innocent soul of the new-married man whom i should be the last of creature to abuse i know not how to clear myself of this vile imputation without a train of consequence i have no mind to fall into in the mean time sophium enjoy the pleasure of heartily plague both I and that person probably this immortal quarrel would have be make up but at the beginning of July the duke go abroad never to return sophium be go to aix-la-chapelle and thence to pari lady mary write to lady mar i dare swear she 'll endeavor to get acquaint with you we be break to a iremediable degree various be the persecution i have endure from she this winter in all of which i remain neuter and shall certainly go to heaven from the passive meekness of my temper chapter xii a famous quarrel pope and lady mary -- he pay she compliment -- he jealousy of she other admirer -- the cause of he quarrel with she -- he malicious attack on she thereafter -- write of she as sappho -- lady mary ask arbuthnot to protect she -- molly skerritt -- lady stafford -- lady mary 's malicious tongue and pen -- mr murray -- a epistle from arthur gray -- lady mary lord hervey and molly lepell -- death of the earl of kingston -- lady gower -- lady mar -- marriage of lady mary 's daughter of pope it be curious to relate though he be a near neighbor she see less and less it have be suggest that the first rift in the lute be she parody of he verse about the lover strike by lightning but even he most sensitive of man can scarcely have be seriously offend so far as be know only two letter pass between they after 1719 i pass my time in a small snug set of dear intimate and go very little into the _ grand monde _ which have always have my hearty contempt -lrb- she write to lady mar in the spring of 1722 -rrb- i see sometimes mr congreve and very seldom mr pope who continue to embellish he house at twickenham he have make a subterranean grotto which he have furnish with looking-glass and they tell I it have a very good effect i here send you some verse address to mr gay who write he a congratulatory letter on the finish he house i stifle they here and i beg they may die the same death at paris and never go further than you closet : ` ah friend ` tis true -- this truth you lover know -- in vain my structure rise my garden grow in vain fair thame reflect the double scene of hang mountain and of slope green : joy live not here to happier seat it fly and only dwell where wortley cast she eye what be the gay parterre the chequer would shade the morning bower the ev ` ning colonnade but soft recess of uneasy mind to sigh unheard in to the pass wind so the strike deer in some sequestrate part lie down to die the arrow at he heart there stretch would unseen in covert hide from day bleed drop by drop and pants he life away ' it may here be remark that in epistle viii of the _ moral essay _ pope have a line : and other beauty envy wortley 's eye but in a reprint of the poem he substitute -lrb- lady -rrb- worsley for wortley in order to give the impression that wortley have be a misprint pope 's quarrel with lady mary begin in or about 1722 the cause be obscure many reason have be advance lady mary in she correspondence give no clue as to the breach it have be say that it arise out of the fact that pope lend the montagus a pair of sheet and that they be return unwashed to the great indignation of he mother who live with he it be difficult to believe this other have it that he be jealous of the favor which lady mary accord to the duke of wharton and lord hervey certainly he lampoon the duke and he be never weary of write insultingly about the other most probable be the account give by lady louisa stuart lady mary 's grand-daughter which be to the effect that pope make a declaration of love and that lady mary receive it with shriek of laughter if pope be serious it must have gall he indeed though nothing can excuse the malignity with which he pursue she for year and year and if he be not in earnest he would probably have be nearly if not quite as indignant anyhow it be a sorry story and a blot on the scutcheon of the poet who good-hearted as he usually be be curse by the gift refine to a rare degree of alienate he friend more often than not for some fancied slight addison he lampoon and from denni and philip he part company leave he as soon as you can addison have warn lady mary he will certainly play you some devilish trick else : he have a appetite for satire lady mary presently must have wish that she have follow this sage counsel when pope fight he fight with the glove off and not the sex or the age or the standing of the subject of he wrath deter he a whit have i in silent wonder see such thing as pride in slave and avarice in king and at a peer or peeress shall i fret who starve a sister or forswear a debt thus pope in the first dialogue of the _ epilogue to the satire _ the reference to forswear a debt be of course to the rémond business who starve a sister be a allusion to lady mary and lady mar -lrb- 6 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : _ see _ p 200 of this work -rrb- pope return to the attack again and again in _ the satire of dr john donne versified _ he insert the follow line although there be nothing in the original to warrant the stroke at lady mary : yes thank my star as early as i know this town i have the sense to hate it too : yet here as e ` en in hell there must be still one giant vice so excellently ill that all beside one pity not abhor : as who know sappho smile at other whore again in the _ epistle to martha blount _ : as sappho 's diamond with she dirty smock or sappho at she toilet 's greasy task with sappho radiant at a evening mask pope would not admit that he allude to lady mary as sappho but everyone realize that this be so lady mary much distressed begged lord peterborough to urge pope to refrain the mission be undertake reluctantly and the result be scarcely satisfactory he say to I lord peterborough write to lady mary what i have take the liberty of say to you that he wonder how the town would apply these line to any but some note common woman that he would yet be more surprised if you should take they to yourself he name to I four remarkable poetess and scribbler mr centlivre mr heywood mr manley and mr behn assure I that such only be the object of he satire much upset lady mary write the following letter to arbuthnot : January 3 -lrb- 1735 -rrb- sir i have peruse the last lampoon of you ingenious friend and be not surprise you do not find I out under the name of sappho because there be nothing i ever hear in we character or circumstance to make a parallel but as the town -lrb- except you who know better -rrb- generally suppose pope mean I whenever he mention that name i can not help take notice of the horrible malice he bear against the lady signify by that name which appear to be irritated by suppose she writer of the verse to the imitator of horace now i can assure he they be write -lrb- without my knowledge -rrb- by a gentleman of great merit whom i very much esteem who he will never guess and who if he do know he dare not attack but i own the design be so well mean and so excellently execute that i can not be sorry they be write i wish you would advise poor pope to turn to some more honest livelihood than libel i know he will allege in he excuse that he must write to eat and he have now grow sensible that nobody will buy he verse except they curiosity be pique to it to see what be say of they acquaintance but i think this method of gain so exceed vile that it admit of no excuse at all -- can anything be more detestable than he abuse poor moore scarce cold in he grave when it be plain he keep back he poem while he live for fear he should beat he for it this be shocking to I though of a man i never speak to and hardly know by sight but i be seriously concerned at the worse scandal he have heap on mr congreve who be my friend and whom i be oblige to justify because i can do it on my own knowledge and which be yet farther bring witness of it from those who be then often with I that he be so far from loving pope 's rhyme both that -- and he conversation be perpetual joke to he exceed despicable in he opinion and he have often make we laugh in talking of they be particularly pleasant on that subject as to pope 's be bear of honest parent i verily believe it and will add one praise to he mother 's character that -lrb- though i only know she very old -rrb- she always appear to I to have much better sense than himself i desire sir as a favor that you would show this letter to pope and you will very much oblige sir you humble servant lady mary be not a person after severe chastisement to turn the other cheek and pope be well aware of it he believe that more than one social satire upon he come from she pen and he especially suspect she of have write or anyhow of have have a hand in the composition of _ a pop upon pope _ in which a account be give of a whipping in ham walk which be say to have be administer to he the poet be so furious -- he regard it as a indirect attack on he physical deformity of which he be always so conscious -- that he actually insert a announcement in the papers that no such incident have ever occur -- thereby draw yet more attention to the lampoon you may be certain i shall never reply to such a libel as lady mary 's he write to fortescue it be a pleasure and comfort at once to find out that with so much mind as so much malice must have to accuse or blacken my character it can fix upon no one ill or immoral thing in my life and must content itself to say my poetry be dull and my person ugly lady mary in a letter to arbuthnot deny the authorship of _ a pop upon pope _ : sir since i see you i have make some inquiry and hear more of the story you be so kind to mention to I i be tell pope have have the surprising impudence to assert he can bring the lampoon when he please to produce it under my own hand i desire he may be make to keep to this offer if he be so skilful in counterfeit hand i suppose he will not confine that great talent to the gratify he malice but take some occasion to increase he fortune by the same method and i may hope -lrb- by such practice -rrb- to see he exalt accord to he merit which nobody will rejoice at more than myself i beg of you sir -lrb- as a act of justice -rrb- to endeavor to set the truth in a open light and then i leave to you judgment the character of those who have attempt to hurt mine in so barbarous a manner i can assure you -lrb- in particular -rrb- you name a lady to I -lrb- as abused in this libel -rrb- whose name i never hear before and as i never have any acquaintance with dr swift be a utter stranger to all he affair and even he person which i never see to my knowledge and be now convince the whole be a contrivance of pope 's to blast the reputation of one who never injure he i be not more sensible of he injustice than i be sir of you -lrb- _ sic _ -rrb- candor generosity and good sense i have find in you which have oblige I to be with a very uncommon warmth you real friend and i heartily wish for a opportunity of show i be so more effectually than by subscribe myself you very humble servant whether in spite of she denial lady mary have a hand in _ a pop upon pope _ can not be say but it be certainly safe to believe that the follow line be write by she in conjunction the gossip of the day have it with lord hervey with some assistance from mr wyndham then tutor to the duke of cumberland : verse address to the imitator of the first satire of the second book of horace _ by a lady _ nor thou the justice of the world disown that leave thee thus a outcast and alone : for though in law the murder be to kill in equity the murder be the will then while with coward hand you stab a name and try at least to assassinate we fame like the first bold assassin be thy lot ne'er be thy guilt forgive or forget but as thou hat ` st by hatred by mankind and with the emblem of thy crooked mind mark on thy back like cain by god 's own hand wander like he accurse through the land it be this malignant attack upon he person that inspired pope 's line in the _ epistle to arbuthnot _ : once and but once he heedless youth be bit and like that dangerous thing a female wit safe so he think though all the prudent chid he writ no libel but my lady do great odds in amorous or poetic game where woman 's be the sin and man 's the shame with the follow extract from a letter write by lady mary from florence in 1740 this unpleasing incident may be dismiss : the word malignity and a passage in you letter call to my mind the wicked wasp of twickenham : he lie affect I now no more they will be all as much despise as the story of the seraglio and the handkerchief of which i be persuade he be the only inventor that man have a malignant and ungenerous heart and he be base enough to assume the mask of a moralist in order to decry human nature and to give a decent vent to he hatred of man and woman kind -- but i must quit this contemptible subject on which a just indignation would render my pen so fertile that after have fatigue you with a long letter i would surfeit you with a supplement twice as long at twickenham lady mary interested herself in plan alteration in the house and garden there be a sort of pleasure she say in shew one 's own fancy on one 's own ground the longer she stay at the riverside the better she like it i be at

additional merit of be old acquaintance and never have give I any reason to complain of either of 'em i pass some day with the duchess of montagu who might be a reign beauty if she please i see the whole town every Sunday and select a few that i retain to supper in short if life could be always what it be i believe i have so much humility in my temper i could be contented without anything better than this two or three hundred year but alas ` dulness and wrinkle and disease must come and age and death 's irrevocable doom ' lady mary who have some two-score year still to live begin at this time to deplore she increase age for my own part she write to lady mar i have some coterie where wit and pleasure reign and i should not fail to amuse myself tolerably enough but for the d -- d d -- d quality of grow older every day and my present joy be make imperfect by fear of the future however this depression be not always on she and later she be write : i think this be the first time in my life that a letter of yours have lie by I two post unanswered you 'll wonder to hear that short silence be occasion by not have a moment unemployed at twickenham but i pass many hour on horseback and

approach to fifteen nearer than i do ten year ago and be in hope to improve every year in health and vivacity lady mary 's tongue make she many enemy in society and when she tongue fail she she bring she pen into action she love of scandal must have go far to make she unpopular and if she letter to she sister at paris have be publish she would have find herself with scarcely a friend in the world correspondence between lady mary from london or twickenham to she sister the countess of mar at paris be a very one-sided affair this be in part owe to the fact that lord mar be of course suspect and that letter to he or to member of he family and household be -lrb- in all probability -rrb- intercept in this country lady mary who have suspect this more than once become more and more convinced that she suspicion be justified i have writ to you at least five-and-forty letter dear sister without receive any answer and resolve not to confide in post-house fidelity any more be firmly persuade that they never come to you hand or you would not refuse one line to let I know how you do which be and ever will be of great importance to I that be write at christmas 1722 and though in the meantime lady mary hear from she sister she realize that if she want she letter to arrive she must be careful as to the topic upon which she discourse letter be so surely open i dare say nothing to you either of we intrigue or duel both of which would afford great matter of mirth and speculation the difficulty of communication do not decrease i have writ to you twice since i receive yours in answer to that i send by mr de caylus she remark a little later but i believe none of what i send by the post ever come to you hand nor ever will while they be direct to mr water for reason that you may easily guess i wish you would give I a safer direction it be very seldom i can have the opportunity of a private messenger and it be very often that i have a mind to write to my dear sister lady mary of course often stay in london and in she correspondence be many reference to she friend and she doings opera flourish more than ever and i have be in a tract of go every time she write to she sister in April 1723 the people i live most with be none of you acquaintance the duchess of montagu excepted whom i continue to see often she daughter belle be at this instant in the paradisal state of receive visit every day from a passionate lover who be she first love whom she think the finest gentleman in europe and be besides that duke of manchester she mamma and i often laugh and sigh reflect on she felicity the consummation of which will be in a fortnight in the mean time they be permit to be alone together every day and all the day mary 's very best vein be the following letter write about the same time and also address to she sister : i be yet in this wicked town but purpose to leave it as soon as the parliament rise mr murray and all she satellite have so seldom fall in my way i can say little about they you old friend mr lowther be still fair and young and in pale pink every night in the park but after be highly in favor poor i be in utter disgrace without my be able to guess wherefore except she fancy I the author or abettor of two vile ballad write on she die adventure which i be so innocent of that i never saw -lrb- they -rrb- _ a propo _ of ballad a most delightful one be say or sing in most house about we dear beloved plot which have be lay firstly to pope and secondly to I when god know we have neither of we wit enough to make it mr hervey lies-in of a female child lady rich be

better with she than ever lady betty manners be on the brink of matrimony with a yorkshire mr monckton of # 3000 per annum : it be a match of the young duchess 's making and she think matter of great triumph over the two coquette beauty who can get nobody to have and to hold they be decay to a piteous degree and so neglect that they be grow constant and particular to the two ugliest fellow in london mrs pulteney condescend to be publicly keep by the noble earl of cadogan whether mr pulteney have a pad nag deduct out of the profit for he share i can not tell but he appear very well satisfy with it this be i think the whole state of love as to that of wit it split itself into ten thousand branch poet increase and multiply to that stupendous degree you see they at every turn even in embroidered coat and pink-coloured top-knot make verse be almost as common as take snuff and god can tell what miserable stuff people carry about in they pocket and offer to they acquaintance and you know one can not refuse reading and take a pinch this be a very great grievance and so particularly shocking to I that i think we wise lawgiver should take it into consideration and appoint a fast-day to beseech heaven to put a stop to this epidemical disease as they do last year for the plague with great success another typical letter from lady mary contain a story of the class that strongly appeal to she : the most divert story about town at present be in relation to edgcombe though you not know the people concern so well as i do will i fear hinder you from be so much entertain by it i

shew up stair to miss tichborne who be ready to drop down at the sight of she and could not help ask she in a grave way how she get in be deny to every mortal intend to pass the evening in devout preparation miss leigh say she have send away she chair and servant with intent of stay till nine o'clock there be then no remedy and she be ask to sit down but have not be there a quarter of a hour when she hear a violent rap at the door and somebody vehemently run up stair miss tichborne seem much surprised and say she believe it be mr edgcombe and be quite amaze how he take it into he head to visit she during these excuse enter edgcombe who appear fright at the sight of a third person miss tichborne tell he almost at he entrance that the lady he see there be perfect mistress of music and as he passionately love it she think she could not oblige he more than by desire she to play miss leigh very willingly sit to the harpsichord upon which she audience decamp to the adjoining room and leave she to play over three or four lesson to herself they return and make what excuse they could but say very frankly they have not hear she performance and beg she to begin again which she comply with and give they the opportunity of a second retirement miss leigh be by this time all fire and flame to see she heavenly harmony thus slight and when they return tell they she do not understand play to a empty room mr edgcombe beg ten thousand pardon and say if she would play _ godus _ it be a tune he die to hear and it would be a obligation he should never forget she make answer she would do he a much greater favor by she absence which she suppose be all that be necessary at that time and run down stair in a great fury to publish as fast as she could and be so indefatigable in this pious design that in four-and-twenty hour all the people in town have hear the story my lady sunderland could not avoid hear this story and three day after invite miss leigh to dinner where in the presence of she sister and all the servant she tell she she be very sorry she have be so rudely treat in she house that it be very true mr edgcombe have be a perpetual companion of she sister 's these two year and she think it high time he should explain himself and she expect she sister should act in this matter as discreetly as lady k -lrb- katherine -rrb- pelham have do in the like case who have give mr pelham four month to resolve in and after that he be either to marry she or to lose she for ever sir robert sutton interrupted she by say that he never doubt the honor of mr edgcombe and be persuade he could have no ill design in he family the affair stand thus and mr edgcombe have four month to provide himself elsewhere during which time he have free egress and regress and ` tis seriously the opinion of many that a wedding will in good earnest be bring about by this admirable conduct i send you a novel instead of a letter but as it be in you power to shorten it when you please by read no farther than you like i will make no excuse for the length of it lady mary have contract a intimacy with griselda baillie the wife of mr -lrb- afterwards sir a -rrb- murray of stanhope after she return from abroad and there be frequent mention of she in the correspondence but the friendship come to a abrupt end in 1725 among the rest a very odd whim have enter the little head of mr murray : do you know she will not visit I this winter lady mary write to lady mar i accord to the usual integrity of my heart and simplicity of my manners with great _ naïveté _ desire to explain with she on the subject and she answer that she be convince that i have make the ballad upon she and be resolve never to speak to I again i answer -lrb- which be true -rrb- that i utterly defy she to have any one single proof of my make it without be able to get any thing from she but repetition that she know it i can not suppose that any thing you have say should occasion this rupture and the reputation of a quarrel be always so ridiculous on both side that you will oblige I in mention it to she for ` tis now at that pretty pass she will not curtsey to I whenever she met I which be superlatively silly -lrb- if she really know it -rrb- after a suspension of resentment for two year together mr murray have have a unpleasant adventure with she footman arthur gray who have break into she bedroom lady mary have write and circulate _ a epistle from arthur gray _ and later another and a improper ballad have appear under the title of _ virtue in danger _ mr murray be firmly convince that both piece come from the same pen lady mar on receipt of the above letter propose to act as peacemaker i give you thanks for the good office you promise with regard to mr murray lady mary write to she in reply and i shall think myself sincerely oblige to you as i already be on many account ` tis very disagreeable in she to go about behave and talk as she do and very silly into the bargain mr murray be in open war with I in such a manner as make she very ridiculous without do I much harm my moderation have a very bright pretence of shew itself -lrb- she write to lady mar -rrb- firstly she be please to attack I in very billingsgate at a masquerade where she be as visible as ever she be in she own clothes i have the temper not only to keep silence myself but enjoin it to the person with I who would have be very glad to have shewn he great skill in sousing upon that occasion she endeavor to sweeten he by very exorbitant praise of he person which might even have be mistake for make love from a woman of less celebrated virtue and conclude she oration with pious warning to he to avoid the conversation of one so unworthy he regard as myself who to she certain knowledge love another man this last article i own pique I more than all she preceding civility the gentleman she address herself to have a very slight acquaintance with I and might possibly go away in the opinion that she have be confidante in some very notorious affair of mine however i make she no answer at the time but you may imagine i lay up these thing in my heart and the first assembly i have the honor to meet she at with a meek tone of voice ask she how i have deserve so much abuse at she hand which i assure she i would never return she deny it in the spirit of lie and in the spirit of folly own it at length i contented myself with tell she she be very ill advise and thus we part but two day ago when sir geoffrey kneller 's picture be to be sell she go to my sister gower and very civily ask if she intend to bid for you picture assure she that if she do she would not offer at purchase it you know crimp and quadrille incapacitate that poor soul from ever buy any thing but she tell I this circumstance and i expect the same civility from mr murray have no way provoke she to the contrary but she not only come to the auction but with all possible spite bid up the picture though i tell she that if you pleased to have it i would gladly part with it to you though to no other person this have no effect upon she nor she malice any more on I than the loss of ten guinea extraordinary which i pay upon she account the picture be in my possession and at you service if you please to have it she go to the masquerade a few night afterwards and have the good sense to tell people there that she be very unhappy in not meet I be come there on purpose to abuse I what profit or pleasure she have in these way i can not find out this i know that revenge have so few joy for I i shall never lose so much time as to undertake it so early as 1721 lady mary write to lady mar mention that the most considerable incident that have happen a good while be the ardent affection that mr hervey and she dear spouse -lrb- 7 -rrb- take to I they visit I twice or thrice a day and be perpetually coo in my room i be complaisant a great while but -lrb- as you know -rrb- my talent have never lie much that way i grow at last so weary of those bird of paradise i flee to twickenham as much to avoid they persecution as for my own health which be still in a decline way lady mary do not like lady hervey the beautiful molly lepell whom gay eulogise : hervey would you know the passion you have kindle in my breast trifling be the inclination that by word can be express in my silence see the lover true love be by silence know in my eye you 'll best discover all the power of you own -lrb- footnote 7 : the hon john hervey -lrb- 1696-1743 -rrb- younger son of john first earl of bristol know as lord hervey after the death of he elder brother carr in 1723 vice-chamberlain of george ii 's household 1730 create baron hervey of ickworth 1733 lord privy seal 1740-1742 -rrb- for hervey however lady mary come to have a strong liking that many believe to have as she would have say border upon the tender although it be on record that she once remark that she divide the human race into man woman and hervey they meet whenever they could when they could not meet they correspond pope bitterly resent the intimacy between lady mary and hervey and in the _ epistle of arbuthnot _ give vent to the malignity with which he soul have be for year overflow : p let sporus tremble a what that thing of silk sporus that mere white curd of ass 's milk satire or sense alas can sporus feel who break a butterfly on

that can creep and pride that lick the dust -lrb- footnote 8 : queen caroline -rrb- this be a heavy price to pay for the favor even of lady mary wortley montagu whatever the relation between lady mary and hervey lady hervey be not indulgent to they which may have inspire lady mary to write to she sister : lady hervey by aim too high have fall very low and be reduce to try to persuade folk she have a intrigue and get nobody to believe she the man in question take a great deal of pain to clear himself of the scandal lady hervey and mr murray be active partisan of lord grange in he persecution of lady mary and aid he in he attempt to get possession of she sister lady mar the bad term on which lady mary and lady hervey be be most clearly define by lady louisa stuart : at the time of lady mary wortley 's return home -lrb- in 1762 after a absence abroad of more than twenty year -rrb- lady hervey be live in great intimacy with lady bute for whom she profess and it be believe really feel the highest esteem and admiration on hearing of she mother 's arrival she come to she owning herself embarrass by the fear of give she pain or offence but yet compel to declare that formerly something have pass between she and lady mary which make any renewal of they acquaintance impossible therefore if she forbear visit she she throw herself upon lady bute 's friendship and candor for pardon no explanation follow lady bute who must have early see the necessity of take care not to be entangled in she mother 's quarrel which to speak truth be seldom few in number only know that there have be a old feud between she lady hervey and lady hervey 's friend mr -lrb- or lady -rrb- murray the particulars of which forget even then by everybody but themselves may well be now beyond recall during this period there be several domestic happening in lady mary 's family on march 5 1726 die she father the duke of kingston after the accession of george i the marquess of dorchester -lrb- as he then be -rrb- be high in favor at court and honor be shower upon he with a lavish hand he be in 1714 appoint lord lieutenant of wiltshire and in the same year chief justice in eyre north of trent which latter dignity he hold for two year in August 1715 he be create duke of kingston upon hull in the county of yorkshire he hold the high office of lord privy seal from 1716 to 1719 in the administration of

be give the garter in 1719 and be four time name as one of the lord justice of the realm during the king 's absence from england on visit to hanover he have marry secondly isabellum fifth daughter of william bentinck first earl of portland by he first wife anne daughter of sir edward villier who survive he two year the duke have never really forgive lady mary for elope she defiance of he hurt he pride inordinately everyone else to some degree at least he could control he young daughter not at all only so far be they ever reconcile that he would occasionally visit the montagus at they london house and play with the child in he later year the duke 's health be unsatisfactory but it be not think that the end be so near i have now to tell you of the surprising death of my father and a great deal of surprising management of the people about he which i leave inform you until another time be now under some spirit of hurry myself lady mary write to lady mar in march 1726 i be unfeignedly sorry that i can not send you word of a considerable legacy for yourself on April 15 she supplement this account but not to a degree to make it very intelligible : to be sure the shock must be very great to you whenever you hear it as indeed it be to we all here be so sudden it be to no purpose now to relate particulars but only renew we grief i can not forbear tell you the duchess have behave very oddly in endeavor to get the guardianship of the young duke and he sister contrary to she husband 's will but the boy when he be fourteen confirm the trustee he grandfather leave so that end all dispute and lady fanny be to live with my aunt cheyne there be a vast number of thing that have happen and some people 's behavior so extraordinary in this melancholy business that it would be great ease of mind if i could tell it you but i must not venture to speak too freely in a letter a week or so later some further detail be forthcoming : i receive yours dear sister this minute and be very sorry both for you past illness and affliction though _ au bout du compte _ i do not know why filial piety should exceed fatherly fondness so much by way of consolation as to the management at that time -- i do verily believe if my good aunt and sister have be less fool and my dear mother-in-law less mercenary thing might have have a turn more to you advantage and mine too when we meet i will tell you many circumstance which would be tedious in a letter i could not get my sister gower to join to act with I and mamma and i be in a actual scold when my poor father expire she have shew a hardness of heart upon this occasion that would appear incredible to any body not capable of it themselves the addition to she jointure be one way or other # 2000 per annum so she good grace remain a passable rich widow and be already present by the town with a variety of young husband but i believe she constitution be not good enough to let she amorous inclination get the better of she covetous lady mary be very angry because she hear that at the end she father have really express a great deal of kindness to she and even a desire of talk to she which the duchess would not permit however he leave she in he will she have marry without a settlement # 6000 for she separate use during she life with reversion to she daughter as regard the heir she write : the duke of kingston have hitherto have so ill a education ` tis hard to make any judgment of he he have spirit but i fear he will never have he father 's good sense as young nobleman go ` tis possible he may make a good figure among they the young duke be send to france and there be much discussion as to what should be do with he sister lady france pierrepont she have # 400 per annum for maintenance have lady mary remark ironically awaken the conscience of half she relation to take care of she education and -lrb- except myself -rrb- they have all be squabbling about she my sister gower carry she off to-morrow morning to staffordshire the lie twaddle and contrivance about this affair be innumerable i should pity the poor girl if i see she pity herself lady gower do not long enjoy she victory over she friend and she fond relation for she die in June 1727 in may 1732 lord mar die at aix-la-chapelle lady mary 's sister lady mar in later year suffer from mental irregularity she brother-in-law jame erskine lord grange endeavor to secure possession of she person by some process of law but be thwart by lady mary who obtain a warrant from the king 's bench for year lady mar remain in she sister 's custody she survive until 1761 there be a rumor that lady mary treat she badly but there be no reason to believe that there be any substantial ground for the accusation lady mary 's daughter mary marry in 1736 john stuart third earl of bute the favorite of the princess of wale and afterwards prime minister chapter xiii on the continent -lrb- 1739-1744 -rrb- lady mary leaf england -- she do not return for twenty year -- montagu suppose to join she -- the domestic relation of the montagus -- a septennial act for marriage -- lady mary correspond with she husband -- dijon -- turin -- venice -- bologna -- florence -- the monastery of la trappe -- horace walpole at florence -- he comment on lady mary and she friend -- reason for he dislike of she -- rome -- the young pretender and henry cardinal york -- wanderings -- cheapness of life in italy -- lady mary 's son edward -- he be a great trouble to he parent -- he absurd marriage -- he extravagance and folly -- account of he early year -- he visit lady mary at valence -- she account of the interview in July 1739 lady mary go abroad she do not return until the beginning of 1762 a few month before she death she go abroad without she husband and indeed they never meet again at first apparently he have intend to join she -- at least so she give lady pomfret to understand : you have put I to a very difficult choice yet when i consider we be both in italy and yet do not see one another i be astonish at the capriciousness of my fortune -lrb- she write from venice late in 1739 -rrb- my affair be so uncertain i can answer for nothing that be future i have take some pain to put the inclination for travel into mr wortley 's head and be so much afraid he would change he mind that i hasten before he in order -lrb- at least -rrb- to secure my journey he propose follow I in six week he business require he presence at newcastle since that the change of scene that have happen in england have make he friend persuade he to attend parliament this session : so that what he inclination which must govern mine will be next spring i can not absolutely foresee for my own part i like my own situation so well that it will be a displeasure to I to change it to postpone such a conversation as yours a whole twelvemonth be a terrible appearance on the other hand i would not follow the example of the first of we sex and sacrifice for a present pleasure a more lasting happiness in short i can determine nothing on this subject when you be at florence we may debate it over again so little be know of the domestic relation of the montagus that it be hazardous to advance a conjecture one writer have suggest that there be a quarrel over money but there be no grounds to support this another have it that lady mary 's flirtation or intrigue do not meet with she husband 's approval yet another think that montagu find he wife with she sharp tongue very ill to live with the montagus have be marry for seven-and-twenty year they younger child be now twenty-one since montagu assist lady mary as a girl with she latin study they do not seem to have have much in common lady mary cut a figure in the social world montagu be a nonentity in political life and seem content so to be perhaps they be tire of each other and welcome a separation that at the outset be intend only to be temporary it be from the custom of the turk that i first have the thought of a septennial bill for the benefit of married person lady mary once say to joseph spence and it be more than likely that she would have take advantage of such a act of parliament have it be in existence that there be no definite breach be evident from the fact that husband and wife correspond though it must be confess that she letter to she husband be almost uniformly dull except when the topic be they son on the other hand there be certainly no especial degree of friendship between they and in one of she letter lady mary say pointedly : you do not seem desirous to hear news which make I not trouble you with any for the rest there be description of the place which lady mary visit and a account of the people she meet lady mary proceed from dover to calai and thence to dijon where she arrive in the middle of August wherever she go she find herself among friend there be not any town in france where there be not english scotch or irish family establish and i have meet with people who have see I -lrb- though often such as i do not remember to have see -rrb- in every town i have pass through and i think the farther i go the more acquaintance i meet she tell she husband at dijon there be no less than sixteen family of fashion lord mansel have lodgings in the house with she at dijon and mr whitst a daughter of lord bathurst reside in the same street she meet lady peterborough and just miss the duke of rutland at st omer at port beauvoisin she run across lord carlisle from turin she travel on the advice of lord carlisle to vienna which he declare be the best place in italy in which to stay the fact that it be the intention of lady pomfret to remove from sienna to vienna be the decide factor she like the latter city so well that she remain there until August of the following year -lrb- 1740 -rrb- it have one great merit in lady mary 's eye that it be cheap next to that she derive pleasure from the consideration with which she be treat i like this place extremely and be of opinion you would do so too : as to cheapness i think ` tis impossible to find any part of europe where both the law and custom be so contrived purposely to avoid expense of all sort and here be a universal liberty that be certainly one of the greatest _ agréments _ in life we have foreign ambassador from all part of the world who have all visit I i have receive visit from many of the noble venetian lady and upon the whole i be very much at my ease here if i be write to lady sophium i would tell she of the comedy and opera which be every night at very low price but i believe even you will agree with I that they be order to be as convenient as possible every mortal go in a mask and consequently no trouble in dress or form of any kind so lady mary write to lady pomfret on October 10 and a few day later she supplement the information in a letter to she husband : i find myself very well here i be visit by the most considerable people of the town and all the foreign minister who have most of they make great entertainment for I i dine yesterday at the spanish ambassador 's who even surpass the french in magnificence he meet I at the hall-door and the lady at the stair-head to conduct I through the long apartment in short they could not have show I more honor if i have be a ambassadress she desire I to think myself patrona del casa and offer I all the service in she power to wait on I where i pleased & c they have the finest palace in venice what be very convenient i hear it be not at all expect i should make any dinner it not be the fashion for anybody to do it here but the foreign minister and i find i can live here very genteelly on my allowance i have already a very agreeable general acquaintance though when i come here be no one i have ever see in my life but the cavaliere grimanus and the abbé contus i must do they -lrb- the -rrb- justice to say they have take pain to be oblige to I the procurator bring he niece -lrb- who be at the head of he family -rrb- to wait on I and they invite I to reside with they at they palace on the brent but i do not think it proper to accept of it he also introduce I to the signora pisanus mocenigo who be the most considerable lady here the nuncio be particularly civil to I he have be several time to see I and have offer I the use of he box at the opera i have many other at my service and in short it be impossible for a stranger to be better receive than i be here be no english except a mr bertie and he governor who arrive two day ago and who intend but a short stay lady mary thoroughly enjoy herself at venice where she find a variety of occupation to occupy she time in the morning she be wrapt up among my book with antiquarian and virtuoso in the afternoon there be visit to pay and receive in the evening dinner -lrb- at other people 's expense -- which fact do not detract from she pleasure -rrb- assembly and the theater and the opera in fact she find there every delight except scandal but that she do not miss because she say she never find any pleasure in malice so strange a thing be human nature that perhaps she believe it upon my word i have speak my real thought in relation to venice but i will be more particular in my description lest you should find the same reason of complaint you have hitherto experienced -lrb- she write in November to lady pomfret -rrb- it be impossible to give any rule for the agreeableness of conversation but here be so great a variety i think ` tis impossible not to find some to suit every taste here be foreign minister from all part of the world who as they have no court to employ they hour be overjoy to enter into commerce with any stranger of distinction as i be the only lady here at present i can assure you i be court as if i be the only one in the world as to all the convenience of life they be to be have at very easy rate and for those that love public place here be two playhouse and two opera constantly perform every night at exceed low price but you will have no reason to examine that article no more than myself all the ambassador have box appoint they and i have every one of they key at my service not only for my own person but whoever i please to carry or send i do not make much use of this privilege to they great astonishment it be the fashion for the greatest lady to walk the street which be admirably pave and a mask price sixpence with a little cloak and the head of a domino the genteel dress to carry you everywhere the greatest equipage be a gondola that hold eight person and be the price of a english chair and it be so much the established fashion for everybody to live they own way that nothing be more ridiculous than censure the action of another this would be terrible in london where we have little other diversion but for I who never find any pleasure in malice i bless my destiny that have conduct I to a part where people be better employ than in talking of the affair of they acquaintance it be at present excessive cold -lrb- which be the only thing i have to find fault with -rrb- but in recompense we have a clear bright sun and fog and faction thing unheard of in this climate certainly everybody do the utmost to make venice agreeable to lady mary with all she good opinion of herself and of she position she find herself treat with more distinction than she could possibly expect when on christmas eve she go to see the ceremony of high mass celebrate by the doge she be surprise to find that he have set aside for she and the prince of wolfenbuttel a gallery to which none be admit but they party a greater compliment could not have be pay I if i have be a sovereign princess to she husband she write : it be impossible to be better treated i may even say more court than i be here all the english who come to venice as a matter of course pay they respects to lady mary lord fitzwilliam arrive here three day ago he come to see I the next day as all the english do who be much surprised at the civility and familiarity which i be with the noble lady everybody tell I ` tis what never be do but to myself and i own i have a little vanity in it because the french ambassador tell I when i first come that though the procurator grimanus might persuade they to visit I he defy I to enter into any sort of intimacy with they : instead of which they call I out almost every day on some diversion or other and be desirous to have I in all they party of pleasure i be invite to-morrow to the foscarinus to dinner which be to be follow by a concert and a ball where i shall be the only stranger though here be at present a great number come to see the regatta which be fix for the 29th of this month n i shall see it at the procurator grimanus 's where there will be a great entertainment that day my own house be very well situate to see it be on the grand canal but i would not refuse he and he niece since they seem desirous of my company and i shall oblige some other lady with my window they be hire at a great rate to see the show there be just one fly in the ointment i be impatient to hear good sense pronounce in my native tongue have only hear my language out of the mouth of boy and governor for these five month -lrb- she complain to lady pomfret -rrb- here be inundation of they break in upon we this carnival and my apartment must be they refuge the greater part of they have keep a inviolable fidelity to the language they nurse teach they they whole business abroad -lrb- as far as i can perceive -rrb- be to buy new clothes in which they shine in some obscure coffee-house where they be sure of meet only one another and after the important conquest of some wait gentlewoman of a opera queen whom perhaps they remember as long as they live return to england excellent judge of man and manners i find the spirit of patriotism so strong in I every time i see they that i look on they as the greatest blockhead in nature and to say truth the compound of booby and _ petit maître _ make up a very odd sort of animal it be not until the middle of August -lrb- 1740 -rrb- that lady mary left venice go first to bologna where she stay a day or two to prepare for the dreadful passage of the apennine on she way to florence she visit the monastery of la trappe -- she account of which may be give as a companion portrait to that of the nunnery print in a earlier chapter the monastery of la trappe be of french origin and one of the most austere and self-denying order i have meet with in this gloomy retreat it give I pain to observe the infatuation of man who have devoutly reduce themselves to a much worse condition than that of the beast folly you see be the lot of humanity whether it arise in the flowery path of pleasure or the thorny one of a ill-judged devotion but of the two sort of fool i shall always think that the merry one have the most eligible fate and i can not well form a notion of that spiritual and ecstatic joy that be mix with sigh groan hunger and thirst and the other complicated misery of monastic discipline it be a strange way of go to work for happiness to excite a enmity between soul and body which nature and providence have design to live together in union and friendship and which we can not separate like man and wife when they happen to disagree the profound silence that be enjoin upon the monk of la trappe be a singular circumstance of they unsociable and unnatural discipline and be this injunction never to be dispense with it would be needless to visit they in any other character than as a collection of statue but the superior of the convent suspend in we favor that rigorous law and allow one of the mute to converse with I and answer a few discreet question he tell I that the monk of this order in france be still more austere than those of italy as they never taste wine flesh fish or egg but live entirely upon vegetable the story that be tell of the institution of this order be remarkable and be well attest if my information be good its founder be a french nobleman whose name be bouthillior de rancé a man of pleasure and gallantry which be convert into the deepest gloom of devotion by the follow incident he affair oblige he to absent himself for some time from a lady with whom he have live in the most intimate and tender connexion of successful love at he return to pari he propose to surprise she agreeably and at the same time to satisfy he own impatient desire of see she by go directly and without ceremony to she apartment by a back stair which he be well acquaint with -- but think of the spectacle that present itself to he at he entrance into the chamber that have so often be the scene of love 's highest rapture he mistress dead -- dead of the small-pox -- disfigure beyond expression -- a loathsome mass of putrified matter -- and the surgeon separate the head from the body because the coffin have be make too short he stand for a moment motionless in amazement and fill with horror -- and then retire from the world shut himself up in the convent of la trappe where he pass the remainder of he day in the most cruel and disconsolate devotion -- let we quit this sad subject the news that lady mary be come to florence come to the ear of horace walpole who be stay there if he have not yet make she acquaintance he certainly know much about she on Wednesday we expect a third she-meteor he write to richard west July 31 1740 those learn luminary the lady pomfret and walpole -lrb- 9 -rrb- be to be join by the lady mary wortley montagu you have not be witness to the rhapsody of mystic nonsense which these two fair one debate incessantly and consequently can not figure what must be the issue of this triple alliance : we have some idea of it only figure the coalition of prudery debauchery sentiment history greek latin french italian and metaphysics all except the second understand by half by quarter or not at all you shall have the journal of this notable academy walpole send some seven week later a account of the lady to the hon henry seymor conway : do i tell you lady mary wortley be here she laugh at my lady walpole scold my lady pomfret and be laugh at by the whole town she dress she avarice and she impudence must amaze any one that never hear she name she wear a foul mob that do not cover she greasy black lock that hang loose never comb or curl mazarine blue wrapper that gape open and discover a canvas petticoat she face swollen violently on one side be partly cover with a plaister and partly with white paint which for cheapness she have buy so coarse that you would not use it to wash a chimney -lrb- footnote 9 : the wife of the eldest son of sir robert walpole who in 1723 be create baron walpole he later succeed as -lrb- second -rrb- earl of orford -rrb- in another letter to richard west -lrb- October 2 1740 -rrb- walpole give a account of the academy but for the academy i be not of it but frequently in company with it he write ti all disjointed madame -- -lrb- 10 -rrb- who though a learn lady have not lose she modesty and character be extremely scandalise with the two other dame especially with moll worthless -lrb- 11 -rrb- who know no bound she be at rivalry with lady w -- -lrb- 12 -rrb- for a certain mr -- whom perhaps you know at oxford he fall into sentiment with my lady w and be happy to catch she at platonic love but as she seldom stop there the poor man will be frighten out of he sens when she shall break the matter to he for he never dream that she purpose be so naught lady mary be so far go that to get he from the mouth of she antagonist she literally take he out to dance country dance at a formal ball where there be no measure keep in laugh at she she play at pharaoh two or three time at princess craon 's where she cheat horse and foot she be really entertaining : i have be read she work which she lend out in manuscript but they be too womanish : i like few of she performance -lrb- footnote 10 : lady pomfret -rrb- -lrb- footnote 11 : lady mary wortley montagu -rrb- -lrb- footnote 12 : lady walpole -rrb- lady mary be of course entirely ignorant of horace walpole 's feeling about she of which naturally he show no sign in social intercourse with she i see he often both at florence and genoa and you may believe i know he she tell she daughter i be well acquaint with mr walpole at florence and indeed he be particularly civil to I she write on another occasion i have great encouragement to ask favor of he if i do not know that few people have so good memory to remember so many year backwards as have pass since i have see he if he have treat the character of queen elizabeth with disrespect -lrb- in _ a catalogue of the royal and noble author of england _ -rrb- all the woman should tear he to piece for abuse the glory of they sex neither be it just to put she in the list of author have never publish anything though we have mr camden 's authority that she write many valuable piece chiefly greek translation i wish all monarch would bestow they leisure hour on such study : perhaps they would not be very useful to mankind but it may be assert for a certain truth they own mind could be more improved than by the amusement of quadrille or cavagnole lady mary need not have fear that walpole have forget she he bear she much in mind to he die day and find never a kind thing to say about she it may be presume that he animosity arise from the fact that lady mary have champion molly skerritt against he mother when miss skerritt be live openly as the mistress of sir robert walpole yet though he write so abusively about she he concern himself with a new edition of the _ court poem _ though with what right have never transpire i have lately have lady mary wortley 's ecloque publish but they do not please though so excessively good he write to sir horace mann November 24 1747 i say so confidently for mr chute agree with I : he say for the _ epistle from arthur gray _ scarce any woman could have write it and no man for a man who have have experience enough to paint such sentiment so well would not have have warmth enough leave do you know anything of lady mary she adventurous son be come in parliament but have not open from florence lady mary repair to rome there she do not see the chevalier de st george but she do see he two son charle edward the young pretender and henry cardinal york the eldest seem thoughtless enough and be really not unlike mr lyttelton in he shape and air she write to montagu the youngest be very well make dance finely and have a ingenuous countenance he be but fourteen year of age the family live very splendidly yet pay everybody and -lrb- wherever they get it -rrb- be certainly in no want of money lady mary seem to have have no prepared itinerary but to have wander as the spirit move she -- naple leghorn turin genoa the cheapness of italy appeal to she frugal mind the manners of italy be so much altered since we be here last the alteration be scarce credible they say it have be by the last war the french be master introduce all they custom which be eagerly embrace by the lady and i believe will never be lay aside yet the different government make different manners in every state you know though the republic be not rich here be many private family vastly so and live at a great superfluous expense : all the people of the first quality keep coach as fine as the speaker 's and some of they two or three though the street be too narrow to use they in the town but they take the air in they and they chair carry they to the gate the livery be all plain : gold or silver be forbid to be worn within the wall the habit be all oblige to be black but they wear exceed fine lace and linen and in they country-house which be generally in the faubuurg they dress very rich and have extreme fine jewel here be nothing cheap but house a palace fit for a prince may be hire for fifty pound per annum i mean unfurnished all game of chance be strictly prohibit and it seem to I the only law they do not try to evade : they play at quadrille piquet & c but not high here be no regular public assembly i have be visit by all of the first rank and invite to several fine dinner particularly to the wedding of one of the house of spinolum where there be ninety-six sit down to table and i think the entertainment one of the best i ever see there be the night follow a ball and supper for the same company with the same profusion they tell I that all they great marriage be keep in the same public manner nobody keep more than two horse all they journey be post the expense of they include the coachman be -lrb- i be tell -rrb- fifty pound per annum a chair be very near as much i give eighteen franc a week for mine the senator can converse with no stranger during the time of they magistracy which last two year the number of servant be regulate and almost every lady have the same which be two footman a gentleman-usher and a page who follow she chair certainly the simple life appeal to lady mary but much as she like geneva the cost of live irk she everything be as dear as it be at london she complain to she husband in November 1741 ` tis true as all equipage be forbid that expense be entirely retrench the way of living be absolutely the reverse of that in italy here be no show and a great deal of eat there be all the magnificence imaginable and no dinner but on particular occasion yet the difference of the price render the total expense very near equal the people here be very well to be like and this little republic have a air of the simplicity of old rome in its earliest age the magistrate toil with they own hand and they wife literally dress they dinner against they return from they little senate yet without dress and equipage ` tis as dear live here for a stranger as in place where one be oblige to both from the price of all sort of provision which they be force to buy from they neighbor have almost no land of they own how much more agreeable from lady mary 's point of view be chambery : here be the most profound peace and unbounded plenty that be to be find in any corner of the universe but not one rag of money for my part i think it amount to the same thing whether one be oblige to give several penny for bread or can have a great deal of bread for a penny since the savoyard nobility here keep as good table without money as those in london who spend in a week what would be here a considerable yearly revenue wine which be equal to the best burgundy be sell for a penny a quart and i have a cook for very small wages that be capable of rival chloé my girl give I great prospect of satisfaction but my young rogue of a son be the most ungovernable little rake that ever play truant lady mary write to lady mar in July 1727 when the boy be fourteen and the girl nine year old it have already be mention that young edward who be place at westminster school at the early age of five run away in fact he run away more than once my bless offspring have already make a great noise in the world he mother tell lady mar in July 1726 that young rake my son take to he heel t ` other day and transport he person to oxford be in he own opinion thoroughly qualify for the university after a good deal of search we find and reduce he much against he will to the humble condition of a schoolboy it happen very luckily that the sobriety and discretion be of my daughter 's side i be sorry the ugliness be so too for my son grow extremely handsome the lad be incorrigible in the following year he disappear for some month to be find sell fish at blackwall my cousin be go to paris and i will not let she go without a letter for you my dear sister though i be never in a worse humor for write -lrb- the anxious mother write to she sister -rrb- i be vex to the blood by my young rogue of a son who have contrived at he age to make himself the talk of the whole nation he be go knight-erranting god know where and hitherto ` tis impossible to find he you may judge of my uneasiness by what you own would be if dear lady fanny be lose nothing that ever happen to I have trouble I so much i can hardly speak or write of it with tolerable temper and i own it have change mine to that degree i have a mind to cross the water to try what effect a new heaven and a new earth will have upon my spirit later edward run away again join the crew of a ship go to oporto and be not discover in that city until a considerable period have elapse since he flight he cap all he folly by marry at the age of twenty a woman of no social standing and much older than himself he parent be at they wit ' end it be hopeless to treat he as a rational be he wife be induce to accept a pension to leave he and he himself be put in charge of a keeper several time he have to be keep in close confinement he be however by no means devoid of brain and in the autumn of 1741 he have sufficiently recover to be enter as a student at the university of leyden he allowance be # 300 a year which he find so insufficient for the indulgence of he taste that he be soon considerably in debt in lady mary 's correspondence there be many letter to she husband about they son genoa aug 15 1741 i be sorry to trouble you on so disagreeable a subject as we son but i receive a letter from he last post in which he solicit you dissolve he marriage as if it be wholly in you power and the reason he give for it be so that he may marry more to you satisfaction it be very vexatious -lrb- though no more than i expect -rrb- that time have no effect and that it be impossible to convince he of he true situation he enclose this letter in one to mr birtle and tell I that he do not doubt that debt of # 200 be pay you may imagine this silly proceeding occasion I a dun from mr birtle i tell he the person that write the letter be to my knowledge not worth a groat which be all i think proper to say on the subject lyon April 23 1742 i be very glad you have be prevail on to let we son take a commission : if you have prevent it he would have always say and perhaps think and persuade other people you have hinder he rise in the world though i be fully persuade that he can never make a tolerable figure in any station of life when he be at morin on he first leave france i then try to prevail with he to serve the emperor as volunteer and represent to he that a handsome behavior one campaign might go a great way in retrieve he character and offer to use my interest with you -lrb- which i say i do not doubt would succeed -rrb- to furnish he with a handsome equipage he then answer he suppose i wish he kill out of the way i be afraid he pretended reformation be not very sincere i wish time may prove I in the wrong i here enclose the last letter i receive from he i answer it the follow post in these word : ' i be very glad you resolve to continue obedient to you father and be sensible of he goodness towards you mr birtle show I you letter to he in which you enclose yours to I where you speak to he as you friend subscribe yourself he faithful humble servant he be at genoa in he uncle 's house when you be there and well acquaint with you though you seem ignorant of everything relate to he i wish you would make such sort of apology for any error you may commit i pray god you future behavior may redeem the past which will be a great blessing to you affectionate mother ' i have not since hear from he i suppose he know not what to say to so plain a detect falsehood it be very disagreeable to I to converse with one from whom i do not expect to hear a word of truth and who i be very sure will repeat many thing that never pass in we conversation you see the most solemn assurance be not bind from he since he could come to london in opposition to you command after have so frequently protest he would not move a step except by you order however as you insist on my see he i will do it and think valence the properest town for that interview it be but two day ' journey from this place it be in dauphiné i shall stay here till i have a answer to this letter if you order you son to go to valence i desire you would give he a strict command of go by a feigned name i do not doubt you return I whatever money i may give he but as i believe if he receive money from I he will be make I frequent visit it be clearly my opinion i should give he none whatever you may think proper for he journey you may remit to he lyon April 25 -lrb- 1742 -rrb- on recollection -lrb- however inconvenient it may be to I on many account -rrb- i be not sorry to converse with my son i shall at least have the satisfaction of make a clear judgment of he behavior and temper : which i shall deliver to you in the most sincere and unprejudiced manner you need not apprehend that i shall speak to he in passion i do not know that i ever do in my life i be not apt to be over-heated in discourse and be so far prepare even for the worst on he side that i think nothing he can say can alter the resolution i have take of treat he with calmness both nature and interest -lrb- be i incline to follow blindly the dictate of either -rrb- would determine I to wish he you heir rather than a stranger but i think myself oblige both by honor conscience and my regard for you no way to deceive you and i confess hitherto i see nothing but falsehood and weakness through he whole conduct it be possible this person may be alter since i see he but he figure then be very agreeable and he manner insinuate i very well remember the profession he make to I and do not doubt he be as lavish of they to other people perhaps lord carteret may think he no ill match for a ugly girl that stick upon he hand the project of break he marriage show at least he devotion counterfeit since i be sensible it can not be do but by false witness he wife be not young enough to get gallant nor rich enough to buy they i make choice of valence for we interview as a town where we be not likely to find any english and he may if he please be quite unknown which it be hardly possible to be in any capital town either of france or italy lyon may 2 -lrb- 1742 -rrb- i receive this morning yours of April 12 and at the same time the enclose which i send you ti the first i have receive since the detection of that falsehood in regard to mr birtle i always send my letter open that mr clifford -lrb- who have the character of sense and honesty -rrb- might be witness of what i say and he not leave at liberty to forge order he never receive i be very glad i have do so and be persuade that have he reformation be what you suppose it mr clifford would have write to I in he favor i confess i see no appearance of it he last letter to you and this to I seem to be no more in that submissive style he have use but like one that think himself well protect i will see he since you desire it at valence which be a by-town where i be less likely to meet with english than any town in france but i insist on he go by a feigned name and come without a servant people of superior fortune to he -lrb- to my knowledge -rrb- have often travel from pari to lyon in the _ diligence _ the expense be but one hundred livre # 5 sterling all thing pay it would not be easy to I at this time to send he any considerable sum and whatever it be i be persuade come from I he would not be satisfy with it and make he complaint to he companion as to the alteration of he temper i see the same folly throughout he now suppose -lrb- which be at best downright childish -rrb- that one hour 's conversation will convince I of he sincerity i have not answer he letter nor will not till i have you order what to say to he -lrb- avignon -rrb- may 6 -lrb- 1742 -rrb- i here send you enclose the letter i mention of you son 's the packet in which it be put be mislay in the journey it will serve to show you how little he be to be depend on i see a savoyard man of quality at chambery who know he at venice and afterwards at genoa who ask I -lrb- not suspect he for my son -rrb- if he be relate to my family i make answer he be some relation he tell I several trick of he he say that at genoa he have tell he that a uncle of he be dead and have leave he # 5000 or # 6000 per annum and that he be return to england to take possession of he estate in the meantime he want money and would have borrow some of he which he refuse i make answer that he do very well i have hear of this sort of conduct in other place and by the dutch letter you have send I i be persuade he continue the same method of lie which convince I that he pretended enthusiasm be only to cheat those that can be impose on by it however i think he should not be hinder accept a commission i do not doubt it will be pawn or sell in a twelvemonth which will prove to those that now protect he how little he deserve it i be now at avignon which be within one day 's journey of valence avignon may 23 -lrb- 1742 -rrb- i receive this morning yours of April 12 and 29th and at the same time one from my son at paris date the 4th instant i have write to he this day that on he answer i will immediately set out to valence and shall be glad to see he there i suppose you be now convinced i have never be mistake in he character which remain unchanged and what be yet worse i think be unchangeable i never see such a complication of folly and falsity as in he letter to mr gibson nothing be cheaper than live in a inn in a country town in france they be oblige to ask no more than twenty-five sous for dinner and thirty for supper and lodging of those that eat at the public table which all the young man of quality i have meet have always do it be true i be force to pay double because i think the decency of my sex confines I to eat in my chamber i will not trouble you with detect a number of other falsehood that be in he letter my opinion on the whole -lrb- since you give I leave to tell it -rrb- be that if i be to speak in you place i would tell he ` that since he be obstinate in go into the army i will not oppose it but as i do not approve i will advance no equipage till i know he behavior to be such as shall deserve my future favor hitherto he have always be direct either by he own humor or the advice of those he think better friend to he than myself if he renounce the army i will continue to he he former allowance notwithstanding he repeated disobedience under the most solemn profession of duty when i see he act like a sincere honest man i shall believe well of he the opinion of other who either do not know he or be impose on by he pretence weigh nothing with I on may 30 lady mary go from avignon to valence where about a week later she son visit she she at once send a full account to montagu avignon June 10 -lrb- 1742 -rrb- i be just return from pass two day with we son of whom i will give you the most exact account i be capable of he be so much alter in he person i should scarcely have know he he have entirely lose he beauty and look at least seven year older than he be and the wildness that he always have in he eye be so much increase it be downright shocking and i be afraid will end fatally he be grow fat but be still genteel and have a air of politeness that be agreeable he speak french like a frenchman and have get all the fashionable expression of that language and a volubility of word which he always have and which i do not wonder should pass for wit with inconsiderate people he behavior be perfectly civil and i find he very submissive but in the main no way really improve in he understanding which be exceedingly weak and i be convinced he will always be lead by the person he converse with either right or wrong not be capable of form any fixed judgment of he own as to he enthusiasm if he have it i suppose he have already lose it since i could perceive no turn of it in all he conversation but with he head i believe it be possible to make he a monk one day and a turk three day after he have a flattering insinuate manner which naturally prejudice stranger in he favor he begin to talk to I in the usual silly cant i have so often hear from he which i shorten by tell he i desire not to be trouble with it that profession be of no use where action be expect and that the only thing could give I hope of a good conduct be regularity and truth he very readily agree to all i say -lrb- as indeed he have always do when he have not be hot-headed -rrb- i endeavor to convince he how favourably he have be deal with he allowance be much more than have i be he father i would have give in the same case the prince of hesse who be now marry to the princess of england live some year at geneva on # 300 per annum lord hervey send he son at sixteen thither and to travel afterwards on no larger pension than # 200 and though without a governor he have reason enough not only to live within the compass of it but carry home little present for he father and mother which he show I at turin in short i know there be no place so expensive but a prudent single man may live in it on # 100 per annum and a extravagant one may run out ten thousand in the cheapest have you -lrb- say i to he -rrb- think rightly or would have regard the advice i give you in all my letter while in the little town of islestein you would have lay up # 150 per annum you would now have have # 750 in you pocket which would have almost pay you debt and such a management would have gain you the esteem of the reasonable part of mankind i perceive this reflection which he have never make himself have a very great weight with he he would have excuse part of he folly by say mr g have tell he it become mr w 's son to live handsomely i make answer that whether mr g have say so or no the good sense of the thing be noway alter by it that the true figure of a man be the opinion the world have of he sense and probity and not the idle expense which be only respect by foolish or ignorant people that he case be particular he have but too publicly show he inclination to vanity and the most become part he could now act would be own the ill use he have make of he father 's indulgence and profess to endeavor to be no further expense to he instead of scandalous complaint and be always at he last shirt and last guinea which any man of spirit would be ashamed to own i prevail so far with he that he seem very willing to follow this advice and i give he a paragraph to write to g which i suppose you will easily distinguish from the rest of he letter he ask I if you have settle you estate i make answer that i do not doubt -lrb- like all other wise man -rrb- you always have a will by you but that you have certainly not put anything out of you power to change on that he begin to insinuate that if i could prevail on you to settle the estate on he i might expect anything from he gratitude i make he a very clear and positive answer in these word : ' i hope you father will outlive I and if i should be so unfortunate to have it otherwise i do not believe he will leave I in you power but be i sure of the contrary no interest nor no necessity shall ever make I act against my honor or conscience and i plainly tell you that i will never persuade you father to do anything for you till i think you deserve it ' he answer by great promise of future good behavior and economy he be highly delighted with the prospect of go into the army and mightily pleased with the good reception he have from lord stair though i find it amount to no more than tell he he be sorry he have already name he aide-de-camp and otherwise should have be glad of he in that post he say lord carteret have confirm to he he promise of a commission the rest of he conversation be extremely gay the various thing he have see have give he a superficial universal knowledge he really know most of the modern language and if i could believe he can read arabic and have read the bible in hebrew he say it be impossible for he to avoid go back to pari but he promise I to lie but one night there and go to a town six post from thence on the flander road where he would wait you order and go by the name of mon du durand a dutch officer under which name i see he these be the most material passage and my eye be so much tired i can write no more at this time i give he 240 livre for he journey no amount of admonition have any effect upon edward at the age of thirty he be as irresponsible as he be when he be thirteen year old he promise he mother at avignon most solemnly to reform and at once get into mischief i be persuade lady mary say whoever protect he will be very soon convince of the impossibility of he behave like a rational creature avignon November 20 1743 as to my son 's behavior at montelimart it be nothing more than a proof of he weakness and how little he be to be depend on in he most solemn profession he tell I that he have make acquaintance with a lady on the road who have a assembly at she house at montelimart and that she have invite he thither i ask immediately if she know he name he assure I no and that he pass for a dutch officer by the name of durand i advise he not go thither since it would raise a curiosity concern he and i be very unwilling it should be know that i have converse with he on many account he give I the most solemn assurance that no mortal should know it and agree with I in the reason i give he for keep it a entire secret yet rid straight to montelimart where he tell at the assembly that he come into this country purely on my order and that i have stay with he two day at orange talk much of my kindness to he and insinuate that he have another name much more considerable than that he appear with i know nothing of this till several month after that a lady of that country come hither and meet she in company she ask I if i be acquaint with monsieur durand i have really forget he have ever take that name and make answer no and that if such a person mention I it be probably some _ chevalier d'industrie _ who seek to introduce himself into company by a suppose acquaintance with I she make answer the whole town believe so by the improbable tale he tell they and inform I what he have say by which i know what i have relate to you i expect you order in relation to he letter edward be still anxious to join the army and he parent be not averse to the scheme lady mary however think that certain precaution should be take in the event of he secure a commission it be my opinion she write to montagu in January 1744 he should have no distinction in equipage from any other cornet everything of that sort will only serve to blow he vanity and consequently heighten he folly you indulgence have always be greater to he than any other parent 's would have be in the same circumstance i have always say so and think so if anything can alter he it will be think firmly that he have no dependence but on he own conduct for a future maintenance edward obtain a commission and be present at fontenoy on he return to england in 1747 he be elect to parliament for the family borough of huntingdon this he hold until 1754 when he be return for the borough of bossiney in cornwall which he represent for the next eight year of he subsequent career it be not necessary to say anything here except that he father leave he a annuity of # 1000 a year to be increase to # 2000 on he mother 's death lady mary in she will bequeath he one guinea chapter xiv lady mary as a reader she fondness for reading -- she difficulty to get enough book while abroad -- lady bute keep she supply -- lady mary 's catholic taste in literature -- samuel richardson -- the vogue of _ clarissa harlowe _ -- lady mary tell a story of the richardson type -- henry fielding -- _ joseph andrew -- tom jone _ -- she high opinion of fielding and steele -- tobia smollett -- _ peregrine pickle -- _ lady vane 's _ memoirs of a lady of quality _ -- sarah fielding -- minor writer -- lord orrery 's _ remark on swift _ -- bolingbroke 's work -- addison and pope -- dr johnson in she quiet retreat lady mary find plenty of time for book i yet retain and carefully cherish my taste for read she write to she daughter in 1752 if relay of eye be to be hire like post-horses i would never admit any but select companion : they afford a constant variety of entertainment and be almost the only one please in the enjoyment and inoffensive in the consequence she trouble be that she could not get book enough to occupy she time she be always ask lady bute to send she some and be duly grateful when they reach she i fancy you be now say ` tis a sad thing to grow old what do my poor mamma mean by trouble I with criticism on book that nobody but herself will ever read you must allow something to my solitude and again : i thank god my taste still continue for the gay part of read wiser people may call it trifling but it serve to sweeten life to I and be worst better than the generality of conversation lady mary 's taste in book be catholic she have see the memoirs of she old friend the duchess of maryborough but would be glad of the _ apology for a late resignation _ and of colin campbell 's book on _ architecture _ she have read mr lennox 's _ the female quixote _ and much of sarah fielding and she desire henry fielding 's posthumous work with he _ memoirs of jonathan wild _ and _ the journey to the next world _ also the _ memoirs of verocand _ a man of pleasure and those of a young lady you will call all this trash trumpery etc she say to she daughter i can assure you i be more entertain by g edward than h st john of whom you have send I duplicate i see new story book with the same pleasure you eldest daughter do a new dress or the youngest a new baby i thank god i can find plaything for my age i be not of cowley 's mind that this world be ' a dull ill-acted comedy ' nor of mr philip 's that it be ' a too well-acted tragedy ' i look upon it as a very pretty farce for those that can see it in that light i confess a severe critic that would examine by ancient rule might find many defect but ` tis ridiculous to judge seriously of a puppet-show those that can laugh and be divert with absurdity be the wisest spectator be it of writings action or people presently lady mary be ask for book the name of which she have see in the-newspaper : _ fortunate mistress accomplish rake mr charke 's memoirs modern lover history of two orphan memoirs of david ranger miss mostyn dick hazard history of a lady platonist sophium shakespear jasper bank frank hammond sir andrew thompson van a clergyman 's son cheantle and celemena _ i do not doubt at least the greater part of these be trash lumber etc however they will serve to pass away the idle time if you will be so kind as to send they to you most affectionate mother richardson lady mary like in spite of herself as so many other then and since have do though it be true that she speak of the very extraordinary -lrb- and i think undeserved -rrb- success of pamelum which she say be all the fashion at pari and versaille and be still the joy of the chambermaid of all nation i be such a old fool as to weep over _ clarissa harlowe _ like any milkmaid of sixteen over the ballad of the _ lady 's fall _ -lrb- she write to she daughter -rrb- to say truth the first volume soften I by a near resemblance of my maiden day but on the whole ` tis most miserable stuff miss how who be call a young lady of sense and honor be not only extreme silly but a more vicious character than sally martin whose crime be owe at first to seduction and afterwards to necessity while this virtuous damsel without any reason insult she mother at home and ridicule she abroad abuse the man she marry and be impertinent and impudent with great applause even that model of affection clarissa be so faulty in she behavior as to deserve little compassion any girl that run away with a young fellow without intend to marry he should be carry to bridewell or to bedlam the next day yet the circumstance be so lay as to inspire tenderness notwithstanding the low style and absurd incident and i look upon this and _ pamelum _ to be two book that will do more general mischief than the work of lord rochester there be something humorous in _ r random _ that make I believe that the author be h fielding i be horribly afraid i guess too well the writer of those abominable insipidity of _ cornelium leonora _ and the _ lady ' drawing room _ this richardson be a strange fellow she say in another letter i heartily despise he and eagerly read he nay sob over he work in a most scandalous manner i have now read over richardson -- he sink horribly in he third volume -lrb- he do so in he story of _ clarissa _ -rrb- when he talk of italy it be plain he be no better acquaint with it than he be with the kingdom of mancomugus he might have make he sir charle 's amour with clementina begin in a convent where the pensioner sometimes take great liberty but that such familiarity should be permit in she father 's house be as repugnant to custom as it would be in london for a young lady of quality to dance on the rope at bartholomew fair : neither do he hero behave to she in a manner suitable to he nice notion it be impossible a discerning man should not see she passion early enough to check it if he have really design it he conduct put I in mind of some lady i have know who could never find out a man to be in love with they let he do or say what he would till he make a direct attempt and then they be so surprised i warrant you nor do i approve sir charle 's offer compromise -lrb- as he call it -rrb- there must be a great indifference as to religion on both side to make so strict a union as marriage tolerable between people of such distinct persuasion he seem to think woman have no soul by agree so easily that he daughter should be educate in bigotry and idolatry -- you will perhaps think this last a hard word yet it be not difficult to prove that either the papist be guilty of idolatry or the pagan never be so you may see in lucian -lrb- in he vindication of he image -rrb- that they do not take they statue to be real god but only the representation of they the same doctrine may be find in plutarch and it be all the modern priest have to say in excuse for they worship wood and stone though they can not deny at the same time that the vulgar be apt to confound that distinction lady mary frequently re-read richardson and not seldom refer to they in she correspondence it be certain there be as many marriage as ever richardson be so eager for the multiplication of they i suppose he be some parish curate whose chief profit depend on wedding and christening he be not a man-midwife for he would be better skilled in physic than to think fit and madness any ornament to the character of he heroine : though he sir charle have no thought of marry clementina till she have lose she wit and the divine clarissa never act prudently till she be in the same condition and then very wisely desire to be carry to bedlam which be really all that be to be do in that case madness be as much corporal distemper as the gout or asthma never occasion by affliction or to be cure by the enjoyment of they extravagant wish passion may indeed bring on a fit but the disease be lodge in the blood and it be not more ridiculous to attempt to relieve the gout by a embroidered slipper than to restore reason by the gratification of wild desire richardson be as ignorant in morality as he be in anatomy when he declare abuse a oblige husband or a indulgent parent to be a innocent recreation he anna how and charlotte grandison be recommend as pattern of charming pleasantry and applaud by he saint-like dame who mistake pert folly for wit and humor and impudence and ill nature for spirit and fire charlotte behave like a humorsome child and should have be use like one and \*\*\* well whip in the presence of she friendly confidante harriet lord halifax very justly tell he daughter that a husband 's kindness be to be kindly receive by a wife even when he be drunk and though it be wrap up in never so much impertinence charlotte act with a ingratitude that i think too black for human nature with such coarse joke and low expression as be only to be hear among the lowest class of people woman of that rank often plead a right to beat they husband when they do not cuckold they and i believe this author be never admit into higher company and should confine he pen to the amours of housemaid and the conversation at the steward 's table where i imagine he have sometimes intrude though oftener in the servant hall : yet if the title be not a puff this work have pass three edition i do not forgive he he disrespect of old china which be below nobody 's taste since it have be the d of argyll 's whose understanding have never be doubt either by he friend or enemy richardson never have probably money enough to purchase any or even a ticket for a masquerade which give he such a aversion to they though he intended satire against they be very absurd on the account of he harriet since she might have be carry off in the same manner if she have be go from supper with she grandmamma she whole behavior which he design to be exemplary be equally blamable and ridiculous she follow the maxim of clarissa of declare all she think to all the people she see without reflect that in this mortal state of imperfection fig-leaf be as necessary for we mind as we body and ` tis as indecent to show all we think as all we have he have no idea of the manners of high life : he old lord m talk in the style of a country justice and he virtuous young lady romp like the wench round a maypole such liberty as pass between mr lovelace and he cousin be not to be excuse by the relation i should have be much astonished if lord denbigh should have offer to kiss I and i dare swear lord trentham never attempt such a impertinence to you lady mary be in sore trouble about richardson she would not like he she be angry with he yet could never away with he when she hear of a adventure at lovere she who herself have a gift for novel-writing must need send a account of it to lady bute say that it exactly resemble and she believe be copy from _ pamelum _ i know not under what constellation that foolish stuff be write but it have be translate into more language than any modern performance i ever hear of she add no proof of its influence be ever stronger than this story which in richardson 's hand would serve very well to furnish out seven or eight volume : i shall make it as short as i can as a example of lady mary 's skill in narrative she account of the richardsonian adventure be well worth reprint here be a gentleman 's family consist of a old bachelor and he sister who have fortune enough to live with great elegance though without any magnificence possess of the esteem of all they acquaintance he be distinguish by he probity and she by she virtue they be not only suffer but seek by all the best company and indeed be the most conversable reasonable people in the place she be a excellent housewife and particularly remarkable for keep she pretty house as neat as any in holland she appear no longer in public be past fifty and pass she time chiefly at home with she work receive few visitant this signora diana about ten year since saw at a monastery a girl about eight year old who come thither to beg alms for she mother she beauty though cover with rag be very observable and give great compassion to the charitable lady who think it meritorious to rescue such a modest sweetness as appear in she face from the ruin to which she wretched circumstance expose she she ask she some question to which she answer with a natural civility that seem surprising and find the head of she family -lrb- she brother -rrb- to be a cobbler who could hardly live by that trade and she mother too old to work for she maintenance she bid the child follow she home and send for she parent propose to she to breed the little octavium for she servant this be joyfully accept the old woman dismiss with a piece of money and the girl remain with the signora diana who buy she decent clothes and take pleasure in teach she whatever she be capable of learn she learn to read write and cast account with uncommon facility and have such a genius for work that she excel she mistress in embroidery point and every operation of the needle she grow perfectly skilled in confectionary have a good insight into cookery and be a great proficient in distillery to these accomplishment she be so handy well breed humble and modest that not only she master and mistress but everybody that frequent the house take notice of she she live thus near nine year never go out but to church however beauty be as difficult to conceal as light hers begin to make a great noise signora diana tell I she observe a unusual concourse of pedle woman that come on pretext to sell penn ` orth of lace china etc and several young gentleman very well powdered that be perpetually walk before she door and look up at the window these prognostic alarm she prudence and she listen very willingly to some honorable proposal that be make by many honest thrive tradesman she communicate they to octavium and tell she that though she be sorry to lose so good a servant yet she think it right to advise she to choose a husband the girl answer modestly that it be she duty to obey all she command but she find no inclination to marriage and if she would permit she to live single she should think it a greater obligation than any other she could bestow signora diana be too conscientious to force she into a state from which she could not free she and leave she to she own disposal however they part soon after whether -lrb- as the neighbor say -rrb- signor aurelio ardinghus she brother look with too much attention on the young woman or that she herself -lrb- as diana say -rrb- desire to seek a place of more profit she remove to bergamo where she soon find preferment be strongly recommend by the ardinghus family she be advance to be first waiting-woman to a old countess who be so well pleased with she service she desire on she death bed count jeronimo sosus she son to be kind to she he find no repugnance to this act of obedience have distinguish the beautiful octavium from he first sight of she and during the six month that she have serve in the house have try every art of a fine gentleman accustom to victory of that sort to vanquish the virtue of this fair virgin he have a handsome figure and have have a education uncommon in this country have make the tour of europe and bring from paris all the improvement that be to be pick up there be celebrate for he grace in dancing and skill in fencing and ride by which he be a favorite among the lady and respect by the man thus qualify for conquest you may judge of he surprise at the firm yet modest resistance of this country girl who be neither to be move by address nor gain by liberality nor on any term would be prevail on to stay as he housekeeper after the death of he mother she take that post in the house of a old judge where she continue to be solicit by the emissary of the count 's passion and find a new persecutor in she master who after three month ' endeavor to corrupt she offer she marriage she choose to return to she former obscurity and escape from he pursuit without ask any wages and privately return to the signora diana she throw herself at she foot and kiss she hand beg she with tear to conceal she at least some time if she would not accept of she service she protest she have never be happy since she leave it while she be make these submission signor aurelio enter she entreat he intercession on she knee who be easily persuade to consent she should stay with they though he sister blame she highly for she precipitate flight have no reason from the age and character of she master to fear any violence and wonder at she decline the honor he offer she octavium confess that perhaps she have be too rash in she proceedings but say that he seem to resent she refusal in such a manner as frighted she she hope that after a few day ' search he would think no more of she and that she scruple enter into the holy band of matrimony where she heart do not sincerely accompany all the word of the ceremony signora diana have nothing to say in contradiction to this pious sentiment and she brother applaud the honesty which could not be pervert by any interest whatever she remain conceal in they house where she help in the kitchen clean the room and redouble she usual diligence and officiousness she old master come to lovere on pretence of adjust a lawsuit three day after and make private inquiry after she but hear from she mother and brother -lrb- who know nothing of she be here -rrb- that they have never hear of she he conclude she have take another route and return to

servant on horseback a old priest step out of it and desire to speak with signora diana inform she he come from the count jeronimo sosus to demand octavium that the count wait for she at a village four mile from hence where he intend to marry she and have send he who be engage to perform the divine rite that signora diana might resign she to he care without any difficulty the young damsel be call for who entreat she might be permit the company of another priest with whom she be acquaint : this be readily grant and she send for a young man that visit I very often be remarkable for he sobriety and learn meanwhile a valet-de-chambre present she with a box in which be a complete genteel undress for a lady she lace linen and fine nightgown be soon put on and away they march leave the family in a surprise not to be describe signor aurelio come to drink coffee with I next morning : he first word be he have bring I the history of pamelum i say laughing i have be tire with it long since he explain himself by relate this story mix with great resentment for octavium 's conduct count jeronimo 's father have be he ancient friend and patron and this escape from he house -lrb- he say -rrb- would lay he under a suspicion of have abet the young man 's folly and perhaps expose he to the anger of all he relation for contrive a action he would rather have die than suffer if he have know how to prevent it i easily believe he there appear a latent jealousy under he affliction that show I he envy the bridegroom 's happiness at the same time he condemn he extravagance yesterday noon be Saturday don joseph return who have get the name of parson william by this expedition : he relate that when the bark which carry the coach and train arrive they find the amorous count wait for he bride on the bank of the lake : he would have proceed immediately to the church but she utterly refuse it till they have each of they be at confession after which the happy knot be tie by the parish priest they continue they journey and come to they palace at bergamo in a few hour where everything be prepare for they reception they receive the communion next morning and the count declare that the lovely octavium have bring he a inestimable portion since he owe to she the salvation of he soul he have renounce play at which he have lose a great deal of time and money she have already retrench several superfluous servant and put he family into a exact method of economy preserve all the splendor necessary to he rank he have send a letter in he own hand to she mother invite she to reside with they and subscribe himself she dutiful son : but the countess have send another privately by don joseph in which she advise the old woman to stay at lovere promising to take care she shall want nothing accompany with a token of twenty sequin which be at least nineteen more than ever she see in she life i forget to tell you that from octavium 's first serve the old lady there come frequent charity in she name to she poor parent which nobody be surprise at the lady be celebrate for pious work and octavium know to be a great favorite with she it be now discover that they be all send by the generous lover who have present don joseph very handsomely but he have bring neither letter nor message to the house of ardinghus which afford much speculation lady mary follow this narrative with she reflection she be sure that all these adventure proceed from artifice on one side and weakness on the other a honest tender mind she say be betray to ruin by the charm that make the fortune of a design head which when join with a beautiful face can never fail of advancement except bar by a wise mother who lock up she daughter from view till nobody care to look on they she instance the case of my poor friend the duchess of bolton who be educate in solitude with some choice book by a saint-like governess : cram with virtue and good quality she think it impossible not to find gratitude though she fail to give passion and upon this plan throw away she estate be despise by she husband and laugh at by the public lady mary compare the case of the duchess with that of polly breed in a ale-house and produce on the stage who have obtain wealth and title and find the way to be esteem this particular instance hardly furnish the basis for the general rule lay down by she : so useful be early experience -- without it half of life be dissipate in correct the error that we have be teach to receive as indisputable truth accord to all account charle paulet third duke of bolton be at the age of twenty-eight force by he father to marry lady anne vaughan only daughter and heiress of john earl of carbery when the old duke die in 1722 they separate some year later the duke take for he mistress lavinium fenton the polly in gay 's beggar 's opera on the death of he wife in 1751 he marry she henry fielding be lady mary 's second cousin but there have never be any intimacy between they although some acquaintance the novelist be eighteen year the younger in 1727 when he be twenty and near the beginning of he career as a playwright he have consult she about he comedy love in several masque of which when it be publish in the following year he send she a copy i have presume to send you ladyship a copy of the play which you do I the honor of read three act last spring and hope it may meet as light a censure from you ladyship 's judgment as then for while you goodness permit I -lrb- what i esteem the greatest and indeed only happen of my life -rrb- to offer my unworthy performance to you perusal it will be entirely from you sentence that they will be regard or disesteem by I field write lady mary another letter about four year later : i hope you ladyship will honor the scene which i presume to lay before you with you perusal as they be write on a model i never yet attempt i be exceedingly anxious less they should find less mercy from you than my lighter production it will be a slight compensation to ` the modern husband ' that you ladyship 's censure will defend he from the possibility of any other reproof since you least approbation will always give I pleasure infinitely superior to the loudest applause of a theater for whatever have pass you judgment may i think without any imputation of immodesty refer want of success to want of judgment in a audience i shall do myself the honor of wait upon you ladyship at twickenham to receive my sentence one evening when she arrive home after have ridden twenty mile in the moonlight she find a box of book and pounce upon she cousin fielding 's work sit up all night read i think _ joseph andrew _ better than he _ foundling _ -lrb- 13 -rrb- i believe i be the more strike with it have at present a fanny in my own house not only by the name which happen to be the same but the extraordinary beauty join with a understanding yet more extraordinary at she age which be but few month past sixteen : she be in the post of my chambermaid i fancy you will tax my discretion for take a servant thus qualify but my woman who be also my housekeeper be always tease I with she have too much work and complain of ill-health which determine I to take she a deputy and when i be at lovere where i drink the water one of the most considerable merchant there press I to take this daughter of he : she mother have a uncommon good character and the girl have have a better education than be usual for those of she rank she write a good hand and have be bring up to keep account which she do to great perfection and have herself such a violent desire to serve I that i be persuade to take she : i do not yet repent it from any part of she behavior but there have be no peace in the family ever since she come into it i might say the parish all the woman in it have declare open war with she and the man endeavor at treaty of a different sort : my own woman put herself at the head of the first party and she spleen be increase by have no reason for it the young creature never stir from my apartment always at needle and never complain of anything -lrb- footnote 13 : _ the history of tom jone a foundling _ -rrb- later lady mary have more to say about fielding 's book : h fielding have give a true picture of himself and he first wife in the character of mr and mr booth some compliment to he own figure except and i be persuade several of the incident he mention be real matter of fact i wonder he do not perceive tom jone and mr booth be sorry scoundrel all these sort of book have the same fault which i can not easily pardon be very mischievous they place a merit in extravagant passion and encourage young people to hope for impossible event to draw they out of the misery they choose to plunge themselves into expect legacy from unknown relation and generous benefactor to distressed virtue as much out of nature as fairy treasure fielding have really a fund of true humor and be to be pity at he first entrance into the world have no choice as he say himself but to be a hackney writer or a hackney coachman he genius deserve a better fate but i can not help blame that continue indiscretion to give it the softest name that have run through he life and i be afraid still remain i guess _ random _ to be he though without he name i can not think _ ferdinand count fathom _ write by the same hand it be every way so much below it adventure of roderick random _ -lrb- 1748 -rrb- and _ the adventure of ferdinand count fathom _ -lrb- 1753 -rrb- be publish anonymously lady mary be not the only one to attribute _ roderick random _ to fielding and it be actually translate into french in he name when lady mary hear of fielding 's death she express deep regret : i be sorry for h fielding 's death not only as i shall read no more of he writings but i believe he lose more than other as no man enjoy life more than he do though few have less reason to do so the highest of he preferment be rake in the lowest sink of vice and misery i should think it a nobler and less nauseous employment to be one of the staff-officer that conduct the nocturnal wedding he happy constitution -lrb- even when he have with great pain half demolish it -rrb- make he forget everything when he be before a venison pasty or over a flask of champagne and i be persuade he have know more happy moment than any prince upon earth he natural spirit give he rapture with he cook-maid and cheerfulness when he be flux in a garret there be a great similitude between he character and that of sir richard steele he have the advantage both in learning and in my opinion genius : they both agree in want money in spite of all they friend and would have want it if they hereditary land have be as extensive as they imagination yet each of they be so form for happiness it be a pity he be not immortal writing of imaginative prose literature generally lady mary write : the general want of invention which reign among we writer incline I to think it be not the natural growth of we island which have not sun enough to warm the imagination the press be load by the servile flock of imitator lord b -lrb- bolingbroke -rrb- would have quote horace in this place since i be bear no original have appear except congreve and fielding who would i believe have approach nearer to he excellence if not force by necessity to publish without correction and throw many production into the world he would have throw into the fire if meat could have be get without money or money without scribble the greatest virtue justice and the most distinguishing prerogative of mankind write when duly execute do honor to human nature but when degenerate into trade be the most contemptible way of get bread i be sorry not to see any more of peregrine pickle 's performance : i wish you would tell I he name it appear strange that lady mary should have be ignorant when she write the above passage in July or August 1755 of the authorship of _ roderick random _ for in January of that year she have evince a interest in smollett : i be sorry my friend smollett lose he time in translation he have certainly a talent for invention though i think it flag a little in he last work _ don quixote _ be a difficult undertaking : i shall never desire to read any attempt to redress he though i be a mere piddler in the spanish language i have rather take pain to understand he in the original than sleep over a stupid translation _ peregrine pickle _ however lady mary have read shortly after its appearance in 1751 : i begin by you direction with _ peregrine pickle _ i think lady vane 's _ memoirs _ -lrb- 14 -rrb- contain more truth and less malice than any i ever read in my life when she speak of she own be disinterested i be apt to believe she really think herself so as many highwayman after have no possibility of retrieve the character of honesty please themselves with that of be generous because whatever they get on the road they always spend at the next ale-house and be still as beggarly as ever she history rightly consider would be more instructive to young woman than any sermon i know they may see there what mortification and variety of misery be the unavoidable consequence of gallantry i think there be no rational creature that would not prefer the life of the strictest carmelite to the round of hurry and misfortune she have go through she style be clear and concise with some stroke of humor which appear to I so much above she i can not help be of opinion the whole have be model by the author of the book in which it be insert who be some subaltern admirer of hers i may judge wrong she be no acquaintance of mine though she have marry two of my relation she first wedding be attend with circumstance that make I think a visit not at all necessary though i disobliged lady susan by neglect it and the second which happen soon after make she so near a neighbor that i rather choose to stay the whole summer in town than partake of she ball and party of pleasure to which i do not think it proper to introduce you and have no other way of avoid it without incur the censure of a most unnatural mother for deny you diversion that the pious lady ferrer permit to she exemplary daughter mr shirley have have uncommon fortune in make the conquest of two such extraordinary lady equal in they heroic contempt of shame and eminent above they sex the one for beauty and the other wealth both which attract the pursuit of all mankind and have be throw into he arm with the same unlimited fondness he appear to I gentile -lrb- _ sic _ -rrb- well breed well shaped and sensible but the charm of he face and eye which lady vane describe with so much warmth be i confess always invisible to I and the artificial part of he character very glaring which i think she story show in a strong light -lrb- footnote 14 : france anne hawe -lrb- 1713-1788 -rrb- married lord william dougla in 1731 and after he death william second viscount vane in 1735 she be notorious for profligacy and extravagance of all kind she be responsible for the scandalous _ memoirs of a lady of quality _ which she pay smollett to insert in _ peregrine pickle _ -rrb- of minor novelist lady mary have also something to say from time to time sally -lrb- fielding -rrb- have mend she style in she last volume of _ david simple _ which convey a useful moral though she do not seem to have intend it : i mean show the ill consequence of not provide against casual loss which happen to almost everybody mr orgueil 's character be well draw and be frequently to be meet with the _ art of torment _ the _ female quixote _ -lrb- 15 -rrb- and _ sir c goodville _ be all sale work i suppose they proceed from she pen and heartily pity she constrain by she circumstance to seek she bread by a method i do not doubt she despise tell I who be that accomplished countess she celebrate i leave no such person in london nor can i imagine who be mean by the english sappho mention in betsy thoughtless whose adventure and those of jenny jessamy give I some amusement -lrb- footnote 15 : by charlotte lennox -rrb- i have read _ the cry _ -lrb- 16 -rrb- and if i would write in the style to be admire by good lord orrery i would tell you _ the cry _ make I ready to cry and the _ art of torment _ torment I very much i take they to be sally field 's and also the _ female quixote _ the plan of that be pretty but ill execute : on the contrary the fable of _ the cry _ be the most absurd i ever see but the sentiment generally just and i think if well dress would make a better body of ethic than bolingbroke 's she invent new word that be neither more harmonious or significant than those already in use be intolerable -lrb- footnote 16 : by sarah fielding and miss collier -rrb- the next book i lay my hand on be _ the parish girl _ which interested I enough not to be able to quit it till it be read over though the author have fall into the common mistake of romance-writer intend a virtuous character and not know how to draw it the first step of he heroine -lrb- leave she patroness 's house -rrb- be altogether absurd and ridiculous justly entitle she to all the misfortune she meet with candle come -lrb- and my eye grow weary -rrb- i take up the next book merely because i suppose from the title it could not engage I long it be _ pompey the little _ -lrb- 17 -rrb- which have really divert I more than any of the other and it be impossible to go to bed till it be finish it be a real and exact representation of life as it be now act in london as it be in my time and as it will be -lrb- i do not doubt -rrb- a hundred year hence with some little variation of dress and perhaps government i find there many of my acquaintance lady t and lady o be so well paint i fancied i hear they talk and have hear they say the very thing there repeat -lrb- footnote 17 : by franci coventry -rrb- i open my eye this morning on _ leonora _ from which i defy the greatest chemist in moral to extract any instruction the style most affectedly florid and naturally insipid with such a confused heap of admirable character that never be or can be in human nature i flung it aside after fifty page and lay hold of _ mr philip _ where i expect to find at least probable if not true fact and be not disappoint there be a great similitude in the genius and adventure -lrb- the one be productive of the other -rrb- between madame constantia and lady vane : the first mention have the advantage in birth and if i be not mistake in understanding : they have both have scandalous lawsuit with they husband and be endowed with the same intrepid assurance con seem to value herself also on she generosity and have give the same proof of it the parallel might be draw out to be as long as any of plutarch 's but i dare swear you be already heartily weary of my remark and wish i have not read so much in so short a time that you might not be trouble with my comment but you must suffer I to say something of the polite mr ste whose name i should never have guess by the rapturous description he mistress make of he person have always look upon he as one of the most disagreeable fellow about town as odious in he outside as stupid in he conversation and i should as soon have expect to hear of he conquest at the head of a army as among woman yet he have be it seem the darling favorite of the most experienced of the sex which show I i be a very bad judge of merit but i agree with mr philip that however profligate she may have be she be infinitely he superior in virtue and if she penitence be as sincere as she say she may expect they future fate to be like that of dive and lazarus lady mary receive from she daughter a copy of lord orrery 's _ remark on the life and writings of jonathan swift _ publish in 1751 six year after the death of swift this book so arouse the ire of lady mary that writing of it she attack everyone concerned lord orrery 's work have extremely entertain and not at all surprised I have the honor of be acquaint with he and know he for one of those dangler after wit who like those after beauty spend they time in humbly admire and be happy in be permit to attend though they be laugh at and only encourage to gratify the insatiate vanity of those profess wit and beauty who aim at be publicly distinguish in those character dean swift by he lordship 's own account be so intoxicate with the love of flattery he seek it amongst the lowest of the people and the silliest of woman and be never so well pleased with any companion as those that worship he while he insult they it be a wonderful condescension in a man of quality to offer he incense in such a crowd and think it a honor to share a friendship with sheridan & c especially be himself endowed with such universal merit as he display in these letter where he show that he be a poet a patriot a philosopher a physician a critic a complete scholar and most excellent moralist shine in private life as a submissive son a tender father and zealous friend he only error have be that love of learn ease which he have indulge in a solitude which have prevent the world from be bless with such a general minister or admiral be equal to any of these employment if he would have turn he talent to the use of the public heaven be praise he have now draw he pen in its service and give a example to mankind that the most villanous action nay the coarsest nonsense be only small blemish in a great genius i happen to think quite contrary weak woman as i be i have always avoid the conversation of those who endeavor to raise a opinion of they understanding by ridicule what both law and decency oblige they to revere but whenever i have meet with any of those bright spirit who would be smart on sacred subject i have ever cut short they discourse by ask they if they have any light and revelation by which they would propose new article of faith nobody can deny but religion be a comfort to the distressed a cordial to the sick and sometimes a restraint on the wicked therefore whoever would argue or laugh it out of the world without give some equivalent for it ought to be treat as a common enemy : but when this language come from a churchman who enjoy large benefice and dignity from that very church he openly despise it be a object of horror for which i want a name and can only be excuse by madness which i think the dean be strongly touch with he character seem to I a parallel with that of caligulum and have he have the same power would have make the same use of it that emperor erect a temple to himself where he be he own high priest prefer he horse to the highest honor in the state profess enmity to -lrb- the -rrb- human race and at last lose he life by a nasty jest on one of he inferior which i dare swear swift would have make in he place there can be no worse picture make of the doctor 's moral than he have give we himself in the letter print by pope we see he vain trifling ungrateful to the memory of he patron the earl of oxford make a servile court where he have any interested view and meanly abusive when they be disappointed and as he say -lrb- in he own phrase -rrb- fly in the face of mankind in company with he adorer pope it be pleasant to consider that have it not be for the good nature of these very mortal they contemn these two superior being be entitle by they birth and hereditary fortune to be only a couple of link-boy i be of opinion they friendship would have continue though they have remain in the same kingdom : it have a very strong foundation -- the love of flattery on the one side and the love of money on the other pope court with the utmost assiduity all the old man from whom he could hope a legacy the duke of buckingham lord peterborough sir g kneller lord bolingbroke mr wycherley mr congreve lord harcourt & c and i do not doubt project to sweep the dean 's whole inheritance if he could have persuade he to throw up he deanery and come to die in he house and he general preach against money be mean to induce people to throw it away that he might pick it up there can not be a stronger proof of he be capable of any action for the sake of gain than publish he literary correspondence which lay open such a mixture of dulness and iniquity that one would imagine it visible even to he most passionate admirer if lord orrery do not show that smooth line have as much influence over some people as the authority of the church in these country where it can not only veil but sanctify any absurdity or villany whatever it be remarkable that he lordship 's family have be smatterer in wit and learn for three generation : he grandfather have leave monument of he good taste in several rhyming tragedy and the romance of parthenissa he father begin the world by give he name to a treatise write by atterbury and he club which gain he great reputation but -lrb- like sir martin marall who would fumble with he lute when the music be over -rrb- he publish soon after a sad comedy of he own and what be worse a dismal tragedy he have find among the first earl of orrery 's papers people could easier forgive he be partial to he own silly work as a common frailty than the want of judgment in produce a piece that dishonour he father 's memory thus fall into dust a fame that have make a blaze by borrow fire to do justice to the present lord i do not doubt this fine performance be all he own and be a public benefit if every reader have be as well divert with it as myself i verily believe it have contribute to the establishment of my health nor be lady mary more kindly about the writings and character of lord bolingbroke for whom she have always have a feeling even more of hatred than disapproval i have now read over the book you be so good to send and intend to say something of they all though some be not worth speaking of -lrb- she write to she daughter -rrb- i shall begin in respect to he dignity with lord bolingbroke who be a glare proof how far vanity can blind a man and how easy it be to varnish over to one 's self the most criminal conduct he declare he always love he country though he confess he endeavor to betray she to popery and slavery and love he friend though he abandon they in distress with all the blackest circumstance of treachery he account of the peace of utrecht be almost equally unfair or partial : i shall allow that perhaps the view of the whig at that time be too vast and the nation dazzle by military glory have hope too sanguine but sure the same term that the french consent to at the treaty of gertruydenberg might have be obtain or if the displacing of the duke of marlborough raise the spirit of we enemy to a degree of refuse what they have before offer how can he excuse the guilt of remove he from the head of a victorious army and expose we to submit to any article of peace be unable to continue the war i agree with he that the idea of conquer france be a wild extravagant notion and would if possible be impolitic but she might have be reduce to such a state as would have render she incapable of be terrible to she neighbor for some age : nor should we have be oblige as we have do almost ever since to bribe the french minister to let we live in quiet so much for he political reasoning which i confess be deliver in a florid easy style but i can not be of lord orrery 's opinion that he be one of the best english writer well-turned period or smooth line be not the perfection either of prose or verse they may serve to adorn but can never stand in the place of good sense copiousness of word however range be always false eloquence though it will ever impose on some sort of understanding how many reader and admirer have madame de sévigné who only give we in a lively manner and fashionable phrase mean sentiment vulgar prejudice and endless repetition sometimes the tittle-tattle of a fine lady sometimes that of a old nurse always tittle-tattle yet so well gilt over by airy expression and a flowing style she will always please the same people to whom lord bolingbroke will shine as a first-rate author she be so far to be excuse as she letter be not intend for the press while she labor to display to posterity all the wit and learn he be master of and sometimes spoil a good argument by a profusion of word run out into several page a thought that might have be more clearly express in a few line and what be worse often fall into contradiction and repetition which be almost unavoidable to all voluminous writer and can only be forgive to those retailer whose necessity compel they to diurnal scribble who load they meaning with epithet and run into digression because -lrb- in the jockey phrase -rrb- it rid the ground that be cover a certain quantity of paper to answer the demand of the day a great part of lord b 's letter be design to show he reading which indeed appear to have be very extensive but i can not perceive that such a minute account of it can be of any use to the pupil he pretend to instruct nor can i help think he be far below either tillotson or addison even in style though the latter be sometimes more diffuse than he judgment approve to furnish out the length of a daily _ spectator _ i own i have small regard for lord b as a author and the highest contempt for he as a man he come into the world greatly favor both by nature and fortune blest with a noble birth heir to a large estate endowed with a strong constitution and as i have hear a beautiful figure high spirit a good memory and a lively apprehension which be cultivate by a learn education : all these glorious advantage be leave to the direction of a judgment stifle by unbounded vanity he dishonour he birth lose he estate ruin he reputation and destroy he health by a wild pursuit of eminence even in vice and trifle i be far from make misfortune a matter of reproach i know there be accidental occurence not to be foresee or avoid by human prudence by which a character may be injure wealth dissipate or a constitution impair : but i think i may reasonably despise the understanding of one who conduct himself in such a manner as naturally produce such lamentable consequence and continue in the same destructive path to the end of a long life ostentatiously boast of moral and philosophy in print and with equal ostentation bragging of the scene of low debauchery in public conversation though deplorably weak both in mind and body and he virtue and he vigor in a state of non-existence he confederacy with swift and pope put I in mind of that of bessus and he sword-man in the _ king and no king _ -lrb- 18 -rrb- who endeavor to support themselves by give certificate of each other 's merit pope have triumphantly declare that they may do and say whatever silly thing they please they will still be the greatest genius nature ever exhibit i be delighted with the comparison give of they benevolence which be indeed most aptly figure by a circle in the water which widen till it come to nothing at all but i be provoke at lord b 's misrepresentation of my favorite atticus who seem to have be the only roman that from good sense have a true notion of the time in which he live in which the republic be inevitably perish and the two faction who pretend to support it equally endeavor to gratify they ambition in its ruin a wise man in that case would certainly declare for neither and try to save himself and family from the general wreck which could not be do but by a superiority of understand acknowledge on both side i see no glory in lose life or fortune by be the dupe of either and very much applaud that conduct which could preserve a universal esteem amidst the fury of opposite party we be oblige to act vigorously where action can do any good but in a storm when it be impossible to work with success the best hand and ablest pilot may laudably gain the shore if they can atticus could be a friend to man without engage in they passion disapprove they maxim without awake they resentment and be satisfy with he own virtue without seek popular fame : he have the reward of he wisdom in he tranquillity and will ever stand among the few example of true philosophy either ancient or modern -lrb- footnote 18 : a play by beaumont and fletcher license for the stage in 1611 -rrb- i must add a few word on the _ essay on exile _ which i read with attention as a subject that touch I i find the most abject dejection under a pretended fortitude that the author feel it can be no doubt to one that know -lrb- as i do -rrb- the mean submission and solemn promise he make to obtain a return flattering himself -lrb- i suppose -rrb- he need only appear to be at the head of the administration as every ensign of sixteen fancy he be in a fair way to be a general on the first sight of he commission you will think i have be too long on the character of atticus i own i take pleasure in explain it pope think himself covertly very severe on mr addison by give he that name and i feel indignation when he be abused both from he own merit and have be you father 's friend besides that it be naturally shocking to see any one lampoon after he death by the same man who have pay he the most servile court while he live and be highly oblige by he as a periodical writer she compare johnson unfavourably with steele and addison : the _ rambler _ be certainly a strong misnomer he always plod in the beaten road of he predecessor follow the _ spectator _ -lrb- with the same pace a pack-horse would do a hunter -rrb- in the style that be proper to lengthen a paper these writer may perhaps be of service to the public which be say a great deal in they favor there be number of both sex who never read anything but such production and can not spare time from do nothing to go through a sixpenny pamphlet such gentle reader may be improve by a moral hint which though repeat over and over from generation to generation they never hear in they life i should be glad to know the name of this laborious author chapter xv lady mary on education and woman 's rights the choice of book for child 's reading -- the danger of a narrow education -- lady mary advocate the higher education of woman -- girl should be teach language -- lady mary 's theory of education for girl -- woman writer in italy -- a rumpus make by lady in the house of lord -- woman 's rights -- lady mary 's view on religion in spite of she own fondness for book lady mary be not a wholehearted believer in read for young folk unless the choice of volume be carefully make by some competent person this point she emphasise in one of she letter to she daughter i can not forbear say something in relation to my granddaughter who be very near my heart if any of they be fond of read i would not advise you to hinder they -lrb- chiefly because it be impossible -rrb- see poetry play or romance but accustom they to talk over what they read and point out to they as you be very capable of do the absurdity often conceal under fine expression where the sound be apt to engage the admiration of young people i be so much charm at fourteen with the dialogue of henry and emma i can say it by heart to this day without reflect on the monstrous folly of the story in plain prose where a young heiress to a fond father be represent fall in love with a fellow she have only see as a huntsman a falconer and a beggar and who confess without any circumstance of excuse that he be oblige to run he country have newly commit a murder she ought reasonably to have suppose he at best a highwayman yet the virtuous virgin resolve to run away with he to live among the bandit and wait upon he trollop if she have no other way of enjoy he company this senseless tale be however so well varnish with melody of word and pomp of sentiment i be convinced it have hurt more girl than ever be injure by the lewdest poem extant life lady mary be at pain to insist upon be a much better instructor for the young than any story-book however innocuous it may seem to grown-up people who for the greater number have not the faculty of see how the tale would have affect they in they childhood i congratulate my granddaughter on be bear in a age so much enlighten sentiment be certainly extreme silly and only qualify young people to be the bubble of all they acquaintance i do not doubt the frequency of assembly have introduce a more enlarged way of think it be a kind of public education which i have always think as necessary for girl as for boy a woman marry at five-and-twenty from under the eye of a strict parent be commonly as ignorant as she be at five and no more capable of avoid the snare and struggle with the difficulty she will infallibly meet with in the commerce of the world the knowledge of mankind -lrb- the most useful of all knowledge -rrb- can only be acquire by converse with they book be so far from give that instruction they fill the head with a set of wrong notion from whence spring the tribe of clarissa harriet & c yet such be the method of education when i be in england which i have it not in my power to correct the young will always adopt the opinion of all they companion rather than the advice of they mother ignorance and a narrow education lay the foundation of vice mary astell have lay down as a axiom and lady mary be always propound this to she daughter i be extremely concern to hear you complain of ill health at a time of life when you ought to be in the flower of you strength i hope i need not recommend to you the care of it : the tenderness you have for you child be sufficient to enforce you to the utmost regard for the preservation of a life so necessary to they well-being i do not doubt you prudence in they education : neither can i say anything particular relate to it at this distance different temper require different management in general never attempt to govern they -lrb- as most people do -rrb- by deceit : if they find themselves cheat even in trifle it will so far lessen the authority of they instructor as to make they neglect all they future admonition and if possible breed they free from prejudice those contract in the nursery often influence the whole life after of which i have see many melancholy example i shall say no more of this subject nor would have say this little if you have not ask my advice : ` tis much easier to give rule than to practice they i be sensible my own natural temper be too indulgent : i think it the least dangerous error yet still it be a error i can only say with truth that i do not know in my whole life have ever endeavor to impose on you or give a false color to anything that i represent to you if you daughter be incline to love reading do not check they inclination by hinder they of the divert part of it it be as necessary for the amusement of woman as the reputation of man but teach they not to expect or desire any applause from it let they brother shine and let they content themselves with make they life easier by it which i experimentally know be more effectually do by study than any other way ignorance be as much the fountain of vice as idleness and indeed generally produce it people that do not read or work for a livelihood have many hour they know not how to employ especially woman who commonly fall into vapor or something worse mary be a advocate one of the earliest advocate for the higher education of woman although she have educate herself she realize that the circumstance in she case be exceptional and no doubt it be also bear in on she that she have be a exceptional girl even as she be a remarkable woman it be not so much lack of education against which she tilted as ill-directed study you have give I a great deal of satisfaction by you account of you eldest daughter i be particularly pleased to hear she be a good arithmetician it be the best proof of understanding : the knowledge of number be one of the chief distinction between we and the brute if there be anything in blood you may reasonably expect you child should be endow with a uncommon share of good sense mr wortley 's family and mine have both produce some of the greatest man that have be bear in england : i mean admiral sandwich and my grandfather who be distinguish by the name of wise william i have hear lord bute 's father mention as a extraordinary genius though he have not many opportunity of show it and he uncle the present duke of argyll have one of the best head i ever know i will therefore speak to you as suppose lady mary not only capable but desirous of learn in that case by all mean let she be indulge in it you will tell I i do not make it a part of you education : you prospect be very different from hers as you have no defect either in mind or person to hinder and much in you circumstance to attract the highest offer it seem you business to learn how to live in the world as it be hers to know how to be easy out of it it be the common error of builder and parent to follow some plan they think beautiful -lrb- and perhaps be so -rrb- without consider that nothing be beautiful that be displaced hence we see so many edifice raise that the raiser can never inhabit be too large for they fortune vista be lay open over barren heath and apartment contrived for a coolness very agreeable in italy but kill in the north of britain : thus every woman endeavor to breed she daughter a fine lady qualify she for a station in which she will never appear and at the same time incapacitate she for that retirement to which she be destine learn if she have a real taste for it will not only make she contented but happy in it no entertainment be so cheap as read nor any pleasure so lasting she will not want new fashion nor regret the loss of expensive diversion or variety of company if she can be amuse with a author in she closet to render this amusement extensive she should be permit to learn the language i have hear it lament that boy lose so many year in mere learning of word : this be no objection to a girl whose time be not so precious : she can not advance herself in any profession and have therefore more hour to spare and as you say she memory be good she will be very agreeably employ this way there be two caution to be give on this subject : first not to think herself learn when she could read latin or even greek language be more properly to be call vehicle of learning than learn itself as may be observe in many schoolmaster who though perhaps critic in grammar be the most ignorant fellow upon earth true knowledge consist in know thing not word i would wish she no further a linguist than to enable she to read book in they original that be often corrupted and always injure by translation two hour ' application every morning will bring this about much sooner than you can imagine and she will have leisure enough besides to run over the english poetry which be a more important part of a woman 's education than it be generally suppose many a young damsel have be ruin by a fine copy of verse which she would have laugh at if she have know it have be steal from mr waller i remember when i be a girl i save one of my companion from destruction who communicate to I a epistle she be quite charm with as she have a natural good taste she observe the line be not so smooth as prior 's or pope 's but have more think and spirit than any of theirs she be wonderfully delighted with such a demonstration of she lover 's sense and passion a little pleased with she own charm that have force enough to inspire such elegancy in the midst of this triumph i show she that they be take from randolph 's poem and the unfortunate transcriber be dismiss with the scorn he deserve to say truth the poor plagiary be very unlucky to fall into my hand that author be no longer in fashion would have escape any one of less universal reading than myself you should encourage you daughter to talk over with you what she read and as you be very capable of distinguish take care she do not mistake pert folly for wit and humor or rhyme for poetry which be the common error of young people and have a train of ill consequence the second caution to be give she -lrb- and which be most absolutely necessary -rrb- be to conceal whatever learning she attain with as much solicitude as she would hide crookedness or lameness the parade of it can only serve to draw on she the envy and consequently the most inveterate hatred of all he and she fool which will certainly be at least three part in four of all she acquaintance the use of knowledge in we sex besides the amusement of solitude be to moderate the passion and learn to be contented with a small expense which be the certain effect of a studious life and it may be preferable even to that fame which man have engross to themselves and will not suffer we to share you will tell I i have not observe this rule myself but you be mistake : it be only inevitable accident that have give I any reputation that way i have always carefully avoid it and ever think it a misfortune the explanation of this paragraph would occasion a long digression which i will not trouble you with it be my present design only to say what i think useful for the instruction of my granddaughter which i have much at heart if she have the same inclination -lrb- i should say passion -rrb- for learn that i be bear with history geography and philosophy will furnish she with material to pass away cheerfully a longer life than be allot to mortal i believe there be few head capable of make sir i newton 's calculation but the result of they be not difficult to be understand by a moderate capacity do not fear this should make she affect the character of lady -- or lady -- or mr -- : those woman be ridiculous not because they have learn but because they have it not one think herself a complete historian after read echard 's roman history another a profound philosopher have get by heart some of pope 's unintelligible essay and a third a able divine on the strength of whitefield 's sermon : thus you hear they scream politics and controversy it be a say of thucydide ignorance be bold and knowledge reserve indeed it be impossible to be far advance in it without be more humble by a conviction of human ignorance than elated by learn at the same time i recommend book i neither exclude work nor draw i think it as scandalous for a woman not to know how to use a needle as for a man not to know how to use a sword i be once extremely fond of my pencil and it be a great mortification to I when my father turn off my master have make a considerable progress for a short time i learn my over-eagerness in the pursuit of it have bring a weakness on my eye that make it necessary to leave it off and all the advantage i get be the improvement of my hand i see by hers that practice will make she a ready writer : she may attain it by serve you for a secretary when you health or affair make it troublesome to you to write yourself and custom will make it a agreeable amusement to she she can not have too many for that station of life which will probably be she fate the ultimate end of you education be to make you a good wife -lrb- and i have the comfort to hear that you be one -rrb- : hers ought to be to make she happy in a virgin state i will not say it be happier but it be undoubtedly safer than any marriage in a lottery which there be -lrb- at the lowest computation -rrb- ten thousand blank to a prize it be the most prudent choice not to venture i have always be so thoroughly persuade of this truth that notwithstanding the flattering view i have for you -lrb- as i never intend you a sacrifice to my vanity -rrb- i think i owe you the justice to lay before you all the hazard attend matrimony : you may recollect i do so in the strongest manner perhaps you may have more success in the instruct you daughter : she have so much company at home she will not need seek it abroad and will more readily take the notion you think fit to give she as you be alone in my family it would have be think a great cruelty to suffer you no companion of you own age especially have so many near relation and i do not wonder they opinion influence yours i be not sorry to see you not determine on a single life know it be not you father 's intention and contented myself with endeavor to make you home so easy that you might not be in haste to leave it lady mary 's view on the education of child be well in advance of she day they be certainly not the stereotyped opinion current among governess or even parent somewhat more enlighten than the rest and evidently she have give much consideration to the subject before she put she thought on paper people commonly educate they child as they build they house accord to some plan they think beautiful without consider whether it be suit to the purpose for which they be design almost all girl of quality be educate as if they be to be great lady which be often as little to be expect as a immoderate heat of the sun in the north of scotland you should teach yours to confine they desire to probability to be as useful as be possible to themselves and to think privacy -lrb- as it be -rrb- the happiest state of life i do not doubt you give they all the instruction necessary to form they to a virtuous life but ` tis a fatal mistake to do this without proper restriction vice be often hide under the name of virtue and the practice of they follow by the worst of consequence sincerity friendship piety disinterestedness and generosity be all great virtue but without discretion become criminal i have see lady indulge they own ill humor by be very rude and impertinent and think they deserve approbation by say i love to speak truth one of you acquaintance make a ball the next day after she mother die to show she be sincere i believe you own reflection will furnish you with but too many example of the ill effect of the rest of the sentiment i have mention when too warmly embrace they be generally recommend to young people without limit or distinction and this prejudice hurry they into great misfortune while they be applaud themselves in the noble practice -lrb- as they fancy -rrb- of very eminent virtue i can not help add -lrb- out of my real affection to you -rrb- i wish you would moderate that fondness you have for you child i do not mean you should abate any part of you care or not do you duty to they in its utmost extent : but i would have you early prepare yourself for disappointment which be heavy in proportion to they be surprising it be hardly possible in such a number that none should be unhappy prepare yourself against a misfortune of that kind i confess there be hardly any more difficult to support yet it be certain imagination have a great share in the pain of it and it be more in we power than it be commonly believe to soften whatever ill be found or augment by fancy strictly speak there be but one real evil -- i mean acute pain all other complaint be so considerably diminish by time that it be plain the grief be owe to we passion since the sensation of it vanish when that be over there be another mistake i forget to mention usual in mother : if any of they daughter be beauty they take great pain to persuade they that they be ugly or at least that they think so which the young woman never fail to believe spring from envy and be perhaps not much in the wrong i would if possible give they a just notion of they figure and show they how far it be valuable every advantage have its price and may be either over or undervalue it be the common doctrine of -lrb- what be call -rrb- good book to inspire a contempt of beauty riches greatness & c which have do as much mischief among the young of we sex as a over eager desire of they they should look on these thing as blessing where they be bestow though not necessaries that it be impossible to be happy without of course all these expression of opinion although here gather together be spread over a term of year yet lady mary have from time to time some qualm as to how she admonition would be receive by she daughter although as she be careful once to point out : i do not give they as believe my age have furnish I with superior wisdom but in compliance with you desire i can not help write a sort of apology for my laster letter foresee that you will think it wrong or at least lord bute will be extremely shock at the proposal of a learn education for daughter which the generality of man believe as great a profanation as the clergy would do if the laity should presume to exercise the function of the priesthood i desire you would take notice i would not have learn enjoin they as a task but permit as a pleasure if they genius lead they naturally to it i look upon my granddaughter as a sort of lay nun : destiny may have lay up other thing for they but they have no reason to expect to pass they time otherwise than they aunt do at present and i know by experience it be in the power of study not only to make solitude tolerable but agreeable i have now live almost seven year in a stricter retirement than yours in the isle of bute and can assure you i have never have half a hour heavy on my hand for want of something to do whoever will cultivate they own mind will find full employment every virtue do not only require great care in the planting but as much daily solicitude in cherish as exotic fruit and flower the vice and passion -lrb- which i be afraid be the natural product of the soil -rrb- demand perpetual weed add to this the search after knowledge -lrb- every branch of which be entertaining -rrb- and the longest life be too short for the pursuit of it which though in some regard confine to very strait limit leave still a vast variety of amusement to those capable of tasting they which be utterly impossible for those that be blind by prejudice which be the certain effect of a ignorant education my own be one of the worst in the world be exactly the same as clarissa hawlowe 's she pious mr norton so perfectly resemble my governess who have be nurse to my mother i could almost fancy the author be acquaint with she she take so much pain from my infancy to fill my head with superstitious tale and false notion it be none of she fault i be not at this day afraid of witch and hobgoblin or turn methodist almost all girl be breed after this manner i believe you be the only woman -lrb- perhaps i might say person -rrb- that never be either fright or cheat into anything by you parent i can truly affirm i never deceive anybody in my life excepting -lrb- which i confess have often happen undesignedly -rrb- by speak plainly as earl stanhope use to say -lrb- during he ministry -rrb- he always impose on the foreign minister by tell they the naked truth which as they think impossible to come from the mouth of a statesman they never fail to write information to they respective court directly contrary to the assurance he give they : most people confound the idea of sense and cunning though there be really no two thing in nature more opposite : it be in part from this false reasoning the unjust custom prevail of debar we sex from the advantage of learn the man fancy the improvement of we understanding would only furnish we with more art to deceive they which be directly contrary to the truth fool be always enterprising not see the difficulty of deceit or the ill consequence of detection i could give many example of lady whose ill conduct have be very notorious which have be owe to that ignorance which have expose they to idleness which be justly call the mother of mischief there be nothing so like the education of a woman of quality as that of a prince : they be teach to dance and the exterior part of what be call good breeding which if they attain they be extraordinary creature in they kind and have all the accomplishment require by they director the same character be form by the same lesson which incline I to think -lrb- if i dare say it -rrb- that nature have not place we in a inferior rank to man no more than the female of other animal where we see no distinction of capacity though i be persuade if there be a commonwealth of rational horse -lrb- as doctor swift have suppose -rrb- it would be a established maxim among they that a mare could not be teach to pace i could add a great deal on this subject but i be not now endeavor to remove the prejudice of mankind my only design be to point out to my granddaughter the method of be contented with that retreat to which probably they circumstance will oblige they and which be perhaps preferable to all the show of public life it have always be my inclination lady stafford -lrb- who know I better than anybody else in the world both from she own just discernment and my heart be ever as open to she as myself -rrb- use to tell I my true vocation be a monastery and i now find by experience more sincere pleasure with my book and garden than all the flutter of a court could give I if you follow my advice in relation to lady mary my correspondence may be of use to she and i shall very willingly give she those instruction that may be necessary in the pursuit of she study before she age i be in the most regular commerce with my grandmother though the difference of we time of life be much greater she be past forty-five when she marry my grandfather she die at ninety-six retain to the last the vivacity and clearness of she understanding which be very uncommon you can not remember she be then in you nurse 's arm i conclude with repeat to you i only recommend but be far from command which i think i have no right to do i tell you my sentiment because you desire to know they and hope you will receive they with some partiality as come from you most affectionate mother one of lady mary 's friend be cardinal gerolamo guerinus a distinguished scholar as well as a great churchman one day in October 1753 he send a request by one of he chief chaplain that lady mary would send he she print work for the shelf that he be dedicate to english literature in the library attach to the college at brescium that he have found i be strike dumb for some time with this astonishing request when i recover my vexatious surprise -lrb- foresee the consequence -rrb- i make answer i be highly sensible of the honor design I but upon my word i have never print a single line in my life i be answer in a cold tone he eminence could send for they to england but they would be a long time come and with some hazard and that he have flatter himself i would not refuse he such a favor and i need not be ashamed of see my name in a collection where he admit none but the most eminent author it be to no purpose to endeavor to convince he he would not stay to dinner though earnestly invite and go away with the air of one that think he have reason to be offend i know he master will have the same sentiment and i shall pass in he opinion for a monster of ingratitude while it be the blackest of vice in my opinion and of which i be utterly incapable -- i really could cry for vexation sure nobody ever have such various provocation to print as myself i have see thing i have write so mangled and falsified i have scarce know they i have see poem i never read publish with my name at length and other that be truly and singly write by I print under the name of other i have make myself easy under all these mortification by the reflection i do not deserve they have never aim at the vanity of popular applause but i own my philosophy be not proof against lose a friend and it may be make a enemy of one to whom i be oblige in this letter to lady mar in which lady mary explain she plight she go on to deliver herself of she sentiment concern the difference of opinion as regard woman writer that be current in italy and in england lady mary hold strong view on what be call to-day or at least be so call until they be lately in the main concede woman 's rights although she say that she do not complain that it be man and man only who be privileged to exercise the power of government it be not unlikely that she yield this point in order the more effectively to emphasise some other anyhow she be unfeignedly pleased to be able to record -lrb- to lady pomfret march 1737 -rrb- a rumpus make by lady who regard they exclusion from a debate in parliament as unwarrantable i confess i have often be compliment since i have be in italy on the book i have give the public i use at first to deny it with some warmth but find i persuade nobody i have of late contented myself with laugh whenever i hear it mention know the character of a learn woman be far from be ridiculous in this country the greatest family be proud of have produce female writer and a milanese lady be now professor of mathematics in the university of bologna invite thither by a most obliging letter write by the present pope who desire she to accept of the chair not as a recompense for she merit but to do honor to a town which be under he protection to say truth there be no part of the world where we sex be treat with so much contempt as in england i do not complain of man for have engross the government : in exclude we from all degree of power they preserve we from many fatigue many danger and perhaps many crime the small proportion of authority that have fall to my share -lrb- only over a few child and servant -rrb- have always be a burden and never a pleasure and i believe every one find it so who act from a maxim -lrb- i think a indispensable duty -rrb- that whoever be under my power be under my protection those who find a joy in inflict hardship and see object of misery may have other sensation but i have always think correction even when necessary as painful to the giver as to the sufferer and be therefore very well satisfy with the state of subjection we be place in : but i think it the highest injustice to be debar the entertainment of my closet and that the same study which raise the character of a man should hurt that of a woman we be educate in the grossest ignorance and no art omit to stifle we natural reason if some few get above they nurse ' instruction we knowledge must rest conceal and be as useless to the world as gold in the mine i be now speak accord to we english notion which may wear out some age hence along with other equally absurd it appear to I the strongest proof of a clear understanding in longinus -lrb- in every light acknowledge one of the greatest man among the ancient -rrb- when i find he so far superior to vulgar prejudice as to choose he two example of fine writing from a jew -lrb- at that time the most despise people upon earth -rrb- and a woman we modern wit would be so far from quote they would scarce own they have read the work of such contemptible creature though perhaps they would condescend to steal from they at the same time they declare they be below they notice this subject be apt to run away with I i will trouble you with no more of it here be no news to be send you from this place which have be for this fortnight and still continue overwhelmed with politics and which be of so mysterious a nature one ought to have some of the gift of lilly or partridge to be able to write about they and i leave all those dissertation to those distinguish mortal who be endowed with the talent of divination though i be at present the only one of my sex who seem to be of that opinion the lady have show they zeal and appetite for knowledge in a most glorious manner at the last warm debate in the house of lord it be unanimously resolve there should be no crowd of unnecessary auditor consequently the fair sex be exclude and the gallery destine to the sole use of the house of common notwithstanding which determination a tribe of dame resolve to show on this occasion that neither man nor law could resist they these heroine be lady huntingdon the duchess of queensberry the duchess of ancaster lady westmorland lady cobham lady charlotte edwin lady archibald hamilton and she daughter mr scott and mr pendarve and lady france saunderson i be thus particular in they name since i look upon they to be the boldest assertor and most resigned sufferer for liberty i ever read of they present themselves at the door at nine o'clock in the morning where sir william saunderson respectfully inform they that the chancellor have make a order against they admittance the duchess of queensberry as head of the squadron pish at the ill-breeding of a mere lawyer and desire he to let they upstairs privately after some modest refusal he swear by g -- he would not let they in she grace with a noble warmth answer by g -- they would come in in spite of the chancellor and the whole house this be report the peer resolve to starve they out a order be make that the door should not be open till they have raise they siege these amazon now show themselves qualify for the duty of even foot soldier they stand there till five in the afternoon without either sustenance or evacuation every now and then play volley of thump kick and rap against the door with so much violence that the speaker in the house be scarce hear when the lord be not to be conquer by this the two duchess -lrb- very well apprise of the use of stratagem in war -rrb- command a dead silence of half a hour and the chancellor who think this a certain proof of they absence -lrb- the common also be very impatient to enter -rrb- give order for the opening of the door upon which they all rush in push aside they competitor and place themselves in the front row of the gallery they stay there till after eleven when the house rise and during the debate give applause and show mark of dislike not only by smile and wink -lrb- which have always be allow in these case -rrb- but by noisy laugh and apparent contempt which be suppose the true reason why poor lord hervey speak miserably i beg you pardon dear madam for this long relation but ` tis impossible to be short on so copious a subject and you must own this action very well worthy of record and i think not to be parallel in history ancient or modern lady mary however be less concerned with the open door for woman in politics : she primary desire be that a woman should have the right within reason to live she own life and not merely be a chattel of she husband there be the conduct of she own married life to prove she sincerity she view of the turkish woman have already be give as also have she opinion that marriage should be for the limited period of seven year now she give she opinion of the woman question in italy and it would seem that realize that she own marriage have be anything but satisfactory to either party she write from she heart i can not let pass in silence the prodigious alteration since misson 's writing in regard to we sex this reformation -lrb- or if you please depravation -rrb- begin so lately as the year 1732 when the french overran this part of italy but it have be carry on with such fervor and success that the italian go far beyond they pattern the parisian lady in the extent of they liberty i be not so much surprised at the woman 's conduct as i be amaze at the change in the man 's sentiment jealousy which be once a point of honor among they be explode to that degree it be the most infamous and ridiculous of all character and you can not more affront a gentleman than to suppose he capable of it divorce be also introduce and frequent enough they have long be in fashion in genoa several of the finest and greatest lady there have two husband alive the constant pretext be impotency to which the man often plead guilty and though he marry again and have child by another wife the plea remain good by say he be so in regard to he first and when i tell they that in england a complaint of that kind be esteem so impudent no reasonable woman would submit to make it i be answer we live without religion and that they conscience oblige they rather to strain a point of modesty than to live in a state of damnation however as this method be not without inconvenience -lrb- it be impracticable where there be child -rrb- they have take another here : the husband depose upon oath that he have have a commerce with he mother-in-law on which the marriage be declare incestuous and nullify though the child remain legitimate you will think this hard on the old lady who be scandalise but it be no scandal at all nobody suppose it to be true without circumstance to confirm it but the married couple be set free to they mutual content for i believe it would be difficult to get a sentence of divorce if either side make opposition : at least i have hear no example of it lady mary make no secret of she view upon marriage and though she do not so frequently air she religious belief she often ponder the subject and when challenge to speak be not reticent as regard sacred matter she always have the courage of she conviction even as she have in mundane affair i always if possible avoid controversial dispute : whenever i can not do it they be very short -lrb- she write to she daughter in October 1755 -rrb- i ask my adversary if he believe in the scripture when that be answer affirmatively they church may be prove by a child of ten year old contradictory to it in they most important point my second question be if they think st peter and st paul know the true christian religion the constant reply be o yes then say i purgatory transubstantiation invocation of saint adoration of the virgin relic -lrb- of which they might have have a cartload -rrb- the observation of lend be no part of it since they neither teach nor practice any of these thing vow of celibacy be not more contrary to nature than to the positive precept of st paul he mention a very common case in which people be oblige by conscience to marry no mortal can promise that case shall never be theirs which depend on the disposition of the body as much as a fever and ` tis as reasonable to engage never to feel the one as the other he tell we the mark of the holy spirit be charity humility truth and long suffering can anything be more uncharitable than damning eternally so many million for not believe what they never hear or prouder than call they head a vice-god pious fraud be avowedly permit and persecution applaud : these maxim can not be dictate by the spirit of peace which be so warmly preach in the gospel the creed of the apostle and council of nice do not speak of the mass or real presence as article of belief and athanasius assert whosoever believe accord to they shall be save jesus christ in answer to the lawyer bid he love god above all thing and he neighbor as himself as all that be necessary to salvation when he describe the last judgment he do not examine what sect or what church man be of but how far they have be beneficent to mankind faith can not determine reward or punishment be involuntary and only the consequence of conviction : we do not believe what we please but what appear to we with the face of truth as i do not mistake exclamation invective or ridicule for argument i never recriminate on the life of they pope and cardinal when they urge the character of henry the eighth i only answer good action be often do by all man through interested motive and ` tis the common method of providence to bring good out of evil : history both sacred and profane furnish many example of it when they tell I i have forsake the worship of my ancestor i say i have have more ancestor heathen than christian and my faith be certainly ancienter than theirs since i have add nothing to the practice of the primitive professor of christianity as to the prosperity or extent of the dominion of they church which cardinal bellarmin count among the proof of its orthodoxy the mahometan who have larger empire and have make a quicker progress have a better plea for the visible protection of heaven if the foppery of they religion be only foppery they ought to be comply with wherever it be establish like any ridiculous dress in fashion but i think they impiety : they devotions be scandal to humanity from they nonsense the mercenary deceit and barbarous tyranny of they ecclesiastic inconsistent with moral honesty if they object the diversity of we sect as a mark of reprobation i desire they to consider that objection have equal force against christianity in general when they thunder with the name of father and council they be surprise to find I as well -lrb- often better -rrb- acquaint with they than themselves i show they the variety of they doctrine they virulent contest and various faction instead of that union they boast of i have never be attack a second time in any of the town where i have reside and perhaps shall never be so again after my last battle which be with a old priest a learn man particularly esteem as a mathematician and who have a head and heart as warm as poor whiston 's when i first come hither he visit I every day and talk of I everywhere with such violent praise that have we be young people god know what would have be say i have always the advantage of be quite calm on a subject which they can not talk of without heat he desire i would put on paper what i have say i immediately write one side of a sheet leave the other for he answer he carry it with he promise to bring it the next day since which time i have never see it though i have often demand it be of my defective italian i fancy he send it to he friend the archbishop of milan i have give over ask for it as a desperate debt he still visit I but seldom and in a cold sort of a way when i have find disputant i less respected i have sometimes take pleasure in raise they hope by my concession : they be charm when i agree with they in the number of the sacrament but be horridly disappoint when i explain myself by say the word sacrament be not to be find either in old or new testament and one must be very ignorant not to know it be take from the listing oath of the roman soldier and mean nothing more than a solemn irrevocable engagement parent vow in infant baptism to educate they child in the christian religion which they take upon themselves by confirmation the lord 's supper be frequently renew the same oath ordination and matrimony be solemn vow of a different kind : confession include a vow of reveal all we know and reform what be amiss : extreme unction the last vow that we have live in the faith we be baptise : in this sense they be all sacrament as to the mystery preach since they be all invent long after and some of they repugnant to the primitive institution chapter xvi on the continent -lrb- 1745-1760 -rrb- lady mary stay at avignon -- she remove to brescia -- and then to lovere -- she abandon all idea of montagu join she abroad -- she house at lovere -- she daily round -- she health -- she anxiety about she son -- a amazing incident -- a serious illness -- a novel in a letter -- she correspondence attract the attention of the italian authority -- sir jame and lady france steuart -- politics -- she be in the bad book of the british resident at venice -- lord bute -- the philosophy of lady mary -- letter to lady bute and sir jame steuart lady mary like avignon so well that she stay there until July 1746 then she move to brescia where she stay for a year and then take up she quarter at lovere a small place in lombardy on the lake d'iseo a most attractive spot as she be at pain to tell she daughter at some length for some time she alternate between lovere and brescium i be now in a place the most beautifully romantic i ever see in my life : it be the tunbridge of this part of the world to which i be send by the doctor 's order my ague often return notwithstanding the load of bark i have take -lrb- she write to she daughter from lovere July 24 1747 -rrb- to say truth i have no reason to repent my journey though i be very unwilling to undertake it it be forty mile half by land and half by water the land so stony i be almost shake to piece and i have the ill luck to be surprise with a storm on the lake that if i have not be near a little port -lrb- where i pass a night in a very poor inn -rrb- the vessel must have be lose a fair wind bring I hither next morning early i find a very good lodging a great deal of good company and a village in many respects resemble tunbridge well not only in the quality of the water which be the same but in the manner of the building most of the house be separate at little distance and all build on the side of hill which indeed be far different from those of tunbridge be six time as high : they be really vast rock of different figure cover with green moss or short grass diversify by tuft of tree little wood and here and there vineyard but no other cultivation except garden like those on richmond-hill the whole lake which be twenty-five mile long and three broad be all surround with these impassable mountain the side of which towards the bottom be so thick set with village -lrb- and in most of they gentleman 's seat -rrb- that i do not believe there be anywhere above a mile distance one from another which add very much to the beauty of the prospect we have a opera here which be perform three time in the week i be at it last night and should have be surprise at the neatness of the scene goodness of the voice and justness of the actor if i have not remembered i be in italy several gentleman jump into the orchestra and join in the concert which i suppose be one of the freedom of the place for i never see it in any great town i be yet more amaze -lrb- while the actor be dress for the farce that conclude the entertainment -rrb- to see one of the principal among they and as errant a _ petit maitre _ as if he have pass all he life at paris mount the stage and present we with a cantata of he own perform he have the pleasure of be almost deafen with applause the ball begin afterwards but i be not witness of it have accustom myself to such early hour that i be half asleep before the opera finish : it begin at ten o'clock so that it be one before i could get to bed though i have sup before i go which be the custom i be much better pleased with the diversion on the water where all the town assemble every night and never without music but we have none so rough as trumpet kettle-drum and french horn : they be all violin lute mandolin and flute doux here be hardly a man that do not excel in some of these instrument which he privately address to the lady of he affection and the public have the advantage of it by he add to the number of the musician the fountain where we drink the water rise between two hang hill and be overshadow with large tree that give a freshness in the hottest time of the day the provision be all excellent the fish of the lake be as large and well taste as that of geneva and the mountain abound in game particularly blackcock which i never see in any other part of italy lady mary though still correspond with she husband have clearly give up all idea of return to england or of montagu join she abroad she be quite content with she state which after all so far as we know be she own choice she take a house at lovere and interested herself in improve it and develop the grounds i have be these six week and still be at my dairy-house which join to my garden -lrb- she write to she daughter in July 1748 -rrb- i believe i have already tell you it be a long mile from the castle which be situate in the midst of a very large village once a considerable town part of the wall still remain and have not vacant ground enough about it to make a garden which be my greatest amusement it be now troublesome to walk or even go in the chaise till the evening i have fit up in this farm-house a room for myself -- that be to say strew the floor with rush cover the chimney with moss and branch and adorn the room with basin of earthen-ware -lrb- which be make here to great perfection -rrb- fill with flower and put in some straw chair and a couch bed which be my whole furniture this spot of ground be so beautiful i be afraid you will scarce credit the description which however i can assure you shall be very literal without any embellishment from imagination it be on a bank form a kind of peninsula raise from the river oglio fifty foot to which you may descend by easy stair cut in the turf and either take the air on the river which be as large as the thame at richmond or by walk -lrb- in -rrb- a avenue two hundred yard on the side of it you find a wood of a hundred acre which be all ready cut into walk and riding when i take it i have only add fifteen bower in different view with seat of turf they be easily make here be a large quantity of underwood and a great number of wild vine which twist to the top of the highest tree and from which they make a very good sort of wine they call _ brusco _ i be now write to you in one of these arbor which be so thickly shaded the sun be not troublesome even at noon another be on the side of the river where i have make a camp kitchen that i may take the fish dress and eat it immediately and at the same time see the bark which ascend or descend every day to or from mantua guastalla or pont de vie all considerable town this little wood be carpet in they succeed season with violet and strawberry inhabit by a nation of nightingale and fill with game of all kind except deer and wild boar the first be unknown here and not be large enough for the other my garden be a plain vineyard when it come into my hand not two year ago and it be with a small expense turn into a garden that -lrb- apart from the advantage of the climate -rrb- i like better than that of kensington the italian vineyard be not plant like those in france but in clump fasten to tree plant in equal rank -lrb- commonly fruit-tree -rrb- and continue in festoon from one to another which i have turn into covered gallery of shade that i can walk in the heat without be incommode by it i have make a dining-room of verdure capable of hold a table of twenty cover the whole ground be three hundred and seventeen foot in length and two hundred in breadth you see it be far from large but so prettily dispose -lrb- though i say it -rrb- that i never see a more agreeable rustic garden abound with all sort of fruit and produce a variety of wine i would send you a piece -lrb- _ sic _ -rrb- if i do not fear the custom would make you pay too dear for it lady mary be now in she sixtieth year and ask for nothing better than peace and comfort she manner of life she describe as be as regular as that of any monastery she rise at six and after a early breakfast work in the garden then she visit the dairy and inspect she chicken -- at one time she have two hundred of they -- and she turkey goose duck and peacock she bee and she silkworm at eleven she read for a hour and after a early dinner would take a siesta then she play picquet or whist with some friendly priest in the evening she walk in the wood or ride or go on the lake i enjoy every amusement that solitude can afford she say i confess i sometimes wish for a little conversation but i reflect that the commerce of the world give more uneasiness than pleasure and quiet be all the hope that can reasonably be indulge at my age it would not have be lady mary if she have not keep a keen eye on the penny she be delighted to be able to say in relation to she house and grounds that all thing have hitherto prosper under my care my bee and silkworm be double and i be tell that without accident my capital will be so in two year ' time she enjoy the more she evening now and she fish at dinner because neither cost she anything the fishery of this part of the river belong to I and my fisherman 's little boat -lrb- where i have a green lutestring awning -rrb- serve I for a barge he and he son be my rower without expense he be very well pay by the profit of the fish which i give he on condition of have every day one dish for my table age deal gently with lady mary at the age of sixty-two she could say that she hearing and she memory be good and she sight better than she have any right to expect she have appetite enough to relish what she eat sleep as soundly as she have ever do and have never a headache still the fact be force upon she that she be no longer so young as she have be -- which unpleasing reflection she accept philosophically enough i no more expect to arrive at the age of the duchess of marlborough -lrb- 19 -rrb- than to that of methusalem neither do i desire it -lrb- she write to lady bute in the early spring of 1751 -rrb- i have long think myself useless to the world i have see one generation pass away and it be go for i think there be very few of those leave that flourish in my youth you will perhaps call these melancholy reflection : they be not so there be a quiet after the abandon of pursuit something like the rest that follow a laborious day i tell you this for you comfort it be formerly a terrifying view to I that i should one day be a old woman i now find that nature have provide pleasure for every state those be only unhappy who will not be contented with what she give but strive to break through she law by affect a perpetuity of youth which appear to I as little desirable at present as the baby do to you that be the delight of you infancy -lrb- footnote 19 : the duchess of marlborough be bear on may 29 1660 and die on October 18 1744 -rrb- she revert to the same subject when write to she husband a month or two later : i can no longer resist the desire i have to know what be become of my son i have long suppress it from a belief that if there be anything of good to be tell you would not fail to give I the pleasure of hear it i find it now grow so much upon I that whatever i be to know i think it would be easier for I to support than the anxiety i suffer from my doubt i beg to be inform and prepare myself for the worst with all the philosophy i have at my time of life i ought to be detach from a world which i be soon to leave to be totally so be a vain endeavor and perhaps there be vanity in the endeavor : while we be human we must submit to human infirmity and suffer they in mind as well as body all that reflection and experience can do be to mitigate we can never extinguish we passion i call by that name every sentiment that be not found upon reason and own i can not justify to mine the concern i feel for one who never give I any view of satisfaction this be too melancholy a subject to dwell upon you compliment I on the continuation of my spirit : ` tis true i try to maintain they by every art i can be sensible of the terrible consequence of lose they young people be too apt to let theirs sink on any disappointment there be in 1751 some extraordinary incident in the life of lady mary the true history of which have never be make public pray tell I horace walpole write to sir horace mann on August 31 of that year if you know anything of lady mary wortley : we have a obscure history here of she being in durance in the brescian or the bergamasco : that a young fellow that she set out with keep have take it into he head to keep she close prisoner not permit she to write or receive any letter but which he see : he seem determine if she husband should die not to lose she as the count -lrb- richcourt -rrb- do lady oxford no reply to this letter reach walpole but he insatiable curiosity would not accept this as a check and he write again on October 14 : do you ever receive the question i ask you about lady mary wortley 's be confine by a lover that she keep somewhere in the brescian i long to know the particulars at the time of this incident lady mary be in she sixty-second year it be possible but extremely improbable therefore that lady mary should have take a young man into keep horace walpole may always be trust to make the best of a rumor still it may be state on the authority of wright that among lady mary 's papers there be find a long account of the matter write in italian in this she mention that for some time she have be forcibly detain in a country house belong to a italian count and occupy by he and he mother this paper it be further mention seem to have be submit to a lawyer for he opinion or for production in a court of law it may be of course that lady mary do to some extent adopt the young man who think that by keep possession of she person he might be able to extort money from she not long after this business in fact in February 1752 lady mary be report that she be well enough in health she have be read coventry 's _ pompey the little _ and tell she daughter that she see herself in the character of mr qualmsick : you will be surprise at this no englishwoman be so free from vapor have never in my life complain of low spirit or weak nerve but we resemblance be very strong in the fancied loss of appetite which i have be silly enough to be persuade into by the physician of this place he visit I frequently as be one of the most considerable man in the parish and be a grave sober thinking great fool whose solemn appearance and deliberate way of deliver he sentiment give they a air of good sense though they be often the most injudicious that ever be pronounce by perpetual tell I i eat so little he be amaze i be able to subsist he have bring I to be of he opinion and i begin to be seriously uneasy at it this useful treatise have rouse I into a recollection of what i eat yesterday and do almost every day the same i wake generally about seven and drink half a pint of warm ass ' milk after which i sleep two hour as soon as i be rise i constantly take three cup of milk coffee and hour after that a large cup of milk chocolate : two hour more bring my dinner where i never fail swallow a good dish -lrb- i do not mean plate -rrb- of gravy soup with all the bread root & c belong to it i then eat a wing and the whole body of a large fat capon and a veal sweetbread conclude with a competent quantity of custard and some roasted chestnut at five in the afternoon i take another dose of ass ' milk and for supper twelve chestnut -lrb- which would weigh twenty-four of those in london -rrb- one new lay egg and a handsome porringer of white bread and milk with this diet notwithstanding the menace of my wise doctor i be now convinced i be in no danger of starve and be oblige to little pompey for this discovery two year later however when she be in she sixty-fifth year lady mary find herself far from well in April of that year she tell she daughter : my time be wholly dedicate to the care of a decaying body and endeavor as the old song say to grow wiser and better as my strength wear away shortly after she be take seriously unwell at gottolengo when she have recover she always interested in medical science send lady bute a full account of she illness and of the extraordinary physician from the neighbouring village of lovere soon after i write my last letter to my dear child i be seize with so violent a fever accompany with so many bad symptom my life be despair of by the physician of gottolengo and i prepare myself for death with as much resignation as that circumstance admit : some of my neighbor without my knowledge send express for the doctor of this place whom i have mention to you formerly as have uncommon secret i be surprise to see he at my bedside he declare I in great danger but do not doubt my recovery if i be wholly under he care and he first prescription be transport I hither the other physician assert positively i should die on the road it have always be my opinion that it be a matter of the utmost indifference where we expire and i consent to be remove my bed be place on a bancard my servant follow in chaise and in this equipage i set out i bear the first day 's journey of fifteen mile without any visible alteration the doctor say as i be not worse i be certainly better and the next day proceed twenty mile to iséo which be at the head of this lake i lay each night at nobleman 's house which be empty my cook with my physician aways precede two or three hour and i find my chamber with all necessaries ready prepare with the exactest attention i be put into a bark in my litter bed and in three hour arrive here my spirit be not at all waste -lrb- i think rather raise -rrb- by the fatigue of my journey i drink the water next morning and with a few dose of my physician 's prescription in three day find myself in perfect health which appear almost a miracle to all that see I you may imagine i be willing to submit to the order of one that i must acknowledge the instrument of save my life though they be not entirely conformable to my will and pleasure he have sentence I to a long continuance here which he say be absolutely necessary to the confirmation of my health and would persuade I that my illness have be wholly owe to my omission of drink the water these two year past i dare not contradict he and must own he deserve -lrb- from the various surprising cure i have see -rrb- the name give to he in this country of the miraculous man both he character and practice be so singular i can not forbear give you some account of they he will not permit he patient to have either surgeon or apothecary : he perform all the operation of the first with great dexterity and whatever compound he give he make in he own house : those be very few the juice of herb and these water be commonly he sole prescription he have very little learning and profess draw all he knowledge from experience which he possess perhaps in a greater degree than any other mortal be the seventh doctor of he family in a direct line he forefather have all of they leave journal and register solely for the use of they posterity none of they have publish anything and he have recourse to these manuscript on every difficult case the veracity of which at least be unquestionable he vivacity be prodigious and he be indefatigable in he industry : but what most distinguish he be a disinterestedness i never see in any other : he be as regular in he attendance on the poorest peasant from whom he never can receive one farthe as on the richest of the nobility and whenever he be want will climb three or four mile in the mountain in the hottest sun or heaviest rain where a horse can not go to arrive at a cottage where if they condition require it he do not only give they advice and medicine grati but bread wine and whatever be needful there never pass a week without one or more of these expedition he last visit be generally to I i often see he as dirty and tired as a foot post have eat nothing all day but a roll or two that he carry in he pocket yet bless with such a perpetual flow of spirit he be always gay to a degree above cheerfulness there be a peculiarity in he character that i hope will incline you to forgive my draw it it be probably by the advice of she physician that lady mary decide to make lovere she headquarters he prescribe take the water there and a long rest lovere be a dull place visitor come only during the water-drinking season the plague that overran europe in 1626 have ravage it : the poor be almost destroy and the rich desert it a few of the ancient palace have be turn into lodging-house the rest be in ruinous condition lady mary buy one of the palace i see you lift up you eye in wonder at my indiscretion i beg you to hear my reason before you condemn I in my infirm state of health the unavoidable noise of a public lodging be very disagreeable and here be no private one : secondly and chiefly the whole purchase be but one hundred pound with a very pretty garden in terrace down to the water and a court behind the house it be found on a rock and the wall so thick they will probably remain as long as the earth it be true the apartment be in most tattered circumstance without door or window the beauty of the great saloon gain my affection : it be forty-two foot in length by twenty-five proportionably high opening into a balcony of the same length with marble baluster : the ceiling and flooring be in good repair but i have be force to the expense of cover the wall with new stucco and the carpenter be at this minute take measure of the window in order to make frame for sash the great stair be in such a decline way it would be a very hazardous exploit to mount they : i never intend to attempt it the state bedchamber shall also remain for the sole use of the spider that have take possession of it along with the grand cabinet and some other piece of magnificence quite useless to I and which would cost a great deal to make habitable i have fit up six room with lodgings for five servant which be all i ever will have in this place and i be persuade that i could make a profit if i would part with my purchase have be very much befriend in the sale which be by auction the owner have die without child and i believe he have never see this mansion in he life it have stand empty from the death of he grandfather the governor bid for I and nobody would bid against he thus i be become a citizen of lovere to the great joy of the inhabitant not -lrb- as they would pretend -rrb- from they respect for my person but i perceive they fancy i shall attract all the travel english and to say the truth the singularity of the place be well worth they curiosity but as i have no correspondent i may be bury here fifty year and nobody know anything of the matter lady mary find great pleasure in she correspondence it be one of the occupation with which she solace she loneliness and she be never more happy than when she have a exciting story to set down for she could set it down with the ease of a walpole and a individual touch that be all she own : i be quietly read in my closet when i be interrupt by the chambermaid of the signora laura bono who fling herself at my foot and in a agony of sob and tear beg I for the love of the holy madonna to hasten to she master 's house where the two brother would certainly murder one another if my presence do not stop they fury i be very much surprised have always hear they speak of as a pattern of fraternal union however i make all possible speed thither without stay for hood or attendance i be soon there -lrb- the house touch my garden wall -rrb- and be direct to the bedchamber by the noise of oath and execration but on open the door be astonish to a degree you may better guess than i describe by see the signora laura prostrate on the ground melting in tear and she husband standing with a draw stiletto in he hand swearing she should never see tomorrow 's sun i be soon let into the secret the good man have business of consequence at brescium go thither early in the morning but as he expect he chief tenant to pay he rent that day he leave order with he wife that if the farmer who live two mile off come himself or send any of he son she should take care to make he very welcome she obey he with great punctuality the money come in the hand of a handsome lad of eighteen : she do not only admit he to she own table and produce the best wine in the cellar but resolve to give he _ chêre entière _ while she be exercise this generous hospitality the husband meet midway the gentleman he intend to visit who be post to another side of the country they agree on another appointment and he return to he own house where give he horse to be lead round to the stable by the servant that accompany he he open he door with the _ passe-partout _ key and proceed to he chamber without meeting anybody where he find he beloved spouse asleep on the bed with she gallant the opening of the door wake they : the young fellow immediately leap out of the window which look into the garden and be open it be summer and escape over the field leave he breeches on a chair by the bedside -- very striking circumstance in short the case be such i do not think the queen of fairy herself could have find a excuse though chaucer tell we she have make a solemn promise to leave none of she sex unfurnished with one to all eternity as to the poor criminal she have nothing to say for herself but what i dare swear you will hear from you youngest daughter if ever you catch she stealing of sweetmeat -- pray pray she would do so no more and indeed it be the first time this last article find no credit with I : i can not be persuade that any woman who have live virtuous till forty -lrb- for such be she age -rrb- could suddenly be endow with such consummate impudence to solicit a youth at first sight there be no probability he age and station consider that he would have make any attempt of that kind i must confess i be wicked enough to think the unblemished reputation she have hitherto maintain and do not fail to put we in mind of be owe to a series of such frolic and to say truth they be the only amours that can reasonably hope to remain undiscovered lady that can resolve to make love thus _ extempore _ may pass unobserved especially if they can content themselves with low life where fear may oblige they favorite to secrecy : there want only a very lewd constitution a very bad heart and a moderate understand to make this conduct easy : and i do not doubt it have be practice by many prude beside she i be now speak of you may be sure i do not communicate these reflection the first word i speak be to desire signer carlo to sheathe he poniard not be please with its glittering he do so very readily beg my pardon for not have do it on my first appearance say he do not know what he do and indeed he have the countenance and gesture of a man distract i do not endeavor a defense that seem to I impossible but represent to he as well as i could the crime of a murder which if he could justify before man be still a cry sin before god the disgrace he would bring on himself and posterity and irreparable injury he would do he eldest daughter a pretty girl of fifteen that i know he be extremely fond of i add that if he think it proper to part from he lady he might easily find a pretext for it some month hence and that it be as much he interest as hers to conceal this affair from the knowledge of the world i could not presently make he taste these reason and be force to stay there near five hour -lrb- almost from five to ten at night -rrb- before i durst leave they together which i would not do till he have swear in the most serious manner he would make no future attempt on she life i be content with he oath know he to be very devout and find i be not mistaken how the matter be make up between they afterwards i know not but it be now two year since it happen and all appearance remain as if it have never be the secret be in very few hand he brother be at that time at brescium i believe know nothing of it to this day the chambermaid and myself have preserve the strictest silence and the lady retain the satisfaction of insulting all she acquaintance on the foundation of a spotless character that only she can boast in the parish where she be most heartily hate from these air of impertinent virtue and another very essential reason be the best dress woman among they though one of the plainest in she figure the discretion of the chambermaid in fetch I which possibly save she mistress 's life and she taciturnity since i fancy appear very remarkable to you and be what would certainly never happen in england the first part of she behavior deserve great praise come of she own accord and invent so decent a excuse for she admittance : but she silence may be attribute to she know very well that any servant that presume to talk of he master will most certainly be incapable of talk at all in a short time they life be entirely in the power of they superior : i do not mean by law but by custom which have full as much force if one of they be kill it would either never be inquire into at all or very slightly pass over yet it seldom happen and i know no instance of it which i think be owe to the great submission of domestic who be sensible of they dependence and the national temper not be hasty and never inflamed by wine drunkenness be a vice abandon to the vulgar and speak of with greater detestation than murder which be mention with as little concern as a drinking-bout in england and be almost as frequent it be extreme shocking to I at my first come and still give I a sort of horror though custom have in some degree familiarise it to my imagination robbery would be pursue with great vivacity and punish with the utmost rigor therefore be very rare though steal be in daily practice but as all the peasant be suffer the use of fire-arm the slightest provocation be sufficient to shoot and they see one of they own species lie dead before they with as little remorse as a hare or a partridge and when revenge spur they on with much more pleasure a dissertation on this subject would engage I in a discourse not proper for the post lady mary be a prolific letter-writer come under the suspicion of the italian authority who carefully examine the correspondence -- a fact that be only by a chance conversation reveal to she i think i now know why we correspondence be so miserably interrupted and so many of my letter lose to and from england she write to she husband in October 1753 but i be no happier in the discovery than a man who have find out he complaint proceed from a stone in the kidney i know the cause but be entirely ignorant of the remedy and must suffer my uneasiness with what patience i can a old priest make I a visit as i be folding my last packet to my daughter observe it to be large he tell I i have do a great deal of business that morning i make answer i have do no business at all i have only write to my daughter on family affair or such trifle as make up woman 's conversation he say gravely people like you excellenza do not use to write long letter upon trifle i assure he that if he understand english i would let he read my letter he reply with a mysterious smile if i do understand english i should not understand what you have write except you would give I the key which i durst not presume to ask what key -lrb- say i stare -rrb- there be not one cypher besides the date he answer cypher be only use by novice in politics and it be very easy to write intelligibly under feigned name of person and place to a correspondent in such a manner as should be almost impossible to be understand by anybody else thus i suppose my innocent epistle be severely scrutinize and when i talk of my grandchild they be fancy to represent all the potentate of europe this be very provoking i confess there be good reason for extraordinary caution at this juncture but ` tis very hard i can not pass for be as insignificant as i really be lady mary clearly be happy in italy and do not in the least hanker after the delight of london society which in she earlier day she have so much enjoy by the account you give I of london i think it very much reform at least you have one sin the less and it be a very reign one in my time i mean scandal : it must be literally reduce to a whisper since the custom of live all together i hope it have also banish the fashion of talk all at once which be very prevail when i be in town and may perhaps contribute to brotherly love and unity which be so much decline in my memory that it be hard to invite six people that would not by cold look or pique reflection affront one another i suppose party be at a end though i fear it be the consequence of the old almanac prophecy poverty bring peace and i fancy you really follow the french mode and the lady keep a assembly that the assembly may keep the lady and card money pay for clothes and equipage as well as card and candle i find i should be as solitary in london as i be here in the country it be impossible for I to submit to live in a _ drum _ which i think so far from a cure of uneasiness that it be in my opinion add one more to the heap there be so many attach to humanity ` tis impossible to fly from they all but experience have confirm to I what i always think that the pursuit of pleasure will be ever attend with pain and the study of ease be most certainly accompany with pleasure i have have this morning as much delight in a walk in the sun as ever i feel formerly in the crowded mall even when i imagine i have my share of the admiration of the place which be generally sour before i sleep by the information of my female friend who seldom fail to tell I it be observe i have show a inch above my shoe-heel or some other criticism of equal weight which be construe affectation and utterly destroy all the satisfaction my vanity have give I i have now no other but in my little houswifery which be easily gratify in this country where by the help of my receipt-book i make a very shine figure among my neighbor by the introduction of custard cheesecake and minced pie which be entirely unknown to these part and be receive with universal applause and i have reason to believe will preserve my memory even to future age particularly by the art of butter-making in which i have so improve they that they now make as good as in any part of england lady mary make the acquaintance in 1758 of sir jame steuart -lrb- 20 -rrb- and he wife lady france the eldest daughter of the earl of wemyss and sister of the jacobite lord elcho steuart when make the grand tour have meet the exile stuart at rome and have become attach to they cause when the young pretender land in scotland in 1745 steuart throw in he lot with he on he master 's business he go to pari and be abroad when culloden be fight when a act of oblivion be pass in 1748 he be exempt by name and therefore he return be at the time impossible he and he wife wander about the continent and it be at venice that they encounter lady mary who be delighted with they i be charm to find a man of uncommon sense and learning and a lady that without beauty be more admirable than the fairest of she sex she write enthusiastically to she daughter i offer they all the little good office in my power and invite they to supper upon which we wise minister -lrb- 21 -rrb- have discover that i be in the interest of popery and slavery as he have often say the same thing of mr pitt it would give I no mortification if i do not apprehend that he fertile imagination may support this wise idea by such circumstance as may influence those that do not know I it be very remarkable that after have suffer all the rage of that party at avignon for my attachment to the present reign family i should be accuse here of favor rebellion when i hope all we odious diversion be forget -lrb- footnote 20 : sir jame steuart -lrb- 1712-1780 -rrb- in 1773 on inherit a estate from a relative take the additional surname of denham he be the author of work on currency and political economy -rrb- -lrb- footnote 21 : the british resident at venice at this time be john murray -rrb- lady mary be anxious that nothing she do should reflect upon she daughter or in any way affect lord bute i be afraid you may think some imprudent behavior of mine have occasion all this ridiculous persecution -lrb- by the resident -rrb- she write to they in may 1758 i can assure you i have always treat he and he family with the utmost civility and be now retire to padua to avoid the comment that will certainly be make on he extraordinary conduct towards I i only desire privacy and quiet and be very well contented to be without visit which oftener disturb than amuse I my single concern be the design he have form of secure -lrb- as he call it -rrb- my effect immediately on my decease if they ever fall into he hand i be persuade they will never arrive entire into yours which be a very uneasy thought to I although not primarily interested in politics lady mary have meet so many politician that she be naturally eager to hear what be go on and the fact that she son-in-law lord bute be active in that department of life make she follow ministerial event in england so closely as possible i stay here though i be on many account better pleased with padua she write to she daughter from venice January 20 1758 we great minister the resident treat I as one of the opposition i be incline to laugh rather than be displeased at he political air yet as i be among stranger they be disagreeable and could i have foresee they would have settle in some other part of the world : but i have take lease of my house be at much pain and expense in furnish they and be no longer of a age to make long journey pitt 's coalition ministry form in June 1757 in which pitt and lord holdernesse be secretary of state the duke of newcastle first lord of the treasury legge chancellor of the exchequer and lord granville lord temple sir robert henley the duke of devonshire the duke of bedford and henry fox hold office move lady mary to merriment you account of the change in ministerial affair do not surprise I but nothing could be more astonishing than they all come together -lrb- she write to lady bute -rrb- it put I in mind of a friend of mine who have a large family of favorite animal and not know how to convey they to he country-house in separate equipage he order a dutch mastiff a cat and she kitten a monkey and a parrot all to be pack up together in one large hamper and send by a waggon one may easily guess how this set of company make they journey and i have never be able to think of the present compound ministry without the idea of bark scratch and scream ` tis too ridiculous a one i own for the gravity of they character and still more for the situation the kingdom be in for as much as one may encourage the love of laughter ` tis impossible to be indifferent to the welfare of one 's native country the resident be so far as lady mary be concern a ill-conditioned fellow she ask he once or twice for the english papers but the reply make with intention on each occasion be that they be engage since the ministry of mr pitt she remark he be so desirous to signalise he zeal for the contrary faction he be perpetually say ridiculous thing to manifest he attachment and as he look upon I -lrb- nobody know why -rrb- to be the friend of a man i never see he have not visit I once this winter the misfortune be not great lady mary be amuse at be mistake for a politician i have often be so though i ever think politics so far remove from my sphere i can not accuse myself of dabble in they even when i hear they talk over in all company but as the old song say ` tho ' through the wide world we should range ` tis in vain from we fortune to fly ' lady mary always cherish affection and respect for she son-in-law lord bute he have be since 1747 a favorite with frederick prince of wale who in 1750 appoint he a lord of he bedchamber when frederick die in the following year bute have establish he popularity with the princess who in 1756 secure he appointment as groom of the steal i have something to mention that i believe will be agreeable to you edward wortley montagu write to he wife at this time i mean some particulars relate to lord bute he stand higher in the prince of wale 's favor than any man he attendance be frequent at leicester house where this young prince have reside and since he father 's death have continue without intermission till new officer be to be place under he it be say that another person be to be groom of the steal but that the prince 's earnest request be comply with in my lord 's favor it be suppose that the governor preceptor etc who be about he before will now be set aside and that my lord be now the principal adviser neither montagu nor he wife in they publish correspondence make any allusion to the scandal current about the intimate relation of the princess and lord bute though it be so widely spread it be almost impossible it should not have come to the ear of one or other of they on the accession of george iii bute be swear a member of the privy council and in November 1760 appoint groom of the steal and first gentleman of the bedchamber he influence with the young king be paramount i pity lady bute walpole write to sir horace mann on January 27 1761 she mother will sell to whoever do not know she all kind of promise and reversion bestow lie grati and wholesale and make so much mischief that they will be force to discard she in three month which will go to lady bute 's heart who be one of the best and most sensible woman in the world and who educate by such a mother have never make a false step as a matter of fact the only request know to be make by lady mary be to ask lord bute through she daughter to take care that sir jame steuart 's name be not exclude in the act of indemnity it be however true that there be the follow statement in the diary of the right hon william windham under the date of November 25 1772 which be give here for what it be worth mr montagu tell I this evening about lady mary wortley montagu that at she death ' a note of he be find among she papers for one thousand guinea ' which have be give she by a gentleman of ireland as the premium for some honor to be receive through she interest the honor stipulate for be not obtain before she death and the gentleman upon representation of the story to the family recover the note which she have deposit by agreement in a particular drawer shewn to he it may reasonably be suppose that this be not the first instance of she accept money on those condition and that much of lord bute 's interest have be employ in she service as lady mary advance in the sixty of she life she look upon the world with the eye of a vast experience and find it more sad than she have think it in youth or middle age _ vanita vanitatum _ be the text of many a homily that she deliver and a certain sadness replace the sense of malice that have once possess she once more than aggressive now she have have bestow upon she in some degree that gift of understand that engender sympathy as she grow older she grow more wise and be anxious to impart she wisdom especially to she daughter for she benefit or for that of she daughter 's child how important be the charge of youth and how useless all the advantage of nature and fortune without a well-turned mind i have lately hear of a very shine instance of this truth from two gentleman -lrb- very deserving one they seem to be -rrb- who have have the curiosity to travel into moscovy and now return to england with mr archer i inquire after my old acquaintance sir charle -lrb- hanbury -rrb- william who i hear be much broken both in spirit and constitution how happy that man might have be if there have be add to he natural and acquire endowment a dash of morality if he have know how to distinguish between false and true felicity and instead of seek to increase a estate already too large and hunting after pleasure that have make he rotten and ridiculous he have bound he desire of wealth and follow the dictate of he conscience he servile ambition have gain he two yard of red ribbon and a exile into a miserable country where there be no society and so little taste that i believe he suffer under a dearth of flatterer this be say for the use of you grow son whom i hope no golden temptation will induce to marry woman they can not love or comply with measure they do not approve all the happiness this world can afford be more within reach than be generally suppose whoever seek pleasure will undoubtedly find pain whoever will pursue ease will as certainly find pleasure the world 's esteem be the highest gratification of human vanity and that be more easily obtain in a moderate fortune than a overgrown one which be seldom possess never gain without envy i say esteem for as to applause it be a youthful pursuit never to be forgive after twenty and naturally succeed the childish desire of catch the setting sun which i can remember run very hard to do : a fine thing truly if it could be catch but experience soon show it to be impossible a wise and honest man live to he own heart without that silly splendor that make he a prey to knave and which commonly end in he become one of the fraternity i be very glad to hear lord bute 's decent economy set he above anything of that kind i wish it may become national a collective body of man differ very little from a single man frugality be the foundation of generosity i have often be compliment on the english heroism who have throw away so many million without any prospect of advantage to themselves purely to succor a distressed princess i never could hear these praise without some impatience they sound to I like panegyric make by the dependent on the duke of newcastle and poor lord oxford bubble when they be commend and laugh at when undo some late event will i hope open we eye : we shall see we be a island and endeavor to extend we commerce rather than the quixote reputation of redress wrong and place diadem on head that should be equally indifferent to we when time have ripen mankind into common sense the name of conqueror will be a odious title i could easily prove that have the spaniard establish a trade with the american they would have enrich they country more than by the addition of twenty-two kingdom and all the mine they now work -- i do not say possess since though they be the proprietor other enjoy the profit mary 's letter at this period of she life be so entertaining that a few may well be insert here for the sheer pleasure of read they to the countess of bute padua September 30 1757 lord bute have be so oblige as to let I know you safe delivery and the birth of another daughter may she be as meritorious in you eye as you be in mine i can wish nothing better to you both though i have some reproach to make you daughter daughter do not call name you be always abuse my pleasure which be what no mortal will bear trash lumber sad stuff be the title you give to my favorite amusement if i call a white staff a stick of wood a gold key gilded brass and the ensign of illustrious order color string this may be philosophically true but would be very ill receive we have all we plaything : happy be they that can be contented with those they can obtain : those hour be spend in the wisest manner that can easiest shade the ill of life and be lest productive of ill consequence i think my time better employ in read the adventure of imaginary people than the duchess of marlborough 's who pass the latter year of she life in paddle with she will and contrive scheme of plague some and extract praise from other to no purpose eternally disappointed and eternally fret the active scene be over at my age i indulge with all the art i can my taste for read if i would confine it to valuable book they be almost as rare as valuable man i must be content with what i can find as i approach a second childhood i endeavor to enter into the pleasure of it you youngest son be perhaps at this very moment ride on a poker with great delight not at all regret that it be not a gold one and much less wish it a arabian horse which he would not know how to manage i be read a idle tale not expect wit or truth in it and be very glad it be not metaphysics to puzzle my judgment or history to mislead my opinion he fortify he health by exercise i calm my care by oblivion the method may appear low to busy people but if he improve he strength and i forget my infirmity we attain very desirable end to the countess of bute venice November 8 1758 some few month before lord w hamilton marry there appear a foolish song say to be write by a poetical great lady who i really think be the character of lady arabellum in _ the female quixote _ -lrb- without the beauty -rrb- : you may imagine such a conduct at court make she superlatively ridiculous lady delawarr a woman of great merit with whom i live in much intimacy show this fine performance to I : we be very merry in suppose what answer lord william would make to these passionate address she beg I to say something for a poor man who have nothing to say for himself i write _ extempore _ on the back of the song some stanza that go perfectly well to the tune she promise they should never appear as mine and faithfully keep she word by what accident they have fall into the hand of that thing dodsley i know not but he have print they as address by I to a very contemptible puppy and my own word as he answer i do not believe either job or socrate ever have such a provocation you will tell I it can not hurt I with any acquaintance i ever have : it be true but it be a excellent piece of scandal for the same sort of people that propagate with success that you nurse leave she estate husband and family to go with I to england and then i turn she to starve after defraud she of god know what i thank god witch be out of fashion or i should expect to have it depose by several credible witness that i have be see fly through the air on a broomstick & c i be really sick with vexation to sir jame steuart venice November 14 1758 this letter will be solely to you and i desire you will not communicate it to lady fanny : she be the best woman in the world and i would by no means make she uneasy but there will be such strange thing in it that the talmud or the revelation be not half so mysterious : what these prodigy portend god know but i never should have suspect half the wonder i see before my eye and be convince of the necessity of the repeal of the witch act -lrb- as it be commonly call -rrb- i mean to speak correctly the tacit permission give to witch so scandalous to all good christian : though i tremble to think of it for my own interest it be certain the british island have always be strangely addict to this diabolical intercourse of which i dare swear you know many instance but since this public encouragement give to it i be afraid there will not be a old woman in the nation entirely free from suspicion the devil rage more powerfully than ever : you will believe I when i assure you the great and learn english minister be turn methodist several duel have be fight in the place of st marc for the charm of he excellent lady and i have be see fly in the air in the figure of julian cox which history be relate with so much candor and truth by the pious pen of joseph glanville chaplain to k charle i know you young rake make a jest of all those thing but i think no good lady can doubt of a relation so well attest she be about seventy year old -lrb- very near my age -rrb- and the whole swear to before judge archer 1663 : very well worth reading but rather too long for a letter you know -lrb- wretch that i be -rrb- ` tis one of my wicked maxim to make the best of a bad bargain and i have say publicly that every period of life have its privilege and that even the most despicable creature alive may find some pleasure now observe this comment who be the most despicable creature certainly old woman what pleasure can a old woman take only witchcraft i think this argument as clear as any of the devout bishop of cloyne 's metaphysics : this be decide in a full congregation of saint only such atheist as you and lady fanny can deny it i own all the fact as many witch have do before I and go every night in a public manner astride upon a black cat to a meeting where you be suspect to appear : this last article be not swear to it be doubtful in what manner we clandestine midnight correspondence be carry on some think it treasonable other lewd -lrb- do not tell lady fanny -rrb- but all agree there be something very odd and unaccountable in such sudden liking i confess as i say before it be witchcraft you will not wonder i do not sign -lrb- notwithstanding all my impudence -rrb- such dangerous truth : who know the consequence the devil be say to desert he votary to sir jame steuart venice January 13 1759 i have indulge myself some time with day-dream of the happiness i hope to enjoy this summer in the conversation of lady fanny and sir jame s but i hear such frightful story of precipice and hovel during the whole journey i begin to fear there be no such pleasure allot I in the book of fate : the alp be once molehill in my sight when they interpose between I and the slightest inclination now age begin to freeze and bring with it the usual train of melancholy apprehension poor human-kind we always march blindly on the fire of youth represent to we all we wish possible and that over we fall into despondency that prevent even easy enterprise : a store in winter a garden in summer bound all we desire or at least we undertaking if mr steuart would disclose all he imagination i dare swear he have some thought of emulate alexander or demosthene perhaps both : nothing seem difficult at he time of life everything at name i be very unwilling but be afraid i must submit to the confinement of my boat and my easy-chair and go no farther than they can carry I why be we view so extensive and we power so miserably limit this be among the mystery which -lrb- as you justly say -rrb- will remain ever unfold to we shallow capacity i be much inclined to think we be no more free agent than the queen of club when she victoriously take prisoner the knave of heart and all we effort -lrb- when we rebel against destiny -rrb- as weak as a card that stick to a glove when the gamester be determine to throw it on the table let we then -lrb- which be the only true philosophy -rrb- be contented with we chance and make the best of that bad bargain of be bear in this vile planet where we may find however -lrb- god be thank -rrb- much to laugh at though little to approve i confess i delight extremely in look on man in that light how many thousand trample under foot honor ease and pleasure in pursuit of riband of certain color dab of embroidery on they clothes and gilt wood carve behind they coach in a particular figure other break they heart till they be distinguish by the shape and color of they hat and in general all people earnestly seek what they do not want while they neglect the real blessing in they possession -- i mean the innocent gratification of they sens which be all we can properly call we own for my part i will endeavor to comfort myself for the cruel disappointment i find in renounce tubingen by eat some fresh oyster on the table i hope you be sit down with dear lady

there be any such faculty as memory in the machine call to the countess of bute venice may 22 1759 building be the general weakness of old people i have have a twitch of it myself though certainly it be the highest absurdity and as sure a proof of dotage as pink-coloured riband or even matrimony nay perhaps there be more to be say in defense of the last i mean in a childless old man he may prefer a boy bear in he own house though he know it be not he own to disrespectful or worthless nephew or niece but there be no excuse for begin a edifice he can never inhabit or probably see finish the duchess of marlborough use to ridicule the vanity of it by say one might always live upon other people 's folly : yet you see she build the most ridiculous house i ever see since it really be not habitable from the excessive damp so true it be the thing that we would do those do we not and the thing we would not do those do we daily i feel in myself a proof of this assertion be much against my will at venice though i own it be the only great town where i can properly reside yet here i find so many vexation that in spite of all my philosophy and -lrb- what be more powerful -rrb- my phlegm i be oftener out of humor than among my plant and poultry in the country i can not help be concern at the success of iniquitous scheme and grieve for oppressed merit you who see these thing every day think I as unreasonable in make they matter of complaint as if i seriously lament the change of season you should consider i have live almost a hermit ten year and the world be as new to I as to a country girl transport from wale to coventry i know i ought to think my lot very good that can boast of some sincere friend among stranger old age will in the long run have its way lady mary as pleasantly loquacious as ever find the manual labor of write not always to be endure and she try the experiment of dictate she correspondence thus far -lrb- she write to sir jame steuart from padua

write as fast as i talk and yet you see there be so many mistake it want a comment longer than my letter to explain my insignificant meaning and i have fatigue my poor eye more with correct it than i should have do in scribble two sheet of paper you will think perhaps from this idle attempt that i have some fluxion on my sight no such matter i have suffer myself to be persuade by such sort of argument as those by which people be induce to strict abstinence or to take physic fear paltry fear found on vapor rise from the heat which be now excessive and have so far debilitate my miserable nerve that i submit to a present displeasure by way of precaution against a future evil that possibly may never happen i have this to say in my excuse that the evil be of so horrid a nature i own i feel no philosophy that could support I under it and no mountain girl ever tremble more at one of whitfield 's pathetic lecture than i do at the word blindness though i know all the fine thing that may be say for consolation in such a case : but i know also they would not operate on my constitution ` why then ' -lrb- say my wise monitor -rrb- ` will you persist in reading or write seven hour in

do and literally give I a box on the ear she be very lively all she sens perfect she language as imperfect as ever she avarice greater she entertain I at first with nothing but the dearness of provision at helvoet with nothing but a italian a french and a prussian all men-servant and something she call a _ old _ secretary but whose age till he appear will be doubtful she receive all the world who go to homage she as queen-mother and cram they into this kennel the duchess of hamilton who come in just after I be so astonished and divert that she could not speak to she for laugh she say that she leave all she clothes at venice i really pity lady bute what will the progress be of such a commencement lady mary rent a house in great george street hanover square whither she daughter and grandchild come often occasionally she go about and from time to time would grace a assembly with she presence horace walpole see she at some gathering dress in yellow velvet and sable with a decent lace head and a black hood almost like a veil over she face he prognostication that she would by she interference and demand for job make life hideous for lord and lady bute prove to be unfounded and he have the grace to say she be much more discreet than i expect and meddle with nothing but he could not refrain from say that she be woefully tedious in she narration lady mary be suffer from cancer

fortune be believe to have be inconsiderable except for some valuable jewel walpole have one last gibe : with she usual maternal tenderness and usual generosity she have leave she son one guinea the gibe be unworthy because walpole know quite well the career of that son who anyhow be sufficiently provide for it may be that it be the pricking of walpole 's conscience for this last outburst that make he later administer a stern rebuke to lady craven i be sorry to hear madam that by you account lady mary wortley be not so accurate and faithful as modern traveller the invaluable art of inoculation which she bring from constantinople so dear to all admirer of beauty and to which we owe perhaps the preservation of yours stamp she a universal benefactress and as you rival she in poetic
