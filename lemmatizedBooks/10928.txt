but to the astonishment of every one in no way injure during one of he shooting expedition the maharajah and he companion decide one night that they would go out on foot at the very break of dawn and see the animal world in the jungle and they be well reward for they adventurous spirit in a glade of the forest they have a magnificent sight of a large herd of bison peacefully grazing in the dewy grass they could hear tiger and bear pass back through the jungle to they den in the deeper forest and as the man stand there admire the grand head of the bison a monstrous tiger pass along quite

of the young snake and tell he friend what the heap be when they come closer they could see that the long slimy body be all twist together and with a uncanny feeling the sportsman watch these serpent uncoil themselves from each other and glide away and disappear through the grass once after a long and fruitless day in the jungle the maharajah decide he would try he luck stalk some deer that he spy on the opposite side of a narrow strip of jungle he accordingly leave he elephant and begin to creep through the long dry bramble-choked grass with he rifle in he hand as he push he way through the thick jungle he fancy he hear a animal breathing and then something crackle intent on the deer before he he conclude that he have break a twig or a branch with the end of he rifle and push on as he emerge from the thicket on the opposite side from where he have enter he come face to face with a group of shepherd they stare at he in amazement and then recognize he as they maharajah fall at he foot in rapturous joy accustom as he be to demonstration from he people they abandon strike he as something unusual and he be about to question they when they exclame : hoozoor dharmabatar -lrb- you honor royal master -rrb- how do you come in safety through that jungle he smile at they wonderment and be about to chide they gently when they continue : a immense tiger have just slay one of we cow

darkening night the shooting camp be invariably pitch on the bank of a river or stream one evening two of the servant cross the shallow stream in front of the camp to enjoy some fishing they find a suitable place behind a mound and here they sit quietly watch they line the afternoon hour pass swiftly and the sun be near the horizon when they attention be simultaneously draw to a sound above they head look up to they horror they see a immense tiger just above they one of they shiver with terror and clutch he companion say in a hoarse whisper : we hour have come the other whisper back : keep

it take the lord of the jungle fully half a hour to drink he fill then as slowly and impressively the tiger turn from the stream and ascend the bank when he reach the top he stand there gaze before he either as if admire the scenery or contemplate a meal off one of the man the pair scarcely dare to breathe and wild scheme of take to they heel to gain the center of the stream and swim down the river shot through they brain at last the tiger slowly turn away from the river and disappear into the forest then after some time the frightened servant hurry across the stream back to camp and tell the
