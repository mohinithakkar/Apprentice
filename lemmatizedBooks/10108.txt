produce by greg lindahl a treatise of dauns wherin it be shew that they be as it be accessory and dependant -lrb- or thynge annex -rrb- to whoredome : where also by the way be touch and proue that _ playe be ioyne and knit togeather in a rancke or rowe with they _ i thessal 5 _ let eurie one possesse he vessel in holine and honor _ anno 1581 a treatise of dauns in which be shew that dauns bee intisemente to whoredome and that the abuse of playe ought not to be among christian i doubt not but that some into whose hande this little treatise shall come will thinke I to be at greate leasure that haue enterprise largely to leuie out and handle this argument : which to they seeming be not otherwise of great importaunce for be it that dauns be allow or condemn or el yet they be putt in the rowe of thinge indifferent man might easily iudge accord to they opinion that that should not bring great profit or hurt to we christian common wealth see that ther be diuer pointe of greater weight and consequence which trouble the spirit of manye learn man & make afraide the conscience of the weake and simple one : which poynte haue verye much nede to be open and make plaine rather then to trouble a man selfe to write agaynst playe and dauns furthermore man should be in very great forwardne if euery thinge be so well refourm that they be come euen unto dauns that be to say that all that which be corrupt and those abuse which beare the sway among christian be so cut off and this so sick a body againe so wel restore to he soundne and health that there should remayne nothing el but to debate the question of leap skipping and dauns ther will be find a other manner & sort of people who will make no accoumpte at all to mocke at this matter : as indeede the world be ful of mocker and man without godline without god and without religion now as concerninge these person they deserue no manner of aunsweare at al because they do as soone scoffe at the principall pointe of christian religion and that which directly concerneth the seruice of god as matter of lesse weight and importaunce wherefore i not much regard or caringe for the iudgement of such iudge will let they runne to the water with the bridle uppon they head or in they necke as they say but as touchinge the first because they bee not altogeather malicious and obstinate i hope that ha = uing aunswear they obiection and declare the reason which haue moue yea rather driuen I forward or inforse mee to descipher and sett out this matter they will iudge my labor not to haue bene altogeather unprofitable it be then in the first place to bee wish and desire that trouble beyng pacify and all dissention repress and put out the spirit and conscience of man should be assure and thorowly perswade of that which appertaineth to they saluation and indeede we lorde have stir and raise up so perfect a age in al science & know = ledge in which so many learn man and of excellent learning and knowledge haue so blessedly and diligently imploy they = selue to teach we the order and maner to liue well some after one sort and fashion and some after a other that those which be not yet satisfye can not or ought not to lay the fault in any but in themselue next all good man ought to wishe and desire that those which put they hande to -lrb- this be to say trauaile for -rrb- the reformation of maner should do it with such good argumente that there shoulde remayne or be leave but euen a very litle to be correct and amend and yet this wish & desire should not let or hinder the trauaile of such as do indeuor to pull up by the roote such herbe as be hurtful to the field of the lord be they neuer so small and little : and i do or which thing i labor to do in this little boke accord to the talente & grace which be geuen I from aboue adde also that if any do deeply & seasonably consider this matter i hope he shal not finde it so barren and of little edification that it ought to be dispise or troden under foote : for many man of quality -lrb- yea euen in the company of notable personage -rrb- of name and authority make no conscience to demaunde and aske whether it be yll do to daunce demaunding also a formall or playne parcell and text of scripture by which it may appeare that dauns be prohibit and forbid otherwise they think not that they do euill in daunse some other goe further and alledge or rather indeede abuse some peece of the scripture where it appeareth that the faithfull haue leap and daunse : they thinke verily that they haue founde the beane in the cake as though this be a proper couerture & cloke to couer the infection and filthine of they daunce seyng then that many be foulie & grosely deceaue in this behalfe and that possible for want of beyng sufficiently instruct and inform or teach touch this matter i haue bene so much the more willing to ease they in this question by how much i hope to profit in common that be to do good to the greatest multitude as also be willing hereby to satisfy some which haue earnestly and instantly require it at my hande now to answeare they which demaund and aske a playne peece or text of scripture in which dauns should be forbid let they know that there be many wicked and euill thinge which be not euidently and playnly express in the scripture to be forbid notwithstanding they bee of the same kynd and nature or else dependence of some thynge which be therein express and under which they ought to be comprehend or el when the contrary of these thing be praise and commend we be sufficiently teach and instruct to cast they away as thing condemn by the holy ghost because ther be one & the selfe same reason in contrary thing i will place & put in the order or rowe of the first playe and dauns : i meane such playe as by which man draweth or getteth to hymselfe he neighboure money it be true that wee fynd not in the scripture these word thou shalt not play but wee find indeede these worde thou shale not steale : now that to gayne or get a other man money at play shoulde not be a most manifest & plaine thieuery : none of sound iudgement will denie it for hee which have wonne or get it by what title or right can he say that such money be he : verily when we get or win the money or the goods of we brother it must be with the sweate of we face or browe & that we laboure bringe he some profite that be to be profitable unto he : and euen as we receaue he money or good : so must hee thorow we diligence and trauaile receaue some profite but when a man have get he money by the hazard or chaunce as a man would say of play i pray you what commoditye and profite commeth to he thereby : we must then conclude that this be a kind of theft : which although it be not playnly express in the holye scripture yet neuerthele it ought to bee refer to the eight commaundement in which it be sayd thou shalt not steale the like be of dauns which wee may put in the first & second row or order for although wee haue not any playne and expresse forbid where it should be sayd thou shalt not daunse yet we haue a formall and plaine commaundement thou shalt not commit adultery or whoredome : to which the dauns ought to be refer -lrb- sidenote : a definition of dauns -rrb- now if one would aske I what dauns be : i wil answeare that consider the sway which they haue at this day amongest we cristian they bee nothing else but impudent shamele and dissolute gesture by which the lust of the flesh be awake stir by and inflamed as wel in man as in woman -lrb- sidenote : deut 22 titus 2 -rrb- bat if honesty modesty and soberne be require in apparaile & adorning of men selue as we see that it be commend and commaund in deuteronomie & seing that s paule also in he epistle to titus willeth that there should be among we a sober and holy countenaunce singularly and specially in woman which ordinarily be very curious in they garmente it be certayne and sure that there be some poyson or venym hide under the grasse -lrb- sidenote : i pet 3 -rrb- and because it be so s peter in he first canonicall or generall epistle forbiddeth that woman should appeare shew and sett out themselue by theyr apparayle and neatne add that in many other place of the sayd holy scripture the diuersity and difference in attire and garmente be condemn as prouoking to whoredome and slipperine by more stronge reason the dissolute and lewde gesture which be practice by the proper and owne member of a man bodye ought to be cutt of and banish from among christian -lrb- sidenote : jud 23 -rrb- and s jude exhorteth we to haue yea and that in hatred the garment which be defile by the flesh meaning under this figure & manner of speech all inticemente & allurement which might draw we to any pollution uncleanne and fylthyne : what ought we to iudge in the excellency -lrb- as a man woulde say -rrb- value and estimation of the flesh itselfe which be so polluted and defyle that it bringeth forth and setteth out the pollution and filthine thereof by villanous and dishonest gesture -lrb- sidenote : ephe 4 29 colo 3 -rrb- and when s paule in he epistle to the ephesian and colossian forbiddeth we all corrupt infected and filthy speech or woorde be there not at the least as much or as greate occasion : -lrb- sidenote : the eie -rrb- yea more or greater to condemne dissolute and lewd gesture : for as concern dishonest and unmeete woorde they be gather or receaue with we eare onely but as for villanous & dishonest gesture they be so many obiect or thinge set before we eye as if one shoulde set before we a paint table in which all villany infection and filthine should be liuely pourtrait and set out -lrb- sidenote : mat 5 -rrb- now that the sighte of all we sens be it which have most force & strength to make we incline to uncleanne and filthyne i will haue none other iudge but we lord himselfe when he have utter and speak with he mouth that hee which have cast he eye uppon he neighbor wife for to couet desyre and with she be already a whoremonger in he hart : -lrb- sidenote : i john 2 -rrb- behold also wherefore s john in he first canonicall or generall epistle putteth or ioyneth with the concupiscence or lust of the flesh the concupiscence & lust of the eye finally when s paule placeth or putteth soberne modestie and temperaunce among the effect and fruite which the grace of god ought to bring forth in we doth hee not sufficiently forbid all dissolutene lightne outrage and disorder as wel in we manners as in we gesture & other manner of doings but for as much as all the former argumente be found and ground upon that definition of dauns which i haue before geuen and make and that some man might deny it I we must answeare that which they haue bene accustomed to obiect against it first of al i haue hear of some which denye dauns to be shamelesse and dissolute gesture because that when they daunse they do it not but for a recreation of themselue and bodily exercise yea that they use it as a certayne thing which of itselfe be neither good nor euill but let such people be answear after this manner that be to say that they affection can not so chaunge the nature of the thing that it doth not alwaies kepe and hold fast he proper or owne name we see that if one enter or goe into a brothel house or stewe yea without affection or mind to commit whoredome ther yet neuerthelesse the place shal not cease or leaue of to be call a stewe or brothell house likewise let they say that in daunse they haue not any shamelesse or vilanous mynde & affection which notwithstanding may not well easily or lightly be beleeue yet so it be yet daunses cease not to be call shamelesse gesture but what : the question be not onely of they person but of a thing which ought not to be in any use among christian and moreeuer this be not all to haue respect or regard onely of a mans owne selfe but we must loke also to we neighbor who be he which dare assure or warrant he selfe & other that when he daunseth or after that he have daunse he have not prevoked & stir up the lust of the flesh in some one of the stander by : but yet it be so the effect & sute declareth it because that the daughter and sister of the county or earle of a be so enamoured or rauish with the loue of a very simple and base gentleman whom she have seene daunse in the courte and it print so wel that be toke such deepe impression and roote in she hart and understanding that against the will of father and mother parente and friend shee maried he now let we come to the poynt or matter what prouok this young gentlewoman beyng rych wise learn fayre & of good countenaunce to loue a base man of litle discretion unlearned cockbrained yea which with great payne or much adoe knoweth to write he owne name and besyde or moreouer very deform in face & countenaunce if not to daunce onely and to see in he some small experience & skill to runne at the ringe : man will say that shee shew not hir wifedome in that shee choose she husbande for daunse onely : but what be that the flesh doth not intise and allure with he snare & bayte : for albeit ther be so much difference betweene the two party as betweene fayre gold and leade yea so much indeed yet by she wifedome shee keep he backe or make he to refrayne from striking fighting slaying and cast the house out at the windowe as we say for the least flee which come before he eie : yet so it be that he obtayne and get she by the meane abouesayde : notwithstanding if ther fall out no worse by daunse this be somewhat to be support or bear withall but now if he reply and say hee careth not or regardeth not what other man think seyng hee have no maner of euil or naughty meaninge in himselfe i answere that here we see a offense geuen and the very bond of loue break and violate for put the case or graunt that daunsing be put & reckon among thing indifferent in respect and consideration of it selfe be it meete or dutifull that for a indifferent and light thing a man should geue a occasion of fall or stumble to he neighboure : but so farr of be it that dauns should bee put in the rome and number of thinge indifferent that euery one ought to make a accompt of they and to holde they altogeather wicked and unlawful : in so much that i send all they againe back to they owne conscience which say that in daunse they haue not any impudent & shamelesse affection for the thing beyng so vilanous and so infected of he own nature as daunsing be it be impossible that he which useth it should not bee infected neither more nor lesse : then it be impossible to touch any filthine and not to bee once uncleane infected and defyled -lrb- sidenote : the beginning of dauns -rrb- and that it be so let we somewhat or a little serch and seeke out the beginning of dauns and we shal fynd that man can not geue they a better nor more apt and proper definition then that which have bene bring heretofore for if wee would in this matter refer we selue to they which haue write of the antiquity as well of the grecian as of the romain yea and that to some poet wee shall fynd how that dauns haue take they begynning from pagan and heathen man which haue then first use they when they do sacrifyce to they god for bee plunge into very thick & as it be palpable dark ness after that they have forge and advise god accord to they owne fantasy they think and suppose that they should bee delighted and pleased with the selfe same delighte and pleasure wherein or wherewith they delight themselue whereupon wee neede not doubt hereof but that it be the deuil which do guide and leade they whom al superstition false religion and erronious doctrine pleaseth aboue all thinge speciallye when such a toy and trifle be accompany with al wantonnesse and villanie now that such manner of do that be to say custome of pagan and heathen man have bene follow and practice by the child of israel after that hauing sacrifice to the golden calf they gaue themselue to play the scripture assureth we thereof in the ii chapter of exodus afterward man begin to daunce in open playe spectacles and shewe from which notwithstanding the people be driuen prohibit and forbid for feare lest they should be constrain there to behold and see a unhonest and unseemly thinge for they fere or kynd afterwarde when in a small space of tyme all honesty and shame do begin to vanish and weare away then men daughter and woman be admit and receaue to dauns : and yet withall it be true that this be a part by themselue and in priuie place finally a short time after man haue so far disorder themselue and break the bonde and limit of honesty that man & woman haue daunsed togeather or as wee would say in mingle mangle and namely and specially in feaste and banquet in so much that we see that this wicked and ungodlye custome have stretch forth it selfe euen unto we and have yet or already the sway at this daye more then euer it have beholde the beginninge of daunses togeather with they fruit and property which if they be well consider and deeply waighed by sound and rype understandinge it will not or shall not bee think straunge & maruailous that i

by the estate lately holden at orlean in the young age or minority of charle the 9 a article in which amongest other thinge all iudge be forbid to permit or suffer any publicke dauns uppon the sondaye and other solonme holy daye but in the first place it be to be desire and wish that this ordinance might be straitly obserued and keep secondlye that it be more generall that be to say that it do wholly and altogeather forbidd dauns as wicked and unlawful thinge : for if we be christian indeede we ought not to suffer that some pore and blinde pagan should surmount and ouercome we in honesty & modesty we fynd that amongest the romain they which be ouermuch geuen to daunsinge cary or bare with they so greate a note or marke of infamy & sklaunder that they oftentimes account and esteme they unworthy to exercise or haue a publicke and honorable office : as appeareth by the censure punishment and correction of domitian who for thy only cause cast out of the senate a citizen of rome as unmeete and unworthy of such a degree of honor saluit in he oration against catilina speaking of a certaine woman name sempronium sayeth that shee could daunse more delicately and fynely then do appertaine to a honest and good woman cicero much reprocheth and upbraydeth yea and constantly obiecteth to gabinius the study and practisinge of dauns as a infamous thing he both like in he philippicke agaynst antonius and in the oration of durena he sayth that a sober man neuer daunseth neither a part or priuily neyther in a honest & moderate banquet unlesse perhaps hee be unwyse or out

sauing that this man that be to say the daunser be then onely mad when he daunse and the other be so all he life long from thence commeth the latine prouerbe that daunser play the foole or wanton but it be with measure here wee euidently and playnly see in what estimation and regard dauns be among pagan and infidel which trulye could not iudge otherwise therof i speake of they which have the best and more sound iudgement and which be able to weigh and consider as well the dauns themselue as they so pretious fruite and excellent effecte for if it be yet after feaste and banquet man commonly set or geue themselue to daunse and after that man be full of wyne and good meate they bee then prouok & prick forwarde by the pricke of the flesh to what end serue such manner of gesture if not to make manifest & set out they intemperency now if man would refer it or bringe it to bodily exercise this would be very folishly do for the body of she owne health requireth not to be so shake toss and as a man woulde say hunt after meate for feare to hinder digestion as the phisition place it amonge they rule of diet moreouer see yet man may exercise themselue in many other maner and sorte of exercise hee as mee thinketh openly sheweth yet he have not modesty nor temperance nor he health it selfe in estimation yet be he estemeth & regardeth not & c which choseth daunse for he exercise dauns then be neuer heretofore otherwise account of nether be at this present otherwise think of then mere vilany & a most certaine plaine and evident testimony of the filthine & intemperancy of they which delighted themselue therin now that so it be the prouerbe sayeth de la panse vient la danse : from the panch commeth the daunce : -lrb- sidenote : math 14 mark 6 -rrb- and if we dare ioine therto whoredom they elder daughter we shal find that she followeth after immediately which thing we shall easily fynd if we consider the most ordinary & common effecte of daunse what be the cause that herode so lightly promise to that goodlye daunser salome the daughter of herodia euen the one halfe of he realme and kingdome but that by she vilanous and shameles daunsing shee have stir up and set on fyre he concupiscence and lust who be already a villanous adulterer and infamous whoremonger so that the delighte and pleasure which he take therin provoke he to be willing to make so excessiue and unmeasurable a recompence : moreouer let we marke more narrowly in genesis that which be write of dina the daughter of jacob and we shall find that dauns be partly the cause of she rauishing or deflouring for albeit that in that place there be no expresse mention make of dauns yet so it be that when it be sayde that dina go to see the daughter of the countrey or land there be some appearance and likelihod that the daughter have this custome to assemble themselue togeather in daunse and that to the end that in shew the nimblene of they body they bewty and wery conceyt they might bee coveted and desyred of young man as indeede dina be by sichem and in this we tyme and age do not man daily see many such thinge which dauns bring with they : the example by mee heretofore bring forth and allege ought to serue for a example to all great lord to withdraw they daughter from such baite but set all the rest aside do wee not see that duncing have cost this holy man and great prophet of god so deare that it have take away from he the head from aboue he shoulder by the way or meane of daunse the child of israell be willing to geue honor to a ydole to a calfe of gold to a dead thing and which they themselue have melt & frame after the imitation & manner of pagan which in such a sort & fashion serue they god bee not these thing sufficient to make a man flie dauns & to prouoke a christian man to haue they in abomination & to abhore they as thing which haue ordinarilye and commonlye serue to idolatry and haue prouoked to whoredome and haue chaunge and alter many daughter of good house and stocke from the loue and fauor of they parente and finally haue cause infinite murther : murther i say for in all the 3 peece of scripture before alledged we euer fynd ther the death of some in the daunse before herod the death of john baptist in the rape or rauishing of dina sichem he father & all he sobiecte die there in the worshipping of the golden calfe where the child of israel daunsed and leap so nimblie cherefully & merily before that they belly be full there die then aboute three thousande in recompence of they ioy and gladne if then we would consider the issue and effecte which come from dauns & the fayre or goodly fruite which they bring forth we would neuer thinke but that the heare would stand upright upon we very heade when the question be of daunse it remaineth now to answeare they who would serue themselue with certaine parcel and peece of the scripture in which mention be make that the faithfull people haue daunsed -lrb- sidenote : exo 15 20 -rrb- first they alledge that which be write in exodus that mary the prophetesse the sister of aaron who after that god have ouerwhelm and drown pharao & he army in the red sea toke a taberet in hir hand & be attend or wait upon by other woman song with they a songe to the lord : as also mose and the child of israel song another the like be founde in the booke of samuel after that dauid have slaine goliath that many woman come out of all the towne of israel singing and daunsing before king saule with tabor rebecke and other instrumente of harmonie or musicke but when these which loue to leape and daunse see there be here speak not only of dauns but also of taberet and other musicall instrumente do thinke that they be already in the hall of leapinge or skip and do daunse accord to the note and measure that the minstrel and piper wil sound or play to they : inferringe that the holy scripture before allege maketh for they and that by it dauns be approue they be indeede fouly deceaue and very farre of from they reckoninge because that reckoning without the host it be meete for they to reckon twyse for it be most certaine that there be as much difference betweene they dauns and those which holy man haue use as there be betwene mariage and fornication i meane betweene chastity & whoredome and euen as it be no maner of way permit or suffer to committe whoredome so we dauns and the usage of they may not be allow nor receiue but to cut it short that be to say to be short wee can not gather that any appearaunce or shew of euil or any signe of watonne or dissolutene be euer find in the dauns of holy man but altogeather contrariwise they therein behaue themselue with such honor fear and reuerence towarde god the whole matter it selfe beyng accompany with so great honesty and sobernesse as nothinge more and in which men deede 3 pointe be to be consider and mark which can not be at any hand find in the prophane and wicked dauns of we tyme first the occasion which thrust they forwarde to do it be such a great ioy which they have conceaue of the fauoure which god have shew to they that they coulde not conceale or kepe hidden but neede must manifest it & let it abroad by all the meane and waye that they could inuent or deuise -lrb- sidenote : psal 68 -rrb- which thinge also dauid declareth in the sixty and eight psalme say the lord have geuen a argument occasion or matter unto the woman who also haue song accordingly : it be then a solomne -lrb- as a man would say -rrb- or publicke thanke geuing which they rendr or gaue unto god singing or set forth he to be the author of they deliuerance what fellowship agreement or likene can there bee between the daunce of these holy father and these which wee behold nowe at this day among christian be it a question when man daunce to acknowledge or confesse the grace & goodness of god to thanke he therfore reioice themselue in he : when the lusty and fyne man should holde a young damosel or a woman by the hand and keep he measure he shal remoue himselfe whirle about & shake he legge alofte -lrb- which the daunser call crosse capring -rrb- for pleasure doth not she in the meane while make a good threede playing at the mori on she behalfe : but i pray you : what can ther by there of god of he worde of of honestye in such folishne : i holde my tounge that be i speake nothing of they worde amorous deuise or deuise of loue wanton communication or speech or marke only knowen to the ladye or gentlewoman it be true that a man will say to I that he must reioyce and be mery which thing also i graunt but yet not with a worldly dissolute and leuse ioy the seconde pointe be that euen as the people of israell be instruct in the seruice of god by very many cerimony and outward manners or fashion so when they would honor he and geue he some duety which they do owe they do not content themselue to do it with the harte and with the mouth but by and by they add and ioyne there withall some outwarde gesture to witne that which be within euen unto this present or hetherto we haue founde very little affinitye or agreement betweene the dauns of the auncient patriarch and of good and religious people and these which we use at this present or in these daye it be certaine and true that the daunser of we tyme would very fayne make themselue equall with they and be in the selfe same degree of honor : saue notwithstanding that they content not they selue to haue a shamele and villanous harte but they will also discouer and lay open they own shame & villany by dissolute gesture the third and last poynt sheweth we the fashion of the nation or people of the east the outward gesture and custome receaue among they contrary herein to the westerne people the reason be because euery nation have alwayes some proper and particuler inclination which another have not moreouer those which draw nigh unto the east and south be by reason of the heate mor easie to moue themselue and consequently to make or shew gesture then they be which be in the east or north who by reason of the cold be more heauy & weighty : from whence it commeth that the italian in he communication or speech but especially if he speake with a affection or good hart intermingleth and useth so many gesture that if a english man should see he a farre of not hear he word would iudge he out of he wit or el play some comedy upon a scaffold let a man on the other side beholde a almain or germain in the pulpit and hee would thinke he benum and impotent or lame in all he member or parte of he bodie and to confirme this lett we beholde and call to remembraunce how the auncient romain be remoue farr from the opinion and mind of the grek these that be the greeke esteem daunse verye much and all these which know howe to helpe and comfort themselue with a instrument of musicke the other that be the romain make very small account of both daunsyng and lesse of the daunser themselue here appeareth the difference of climate and of such as dwell under those climate from thence it commeth that the people of the east parte do breake and rent in peece they garmente when they have understanding of euil newe wherefore they do lye weltering and tumblinge upon the ground put on sackcloth put on ash or dust upon they head yea then when they pretend to shew some repentance and to manifest or set out a inward greefe : all which thinge would bee founde and think rediculous foolish and to bee laugh at amonge nation & people on this side of they : and if that woman should take tabouret in they hande as we read that the woman of israel haue do : would not man thinke that they be out of they witt : which notwihstanding be not find in think straung among the israelite because this be the custome of the nation and people it be true that a man may also referr the tabouret & other instrumente of musicke to the ceremony of moys law : which ceremony haue bene abolish at the comming of jesus christ in so much that at this day where we be under the gospell wee must use the same more soberly and sparingly & with greater modesty : but all that have nothinge common with the dauns of this present time or age these three poynte be dispatch we fynd and see cleerely what affinity & agreement there be betweene these twoo maner of dauns -lrb- sidenote : 2 sam 6 -rrb- we daunser do yet further alledge a other parcel or peece of the scripture write in the booke of the kinge where it be say that dauid leap and daunse before the arke of the lord -lrb- sidenote : mark this you that folowe daunsing schole -rrb- but so far of be it that this serueth they to mayntayne they dauns that i would not wish to haue a more proper fitt playne and agreeable place to confute they for if dauid have have a like affection in he daunse as they haue in theirs that be to say to please the gentlewoman and lady as we daunser endeuor studye & deuise to please they minion and flattering dame michol he wife have neuer mock he he might then haue daunse more pleasantly and after a fashion more agreeable to the flesh : and for trueth hee might haue do it beyng light or nimble by nature and able or meete to do al thinge but the answeare which he make he wife michol very well declareth that hee pretend or purpose no other thinge but to set out by outward gesture the greatne of the ioy which he have conceaue in he harte because of the presence of god this be -lrb- sayd he -rrb- before the lord which i haue do in this behalfe : it appeareth by this aunsweare that he affection be not in or on the world and that he care not much for the iudgement of michol and of all other worldling because he would not please they nor satisfy or feede they fine and goodly eye by he daunse wherfore we must conclude that dauid condemneth the worldline of he wife and such other as shee : yea in that that shee be punish by barrenne which follow theruppon it be a evident argument that god approue or allow the do and say of the prophet -lrb- sidenote : note you that delight in you art of daunsing -rrb- now if al they which make daunsinge they god would imprint this in they hart and understand they should receaue & use the same rather to they condemnation then to be so much without aforehead that be to say shamele that they woulde abuse the scripture to couer they uncleanne & infection for this be a most detestable & abhominable sacriledge to make the unspeakeable truth of god to serue we wicked and most shamefull affection adde thereunto that he will greeuously & sharply punish all such scoffer and prodigall person which do so much prophane the maiesty and excellency of he name and that diuinity which be contayne and express in the holy scripture -lrb- sidenote : isa 520 -rrb- moreouer when we so disguise and chaunge the
