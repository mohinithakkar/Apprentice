pay write under the pseudonym of george owen baxter and subsequently in book form under the title the rangeland avenger in 1924 1 of the four man hal sinclair be the vital spirit in the actual labor of mine the mighty arm and tireless back of quade have be a treasure for knowledge of camping hunting cooking and all the lore of the trail lowrie stand as a valuable resource and sandersen be the dreamy resolute spirit who have hope for gold in those mountain until he come to believe he hope he have gather these three stalwart to help he to he purpose and if he live he would lead yet other to failure hope never die in this tall gaunt man with a pale-blue eye the color of the horizon dust with the first morning mist he be the very spirit of lose cause full of apprehension forebode superstition a hunch might make he journey five hundred mile a snort of he horse could make he give up the trail and turn back but hal sinclair be the antidote for sandersen he be still a boy at thirty -- big handsome thoughtless with a heart as clean as new snow he throat be so parch by that day 's ride that he dare not open he lip to sing as he usually do he compromise by hum song new and old and when he companion curse he noise he contented himself with talk softly to he horse amply reward when the pony occasionally lift a tired ear to the familiar voice failure and fear be the blight on the spirit of the rest they have find no gold worth look at twice and linger too long in the search they have rashly turn back on a shortcut across the desert two day before the blow have fall they find sawyer 's water hole nearly dry just a little pool in the center with cake dead mud all around it they drain that water dry and strike on since then the water famine have gain a hold on they another water hole have not a drop in it now they could only aim at the cool blue mockery of the mountain before they pray that the pony would last to the foothill still hal sinclair could sing softly to he horse and to himself and though he companion curse he singing they bless he for it in they heart otherwise the white listen silence of the desert would have crush they otherwise the lure of the mountain would have madden they and make they push on until the horse would have die within five mile of the labor otherwise the pain in they slowly swell throat would have take they reason for thirst in the desert carry the pang of several death -- death from fire suffocation and insanity no wonder the three scowl at hal sinclair when he draw he revolver my horse be gun-shy he say but i 'll bet the rest of you i can drill a horn off that skull before you do of course it be a foolish challenge lowrie be the gun expert of the party indeed he have reach that dangerous point of efficiency with firearm where a man be apt to reach for he gun to decide a argument now lowrie follow the direction of sinclair 's gesture it be the skull of a steer with enormous branch horn the rest of the skeleton be sink into the sand do not talk fool talk say lowrie save you wind and you ammunition you may need 'em for yourself son that grim suggestion make sandersen and quade shudder but a grin spread on the broad ugly face of lowrie and sinclair merely shrug he shoulder i 'll try you for a dollar nope five dollar nope you be afraid to try lowrie it be a smile challenge but lowrie flush he have a childish pride in he skill with weapon all right kid get ready he bring a colt smoothly into he hand and balanced it dexterously swing it back and forth between he eye and the target to make ready for a snap shot ready cry hal sinclair excitedly lowrie 's gun speak first and it be the only one that be fire for sinclair 's horse be gun-shy indeed at the explosion he pitch straight into the air with a squeal of mustang fright and come down buck the other forget to look for the result of lowrie 's shot they rein they horse away from the pitch broncho disgustedly sinclair be a fool to use up the last of he mustang 's strength in this manner but hal sinclair have forget the journey ahead he be rioting in the new excitement cheer the broncho to new exertion and it be in the midst of that flurry of action that the great blow fall the horse stick he right forefoot into a hole to the eye of the other it seem to happen slowly the mustang be halt in the midst of a leap tug at a leg that seem glue to the ground and then buckle suddenly and collapse on one side they hear that awful muffle sound of splinter bone and then the scream of the tortured horse but they give no heed to that hal sinclair in the fall have be pin beneath he mount the huge strength of quade suffice to budge the writhe mustang lowrie and sandersen draw sinclair 's pinion right leg clear and stretch he on the sand it be lowrie who shoot the horse you have do a brown turn say sandersen fiercely to the prostrate figure of sinclair four man and three hoss a fine partner you be sinclair shut up say hal do something for that foot of mine lowrie cut the boot away dexterously and turn out the foot it be painfully twist to one side and lay limp on the sand do something say sinclair groan the three look at he at the dead horse at the white-hot desert at the distant blue mountain what the devil can we do you have spoil all we chance sinclair ride on then and forget I but tie up that foot before you go i can not stand it silently with ugly look they obey secretly every one of the three be say to himself that this folly of sinclair 's have ruin all they chance of get free from the sand alive they look across at the skull of the steer it be still there very close it seem to have grow larger with a horrible significance and each instinctively put a man 's skull beside it bleached and white with shadow eye quade do the actual bandaging of sinclair 's foot drawing tight above the ankle so that some of the circulation be shut off but it ease the pain and now sinclair sit up i be sorry he say mighty sorry boy there be no answer he see by they lowered eye that they be hate he he feel it in the savage grip of they hand as they lift he and put he into quade 's saddle quade be the largest and it be mutely accept that he should be the first to walk while sinclair ride it be accept by all except quade that be to say that big man stride beside he horse lift he eye now and then to glare remorselessly at sinclair it be bitter work walk through that sand the heel crunch into it throw a strain heavily on the back of the thigh and then the ball of the foot slip back in the midst of a stride also the labor raise the temperature of the body incredibly with no wind stir it be suffocate and the day be barely begin barely two hour before the sun have be merely a red ball on the edge of the desert now it be low in the sky but bitterly hot and they mournful glance presage the horror that be come in the middle of the day deadly silence fall on that group they take they turn by the watch half a hour at a time walk and then change horse and as each man take he turn on foot he cast one long glance of hatred at sinclair he be begin to know they for the first time they be chance acquaintance the whole trip have be undertake by he on the spur of the moment and as far as lay in he cheery thoughtless nature he have come to regret it the work of the trail have teach he that he be mismate in this company and the first stern test be strip the mask from they he see three ugly nature three small cruel soul it come sandersen 's turn to walk maybe i could take a turn walk suggest sinclair it be the first time in he life that he have have to shift any burden onto the shoulder of another except he brother and that be different ah how different he send up one brief prayer for riley sinclair there be a man who would have walk all day that he brother might ride and at the end of the day that man of iron would be as fresh as those who have ride moreover there would have be no question no spite but a free give mutely he swear that he would hereafter judge all man by the stern and honorable spirit of riley and then that sad offer : maybe i could take a turn walk sandersen i could hold on to a stirrup and hop along some way lowrie and quade sneer and sandersen retort fiercely : shut up you know it be not possible but i ought to call you bluff he have no answer for it be not possible the twisted foot be a steady torture in another half hour he ask for water as they pause for sandersen to mount and lowrie to take he turn on foot sandersen snatch the canteen which quade reluctantly pass to the injured man look here say sandersen we get to split up on this you sit there and ride and take it easy I and the rest have to go through hell you take some of the hell yourself you ride but we 'll have the water and they be not much of it leave at that sinclair glance helplessly at the other they face be set in stern agreement slowly the sun crawl up to the center of the sky and stick there for endless hour it seem pour down a fiercer heat and the foothill still waver in blue outline that mean distance -- terrible distance out of the east come a cloud of dust the restless eye of sandersen see it first and a harsh shout of joy come from the other quade be walk he lift he arm to the cloud of dust as if it be a vision of mercy to hal sinclair it seem that cold water be already run over he tongue and over the hot torment of he foot but after that first cry of hoarse joy a silence be on the other and gradually he see a shadow gather it be not wagon say lowrie bitterly at length and it be not rider it come too fast for that and it be not the wind it come too slow but it be not man you can lay to that still they hope against hope until the grow cloud part and lift enough for they to see a band of wild horse sweep along at a steady lope they sight the man and veer swiftly to the leave a moment later there be only a thin trail of fly dust before the four three pair of eye turn on sinclair and silently curse he as if this be he fault those horse be aim at water he say can not we follow 'em they be aim for a hole fifty mile away no we can not follow 'em they start on again and now after that cruel moment of hope it be redouble labor quade be cursing thickly with every other step when it come he turn to ride he draw lowrie to one side and they converse long together with side glance at sinclair vaguely he guess the trend of they conversation and vaguely he suspect they treacherous meanness yet he dare not speak even have he pride permit it be the same story over again when lowrie walk quade ride aside with sandersen and again with the wolfish side glance they eye the injured man while they talk at the next halt they face he sandersen be the spokesman we have about make up we mind hal he say deliberately that you get to be drop behind for a time we be go on to find water when we find it we 'll come back and get you understand sinclair moisten he lip but say nothing then sandersen 's voice grow screechy with sudden passion say do you want three man to die for one besides what good could we do you do not mean it declare sinclair sandersen you do not mean it not alone out here you boy can not leave I out here strand might as well shoot I all be silent sandersen look to lowrie and the latter stare at the sand it be quade who act step to the side of sinclair he lift he easily in he powerful arm and lower he to the sand now keep you nerve he advise we be come back he stumble a little over the word it be all of we or none of we he say come on boy _ my _ conscience be clear they turn they horse hastily to the hill and when the voice of sinclair ring after they not one dare turn he head partner for the sake of all the work we have do together -- do not do this in a shudder unison they spur they horse and raise the weary brute into a gallop the voice fade into a wail behind they and still they do not look back for that matter they dare not look at one another but press on they eye rivet to the hill once lowrie turn he head to mark the position of the sun once sandersen in the grip of some passion of remorse or of fear of death bow he head with a strange moan but aside from that there be no sound or sign between they until hardly a hour and a half after leave sinclair they find water at first they think it be a mirage they turn away from it by mutual assent but the horse have scented drink and they become unmanageable five minute later the animal be up to they knee in the muddy water and the man be flounder breast deep drinking drinking drinking after that they sit about the brink stare at one another in a stunned fashion there seem no joy in that delivery for some reason i guess sinclair will be a pretty happy gent when he see we come back say sandersen smile faintly there be no response from the other for a moment then they begin to justify themselves hotly it be you idea quade why curse you soul be not you glad to take the idea be you go to blame it on to I what be the blame ask lowrie be not we go to bring he water suppose he ever tell we leave he we would have to leave these part pronto he 'll never tell we 'll swear he if he do talk i 'll stop he pretty sudden say lowrie tap he holster significantly will you what if he put that brother of he on you trail lowrie swallow hard well -- he begin but say no more they mount in a new silence and take the back trail slowly not until the evening begin to fall do they hurry for fear the darkness would make they lose the position of they comrade when they be quite near the place the semidarkness have come and quade begin to shout in he tremendous voice then they would listen and sometimes they hear a echo or a voice like a echo always at a great distance maybe he be start crawl and go the wrong way he should have sit still say lowrie because -- oh lord break in sandersen i know it i be see it all the way he point to a figure of a man lie on he back in the sand with he arm throw out crosswise they dismount and find hal sinclair dead and cold perhaps the insanity of thirst have take he perhaps he have figure it out methodically that it be better to end thing before the madness come there be a certain stern repose about he face that favor this supposition he seem much older but whatever the reason hal sinclair have shoot himself cleanly through the head you see that face ask lowrie with curious quiet take a good look you 'll see it ag ` in a superstitious horror seize on sandersen what d'you mean lowrie what d'you mean i mean this the way he look now he be a ringer for riley sinclair and you mark I we be all go to see riley sinclair face to face before we die he 'll never know say quade the stolid who know except we and will one of we ever talk he laugh at the idea i dunno whisper sandersen i dunno gent but we do a awful thing and we be go to pay -- we be go to pay 2 they trail divide after that sandersen and quade start back for sour creek at the parting of the way lowrie 's last word be for sandersen you start this party sandersen if they be any hell come out of it it 'll fall chiefly on you remember because i get one of you own hunch after that lowrie head straight across the mountain travel as much by instinct as by landmark he be one of those man who be bear to the trail he stop in at four pine and there he tell the story on which he and sandersen and quade have agree four pine would spread that tale by telegraph and riley sinclair would be advise beforehand lowrie have no desire to tell the gunfighter in person of the passing of hal sinclair certainly he would not be the first man to tell the story he reach colma late in the afternoon and a group instantly form around he on the veranda of the old hotel four pine have indeed spread the story and the crowd want verification he reply as smoothly as he could hal sinclair have break he leg in a fall from he horse and they have bind it up as well as they could they have tie he on he horse but he could not endure the pain of travel they stop nearly die from thirst mortification set in hal sinclair die in forty-eight hour after the halt four pine have accept the tale there have be more deadly story than this connect with the desert but pop hansen the proprietor draw lowrie to one side keep out of riley 's way for a while he be all het up he be fond of hal you know and he take this bad get a ugly way of ask question and -- the truth be the truth protest lowrie besides -- i know -- i know but jest make yourself scarce for a couple of day i 'll keep on go pop thanks never mind be not no hurry riley 's out of town and will not be back for a day or so but speak personal i would rather step into a nest of rattler than talk to riley the way he be feel now lowrie climb slowly up the stair to he room think very hard he know the repute of riley sinclair and he know the man to be even worse than reputation one of those stern soul who exact a eye for a eye -- and even a little more once in he room he throw himself on he bed after all there be no need for a panic no one would ever learn the truth to make surety doubly sure he would start early in the dawn and strike out for far trail the thought have hardly come to he when he dismiss it a flight would call down suspicion on he and riley sinclair would be the first to suspect in that case distance would not save he not from that hard and tireless rider to help compose he thought he go to the washstand and bath he hot face he be dry himself when there be a tap on the door can i come in ask a shrill voice he answer in the affirmative and a youngster step into the room you be lowrie yep they be a gent downstairs want you to come down and see he who be it i dunno we just move in from conway i can point he out to you on the street lowrie follow the boy to the window and there surround by half a dozen serious-faced man stand riley sinclair tall easy formidable the sight of sinclair fill lowrie with dismay push a silver coin into the hand of the boy he say : tell he -- tell he -- i be come right down as soon as the boy disappear lowrie run to the window which open on the side of the house when he look down he hope flee at one time there have be a lean-to shed run along that side of the building by the roof of it he could have get to the ground unseen now he remember that it have be tear down the year before there be a straight and perilous drop beneath the window as for the stair they lead almost to the front door of the building sinclair would be sure to see he if he go down there of the purpose of the big man he have no doubt he black guilt be so apparent to he own mind that it seem impossible that the keen eye of sinclair have not look into the story of hal 's broken leg and see a lie besides the invitation through a messenger seem a hollow lure sinclair wish to fight he and kill he before witness who would attest that lowrie have be the first to go for he gun fight lowrie look down at he hand and find that the very wrist be quiver even at he best he feel that he would have no chance once he have see sinclair in action in lew murphy 's old saloon have see red jordan get the drop and have watch sinclair shoot he man deliberately through the shoulder red jordan be a cripple for life suppose he walk boldly down tell he story and trust to the skill of he lie no he know he color would pale if he face sinclair suppose he refuse to fight better to die than be shame in the mountain country he hurry to the window for another look into the street and he find that sinclair have disappear lowrie 's knee buckle under he weight he go over to the bed with short step like a drunken man and lower himself down on it sinclair have go into the hotel and doubtless that mean that he have grow impatient the fever to kill be burn in the big man then lowrie hear a steady step come regularly up the stair they creak under a heavy weight lowrie draw he gun it catch twice finally he jerk it out in a frenzy he would shoot when the door open without wait and then trust to luck to fight he way through the man below in the meantime the muzzle of the revolver wabble crazily from side to side up and down he clutch the barrel with the other hand and still the weapon shake curl up he knee before he breast he grind down with both hand that give he more steadiness but would not this contorted position destroy all chance of shooting accurately he own prophecy make over the dead body of hal sinclair that all three of they would see that face again come back to he with a sense of fatality some forward-looking instinct he assure himself have give he that knowledge the step upon the stair come up steadily but the mind of lowrie between the step leap hither and yon a thousand mile and back what if he nerve fail he at the last moment what if he buckle and show yellow and the shame of it follow he better a hundred time to die by he own hand excitement forebode the weariness of the long trail -- all be work upon lowrie nearer draw the step it seem a hour since he have first hear it begin to climb the stair it sound heavily on the floor outside he door there be a heavy tap on the door itself for a instant the clutch of lowrie freeze around he gun then he twitch the muzzle back against he own breast and fire there be no pain -- only a sense of numbness and a vague feeling of tear muscle as if they be extraneous matter he drop the revolver on the bed and press both hand against he wound then the door open and there appear not riley sinclair but pop hansen what in thunder -- he begin get riley sinclair there be be a accident say lowrie faintly and huskily get riley sinclair quick i get something to say to he 3 riley sinclair ride over the mountain a hour of stern climbing lay behind he but it be not sympathy for he tired horse that make he draw rein sympathy be not readily on tap in riley 's nature hossflesh to riley be purely and simply a means to a end neither have he pause to enjoy that mystery of change which come over mountain between late afternoon and early evening he keen eye answer all he purpose and that they have never learn to see blue in shadow mean nothing to riley sinclair if he look kindly upon the foothill which step down from the peak to the valley land it be because they mean a easy descent riley take thorough stock of he surroundings for it be a new country yonder where the slant sun glance and blink on window must be sour creek and there be the road to town jagging across the hill riley sigh in he heart he despise that valley there be black patch of plow land a scattering of house begin in the foothill and thicken toward sour creek how could man remain there where there be so little elbow room he scowl down into the shadow of the valley small country small man picture fail to hold riley but as he sit the saddle hand on thigh and look scornfully toward sour creek he be himself a picture to make one 's head lift as a rule the horse come in for as much attention as the rider but when riley sinclair come near people see the man and nothing else not because he be good-looking but because one become suddenly aware of some hundred and eighty pound of lithe tough muscle and a domineering face somewhere behind he eye there be a faint glint of humor that be the only soft touch about he he be in that hard age between thirty and thirty-five when people be still young but have lose the illusion of youth and indeed that be exactly the word which people in haste use to describe riley sinclair -- hard have once resign himself to the descent into that cramped country beneath he at once banish all regret first he pick out he objective a house some distance away near the road and then he bring he mustang up on the bit with a touch of the spur then have establish the taut rein which he prefer he send the cow pony down the slope it be plain that the mustang hate its rider it be equally plain that sinclair be in perfect touch with he horse what with the stern wrist pull against the bit and the spur keep the pony up on it in spite of he bulk he be not heavy in the saddle for he keep in tune with the gait of the horse with that sway of the body which lighten burden a capable rider he be so judicious that he seem reckless leave the mountainside he strike at a trot across a tableland some mysterious instinct enable he to guide the pony without glance once at the ground for sinclair with he head high be now carefully examine the house before he twice a cluster of tree obscure it and each time as it come again more closely in view the eye of riley sinclair brighten with certainty at length nod slightly to express he conviction he send the pony into the shelter of a little grove overlook the house from this shelter still give half he attention to he objective he run swiftly over he weapon the pair of long pistol come smoothly into he hand to be weigh nicely and have they cylinder spin then the rifle come out of its case and its magazine be look to thoroughly before it be return this do the rider seem in no peculiar haste to go on he merely push the horse into a position from which he command all the environs of the house then he sit still as a hawk hover in a windless sky presently the door of the little shack open and two man come out and walk down the path toward the road talk earnestly one be as tall as riley sinclair but heavier the other be a little slight man he go to a sleepy pony at the end of the path and slowly gather the rein plainly he be trouble and apparently it be the big man who have trouble he for now he turn and cast out he hand toward the other speak rapidly in the manner of one make a last appeal only the murmur of that voice drift up to riley sinclair but the loud laughter of the big man drive clearly to he the smaller of the two mount and ride away with dejected head while the other remain with arm fold look after he he seem to be chuckle at the little man and indeed there be cause for riley have never see a rider so completely out of place in a saddle when the pony presently break into a soft lope it cause the elbow of the little man to flop like wing like a great clumsy bird he wing he way out of view beyond the edge of the hilltop the big man continue to stand with he arm fold look in the direction in which the other have disappear he be still shake with mirth when he eventually turn riley sinclair be ride down on he at a sharp gallop stranger do not pass ungreeted in the mountain desert there be a wave of the arm to riley and he respond by bring he horse to a trot then rein in close to the big man at close hand he seem even larger than from a distance a burly figure with ludicrously inadequate support from the narrow-heeled ride boot he look sharply at riley sinclair but he first speech be for the hard-ridden pony you be put you hoss through a grind i see stranger the mustang have slump into a position of rest he side heave most generally say riley sinclair when i climb into a saddle it be not for pleasure -- it be to get somewhere he voice be surprisingly pleasant he speak very deliberately so that one feel occasionally that he be pause to find the right word and in addition to the quality of that deep voice he have a impersonal way of look he interlocutor squarely in the eye a habit that please the man of the mountain desert on this occasion he companion respond at once with a grin he be a younger man than riley sinclair but he give a impression of as much hardness as riley himself maybe you 'll be slide out of the saddle for a minute he ask get some pretty fair hooch in the house thanks partner but i be due over to sour creek by night i guess that be sour creek over the hill yep new to these part sort of new riley 's noncommittal attitude be by no means displease to the larger man he rather brutally handsome face continue to light as if he be recognize in riley sinclair a man of he own caliber you be from yonder across the mountain you travel light he eye be run over riley 's meager equipment sinclair have be know to strike across the desert load with nothing more than a rifle ammunition and water other thing be nonessential to he and it be hardly likely that he would put much extra weight on a horse the only concession to animal comfort in fact be the slicker roll snugly behind the saddle he be one of those rare westerner to whom coffee on the trail be not the staff of life as long as he have a gun he could get meat and as long as he could get meat he care little about other nicety of diet on a long trip he extra be usually confine to a couple of bag of strength-giving grain for he horse maybe you would know the gent i be down here look for ask riley happen to know ollie quade -- oliver quade sort of know he yep riley go on explain blandly you see i be carry he a sort of a death message h be say the big man and he watch riley he eye grow suddenly alert he glance shift from hand to face with catlike uncertainty yep resume sinclair in a rambling vein i come from a gent that use to be a pal of he name be sam lowrie sam lowrie exclaim the other you a friend of sam 's i be the only gent with he when he die say sinclair simply dead say the other heavily sam dead you must of be pretty thick with he declare riley man i be quade lowrie be my bunkie he come close to sinclair raise a eager face how would lowrie go out pretty peaceful -- boot off -- everything comfortable he give you a message for I yep about a gent call sinclair -- hal sinclair i think it be immediately he turn he eye away as if he be strive to recollect accurately covertly he send a side glance at quade and find he scowl suspiciously when he turn he head again he eye be as clear as the eye of a child yep he say that be the name -- hal sinclair what about hal sinclair ask quade gruffly seem like sinclair be on lowrie 's conscience say riley in the same unperturbed voice you do not say so i 'll tell you what he tell I maybe he be just rave for he have a sort of fever before he go out he say that you and he and hal sinclair and bill sandersen all go out prospect you get stick clean out in the desert lowrie say and you hit for water then sinclair 's hoss bust he leg in a hole the fall smash up sinclair 's foot the four of you go on sinclair ride one hoss and the rest of you take turn with the third one without water the hoss get weak and you gent get pretty badly scared lowrie say finally you and sandersen figure that sinclair have get to get off but sinclair could not walk so the three of you make up you mind to leave he and make a dash for water you get to water all right and in three hour you go back for sinclair but he would give up hope and shoot himself sooner 'n die of thirst lowrie say the horrible story come slowly from the lip of riley sinclair there be not the slightest emotion in he face until quade rub he knuckle across he wet forehead then there be the faintest jut out of riley 's jaw lowrie be sure raving say quade sinclair look carelessly down at the gray face of quade i guess maybe he be but what he ask I to say be : ` hell be sure come to what you boy do ' he think about that might late reply quade wait till he could shift the blame on I and sandersen eh to hell with lowrie maybe he be there all right say sinclair shrugging but i have get rid of the yarn anyway be you go to spread that story around in sour creek ask quade softly I why that story be tell I confidential by a gent that be about to go out riley 's frank manner disarm quade in a measure kind of queer I run on to you like this be not it he go on well you be fix up sort of comfortable up here nice little shack partner and i suppose you get a wife and kid and everything pretty lucky i would call you quade be glad of a opportunity to change the subject no wife yet he say live up here all alone sure why nothing think maybe you would find it sort of lonesome back to the dismiss subject quade return with the persistence of a guilty conscience say he say while we be talk about it you do not happen to believe what lowrie say lowrie be pretty sick maybe he be rave so you be all along up here nobody near he restless impatient eye run over the surroundings there be not a soul in sight the mountain be grow stark and black against the flush of the western sky he glance fall back upon quade but how do lowrie happen to die he get shot do a gang drop he nope just one gent you do not say but lowrie be a pretty slick hand with a gun -- next to bill sandersen the best i ever see almost somebody get the drop on he eh nope he kill himself quade gasp suicide sure how come i 'll tell you how it be he see a gent come in fact he look out of the window of he hotel and see riley sinclair and he figure that riley have come to get he for what happen to he brother hal lowrie get sort of excited lose he nerve and when the hotel keeper come upstairs lowrie think it be sinclair and he do not wait he shoot himself you seem to know a pile say quade thoughtfully well you see i be riley sinclair still he smile but quade be as one who have see a ghost i have to make sure that you be alone i have to make sure that you be guilty and you be quade do not do that the hand of quade slip around the butt of he gun and clung there you be not fit for a gun fight right now go on riley sinclair slowly you be all shake quade and you could not hit the side of the mountain let alone I wait a minute take you time get all settle down and wait till you hand stop shake quade moisten he white lip and wait you give hal plenty of time resume riley sinclair since lowrie tell I that yarn i be wonder how hal feel when you and the other two leave he alone you know a gent can do some pretty stiff thinking before he make up he mind to blow he head off he tone be quite conversational queer thing how i come to blunder into all this information partner i come into a room where lowrie be the minute he hear my name he figure i be after he on account of hal up he come with he gun like a flash afterward he tell I all about it and i give he a pretty fine funeral i 'll do the same by you quade how you feel now curse you exclaim quade maybe i be curse right enough but quade i would let 'em burn I inch by inch in a fire before i would quit a partner a bunkie in the desert you hear it be a queer thing that a gent could have much pleasure out of plug another gent full of lead i have have that pleasure once and i be go to have it again i be go to kill you quade but i wish there be a slower way pull you gun that last come out with a snap and the revolver of quade flick out of its holster with a convulsive jerk of the big man 's wrist yet the spit of fire come from riley sinclair 's weapon slip smoothly into he hand quade do not fall he stand with a bewildered expression as a man try to remember something hide far in the past and sinclair finger the butt of he gun lightly and wait it be rather a crumble than a fall the big body literally slump down into a heap sinclair reach down without dismount and pull the body over on its back because he explain to what have be a strong man the moment before when the devil come to you i want the old boy to see you face quade git on old boss as he ride down the trail toward sour creek he carefully and deftly clean he revolver and reload the empty chamber 4 perhaps in the final analysis riley sinclair would not be condemn for the death of lowrie or the killing of quade but for singing on the trail to sour creek and sing he do he voice ring from hill to hill and the echo bark back to he now and again he be not silent until he come to sour creek at the head of the long wind single street he draw the mustang to a tired walk it be a very peaceful moment in the little town yonder a dog bark and a coyote howl a thin answer far away but aside from these all other sound be the happy noise of family at the end of a day from every house they float out to he the clamor of child the deep laughter of a man the loud rattle of pan in the kitchen this be not so bad riley sinclair say aloud and rouse the mustang cruelly to a gallop the hoof of he mount splash through inch of pungent dust the heaviness of the gallop tell he that he horse be plainly spend and would not be capable of a long run before the morning riley sinclair accept the inevitable with a sigh all he strong instinct cry out to find sandersen and have find he to shoot he and flee yet he have a sense of fatality connect with sandersen lowrie 's own conscience have betray he and he craven fear have be he executioner quade have be shoot in a fair fight with not a soul near by but at the third time sinclair feel reasonably sure that he luck would fail he the third time the world would be very apt to brand he with murder it be a bad affair and he want to get it do this stay in sour creek be entirely against he will accordingly he put the mustang in the stable behind the hotel look to he feed and then go slowly back to get a room he register and go in silence up to he room if there have be the need he could have keep on ride for a twenty-hour stretch but the moment he find he journey interrupt he fling himself on the bed he arm throw out crosswise crucify with weariness in the meantime the proprietor return to he desk to find a long gaunt man lean above the register one brown finger trace a name look for somebody sandersen he ask know this gent sinclair face look kind of familiar to I say the other who have jerk he head up from the study of the register somehow i do not tie that name up with the face maybe not say the proprietor maybe he be not riley sinclair of colma maybe he be somebody else travel strange you mean asked sandersen i dunno bill but he look like a hard one he be get one of they nervous right hand gunfighter i dunno i be not say anything about what he be or what he be not but if a gent be to come in here and tell I a pretty strong yarn about riley sinclair or whatever he name might be i would not incline to doubt of it would you bill maybe i would and maybe i would not answer bill sandersen gloomily he go out onto the veranda and squint thoughtfully into the darkness bill sandersen be worry -- very worried the moment he see sinclair enter the hotel there have be a ghostly familiarity about the man and he understand the reason for it as soon as he see the name on the register sinclair the name carry he back to the picture of the man who lay on he back with the soft sand already half bury he body and the round purple blur in the center of he forehead in a way it be as if hal sinclair have come back to I in a new and more terrible form come back as a avenger bill sandersen be not a evil man and he sin against hal sinclair have its qualify circumstance at least he have be only one of three all of whom have concur in the thing he devoutly wish that the thing be to be do over again he swear to himself that in such a case he would stick with he companion no matter who desert but what have bring this riley sinclair all the way from colma to sour creek if it be not a errand of vengeance a sense of guilt trouble the mind of bill sandersen but the obvious thing be to find out the reason for sinclair 's presence in sour creek sandersen cross the street to the newly install telegraph office he have one intimate friend in the far-off town of colma and to that friend he now address a telegram \* \* \* \* \* rush back all news you have about man call self riley sinclair of colma -- over six foot tall weight hundred and eighty complexion dark hard look \* \* \* \* \* there be enough meat in that telegram to make the operator rise he head and glance with sharpened eye at the patron bill sandersen return that glance with so much interest that the operator lower he head again and make a mental oath that he would let the westerner run the west with that telegram work for he in far-off colma bill sandersen start out to gather what information he could in sour creek he drift from the blacksmith shop to the kitchen of mr mary caluson but both these brimming reservoir of news have this day run dry mr caluson vaguely remember a riley sinclair a man who fight for the sheer love of fight a grim fellow pete handley the blacksmith have even less to say he also he aver have hear of a riley sinclair a man of action but he could not remember in what sense vaguely he seem to recall that there have be something about gun connect with the name of riley sinclair meager information on which to build but have see this man bill sandersen say the less and think the more in a couple of hour he go back through the night to the telegraph office and find that he colma friend have be unbelievably prompt the telegram have be send collect and bill sandersen groan as he pay the bill but when he open the telegram he do not begrudge the money riley sinclair be harder than he look but absolutely honest and will pay fairer than anybody avoid all trouble trust he word but not he temper gunfighter but not a bully by the way you pal lowrie shoot himself last week the long finger of bill sandersen slowly gather the telegram into a ball and crush it against the palm of he hand that ball he presently unravel to reread the telegram he study it word by word absolutely honest it make sandersen wish to go straight to the gunfighter put he card on the table confess what he have do to sinclair 's brother and then express he sorrow then he remember the cruel lean face of sinclair and the impatient eye he would probably be shoot before he have half finish he story of the gruesome trip through the desert already lowrie be dead even a child could have put two and two together and see that sinclair have come to sour creek on a mission of vengeance sandersen be himself a fighter and be a fighter he know that in riley sinclair he would meet the better man but two good man be better than one even if the one be a expert sandersen go straight to the barn behind he shack saddle he horse and spur out along the north road to quade 's house once warn they would be doubly arm and stand back to back they could safely defy the marauder from the north there be no light in quade 's house but there be just a chance that the owner have go to bed early bill sandersen dismount to find out and dismount he stumble across a soft inert mass in the path a moment later he be on he knee and the flame of the sulphur match sputter a blue light into the dead face of quade stare upward to the star bill sandersen remain there until the match singe he finger tip all doubt be go now lowrie and quade be both go and he sandersen alone remain the third and last of the guilty he first strong impulse after he agitation have diminish to such a point that he be able to think clearly again be to flee headlong into the night and keep on change horse at every town he reach until he be over the mountain and bury in the shift mass of life in some great city and then he recall riley sinclair lean and long as a hound such a man would be terrible on the trail -- tireless certainly besides there be the horror of flight almost more awful than the immediate fear of death once he turn he back to flee from riley sinclair the gunfighter would become a nightmare that would haunt he the rest of he life no matter where he flee every footstep behind he would be the footfall of riley sinclair and behind every closed door would stand the same ominous figure on the other hand if he go back and face sinclair he might reduce the nightmare to a mere creature of flesh and blood sandersen resolve to take the second step in one way he hand be tie he could not accuse sinclair of this killing without in the first place expose the tale of how riley 's brother be abandon in the desert by three strong man who have be he bunky and that story sandersen know would condemn he to worse than death in the mountain desert he would be loathe and scorn from one end of the cattle country to the other all of these thing go through he head as he jog he mustang back down the hill he turn in at mason 's place all at once he recall that he be not act normally he have just come from see the dead body of he best friend and yet so mortal be he concern for he own safety that he feel not the slightest touch of grief or horror for dead quade he have literally to grip he hand and rouse himself to a pitch of semihysterium then he spur he horse down the path fling himself with a shout out of the saddle cast open the door of the house without a preliminary knock and rush into the room murder shout bill sandersen quade be kill 5 who kill quade that be the question ask with the quiet deadliness by six man in sour creek it have be buck mason 's idea to keep the whole affair still it be very possible that the slayer be still in the environs of sour creek and in that case much noise would simply serve to frighten he away it be also buck 's idea that they should gather a few known man to weigh the situation every one of the six man who answer the summons be a adept with fist or gun as the need might be every one of they have prove that he have a level head every one of they be a respected citizen sandersen be one stocky buck mason carry two hundred pound close to the ground massive of hand and jaw be a second after that they choice have fall on judge lodge the judge wear spectacles and a judicial air he have a keen eye for cow and be rather a sharper in horse trade he give he costume a semiofficial air by wear a necktie instead of a bandanna even at a roundup the glass the necktie and he little solemn pause before he deliver a opinion have give he nickname then come denver jim a very little man with nervous hand and remarkable steady eye he have punch cow over those range for ten year and he experience have make he a wildcat in a fight oscar larsen be a huge swede with a perpetual and foolish grin sour creek have laugh at oscar for five year consider he dubiously for five year more and then suddenly admit he as a man among man he be stronger than buck mason quicker than denver jim and shrewder than the judge last of all come montana he have a long sad face prodigious ability to stow away redeye and a nature as simple and kind and honest as a child 's these be the six man who gather about and stare at the center of the floor something they agree have to be do first it be old man collin that be two year back say judge lodge you boy remember how collin go then there be the drifter that be plug eight month ago and now it be ollie quade gent three murder in two year be too much sour creek 'll get a name the bad one will begin to drop in on we and use we for headquarters we get to make a example we never get the one that shoot collin or the drifter since quade have be plug we get to hang somebody be not that straight we get to hang somebody say denver jim the point be -- who he keen eye go slowly hungrily from face to face as if he would not have greatly object to pick one of he companion in that very room be they any stranger in town ask larsen with he peculiar foolish grin sandersen stir in he chair he heart leap there be a gent name riley sinclair nobody be not never see before when do he come in along about dark that be the right time for we you find quade a long time dead bill sandersen swallow in he joy he could have embrace larsen what 'll we do go talk to sinclair say larsen and rise i get a rope he be a dangerous-lookin ' gent declare sandersen larsen reply mildly : mostly they be a pile more interesting when they 's dangerous come on boy it have be well after midnight when mason and sandersen get back to sour creek the gathering of the posse have require much time now as they file out to the hotel to the east the mountain be begin to roll up out of the night and one cloud far away and high in the sky be turn pink they find the hotel waken even at this early hour at least the chinese cook be rattle in the kitchen as he build the fire when the six reach the door of sinclair 's room step lightly they hear the occupant singing softly to himself early riser whisper denver jim too early to be honest reply judge lodge larsen raise one of he great hand and impose a absolute silence then step with astonishing softness consider he bulk he approach the door of sinclair 's room into he left hand slide he 45 and instantly five gun glint in the hand of the other with equal caution they range themselves behind the big swede the latter glance over he shoulder make sure that everything be in readiness and then kick the door violently open riley sinclair be sit on the side of he bed tug on a pair of ride boot and sing a hushed song he interrupt himself long enough to look up into the muzzle of larsen 's gun then deliberately he finish draw on the boot singing while he do so and still deliberately rise and stamp he foot home in the leather next he drop he hand on he hip and consider the posse gravely always hear tell how sour creek be a fine town but i do not know they turn out reception committee before sunup how be you boy want my roll larsen as one who scorn to take a fly start on any man drop he weapon back in its holster sinclair 's own gun and cartridge belt hang on the wall at the foot of the bed that sound too cool to be straight say the judge soberly sinclair i figure you know why we want you i dunno gent say sinclair who grow more and more cheerful in the face of these six pair of grim eye but i be sure oblige to the gent that give I the sendoff what d'you want draw into the background larsen say : open up on he judge start the question but sandersen be of no mind to let the slow-moving mind of the judge handle this affair which be so vital to he if riley sinclair do not hang sandersen himself be instantly place in peril of he life he step in front of sinclair and thrust out he long arm you kill quade riley sinclair rub he chin thoughtfully look past he accuser i do not think so he say at length you do not think so do not you know they be two mexican jump I once one of 'em be call pedro maybe the other be quade that who you be talk about ' you can not talk yourself out of it sinclair say denver jim we mean business real business you 'll find out this here be a necktie party maybe ask riley sinclair it be partner say big larsen with he continual smile sinclair you come over the mountain go on sandersen you come to find quade you ride down off 'n the hill and you come up to quade 's house you call he out to talk to you you be sit on you horse all at once you snatch out a gun and shoot quade down we know that bullet range down it be shoot from above he plain murder he do not have a chance throw out he fact as he see they one by one there be a ring of conviction in he voice the six accuse face grow hard and set then to they astonishment they see that sinclair be smile he do not noway take we serious gent declare the judge let 's take he out and see if a rope mean anything to he sinclair d'you figure this be a game with we riley sinclair chuckle gent he say easily you come here all het up you want a pile of action but you be not go to get it off 'n I -- not a bit i 'll tell you why you gent be straight and you know straight talk when you hear it this dead man -- what be he name quade -- be kill by a gent that have a reason for kill he want to get quade 's money or they be a old grudge but what could my reason be for want to bump off quade can any of you figure that out there be my thing look through 'em and see if i get quade 's money maybe you think it be a grudge gent i give you my word that i never be into this country before this trip how could there be any grudge between I and quade be that sense then talk sense back to I he mirth have disappear halfway through he speech and in the latter part of it he voice ring sternly moreover he look they in the eye one by one all of this be note by sandersen he see suddenly and clearly that he have lose they would not hang this man by hearsay evidence or by chance presumption sinclair would go free and if sinclair go free there would be short shrift for bill sandersen for a moment he feel he destiny waver back and forth on a needle point then he fling himself into a new course diametrically oppose to the other boy it be I that start this and i want to be the first to admit it be a cold trail man have be hang with less agin ' they than we get agin ' sinclair we know when quade must have be kill we know it tally pretty close with the time when sinclair come down that same trail because that be the way he ride into sour creek but no matter how fact look nobody _ see _ that shooting and i say this gent sinclair be not any murderer look he over boy he be clean and i register a vote for he what d'you say no matter what the rest of you figure i be go to shake hand with he i like he style he have turn he back on riley while he speak but now he whirl and thrust out he hand the finger of sinclair close slowly over the proffer hand when it come to the name partner seem like you get a edge over I have i i be sandersen glad to know you sinclair sandersen repeat the stranger slowly sandersen let he finger fall away nervelessly from the hand of the other he sigh deeply sandersen with a side-glance follow every change shade of expression in that hard face how could sinclair attack a man who have just defend he from a terrible charge it could not be for the moment at least sandersen feel he be safe in the future many thing might happen at the very least he have gain a priceless postponement of the catastrophe they that do I a good turn be writ down in red sinclair be say and they that step on my toe be writ down the same way sandersen i get a idea that for one reason or another i be not go to forget you in a hurry there be a grim double meaning in that speech which sandersen alone could understand the other of the self-appointed posse have apparently make up they mind that sandersen be right and that this be a cold trail it be like sinclair say admit the judge we get to find a gent that have a reason for wish to have quade die where 's the man hunt for the reason first and find the man afterward say big larsen still smile all right do anybody owe quade money anybody quade be press for it it be the judge who advance the argument in this solemn and dry form denver jim declare that to he personal knowledge quade have neither borrow nor loan well then have quade ever make many enemy we know quade be a fighter recollect any gent that might hold grudge young penny hate the ground he walk on quade beat penny to a pulp down by the perkin water hole penny would not do a murder maybe it be a fair fight break in larsen fair nothin ' say buck mason do not we all know that quade be fast with a gun he barely have it out in he hand when the other gent drill he and he be shoot from above no sir the way it happen be something like this the murderin ' skunk sit on he hoss say goodby to quade and while they be shake hand or something like that he go for he gun and plug quade maybe it be a gent that know he do not have a chance agin ' quade maybe -- he break off short in he deduction and smite he hand together with a tremendous oath boy i get it it be cold foot that do the job it be gaspar that do it they stare at buck vaguely mason cold foot be not get the nerve to shoot a rabbit not in a fight this be a murder what be the schoolteacher 's reason do not he love sally bent do not quade love she he raise he voice i be a big fool for forget do not i see he ride over the hill to quade 's place and come back in the evening do not i see it why else would he have call on quade there be a round chorus of oath and exclamation the poisonous little skunk it be he we 'll string he up with a rush they start for the door wait call riley sinclair bill sandersen watch he with a keen eye he have study the face of the big man from up north all during the scene and he find the stern feature unreadable for one instant now he guess that sinclair be about to confess if you do not mind seven in one party say riley sinclair i think i 'll go along to see justice do you see i get a sort of secondhand interest in this necktie party mason clap he on the shoulder you be just the sort of a gent we need he declare 6 down in the kitchen they demand a loaf of bread and some coffee from the chinese cook and then the seven dealer of justice take horse and turn into the silence of the long mountain trail the sunrise have pick those mountain out of the night directly above sour creek riley sinclair regard they with a longing eye that be he country a man could see up there and he could see the truth down here in the valley everything be askew man live blindly and do blind thing like this justice which the six rider be bring on a innocent man not by any means have riley decide what he would do if he confess the truth he would not only have a man-sized job try to escape from the posse but he would have to flee before he have a chance to deal finally with sandersen chiefly he want time he want a chance to study sandersen the fellow have speak for he like a man but sinclair be suspicious in he quandary he turn to sad-faced montana and ask : who be this gent you call cold foot he be a tenderfoot declare montana and he be queer he be yaller they say and that be why they call he cold foot besides he teach the school where 's they a real man that would do a schoolma'am 's work living or die he be not much good you can lay to that sinclair be comfort by this speech perhaps the schoolteacher be as montana state not much good dead or alive sinclair have know many man whose life be not worth a ounce of powder in this case he would let cold foot be hang it be a conclusion sufficiently grim but riley sinclair be admittedly a grim man he have live for himself he have work for himself on he younger brother hal he have waste all the better and tenderer side of he nature for hal 's education and advantage he have sweat and save for a long time with the death of hal the better side of riley sinclair die the horse sweat up a rise of ground for a schoolteacher he live sort of far out of town i figure say riley sinclair that be on account of sally bent answer denver jim sally and she brother get a shack out this way and cold foot board with 'em sally bent that be a old-maidish-sounding name denver jim grin broadly tolerable he say just tolerable old-maidish sound when they reach the top of the knoll the horse pause as if by common assent now they stand with they head bow sullen tired already steam go up from they into the cool of the morning there it be it be as comfortably place a house as riley sinclair have ever see the mountain come down out of the sky in ragged uneven step here it dip away into a lap of quite level ground a stream of spring water flash across that little tableland dark in the shadow of the big tree silver in the sunlight at the back of the natural clearing be the cabin build solidly of log wood water and commanding position for defense riley sinclair run he eye appreciatively over these advantage my gun i would forget sally exclaim the massive buck mason be that she asked riley sinclair a woman have come out of the shadow of a tree and stand over the edge of the stream a bucket in she hand at that distance it be quite impossible to make out she feature although riley sinclair find himself squint and peer to make they out she have on something white over she head and neck and she dress be the fade blue of old gingham then the wind strike she dress and it seem to lift the girl in its current i would forget sally bent what difference do she make ask riley you do not know she stranger and she will not know we get anything for mask i be sure a roman-nosed fool declare mason of course we get to wear mask the girl 's pail flash as she raise it up from the stream and dissolve into the shadow of a big tree she do not seem noways interested in this here party remark riley that be she way say denver jim arrange he bandanna to mask the lower part of he face from the bridge of he nose down she 'll show plenty of interest when it come to a pinch riley adjust he own mask and he do it thoroughly out of he vest he rip a section of black lining and have cut eyehole he fasten the upper edge of the cloth under the brim of he hat and tie the loose end behind he head red white blue black and polka dot be that quaint array of mask have complete he arrangement larsen start on at a lope and the rest of the party follow in a lurch loose-formed wedge at the edge of the little tableland larsen draw down he mount to a walk and turn in the saddle quick work no talk and a getaway he say as he swing down to the ground in the crisis of action the big swede seem to be accord the place of leader by natural right the other imitate he example silently before they reach the door larsen turn again watch jerry bent he say softly you watch he denver and you sandersen I and buck will take care of cold foot he may fight like a rat that be the way with a coward when he get cornered then he stride toward the door how thick be sally bent with this schoolteaching gent ask riley sinclair of mason i dunno nobody know sally keep she think to herself larsen kick open the door and at the same moment draw he six-shooter that example be also imitate by the rest with the exception of riley sinclair he hang in the background watch gaspar call larsen there be a voice of answer a man 's thin voice then the sharp cry of a girl from the interior of the house sinclair hear a flurry of skirt hysteric now he say into he mask she spring into the doorway she hand hold the jamb on either side in she haste the big white handkerchief around she throat have be twist awry sinclair look over the head of mason and denver jim into the suntanned face that have now pale into a delicate olive color she very lip be pale and she great black eye be flash at they she seem more a picture of rage than hysterical fear why for she ask what be you-all here for in mask boy what you mean call for gaspar what be he do in a moment of wait larsen clear he throat solemnly it would be best we tell gaspar direct what we be here for this seem to tell she everything oh she gasp you be not really _ after _ he lady we sure be but jig -- he would not hurt a mouse -- he could not sally he be do a murder no no no sally will you stand out of the door it be not -- it be not a lynch party boy oh you fool you 'll hang for it every one of you sinclair confide to buck mason beside he : larsen be let she talk down to he she 'll spoil this here party we be the voice of justice say judge lodge pompously we be not get any other name they

point he off toe like a horse with a sore leg i know you all and if you touch a hair on jig 's head i 'll have you into court for murder you hear -- murder i 'll have you hang every man jack she have lower she voice for the last part of this speech now she make a sweeping gesture close she hand as if she have clutch they destiny in the palm of she hand and could throw it into they face you-all climb right back on you hoss and feed 'em the spur they stand amaze shift from foot to foot exchange miserable glance she begin to laugh mysterious light dance and twinkle in she eye the laughter chime away into word grow suddenly gentle suddenly friendly such a voice riley sinclair have never hear it walk into a man 's heart break the lock why buck mason you of all man to be mix up in a deal like this and you oscar larsen after you and I have talk like partner so many a time denver jim we 'll have a good laugh about this necktie party later on why boy you-all know that jig be not guilty of no harm sally say the wretched denver jim thing seem to be sort of point to a -- there be a growl from the rear of the party and riley sinclair stride to the front and face the girl they be a gent charge with murder inside he say stand off girl you be in the way before she answer he she tooth glint if she have be a man she would have strike he in the face he see that and it please he stranger she say deliberately make sure that every one in the party should hear she word what you need be a stay around sour creek long enough for the boy to teach you how to talk to a lady honey reply riley sinclair with provoke calm you sure put up a tidy bluff maybe you would tell a judge that you know all these gent behind they mask but they would not be no way you could _ prove _ it a stir behind he be ample assurance that this simple point have escape the cowpuncher all the soul of the girl stand up in she eye and hate riley sinclair and again he be pleased it be not that he wish to bring the schoolteacher to trouble but it have anger he to see one girl balk seven grow man stand aside say riley sinclair not a inch lady i 'll move you stranger if you touch I you 'll be teach better the gent in sour creek do not stand for suchlike way before the appeal to the chivalry of sour creek be out of she lip smoothly and swiftly the hand of sinclair settle around she elbow she be lift lightly into the air and deposit to one side of the doorway she cry ring in the ear of riley sinclair then she hand flash up and the mask be tear from he face i 'll remember oh if i have to wait twenty year i 'll remember look I over careful lady today 's most likely the last time you 'll see I declare riley gaze straight into she eye a hand touch he arm stranger no rough play riley sinclair whirl with whiplash suddenness and chop the edge of he hand downward strike away the arm of larsen paralyze the nerve with the same blow hand off say sinclair the girl 's clear voice ring again in he ear : thank you oscar larsen i sure know my friend -- and the gentleman she be pour oil on the fire she would have a feud blaze in a moment with all he heart riley sinclair admire she dexterity he draw the posse back to the work in hand by step into the doorway and calling : hey gaspar 7 he be right larsen and you be wrong buck mason say she have we buffaloe and he pull we clear steady boy they be not no harm do to sally oh buck be that the sort of a friend of mine you be i be sorry sally sinclair give this argument only a small part of he attention he find himself look over a large room which be he think one of the most comfortable he have ever see -- outside of picture at the farther end a great fireplace fill the width of the room the inside of the log wall have be carefully and smoothly finish by some master axman there be plenty of chair homemade and very comfortable with cushion a little organ stand against the wall to one side no wonder the schoolteacher have choose this for he board place riley make he voice larger gaspar then a door open slowly while sinclair drop he hand on the butt of he gun and wait the door move again a head appear and observe he pronto declare riley sinclair and a little man slip into full view he be a full span shorter riley feel than a man have any right to be moreover he be too delicately make he have a head of bright blond hair thick and rather on end the face be thin and handsome and the eye impressed riley as be at once both bright and weary he be wear a dress gown the first riley have ever see get you hand out of those pocket he emphasize the command with a jerk of he gun hand and the arm of the schoolteacher fly up over he head lean fragile hand riley see they to be altogether it be the most disgustingly inefficient piece of manhood that he have ever see slide out here gaspar they be some gent here that want to look you over the voice that answer he be pitch so low as to be almost unintelligible what do they want step lively friend they want to see a gent that let a woman do he fight for he he have drop he gun contemptuously back into its holster now he wave the schoolteacher to the door with he bare hand gaspar sidle past as if a loaded gun be about to explode in he direction he reach the door he arm still hold stiffly above he head but at the sight of the mask face one arm drop to he side and the other fall across he face he slump against the side of the door with a moan it be judge lodge who break the silence guilty boy be not one look at the skunk enough to prove it make it all fair and legal gent break in larsen buck mason stride straight up to the prisoner be you over to quade 's house yesterday evening the other shrink away from the extended point arm yes he stammer i -- i -- what do all this mean mason whirl on he companion still point to the schoolmaster take a slant at he boy can not you read it in he face there be a deep and humming murmur of approval then without a word mason take one of gaspar 's arm and montana take the other sally bent run forward at they with a cry but the long arm of riley sinclair bar she way man 's work he say coldly you go inside and cover you head she turn to they with extend hand buck montana larsen -- boy you-all be not go to let it happen he _ could not _ have do it they lower they head and return no answer at that she whirl with a sob and run back into the house the procession move on buck and montana in the lead with the prisoner between they the other follow judge lodge uncoil a horribly significant rope last of all come bill sandersen never take he eye from the face of riley sinclair the latter be thoughtful very thoughtful he seem to feel the eye of sandersen upon he for presently he turn to the other what good 's a coward to the world sandersen none that i could see well look at that ever see anything more yaller gaspar walk between he two guard rather he be drag between they he foot trail weakly and aimlessly behind he he whole body sink with flabby terror the stern lip of riley sinclair curl he be go to let it go through say sandersen to himself after all nobody can blame he he could not put he own neck in the noose over the lowest limb of a great cottonwood judge lodge accurately fling the rope so that the noose dangle a significant distance from the ground there be a businesslike stir among the other denver larsen the judge and sandersen hold the free end of the rope buck mason tie the hand of the prisoner behind he montana speak calmly through he mask jig you sure do a rotten bad thing you have not ought to of kill he jig these here killing have get to stop we be not hang you for spite but to make a example then with a dexterous hand he fit the noose around the neck of the schoolteacher as the rough rope grate against gaspar 's throat he shriek and jerk against the rope end that bind he hand then as if he realize that struggle would not help he and that only speech could give he a chance for life he

unbending of heart be the first to speak look to I gent like we be waste a lot of time on a rat the blond head of cold foot turn and he large dark eye rest without expression upon the face of the swede he seem almost literally to fold he hand and await the result of he trial the illusion be so complete that even riley sinclair begin to feel that the prisoner might be guilty -- of a act which he himself have do the opportunity be indeed too perfect to be dismiss without consideration it be in he power definitely to put the blame on another man then he could remain in this community as long as he wish to work he will upon sandersen sandersen himself be a great problem if bill have speak up in good faith to save sinclair from the posse that morning the riley feel that he be disarm but a profound suspicion remain with he that sandersen guess he mission and be purposely try to brush away the wrath of the avenger it would take time to discover the truth but to secure that time it be necessary to settle the blame for the killing cold foot be a futile weak-handed little coward in the stern scheme of sinclair 's life the death of such a man be almost less than nothing waste a lot of time on a rat the voice of larsen fall agreeably upon the ear of he honor behind that voice come a faraway murmur the scream of a hawk he bent he head back and look up through the limb of the cottonwood into the pale blue-white haze of the morning sky a speck drift across it the hawk sailing in search of prey under the noble arch of heaven float that fierce malignant creature riley sinclair lower he head with a sigh be not he himself play the part of the hawk he look straight into the eye of the prisoner and jig meet the gaze without flinch he merely smile in a apologetic manner and he make a little gesture with he right hand as if to admit that he be helpless and that he cast himself upon the good will of riley sinclair riley jerk he head to one side and scowl he hate that appeal he want this hang to be the work of seven man not of one montana return bring with he a yellow-covered red-backed book they be not a sign of a bible in the house he state but i find this here

there declaration here larsen put you hand on this and swear you be tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth they be not go to be any bum testimony take in this court we be not go to railroad this lynching through he catch a glistening light of gratitude in the eye of the schoolteacher riley 's own breast swell with a sense of virtue he have never before take the life of a helpless man and now that it be necessary he would do it almost legally larsen willingly take the oath i be go to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth damn I if i do not i be over to shorty lander 's store the other day -- what day hmm last Tuesday i reckon go on larsen but gimme nothin ' but the fact i see jig come into the store ' i want to look at a revolver ' he say ` the deuce you do what might you want to do with a revolver jig ' say shorty ` you mean you want a toy gun ' i remember they word particular clear because i do not see how even a spineless gent like jig could stand for such a pile of insult but he just sort of smile with he lip and get steady with he eye like he be sort of grieve ' i want a gun that 'll kill a man ' he say to shorty shorty and I both laugh but when shorty brung out a forty-five doggone I if jig do not buy the gun ` look here ' say he ` be this the way it work ' and he raise it up in he skinny hand i have to laugh ` hold it in both hand ' say i ` oh ' say he and darned if he do not take it in both hand ` it seem much easier to handle in this way ' say he but that be what i see i see he buy a gun to kill a man they be he word and i figure they be a mouthful larsen retire damagin ' evidence they be not no question say mr clerk severely but i can lay over it you honor blaze away judge larsen take the oath i be go to show you they be bad feeling between the prisoner and the dead man you honor i be over to the dance at the woodville schoolhouse a couple of week ago jig be there not dance or nothing but sit in a corner with

aside ` look here ' he say ` why do not you dance with one girl instead of hog they all ' ' i do not dance ' say jig ` why do you stay if you will not dance ' ask quade ` it be my privilege ' say jig smile in that ornery way of he like he thought be too big for a ordinary gent to understand 'em ` you stay a ' dance a ' welcome ' say quade ` but if you will not dance get out of here and go home where you belong you be spoil the party for we keep all the girl over here ' ` be that a threat ' say jig smile in that way of he ` it sure be and most particular i want you to keep away from sally

give he a dress but they be bad feeling between he and quade they be a devil in they eye of jig 's when he look at big quade i see it and i knowed they would be trouble lodge then retire gent say he honor it look kind of black for the prisoner we know that gaspar have a grudge agin ' quade and that he buy a gun big enough to kill a man it sure look black for you gaspar the prisoner look steadily at sinclair there be something unsettling in that gaze all we get to make sure of say the judge be that that quarrel between gaspar and quade be strong enough to make gaspar want to kill he and -- you honor break in gaspar do not you see that i could never kill a man the prisoner stretch out he hand in a gesture of appeal to sinclair riley grit he tooth suddenly a chill have pass through he at the thought of the hang noose bite into that frail soft throat you shut up till you be ask to talk he say frown savagely i think we get a witness here that 'll prove that you _ do _ have sufficient cause to make you want to get rid of quade and if we have that proof heaven help you montana go get sally bent gaspar start up with a ring in he voice no no in response to a gesture from sinclair denver jim jerk the prisoner back onto the black rock with blaze blue eye gaspar glare at the judge he delicate lip tremble with unspoken word sinclair know with another strange fall of the heart that the prisoner be perfectly aware that he judge have not the slightest suspicion of he guilt a entente be establish between they a entente which distressed sinclair and which he strive to destroy but despite himself he could not get rid of the knowledge that the great blue eye be fix steadily upon he as if beg he to see that justice be do consequently the judge make himself as impersonal as possible 9 sally bent come willingly even eagerly it be the eagerness of a angry woman who want to talk what be you name a name you 'll come to wish you would never hear say the girl if any harm come to john gaspar poor jig they will not _ dare _ to touch a hair of you head with a gentle voice she have turn to gaspar to speak these last word a faint smile come on the lip of gaspar and he gaze be far away as if he be in the midst of a unimportant dream with sally bent the last significant part of it all the girl flush and turn back to riley i ask you you name say he honor gravely what right have you to ask I my name or any other question mr lodge say he honor will you loosen up and tell this lady where we come in sure say the judge clear he throat sally here be the point they be not be

shrill cry from sally let I talk she plead let I stay i will not make no more trouble mr sinclair all right he decide without enthusiasm now what be you name sally bent she smile a little as she speak that name usually bring a answer smile particularly from the man of sour creek but sinclair 's saturnine face show no softening mr clerk swear the witness judge lodge rose and hold forth the book and prescribe the oath during that interval riley sinclair raise he head to escape from the steady reproachful gaze of john gaspar down in the valley bottom sour creek flash muddy-yellow and far away just beyond the sun gleam on the chalk-faced cliff still higher the mountain change between dawn and full day there be the country for riley sinclair what he do down here in the valley do not matter purification wait for he among the summit snow he turn back to hear the last of sally bent 's voice whipping he eye past gaspar to avoid meeting again that cling stare sally bent he say do you know

that i be a flirt and he say i swear to it that he would get gaspar she stop pant with excitement he want to murder john gaspar riley sinclair lift he heavy brow that be a pretty serious thing to say sally bent but it be the truth and i have even hear he threaten gaspar but you try to make they friend you try to smooth quade down i would not waste my time on a bully i just tell john to get a gun and be ready to defend himself and he do it he do it but he never fire the gun what be the last time quade see you the day before yesterday he come up here and tell I that he know I and john gaspar be

have not tell you he love you never but now that john 's in this trouble i do not care if the whole world know it i love john gaspar what a voice what a light face as she turn to the prisoner but instead of a flush of happiness john gaspar rise and shrink away from the outstretched hand of the girl and he be pale -- pale with sorrow and even with pity it seem to sinclair no no say the soft voice of gaspar not that sally not that decidedly it would not do to let this scene progress take away the witness montana montana draw she arm into he and she go away as one stunned stare at john gaspar as if she could not yet understand the extent of the calamity which have befall she she have be worse than scorn she have be reject with pity as she disappear into the door of she house sinclair look at the bow head of john gaspar denver he call suddenly yes you honor the prisoner 's hand be tie wipe the sweat off 'n he face will you sure with a large and brilliant bandanna montana obeyed then he pause in the midst of he operation you honor well it be not sweat it be tear tear riley sinclair start up then slump back on he stump with a groan tear he echo with a voice that be a groan john gaspar what kind of a man be you he turn back to the court with a frown mr jury he say look at this prisoner we get look he over considerable i say do you ever see a man like that a man that be not able to love a girl like sally bent when she just about throw herself at he head be he worth keep alive look at he and then listen to I i see the whole of it mr jury buck mason lean forward with interest glowering upon john gaspar this skunk of a john gaspar get sally all tie up with he sappy talk get she all excite because he be something brand new and different quade get sore nacherallike then he come to gaspar and say : ` cut out this soft talk to sally or i 'll bust you head ' gaspar do not love sally but he be afraid of quade he go and get a gun he go to quade 's house and try to be friend quade kick he out gaspar climb back on he hoss and while he be sit there pull out a gun and shoot poor quade dead do not that sound nacheral he would not marry sally but he do not want another man to have she and he would not give up he soft berth in the house of sally 's brother he know quade would never suspect he of have the nerve to fight so he take quade unready and plug he while quade be not look be that clear it sure sound straight to I say buck mason all right stand up mason rise take off you hat the sombrero be withdraw with a flourish god 's up yonder higher 'n that hawk but see you clear buck tell we straight be gaspar guilty or not guilty as hell you honor a sigh from the prisoner the last of life seem to go from he and sinclair brace himself to meet a hysterical appeal but there be only that slight drooping of the shoulder and decline of the head it be a appalling thing for sinclair to watch he be use to power in man and beast he understand it a cunning devil of a fight outlaw horse be he choice for a ride the meaner they be the longer they last he use to say he respect man of evil as long as they be man of action he be perfectly at home and contented among man where one 's purse and life be at constant hazard where a turn back might mean destruction to he this meek surrender of hope be incomprehensibly despicable if he have hesitate before he hard soul be firm now in the decision that john gaspar must die and so leave sinclair 's own road free with all suspicion of a connection between he and quade 's death go riley could play a free hand against sandersen he turn a face of iron upon the prisoner sandersen and denver jim bring the prisoner before I they obey but when they reach down they hand to gaspar 's shoulder to drag he to he foot he avoid they with a shudder and of he own free will rise and walk between they john irving gaspar say sinclair sternly alia jig alias cold foot -- which be a fitting and proper name for you -- have you get anything to say that will not take too long before i pronounce sentence on you he have to set he tooth the sad eye of john gaspar have rise from the ground and fix steadily darkly upon the eye of he judge there be infinite understanding infinite patience in that look the patience of the weak man school in endure buffet for the moment sinclair almost feel that the man be pity he i have only a little to say say john gaspar speak up then who d'you want to give the message to to no living man say john gaspar all right then gaspar blaze away with the talk but make it short john gaspar raise he head until he be look through the stalwart branch of the cottonwood tree into the haze of light above we father in heaven say john gaspar forgive they as i forgive they riley sinclair quiver under those word look around he upon the stunned face of the rest of the court then back to the calm of gaspar strength seem to have flood the coward at the moment when he lose all hope he become glorious he voice be soft never rise and the great dark eye be steadfast a sudden consciousness come to riley sinclair that god must indeed be above they higher than the flight of the hawk robe in the maze of that lofty cloud see all hear all and every word that gaspar speak be damn he drag he to hell but riley sinclair be not a religious man luck be he divinity he leave god and heaven and hell inside the page of the bible undisturbed the music of the schoolteacher 's voice remind he of the purling of some tiny waterfall in the midst of a mountain wilderness i have no will to fight for life for that sin forgive I and for whatever else i have do wrong let no knowledge of the crime they be commit come to these man fierce man fighter toiler full of hate full of despair full of rage how can they be other than blind forgive they as i forgive they without malice and most of all lord god forgive this most unjust judge louder whisper sinclair he hand cup behind he ear aman say john gaspar as he head bow again the fascinate posse seem frozen each man in he place each in he attitude john gaspar say he honor here 's you sentence : you be to be hang by the neck till you be dead john gaspar close he eye and open they again otherwise he make no move of protest but not continue sinclair from this cottonwood tree a faint sigh indubitably of relief come from the posse riley sinclair arise gent he say i be think this over they be not any doubt that the prisoner be guilty and they be not any doubt that john gaspar be no good anyway you look at he but a gent that can put the word together like he can ought to get a chance to talk in front of a regular jury i figure we have better send for the sheriff to come over from woodville and take the prisoner back there one of you gent can slide over there today and the sheriff 'll be here tomorrow mostlike but who 'll take charge of gaspar who why I of course unless somebody else would like the job more i 'll keep he right here in the bent cabin sinclair protest buck mason you be a pretty capable sort they be not no doubt of that but what if jerry bent come home which he be sure to do before night there would be a mess because jerry would fight for gaspar i know partner say riley sinclair dryly if it come to that then i guess i would have to fight back it be foolish to question the power in that grave sardonic face the other man give way nod one by one secretly each man now that the excitement be go be glad that they have not proceed to the last extremity in five minute they be drift away and all this time sinclair watch the face of john gaspar as the sorrow change to wonder and the wonder to the vague beginning of happiness suddenly he feel that he have the clue to the mystery of cold foot as a matter of fact john gaspar have never grow up he be still a weak dreamy boy 10 the posse have hardly throw its mask to the wind and gallop down the road when sally bent come run from the house i know they could not she cry to john gaspar i know they would not dare the coward i 'll remember every one of they hush murmured gaspar he faint smile be for riley sinclair one of they be still here you see with wrath flush she face the girl look at riley how do you dare to stay here and face I -- after the thing you say lady reply sinclair you mean after the thing i make you say just wait till jerry come exclaim sally at this sinclair grow more sober honey he say dryly when you brother drop in you just calm he down will you because if he and gaspar together be to start in raise trouble -- well they would be more action than you ever see in that cabin before and after it be all over they would have a dead gaspar to cart over to woodville you can lay to that it take sally somewhat aback this confident ferociousness they that brag be not always the one that do thing she declare but why be you stay here to keep gaspar till the sheriff come for he sally grow white do not you see that there be nothing to be afraid of asked john gaspar see how close i come to death and yet i be save why god do not let innocent man be kill sally for a moment the girl stare at the schoolteacher with tear in she eye then she flash at riley a glance of utter scorn as if invite he to see what a angel upon the earth he be persecute but sinclair remain unmoved he inform they of the condition of he stay he must be allow to keep john gaspar in sight at all time only suspicious move he would resent with violence sally bent hear all of this with openly express hatred and contempt john gaspar show no emotion whatever by heaven declare sinclair when the girl have go about some housework i would actually think you believe that god be on you side you talk about he so familiar -- like you and he be partner john gaspar smile one of he rare smile he have a way of look for a long moment at another before he speak all that he be about to say be first register in he face it be easy to understand how sally bent have be entrap by the classic regularity of those feature and the strange manner of the schoolteacher she live in a country where masculine man be a drug on the market john gaspar be the pleasant exception you see explain gaspar i have to cheer sally by say something like that woman like to have such thing say she 'll be absolutely confident now because she think i be not disturbed very odd but very true and it seem to I say sinclair frown that you be not much disturbed gaspar how do that come what can i do maybe you would be man enough to try to break away from you tush i know it be impossible i would as soon try to hide myself in a open field from that hawk no no i 'll give you my parole my word of honor that i 'll make no escape but sinclair strike in with : i do not want you parole hang it man just do you best and i 'll do mine you try to give I the slip and i 'll try to keep you from it that be square all around gaspar observe he with what seem to be a characteristic air of judicious reserve very much as if he suspect a trap a great many word come up into the throat of riley sinclair but he refrain from speech in a way he be begin to detest john gaspar as he have never detest any human being before or since to he no sin be so great as the sin of weakness in a man and certainly gaspar be superlatively weak he have something in place of courage but just what that thing be sinclair could not tell curiosity draw he toward the fellow and these weakness repulse he no wonder that he stare at he now in a quandary one certainty be grow upon he he wish gaspar to escape it would bring he shame in sour creek but for the opinion of these man he have not the slightest respect let they think as they please it come home to riley that this be a man whose like he have never know before and whom he must not therefore judge as if he know he he soften he voice gaspar he say keep you head up make up you mind that you 'll fight to the last gasp why it make I plumb sick to see a grown man give up like you do he scorn ring in he voice and gaspar look at he in wonder you would ought to be pack yourself full of courage go on sinclair here 's you pal jerry bent come back two agin ' one you 'll be be not that a chance i ask you but gaspar shake he head he seem even a little amuse not against a man like you sinclair you love fight you see you be make for fight you make I think of that hawk all beak and talon make to tear remorseless crafty that be overrate I a pile mutter riley greatly please by this tribute as he feel it to be if you try maybe you could do a lot yourself you be full of nerve and a gent that be full of nerve make a first-class fighting man once he find out what he can do with they finger of yours you could learn to handle a gun like a flash start in and learn to be a man gaspar sinclair stretch a friendly hand toward the shoulder of the smaller man the hand pass through thin air gaspar have slip away he stand at a greater distance on he face there be a strong expression of displeasure sinclair scowl darkly now what d'you mean by that i mean that i do not envy you say gaspar steadily i would rather have the other thing what other thing jig gaspar overlook the contemptuous nickname doubly contemptuous on the lip of a stranger you go into the world and take what you want i be stronger than that how be you stronger ask riley because i sit in my room and i can make the world come to I jig i be never smart at riddle go ahead and clear yourself up with a few more word the other hesitate -- not for word but as if he wonder if it might be worth while for he to explain never in riley sinclair 's life have he be take so lightly will you follow I into the house ask gaspar at length i 'll follow you right enough say sinclair that be my job lead on he be bring through the living room of the cabin and into a smaller room to the side comfort seem to fill this smaller room bookcase range along one wall be pack with book the couch before the window be heap with cushion there be a easy chair with a adjustable back so that one could either sit or lie in it there be a lamp with a big greenish-yellow shade this be what i mean murmured jig riley sinclair 's bold eye rove swiftly contemptuously well you get this place fix up pretty stuffy he answer outside of that hang I if i see what you mean cold foot slip into a chair and interlace those finger whose delicacy baffle and disturb sinclair stare over they at he companion i really should not expect you to understand my friend friend sinclair explode you be a queer bird jig what do you mean by ` friend ' why not ask this amazing youth and the quiet of he face brighten into a smile i would be swing from the end of a rope if it be not for you you know sinclair shrug away this rejoinder he tread heavily to the bookshelf take up two or three random volume and toss they heedlessly back into place well kid you be go to be yank out of this little imitation world of yours pretty pronto ah but perhaps not eh something may happen what can happen just something like you my friend the insistence on that word irritated riley sandersen do not call I that he reply in he most brutal manner jig d'you know what a friend mean he ask how d'you figure that word out jig consider a friend be somebody you know and like and be glad to have around contempt spread on the face of sinclair that be just about what i know you would say be i wrong son they be not anything right about you as far as i can make out wrong you be as wrong as a yearling in a blizzard wrong i should tell a man you be wrong lemme tell you what a friend be he be the bunkie that guard you back in a fight he be the man that can ask for you hoss or you gun or you life no matter

though to a friend you give yourself away and you get yourself back bigger and stronger i do not know say jig softly that friendship could mean all that how many friend have you have the big cowpuncher pause then he say gently at length one friend in all you life sure i be lucky and have one friend cold foot lean forward eagerness in he eye tell I about he i do not know you well enough son that jarring speech thrust jig back into he chair as if with a physical hand there as though in covert he continue to study sinclair presently he begin to nod i know it from the first in spite of appearance know what know that we would get along and be we get along jig i think so glad of that mutter the cowpuncher dryly ah cry john gaspar you be not as hard as you seem one of these day i 'll prove it besides you will not forget I what make you so sure of that jig rise from he chair and stand lean against it he hand drop lightly into the pocket of he dress gown he look extraordinarily boyish at that moment and he seem to have the fearlessness of a child which know that the world have no real account against it riley sinclair set he tooth to keep back a flood of pity that rise in he you wait and see say jig he raise a finger at sinclair i 'll keep come back into you mind a long time after you leave I and you 'll keep come back into my mind oh i know it how in thunder do you i do not know just because -- well how do i understand at the trial that you know i be innocent and that you would let no harm come to I do you know that ask sinclair instead of answer jig break into he soft pleasant laughter 11 laugh and be hang declare sinclair i be go outside and do not try no funny break while i be go he say i 'll be watch and wait when you be not expect with that he be go at the door of the house a gust of hot wind strike he for the day be verge on noon and there seem more heat than light in the sun even to that hot gust sinclair jerk he bandanna knot aside and open he throat gratefully he feel as if he have be under a hard nervous strain for some time past cold foot the craven the weak of hand and the frail of spirit have test he in a new way he have be confront a novel and unaccountable thing he feel very oddly as if someone have be prod into corner of he nature yet unknown even to himself he tingle from the rapier touch of that last laughter now he eye roam with relief across the valley heat wave blur the hollow and push sour creek away until it seem a river of mist -- yellow mist he raise he attention out of that swelter hollow to the cool blue mighty mountain -- he country presently he have forget all this he settle he hat on the back of he head and begin to kick a stone before he follow it aimlessly someone be hum close to he and he turn sharply to see sally bent go by carry a bucket she smile generously and though he know that she doubtless hate he in she heart and smile for a purpose he have to reply with a perfunctory grin he stalk after she to the little leap creek and dip out a full bucket thanks say sally wantonly meet he eye as well try to soften a sphinx sinclair carry the drip bucket on the side nearest the girl and thereby gain valuable distance i be mighty glad it be you and not one of the rest confide sally still smile firmly up to he he avoid that appeal with a grunt like sandersen say go on the girl why not he he be a bad hombre say the girl hate to have jig in he hand with you it be different sinclair wait until he have put down the bucket in the kitchen then he face sally thoughtfully why he ask because you be reasonable do jig tell you that and a pile more jig say you be a pretty fine sort that be he word the cowpuncher caress the butt of he gun with he fingertip he habitual gesture when in doubt lady he say at length suppose i cut this short you think i be not go to keep cold foot here till the sheriff come for he you see what it would mean she ask eagerly it would not be a fair trial you could not get a fair jury for jig around sour creek and woodville they hate he -- all the young man do d'you know why simply because he be different simply because -- because all the girl be pretty fond of he eh you can put it that way if you want she answer steadily enough though she flush under he stare then : you 'll keep that in mind and you be man enough to do what you think be right be not you mr sinclair he shift away from the hand which be move toward he i 'll tell you what he answer i be man enough to be afraid of a girl like you sally bent then he see she head fall in despair as he turn away when he reach the shimmering heat of the outdoors again he be feel like a murderer he reason tell he that cold foot be yaller not worth save he reason tell he that he could save jig only by a confession that would drive he sinclair away from sour creek and he destine victim sandersen or he could save jig by violate the law and that also would drive he from sour creek and sandersen suddenly he halt in the midst of he pacing to and fro why be he turn these alternative back and forth in he mind because he understand all at once he have subconsciously determine that cold foot must not die the face of he brother rise up and look into he eye that be the friend of whom he would not speak to jig brother and friend at once and as surely as ever ghost call to live man that face demand the death of sandersen he blink the vision away i _ be _ go nutty muttered sinclair whether sandersen life or die jig be not go to dance at a rope 's end presently sally call he in to lunch and riley eat halfheartedly all during the meal neither sally nor john gaspar have more than a word for he while they talk steadily together they seem to understand each other so well that he feel a hidden insult in it once or twice he make a heavy attempt to enter the conversation always address he remark to sally bent he be receive graciously but he remark always fall dead and a moment later cold foot have pick up the fray end of he own talk and win the entire attention of sally riley be begin to understand why the youth of that district detest cold foot always take some soft-handed dude to make a win with a fool girl he comfort himself he expect the arrival of jerry bent before nightfall and with that arrival perhaps there would be a new sort of attack on he sally and cold foot be try persuasion but they might encourage jerry bent to attempt physical force with all he heart riley sinclair hope so he have a peculiar desire to do something significant for the eye of both sally and jig but nightfall come and then supper and still no jerry appear afterward sinclair make ready to sleep in jig 's room cold foot offer he the couch bed and I do not hitch declare riley throw two or three of the rug together i be not particular partial to a floor neither but these here rug will give it a sort of a ground softness he sit cross-legged on the low pile of rug while he pull off he boot and smoke he good-night cigarette jig coil up in a big chair while he study he jailer but how can you go to bed so early he ask early it be not early sun 's down be not it why do they bring on night except for folk to go to sleep for my part the best part of the day generally begin when the sun go down with patient contempt riley consider john gaspar you look kind of that way he decide aloud pale and not much good with you shoulder now what d'you most generally do with you time in the evening why -- talk talk huh a fine way of waste time for a growed-up man and i read you know i can see by the look of they shelf that you do how many of they book might you have read jig all of they i ask you man to man be not they mostly somebody 's idea of what life be i suppose that be a short way of put it and i ask you ag ` in what be better to take a secondhand hunch out of what somebody else think life might be or to go out and do some living on you own hook cold foot have be smile faintly up to this point as though he have many thing in reserve which might be say at need now he smile disappear perhaps you be right and maybe i be not sinclair brush the entire argument away into a thin mist of smoke now look here cold foot i be about to go to sleep and when i sleep i sure sleep sound take it by and large they 's time when i do not more 'n close one eye all night and they be time when you would have to pull my eye open one by one to wake I up understand i be go to sleep the second way tonight about eight hour of the soundest sleep you ever hear tell of jig consider he gravely i be afraid he answer that i will not sleep nearly as well riley sinclair smile would not be no way nacheral for you to do much sleep he agree take a gent that be in danger of have he neck stretch like you and most generally he do not do much sleep he lie around awake cuss he luck i s ` pose take you now cold foot and i s ` pose you 'll be figure on how far a hoss could carry you in the eight hour that i 'll be sleep eh there be a suggestive lift of the eyebrow as he speak but before jig have a chance to study he face he have turn and wrap himself in one of the rug he lay perfectly still stretch on one side with he back turn to jig he stir neither hand nor foot outside a door slam heavily cold foot hear the heavy voice of jerry bent and the beat of he heel across the floor in spite of those noise riley sinclair be presently sound asleep as he have promise gaspar know it by the rise and fall of the arm which lay along sinclair 's side also by the sound of he breathing cold foot go to the window and look out on the mountain black and huge with a faint shimmer of snow on the farthest summit at the very think of try to escape into that wilderness and wander alone among the peak he shudder he come back and study the sleeper something about the nonchalance with which sinclair have go to sleep under the very eye of he prisoner affect john gaspar strangely doubtless it be sheer contempt for the man he be guard and indeed something assure jig that no matter how well he employ the next eight hour in put a great distance between himself and sour creek the tireless ride of sinclair would more than make up the distance gaspar go to the door then turn sharply and glance over he shoulder at the sleeper but the eye of sinclair be still close and he regular breathing continue jig turn the knob cautiously and slip out into the living room jerry and sally beckon instantly to he from the far side of the room the beauty of the family have descend upon sally alone jerry be a swart-skinned squat bow-legged efficient cowpuncher he now amble awkwardly to meet john gaspar be you all set he ask for what to start on the trail exclaim jerry what else be not sinclair asleep how d'you know i listen at the door and hear he breathing a long time ago think you would never come out sally bent be already on the other side of gaspar draw he toward the door you can have my hoss jig she offer meg be sure as sin in the mountain you will not have nothing to fear on the worst trail they be not a thing assert jerry they half lead and half drag cold foot to the door i 'll show you the best way you see they two peak yonder like a pair of mule 's ear you start -- i do not know say jig it seem very difficult even to think of ride alone through those mountain sally be white with fear you be not go to throw away this chance jig it 'll mean hang sure if you do not run now ask jerry what they be say in sour creek tonight jerry volunteer the information they be all wonder why you be not string up today when they get so much evidence agin ' you also they be think that the boy play plumb foolish in turn you over to this stranger sinclair to guard but they be wait for sheriff kern to come over from woodville a ' nab you in the morning they be some that say that they will not wait if it look like the law be go to take too long to hang you they 'll get up a necktie party and break the jail and do they own hanging i hear all they thing and more jig john gaspar look uncertainly from one to the other of he friend you have _ get _ to go cry sally i have get to go admit cold foot in a whisper i have get meg saddle for you already she be plumb gentle just a minute i have forget something you do not mean you be go back into that room where sinclair be i will not waken he he be sleep like the dead jig turn away from they and hurry back to he room have open and close the door softly he go to a chest of drawer near the window and fumble in the half-light of the low-burning lamp he slip a small leather case into the breast pocket of he coat and then steal back toward the door as softly as before with he hand on the knob he pause and look back for all he know sinclair might be really awake now watch he quarry from beneath those heavy lash wait until he prisoner should have make a definite attempt to escape and then the big man would rise to he foot as soon as the door be close the picture become startlingly real to john gaspar sinclair would slip out that window no doubt and circle around toward the horse shed there he would wait until he prisoner come out on meg and then without warn would come a shot and there would be a end of sinclair 's trouble with he prisoner gaspar could easily attribute such cunning cruelty to sinclair and yet there be something untested unprobed different about the rangy fellow whatever it be it keep gaspar stare down into the lean face of sinclair for a long moment then he go resolutely back into the living room and face sally bent jerry be already wait outdoors i be not go say gaspar slowly i 'll stay sally cry out oh jig have you lose you nerve ag ` in be not you get _ no _ courage the schoolteacher sigh i be afraid not sally i guess my only courage come in wait and see how thing turn out he turn and go gloomily back to he room 12 with the first brightness of dawn sinclair waken even more suddenly that he have fall asleep there be no slow adjusting of himself to the requirement of the day one prodigious stretch of the long arm one great yawn and he be as wide awake as he would be at noon he jerk on he boot and rise and not until he stand up do he see john gaspar asleep in the big chair he head incline to one side the book half-fallen from he hand and the lamp sputter its last beside he but instead of view the weary face with pity sinclair burst into sudden and amaze profanity the first jarring note bring gaspar up and awake with a start and he stare in astonishment at the uninterrupted flood which ripple from the lip of the cowpuncher it conclude : still here of all the shorthorned fathead that i ever see the worst be this gaspar -- this jig -- this cold foot say man be not you get no spirit at all what do you mean asked gaspar still here of course i be still here do you expect I to escape sinclair flung himself into a chair speechless with rage and disgust do you think i be joke when i tell you i be go to sleep eight hour without wake up it might very well have be a trap you know sinclair groan son they be not any man in the world that 'll tell you that riley sinclair set he trap for bird that be not get they stiff feather grow yet trap for you what in thunder should i want you for eh he stride to the window still groan there be where you would ought to be over yonder behind they mule ear they would never catch you in a thousand year with that start eight hour start as good as have eight year kid -- just as good and you have throw that chance away he turn and stare mournfully at the schoolteacher it be not no use he say sadly i see it all now you be cut out to end in a rope collar not another word could be pry from he set lip during breakfast a gloomy meal to which sally bent come with red eye and jerry bent sullenly with black look at sinclair jig be the cheeriest one of the party that cheer at last bring another explosion from sinclair they stand in front of the house watch a horseman wind he way up the road through the hill it be sheriff kern say jerry bent i can tell by the way he ride sort of slant it be kern right enough sally bent choke but jig continue to hum softly singin ' ask riley sinclair suddenly be not you no more worried than that the voice of the schoolteacher in reply be as smooth as run water i think you 'll bring I out of the trouble safely enough mr sinclair mr sinclair 'll see you damned before he lift a hand for you riley retorted savagely he stride to he horse and expend he wrath by viciously jerk at the cinch until the mustang groan sheriff kern come suddenly into clear view around the last turn and ride quickly up to they a very short man muscular sweaty he always give the impression that he have be work ceaselessly for a week and certainly he find time to shave only once in ten day dense bristle cloud the lower feature of he face he be a taciturn man he greeting take the form of a single grunt he take possession of john gaspar with a single glance that send the latter nervously toward he saddle horse i see you get this party all ready for I say the sheriff more amiably to riley sinclair who be watch in disgust the clumsy method of jig 's mount you be sinclair i guess i be sinclair sheriff they shake hand nice bit of work you do for I sinclair keep the boy from string up jig yonder these here lynching do not set none too well on the reputation of a sheriff i guess we be ready to start s ` long sally -- jerry be you ride we way sinclair i think i would happen along be not never see woodville yet glad to have you but they be not much to see unless you look twice at the same thing they start down the trail three abreast ride on ahead command sinclair to jig we do not want you ride in the same line with man git on ahead john gaspar obey that brutal order with bow head he ride listlessly with loose rein let the pony pick its own way once sinclair look back to sally bent weep in the arm of she brother again he face grow black and yet confide the sheriff softly i be not never hear no trouble about this gaspar before he be poison declare sinclair bitterly and he raise he voice that it would unmistakably carry to the shrink figure before they he be such a yaller-hearted skunk sheriff that it make I ashamed of bein ' a man they be only one thing i misdoubt say the sheriff how would that sort of a gent ever get the nerve to murder a man like quade quade be not no tenderfoot and he could shoot a bit besides speak personal sheriff i do not think he do it now i have have a chance to go over the evidence maybe he do not but most like he 'll hang for it the boy be dead set agin ' he first he be a dude second he be a coward sour creek and woodville be not never cut out for that sort they be not want around that speech make riley sinclair profoundly thoughtful he have know well enough before this that there be small chance of jig escape from the damning judgment of twelve of these cowpuncher the statement of the sheriff make the belief a fact the death sentence of jig be pronounce the moment the door of the jail at woodville clang upon he they strike the trail to sour creek and almost immediately swing off on a branch which lead south and west in the opposite direction from the creek it be a day of high-driving cloud thin and fleecy so that they merely filter the sunlight and turn it into a haze without decrease the heat perceptibly and that heat grow until it become difficult to look down at the blaze sand now the trail climb among broken hill until they reach a summit from that point on now and again the road elbow into view of a wide plain and in the center of the plain there be a diminutive dump of building woodville say the sheriff hey you jig hustle that hoss along obediently the droop gaspar spur he horse the animal break into a gallop that set gaspar jolting in the seat with wildly flop elbow look at that say sinclair would you ever think that man could be bear as awkward as that would you ever think that man would be bear that do not have no use in the world he be not altogether useless decide the sheriff seem as how he be do noble in the school take on with the little boy and girl most amazing and he know how to keep even the eighth grader interested but what can you expect of a gent that be not get no more pride than to be a schoolteacher eh sinclair shake he head the trail drift downward now less brokenly and woodville come into view it be a wretched town in a wretched landscape far different from the wild hill and the rich plow grounds around sour creek all that come to life in the brief spring the long summer have long since burn away to drab yellow and brown a horrible place to die in sinclair thought speaking of hoss that be a wise-looking hoss you get sheriff ride he for five year say the sheriff raise he and bust he and train he all by myself be not nobody but I ever ride he he can go so soft-footed he would not bust egg sir and he can turn loose and run like the wind they be not no better hoss than this that be come under my eye sinclair be you much on the point of a hoss i use hoss -- i do not love 'em say sinclair gloomily but i can read the point tolerable the sheriff eye sinclair coldly so you do not love hoss eh he say return distantly to the subject it be easy to see where he own heart lay by the way he roan pick up its head whenever its master speak sheriff explain sinclair i be a single-shot gent i do not aim to have no scatter fire in what i like they be only one man that i ever call friend they be only one place that i ever call home -- the mountain yonder -- and they be only one hoss that i ever take to much i raise molly up by hand you might say she be ugly as sin but they be not nothing she could not do -- nothing he pause sheriff i use to talk to that hoss the sheriff be greatly move what become of she he ask softly i take after a gent once he could not hit I but he put a slug through molly what become of the gent ask the sheriff still more softly he die just a little later just how i be not prepare to state good say the sheriff he actually smile in the pleasure of newfound kinship you and I would get on proper sinclair most like this hoss of mine now have sense enough to take I home without I touch a rein know direction like a wolf could you guide she with you knee sure and she be plumb safe with you sure i know a gent once that say he would trust himself tie hand and foot on he hoss that go for I and my hoss too sinclair well then just shove up they hand sheriff the sheriff blink as the sun flash on the revolver in the steady hand of sinclair there be a significant little jerk up of the revolver each time the muzzle stir the hand of the sheriff jump higher and higher until he arm be stiffly stretch gaspar have halt he horse and look back in amazement i hate to do it declare sinclair right off i sort of take to you sheriff but this have get to be do sinclair have you do much thinking before you figure this all out enough if i knowed you one shade better sheriff i would take you word that you would ride on into woodville good and slow and not start no pursuit but i do not know you that well i get to tie you on the back of that steady old hoss of yours and turn you loose we need that much start he dismount still keep careful aim take the rope coil beside the sheriff 's own saddle horn and begin a swift and sure process of tie he work deftly without undue fear or haste and gaspar come back to look on with scared eye you be a fool sinclair murmur the sheriff you 'll never get shut of I i 'll foller you till i drop dead i 'll never forget you change you mind now and we 'll say nothing have happen but if you keep on you be do for as sure as my name be kern take you by yourself and you would be a handful to catch but two be easier than one and when one of they two be a deadweight like gaspar they be not nothing to it he finish he appeal completely truss i be not tie you on the hoss say sinclair take note of that also i be leave you you gun sheriff i hope you 'll have a chance to see 'em come out of the holster later on sinclair the cowpuncher take no notice of this bitterness gaspar who look on be astonish by a certain deferential politeness on the part of the big cowpuncher speak personal i hope i do not never have no trouble with you sheriff i like you understand have you little joke sinclair i mean it i know i be usin ' you like a skunk but i get a special need and i can not take no chance sheriff i tell you out of my heart that i be sorry will you believe I the sheriff smile the same as you 'll believe I when we change part sinclair the big man sigh i s ` pose it be get to be that way he say but if you come for I kern come all prime for action it 'll be a hard trail that be my specialty well sheriff s ` long -- and good luck the sheriff nod thanks press he horse with he knee kern start down the trail at a slow canter sinclair follow the retire figure nod with admiration at the skill with which the sheriff keep he mount under control merely by power of voice presently the latter turn a corner of the trail and be out of sight but -- i know -- i know exclaimed john gaspar only why do you let he go on into town the cold glance of sinclair rest on he companion what would you have do tie he up and leave he here i think you would -- to die in the sun he swing up into he saddle now gaspar we have start on what be like to prove the last trail for both of we understand by night we 'll both be outlaw they 'll have a price on we and long before night kern will be after we for the first time in you soft-hearted life you have get to work and you have get to fight i 'll do it mr sinclair bah save you talk talk 's dirt cheap i only ask one thing why have you do it because you fool i kill quade 13 from the first there be no thought in the sheriff 's mind of ride straight into woodville truss and helpless as he be woodville respect he and the whole district be proud of its sheriff he know that five minute of laughter can blast the finest reputation that be ever build by a lifetime of hard labor he know the very face of the man who would never let the story die of how the sheriff come into town not only without he prisoner but tie hand and foot helpless in the saddle without he prisoner never before in he twenty year as sheriff have a criminal escape from he hand many a time they have try and on those occasion he have bring back a dead body for the hand of the law this time he have ample excuse any man in the world might admit that he be helpless when such a fellow as riley sinclair take he by surprise he know sinclair well by reputation and he respect all that he have hear no matter for that the fact remain that he unbroken string of success be interrupted perhaps woodville would explain he failure away no doubt some of the man know of sinclair and would not wonder they would stand up doughtily for the prowess of they sheriff yet the fact hold that he have fail it be a moral defeat more than anything else he mind be make up to remain in the mountain until he starve or until he have remove those shameful rope -- he own rope at that think he writhe again but here a arroyo opening in the ragged wall of a cliff catch he eye he turn he horse into it and continue on he way until he see a project rock with a ragged edge leave where a great fragment have recently fall away here he find it strangely awkward and even perilous to dismount without he hand to balance he weight as he shift out of the stirrup in spite of he care he stumble over a loose rock as he strike the ground and roll flat on he back he get up grind he tooth he hand be tie behind he he turn he back on the broken rock and saw the rope against it to he dismay he feel the rock edge crumble away it be some chalky friable stuff and it give at the first friction bead of moisture start out on the sheriff 's forehead hastily he start on down the arroyo and find another rock with a edge not nearly so favorable in appearance but this time it be granite he lean he back against it and rub with a short shoulder motion until he arm ache but it be a happy labor he feel the rock edge take hold of the rope fray the strand to weakness and then eat into they it be very slow work the sun drift up to noon and still he be lean against that rock work patiently with he head near to burst and perspiration which he could not wipe away run down to blind he finally when he brain be begin to reel with the heat and he shoulder ache to numbness the last strand part the sheriff drop down to the ground to rest presently he draw out he jackknife and methodically cut the remain bond it come to he suddenly as he stand up that someone might have see this singular performance and carry the tale away for future laughter the thought drive the sheriff mad he swing savagely into the saddle and drive he horse at a dead run among the perilous going of that gorge when he reach the plain he pause hesitant between a bulldog desire to follow the trail single-handed into the mountain and run down the pair and a knowledge that he who retreat have a added power that would make such a pursuit rash beyond word a phrase which he have coin for the gossip of woodville come back into he mind he be no longer as young as he once be and even at he prime he shrewdly doubt he ability to cope with riley sinclair with the weight of gaspar throw in the thing become a impossibility gaspar might be a weakling but a man who be capable of murder be always dangerous to have be thwart once be shame enough but he dare not risk two failure with one man he must have help in plenty from woodville and fate willing he would one day have the pleasure of look down into the dead face of sinclair one day have the unspeakable joy of see the slender form of gaspar dangle from the end of a rope he mind be fill with the wicked pleasure of these picture until he come suddenly upon woodville he draw he horse back to a dogtrot to enter the town it be a short street that lead through woodville but short though it be the news that something be wrong with the sheriff reach the heart of the town before he do man be already pour out on the veranda of the hotel where be he sheriff be the greet never before have that question be ask he switch to one side in he saddle and make the speech that startle the mind of woodville for many a day boy i have be double-cross have any of you hear tell of riley sinclair he wait apparently calm inwardly he be breathless with excitement for accord to the size of riley 's reputation as a formidable man would be the size of he disgrace there be a brief pause old shaw fill the gap and he fill it to the complete satisfaction of the sheriff young hopkin be figure for the hardest man up in montana way he say that be till riley sinclair beat he what about sinclair it be he that double-cross I say the sheriff vastly relieved he come like a friend stick I up on the trail when i be not lookin ' for no trouble and he get away with gaspar a chorus astonished eager what do he do it for no man 'll ever know say the sheriff why not because sinclair 'll be dead before he have a chance to look a jury in the face there be more question the little crowd have get its breath again and the word come in volley the sheriff cut sharply through the noise where 's bill wood he be in town now charley will you find billy for I and ask he to slide over to my office thanks where 's arizona and red chalmer they go back to the ranch be a terrible big favor if you would go out and try to find 'em for I boy where 's joe stockton up to the lewi place old shaw strike in : you be not makin ' no mistake in pick the best you can get you 'll need 'em for this riley sinclair i have hear tell about he a pile the very best that woodville and its vicinity could offer be indeed what the sheriff be select another man would have look for number but the sheriff know well enough that number mean little speed and speed be one of the main essential for the task that lay before he he know each of the man he have name and he have know they for year with the exception of arizona but the latter come up from the southland have swiftly prove he ability in many a brawl bill wood be a peerless trailer red chalmer would the sheriff feel be one day a worthy aspirant for the office which he now hold and red be the only man the sheriff feel who could succeed to that perilous office as for joe stockton he be distinctly bad medicine but in a case like this it might very well be that poison would be the antidote for poison of all the man the sheriff know joe be the neatest hand with a gun the trouble with joe be that he appreciate he own ability and be fond of exhibit he prowess have send out for he assistant on the chase the sheriff retire to he office and set he affair in order there be not a great deal of paper work connect with he position in twenty minute he have clear he desk and by the time he have finish this task the first of he posse have saunter into the doorway and stand lean idly there roll a cigarette have a chair bill will you say the sheriff he tilted back in he own and toss he heel to the top of he desk get sort of warm today be not it bill wood have never see the sheriff so cheerful he sit down gingerly know well that some task of great danger lay before they 14 all that gaspar dread in riley sinclair have come true the schoolteacher draw he horse as far away as the trail allow and ride on in silence finally there be a stumble and it seem as if the word be jar out from he lip hitherto closely compress : _ you _ kill quade a scowl be he answer but he persist in the inquiry with a sort of tremble curiosity though he could see the angry emotion rise in sinclair the emotion of a murderer perhaps how with a gun fool how d'you think even that do not halt john gaspar be it a fair fight maybe -- maybe not it will not bring he back to life riley laugh with savage satisfaction gaspar watch he as a bird might watch a snake he have hear tale of man who could find satisfaction in a murder but he have never believe that a human being could actually gloat over he own savagery he stare at riley as if he be look at a wild beast that must be placate thereafter the talk be short now and again sinclair give some curt direction but they put mile after mile behind they without a

sinclair 's heavy brow show that he have hear but he do not raise he head do not do what do not try to kill that second man do not do it gaspar be reward with a sneer why not the schoolteacher be

have just drop over the crest and be wind leisurely down toward the plain below we can get behind that knoll perhaps before he see we suggest jig in a whisper he suggestion meet with no favor you hear I talk son say sinclair dryly that gent be not carry no gun which mean that he be not on we trail we be figure particularly desperate he point this remark with a cold survey of the desperate jig but the best way to make danger follow you jig be to run away from it we stay put he emphasize the remark by stretch luxuriously gaspar however do not seem to hear the last word something about the strange horseman have apparently rivet he interest he last gesture be arrest halfway and he color change perceptibly you stay then mr sinclair he say hurriedly i be go to slip down the hill and -- you stay where you be cut in sinclair but i have a reason you reason be not no good you stay put you hear it seem that a torrent of explanation be about to pour from the lip of jig but he restrain himself white of face and sink down in the shade of the tree there he stretch himself out hastily with he hand cup behind he head and he hat tilted so far down over he face that he entire head be hide sinclair follow these proceedings with a lackluster eye when you _ do _ move jig he say you be not so slow about it that be pretty good fake take it all in all but why do not you want this strange gent to see you face a slight shudder be the only reply then jig lay deadly still in the meantime before sinclair could pursue he question the horseman be almost upon they the cowpuncher regard he with distinct approval he be a man of the country and he show it as he pony slouch down the slope pick its way dexterously among the rock the rider meet each jolt on the way with a easy swing of he shoulder ride straight up just enough of he weight fall into he stirrup to break the jar on the back of the mustang the stranger draw up on the trail and swing the head of he horse in toward the tree raise he hand in cavalier greet he be a sunbrowned fellow as tall as sinclair and more heavily build as for he age he seem in that joyous prime of physical life twenty-five sinclair nod amiably might that be sour creek yonder ask the brown man it might be i reckon it be get down and rest you hoss thanks maybe i will he drop to the ground and ease and stiffen he knee to get out the cramp of long ride off the horse he seem even bigger and more capable than before and now that he have come sufficiently close so that the shadow from he sombrero 's brim do not partially mask the upper part of he face it seem to sinclair that about the eye he be not nearly so prepossessing as around the clean-cut fighter 's mouth and chin the eye be just a trifle too small a trifle too close together yet on the whole he be a handsome fellow as he push back he hat and wipe he forehead dry with a gay silk handkerchief sinclair note furthermore that the other have a proper cowpuncher 's pride in he dress he bench-made boot mold he long and slender foot to a nicety and fit like glove around the high instep the polished spur with they spoon-handle curve gleam and flash as he step with a faint jingle the braid about he sombrero be a thing of price these detail sinclair note the rest do not matter the kid 's asleep ask the stranger cast a careless glance at the slim form of jig i reckon so he do it almighty sudden thought i see he up and walk around when i come over the hill you get good eye say sinclair but he be instantly put on the defensive he be heartily tire of cold foot gaspar he peculiarity he whim he weakness but cold foot be he ride companion and this be a stranger he be throw suddenly in the position of a defender of the helpless that be the way with these kid he confide carelessly to the stranger they get out and ride fast for a couple of hour full of ambition they be but just when a grow man get warm up to he work they be through the kid 's tire out come far ask the stranger tolerable long way sinclair dislike question and for each interrogation he opinion of the newcomer descend lower and lower he own father have raise he on a stern pattern what you mean by question riley what you can not figure out with you own eye and ear and good common hoss sense most likely the other gent do not want you to know thereafter he have school himself in this particular point he could suppress all curiosity and go six month without know more than the nickname of a boon companion you come from sour creek maybe go on the other sort of reply sinclair dryly he companion proceed to dispense information on he own part so as to break the ice i be jude cartwright he pause significantly but sinclair 's face be a blank glad to know you mr cartwright mostly they call I long riley how be you riley they shake hand heartily cartwright take a place on the ground cross-legged and not far from sinclair i guess you do not know I he ask pointedly i guess not i be of the jesse cartwright family sinclair smile blankly lucky cartwright be my dad 's name that so i guess you be not ever be up montana way say the stranger in disgust which he hardly veil not much say sinclair blandly i wish that i be back up there this be a hole of a country down here hossflesh and time will take you back i reckon i reckon they will when my job 's do he turn a disparage eye upon sour creek and its vicinity now who would want to live in a town like that can you tell I it occur very strongly to riley sinclair that cartwright have not yet fully ascertain whether or not he companion come from that very town and although the day before he have decide that sour creek be most undesirable and all that pertain to it this unasked confirmation of he own opinion grate on he nerve well they seem to be a few that get along tolerable well in that town partner they be ten fool for one wise man declare cartwright sententiously sinclair veil he eye with a downward glance he dare not let the other see the cold gleam which he know be come into they i guess they 's true word tolerable true admit cartwright but i have ride a long way and this be not much to find at the end of the trail maybe it 'll pan out pretty well after all if sour creek hold the person i be after i 'll call it a good-paying game i hope you find you friend remark riley with he deceptive softness of tone friend hell and that be where this friend will wish I when i heave in sight you can lay to that and long odds sinclair wait but the other change he tack at once if you be not from sour creek i guess you can not tell I what i want to know maybe not the brown man look about he for diversion presently he eye rest on cold foot who have not stir during all this interval son nope kid brother nope cartwright frown not much of nothing i figure he say with marked insolence maybe not reply sinclair and again he glance down he be sleep long enough i reckon declare the brown man let 's have a look at he hey kid cold foot quiver but seem lose in a profound sleep cartwright reach for a small stone and juggle it in the palm of he hand this 'll surprise he he chuckle better not murmured sinclair why not might land on he face and hurt he it will not hurt he bad besides kid ought to learn not to sleep in the daytime be not a good idea any way you look at it put fog in the head he poise the stone you might hit he eye you see say sinclair leave that to I but as he arm twist back for the throw the hand of sinclair flash out and lean finger crush the wrist of cartwright yet sinclair 's voice be still soft better not he say they sit confront each other for a moment the stone drop from the numbed finger of cartwright and sinclair release he wrist they character be more easily read in the crisis cartwright 's face flush and a purple vein run down he forehead between the eye sinclair turn pale he seem indeed almost afraid and apparently cartwright take he cue from the pallor i see he say sneeringly you get you gun on be that it sinclair slip off the cartridge belt do i look better to you now a pile better say cartwright they rise still confront each other it be strange how swiftly they have plunge into strife i guess you 'll be roll along cartwright nope i guess i like it tolerable well under this here tree except that i come here first partner and maybe you 'll be the first to leave i would have to be persuade a pile how 's this to start you along he flick the back of he hand across the lip of sinclair and then spring back as far as he long leg would carry he so do the first leap of sinclair miss he and when the cowpuncher turn he be meet with a stunning blow on the side of the head at once the blind anger fade from the eye of riley by the weight of that first blow he know that he have encounter a worthy foeman and by the position of cartwright he could tell that he have meet a confident one the big fellow be perfectly poise with he weight well back on he right foot he left foot feel he way over the rough ground as he advance always collect for a heavy blow or for a leap in any direction he carry he guard high with apparent contempt for a attack on he body after the manner of a practice boxer as for riley sinclair boxing be greek to he he battle have be those of bullet and sharp steel or sudden brutal fracas where the rule be to strike with the first weapon that come to hand this single encounter hand to hand be more or less of a novelty to he but instead of abashing or cow he it merely bring to the surface all he coldness of mind all of he cunning he circle cartwright he long arm dangle low he step soft and quick as the stride of a great cat and always there be think in he face one gain a impression that if ever he close with he enemy the battle would end apparently even cartwright gain that impression he own brute confidence of skill and power be suddenly tinge with doubt instead of wait he lead suddenly with he leave a blow that tilted the head of sinclair back and then spring in with a crush right it be poor tactic for half of a boxer 's nice skill be lose in a plunge attack the second blow shot hum past sinclair as the latter dodge and before the brown man could recover he poise the cowpuncher have dive in under the guard arm a shrill cry rise from cold foot a cry so sharp and shrill that it send a chill down the back of sinclair for a moment he whirl with the weight of he struggle cursing enemy and then he right hand shoot up over the shoulder of cartwright and clutch he chin with that leverage one convulsive jerk throw cartwright heavily back he roll on he side with sinclair follow like a wildcat but cartwright as he fall have close he finger on a jagged little stone sinclair see the blow come swerve from it and straightway go mad the brown man become a helpless bulk the knee of sinclair be plant on he shoulder the talon finger of sinclair be bury in he throat then -- he see it only dimly through he red anger and hardly feel it at all -- jig 's hand be tear at he wrist he look up in dull surprise into the face of john gaspar for heaven 's sake jig be plead stop but what check sinclair be not the schoolteacher cartwright have be fight with the fury of one who see death only inch away suddenly he grow limp you he cry you to the astonishment of sinclair the gaze of the beaten man rest directly upon the face of jig yes gaspar admit faintly it be i sinclair release he grip and stand back while cartwright stumble to he foot stand waver breathing harshly and finger he injured throat i know i would find you he say but i never dream i would find you like this i know what you think say cold foot utterly colorless but you think wrong jude you think entirely wrong you lie like a devil on my honor honor you be not get none honor he fling himself into he saddle now that i have locate you the next time i come it 'll be with a gun he turn a convulse face toward sinclair and that go for you partner say riley sinclair that be the best thing i have hear you say until then so long the other wrench he horse about and go down the trail at a reckless gallop plunge out of view around the first shoulder of a hill 15 sinclair watch he out of sight he turn to find that jig have slump against the tree and stand with he arm throw across he face it remind he with a curious pang of mingled pity and disgust of the way gaspar have face the mask man of sour creek 's posse the day before there be the same unmanly abnegation of the courage to meet danger and look it in the eye here again the schoolteacher be wince from the very memory of a crisis look here exclaim sinclair he contempt ring in he voice they be not any danger now turn around here and buck up keep you chin high and look a man in the face will you slowly the arm descend he find himself look into a white and tortured face he respect for the schoolteacher rise somewhat the very fact that the little man could endure such pain in silence no matter what that pain might be be something to he credit now come out with it gaspar you double-cross this cartwright eh yes whisper jig will you tell I not that i make a business of prying into the affair of other gent but i figure i might be able to help you straighten thing out with this cartwright he make a wry face and then rub the side of he head where a lump be slowly grow of all the gent that i ever see say sinclair softly i be not never see none that make I want to tangle with 'em so powerful bad and of all the poison fathead all the mean sneakin ' advantage-takin ' skunks that ever i run up again ' this gent cartwright be the worst if he hide be worth a million a inch i would have it if he be to pay I a hundred thousand a day i would not be he pal for a minute he pause they take 'em by and large be my sentiment about this here cartwright so open up and tell I what you do to he to he very real surprise the schoolteacher shake he head i can not do it h be say sinclair cut to the quick can not you trust I with it eh ah murmured gaspar of all the man in the world you be the one i would tell it to most easily but i can not -- i can not i do not care whether you tell I or not whatever you do it must have be plumb bad if you can not even tell it to a gent that like cartwright like he like poison it be bad say jig slowly it be very bad -- it be a sin until i die i can never repay he for what i have do sinclair recover some of he good nature at this outburst of self-accusation i 'll be hang if i believe it he declare bluntly not a word of it when you come right down to the point you 'll find out that you be not be half so bad as you think the way i figure you be this jig you be not so bad except that you be not get no nerve be it a matter of lose you nerve that make cartwright mad at you yes it be altogether that sinclair sigh too bad i do not blame you for not want to talk about it they be a flaw in everything jig and this be yours if i be to be around you much d'you know what i would do what i would try to plumb forget about this flaw of yours : that be a fact but as far as cartwright go to blaze with he and that be where he be apt to wind up pronto if he be as good as he word and come after I with a gun in the meantime you grab you hoss kid and slide back into sour creek and show the boy this here confession i have write you can add one thing i do not put it in because i knowed they would not believe I i kill quade fair and square i give he the first move for he gun and then i beat he to the draw and kill he on a even break that be the straight of it i know they will not believe it matter of fact i be say it for you jig more 'n i be for they it be a amazing thing to see the sudden light that flood the face of the schoolteacher and i do believe you sinclair he say with all my heart i believe you and know you could not have take a unfair advantage h be muttered riley it be not bad to hear you say that and now trot along son cold foot make no move to obey not that i would not like to have you along but where i get to go you would be a weight around my neck besides you game be to show the folk down yonder that you be not a murderer and that paper i have give you will prove it we 'll drift together along the trail part way and down yonder i turn up for the tall timber to all this jig return no answer but in a peculiarly lifeless manner go to he horse and climb in he awkward way into the saddle they go down the trail slowly because explain the cowpuncher if i save my hoss 's wind i may be save my own life where the trail bent like a elbow and shot sheer down for the plain and sour creek riley sinclair point he horse 's nose up to the taller mountain but jig sit he horse in melancholy silence and look mournfully up at he companion so long say sinclair cheerily and when you get down yonder it 'll happen most likely that pretty soon you 'll hear a lot of hard thing about riley sinclair if i do -- if i hear a syllable against you cry the schoolteacher with a flare of color i 'll -- i 'll drive the word back into they tooth he shake with he emotion riley sinclair shake with controlled laughter would you do all of that partner well i believe you would try what i mean to say be this : no matter what they say you can lay to it that sinclair have try to play square and clean accord to he own light which be not always the best in the world so long there be no answer he find himself look down into the quiver face of the schoolteacher why kid you look all bust up riley gasp jig very faintly i can not go and why not because i can not meet jude cartwright eh but you get to sooner or later i 'll die first would you nerve hold you up through that so easily say jig there be such a simple gravity and despair in he expression that sinclair believe it he grunt and stare hard this cartwright gent be worse 'n death to you a thousand thousand time how come i can not tell you i kind of wish say sinclair thoughtfully that i would keep my grip a mite longer no no you do not wish he dead jig shudder you plumb beat I partner and now you want to come along with I sinclair grin a outlaw 's life be not what it be crack up to be son you would last about a day do what i have to do you 'll find say the schoolteacher eagerly that i can stand it amazingly well i 'll -- i 'll be far far stronger than you expect somehow i kind of believe it but it be for you own fool sake son that i do not want you along let I try plead jig eagerly the other shake he head and seem to change he mind in the very midst of the gesture why not he ask himself you 'll get enough of it inside of a day and then you 'll find out that they be some thing about as bad as death -- or cartwright come on kid 16 it be a weary ride that bring they to the end of that day and to a camping place it seem to jig that the world be make up of nothing but the up and downs of that mountain trail now as the sun go down they come out on a flat shoulder of the mountain far below they lay sour creek long lose in the shadow of premature night which fill the valley here we be fix up as comfortable as can be say sinclair cheerily there be water and there be wood aplenty what could a gent ask for more and here 's my country for a moment he expression soften as he look over the black peak step away to the north now he point out a grove of tree and on the other side of the little plateau be hear the murmur of a feeble spring riley swing down easily from the saddle but when jig dismount he knee buckle with weariness and he slip down on a rock he be unheed for a moment by the cowpuncher who be remove from he saddle the quarter of a deer which he have shoot at the foot of the mountain when this task be end a stern voice bring jig to he foot what be all this how come go to let that hoss stand there all night with he saddle on hurry up all right reply the schoolteacher but he voice quake with weariness and the cinch knot draw taut by the powerful hand of jerry bent refuse to loosen he struggle with it until he finger ache and he panicky breath come in gasp of nervous excitement presently he be aware of the tall dark form of sinclair behind he he saddle sling across he arm by gun mutter sinclair it be not possible not enough muscle to untie a knot it be a good thing that you father can not see the sort of a son that he turn out lemme at that under he strong finger the knot give by magic now yank that saddle off and put it yonder with mine jig pull back the saddle but when the full weight jerk down on he he stagger and he begin to drag the heavy load hey cut in the voice of the tyrant want to spoil that saddle kid lift it can not you gaspar obey with a start and have place it in the require position turn and wait guiltily time you be learn something about camp out declare the cowpuncher and i 'll teach you take this ax and gimme some wood pronto he hand over a short ax heavy-headed and small of haft that bush yonder that be dead or dead enough for we plainly jig be in awe of that ax he carry it well out from he side as if he fear the least touch against he leg might mean a cut of all this riley sinclair be aware with a gradually darkening expression he have be partly win to jig that day but he better opinion of the schoolteacher be be fast undermine with a gloomy eye he watch john gaspar drop on he knee at the base of the designate shrub and raise the ax slowly -- in both hand not only that but the head remain poise hung over the schoolteacher 's shoulder when the blow fall instead of striking solidly on the trunk of the bush it crash futilely through a branch riley sinclair draw closer to watch it be excusable perhaps for a man to be unable to ride or to shoot or to face other man but it be inconceivable that any live creature should be so clumsy with a common ax to he consummate disgust the work of jig become worse and worse no two blow fall on the same spot the trunk of the little tree become bruised but even when the edge of the ax do not strike on a branch at most it merely slice into the outer surface of the wood and leave the heart untouch it be a process of gnawing not of chop to crown the terrible exhibition jig now rest from he labor and examine the palm of he hand which have become a bright red gimme the ax say sinclair shortly he dare not trust himself to more speech and snatch it from the hand of cold foot bury the blade into the very heart of the trunk another blow drive home with equal power and precision on the opposite side make the tree shudder to its top and the third blow send it swish to the earth this bring a short cry of admiration and wonder from the schoolteacher for which sinclair reward he with one glance of contempt with sweeping stroke he clear away the half-dead branch presently the trunk be naked on it riley now concentrate he attack make the short ax whistle over he shoulder the trunk of the shrub be divide into handy portion as if by magic still john gaspar stand by gaping apparently find nothing to do and this with a camp barely start it be easier to do oneself however than to give direction to such stupidity sinclair sweep up a armful of wood and stride off to the spot he have select for the campfire near the place where the spring water run into a small pool a couple of big rock throw in place furnish a windbreak between they he heap dead twig and in a moment the flame be leap as soon as the fire be light they become aware that the night be well nigh upon they hitherto the day have seem some distance from its final end for there be still color in the sky and the top of the western mountain be still bright but with the presence of fire brightness the rest of the world become dim the western peak be ghostly the sky fade to the ash of its former splendor and jig find himself look down upon thick night in the lower valley he see the eye of the horse glisten as they raise they head to watch the gaunt form of sinclair seem enormous stoop about the fire enormous shadow drift above and behind he sometimes the light flush over he lean face and glint in he eye again he head be lose in shadow and perhaps only the active reach hand be illuminate brightly he prepare the deer meat with incomprehensible swiftness at the same time arrange the fire so that it rapidly burn down to a firm strong level bed of coal and by the time the bed of coal be ready the meat be prepare in thick steak to broil over it in a little time the rich brown of the cooking venison streak across to jig he have keep at a distance up to this time realize that he be in disgrace now he drift near he be reward by a amiable grin from riley sinclair whose ugly humor seem to have vanish at the odor of the broiling meat watch this meat cook kid will you there be something you can do that do not take no muscle and do not take no knowledge all you get to do be to keep listen with you _ nose _ and if you smell it burn yank she off understand and do not let the fire blaze she be apt to flare up at the corner you see and these here twig be apt to burn through -- these one that keep the meat off 'n the coal watch they too and that be all you get to do can you manage all they thing at once jig nod gravely as though he fail to see the contempt i see a fine patch of grass down the hill a bit i be go to take the hoss down there and hobble 'em out whistle sinclair stride off down the hill lead the horse after he the schoolteacher watch he go and when the form have vanish and only the echo of the whistle blow back he look up the last life be go from the sunset the last time he glance up there have be only a few dim star now they have come down in multitude great yellow planet and whole rift of steel-blue star he take from he pocket the old envelope which sinclair have give he examine the scribble confession chuckle at the crude labor with which the writing have be draw out and then deliberately stuff the paper into a corner of the fire it flame up singe the cooking meat but john gaspar pay no heed he be stare off down the hill to make sure that sinclair should not return in time to see that little act of destruction a act of self-destruction too it well might turn out to be as for sinclair have find he pastureland where the grass grow thick and tall he be in no hurry to return to he clumsy companion he listen for a time to the sound of the horse rip away the grass close to the ground and to the grate as they chew then he turn he attention to the mountain he spirit be easier in this place he breathe more easily there be a sense of freedom at once and companionship he linger so long indeed that he suddenly become aware that time have slip away from he and that the venison must be long since do at that he hurry back up the slope he be hungry ravenously hungry but the first thing that greet he be the scent of burn meat it stop he short and he hand grip involuntarily in that first burst of passion he want literally to wring the neck of the schoolteacher he stride closer it be as he think the twig have burn away from beneath the steak and allow it to drop into the cinder and beside the die fire barely illuminate by it sit jig sound asleep with he head rest on he knee for a moment sinclair have to fight with himself for control all he murderous evil temper have flare up into he brain and set he tooth grit at length he could trust himself enough to reach down and set he heavy grip on the shoulder of the sleeper even in sleep jig must have be pursue by a burden consciousness of guilt now he jerk up he head and stammer up to the shadowy face of sinclair i -- i do not know -- all at once it happen you see the fire -- but the telltale odor of the char meat strike he nostril and he speech die away he be pant with fear of consequence now a new turn come to the fear of cold foot it seem that riley sinclair 's hand have freeze at the touch of the soft flesh of jig 's shoulder he remain for a long moment without stir when he hand move it be to take jig under the chin with marvelous firmness and gentleness at once and lift the face of the schoolteacher he seem to find much to read there much to study and know whatever it be it set jig tremble until suddenly he shrink away cower against the rock behind you do not think -- but the voice of sinclair break in with a note in it that jig have never hear before gun and glory -- a woman it come over he with a rush that revelation which explain so many thing -- everything in fact all that strange cowardice and all that stranger grace that unmanly shrink that more than manly contempt for death now the firelight be too feeble to show more than one thing -- the haunt eye of the girl as she cower away from he he see she hand drop from she breast to she holster and close around the butt of she revolver sinclair grow cold and sick after all what reason have she to trust he he draw back and begin to walk up and down with long slow stride the girl follow he and see he gaunt figure brush across the star she see the wind furl and unfurl the wide brim of he hat and she hear the faint stir and clink of he spur at every step there be a tumult in the brain of the cowpuncher the star and the sky and the mountain and wind go out they be nothing in the electric presence of this new jig he mind flash back to one picture -- cold foot with she hand tie behind she back pray under the cottonwood shame turn the cowpuncher hot and then cold he allow he mind to drift back over he thousand insult he brutal language he cursing he mockery he open contempt there be a tingle in he ear and a chill run up and down he spine after all that brutality what mysterious sense have tell she to trust to he rather than to sour creek and its man other mystery flock into he mind why have she come to the very verge of death with the rope around she neck rather than reveal she identity know as she must know that in the mountain desert man feel some touch of holiness in every woman he remember cartwright tall handsome and narrow of eye and the fear of the girl suddenly he wish with all he soul that he have fight with gun that day and not with fist 17 at length the continue silence of the girl make he turn perhaps she have slip away he heart be chill at the thought turn he sigh with relief to find she still there without a word he go back and rekindle the fire place new venison steak over it and broil they with silent care not a sound from jig not a sound from the cowpuncher while the meat hiss blacken and at length be do to a turn he lay portion of it on broad white clean chip which he have already prepare and serve she still in silence she eat shame hold sinclair he dare not look at she and he be glad when the fire lose some of its brightness now and then he look with wonder across the mountain all he life they have be face to he and the wind have be a voice now all this be nothing but dead stuff there be no purpose in the march of the mountain except that they lead to the place where jig sit he twist together a cup of bark and bring she water from the spring she thank he with word that he do not hear he be so intent in watch she face as the firelight play on it now that he hold the clue everything be as plain as day new light play on the past turn away he put new fuel on the fire and when he look to she again she have unbelt the revolver and be put it away as if she realize that this would not help she if she be in danger when at length she speak it be the same voice and yet how new the quality in it make sinclair sit a little straighter you have a right to know everything that i can tell you do you wish to hear for another moment he smoke in solemn silence he find that he be wish for the story not so much because of its strangeness but because he want that voice to run on indefinitely yet he weigh the question pro and con here be the point jig he say at last i get a good deal to make up to you in the first place i pretty near let you get string up for a killing i do myself then i be treat you pretty hard take it all in all you get a story and i do not deny that i would like to hear it but it do not seem a story that you be fond of tell and i be not get no right to ask for it all i ask to know be one thing : when you stand there under that cotton wood tree with a rope around you neck do you know that all you have to do be to tell we that you be a woman to get off free of course and you would sooner have hang than tell we yes sinclair sigh maybe i have say this before but i get to say it ag ` in : jig you plumb beat I he brush he hand across he forehead s ` pose it would be do s ` pose i have let 'em go ahead and string

after you would sentence I to hang do not go back to that i sure be a plumb fool but why would you have go ahead and let that hang happen because i have rather die than be know except to you you leave I out i would trust you to the end of everything riley i b ` lieve you would jig -- i honest believe you would heaven know why because that be not a reason a very good woman 's reason for one thing you have let I come along when you know that i be a weight and you be in danger but you do not know what it mean if i go back you can not know i know it be wrong and cowardly for I to stay and imperil you but i _ be _ a coward and i be afraid to go back hush up murmured sinclair hush up girl be they anybody ask you to go back but you do not really figure on hang out here with I in the mountain I have most of the gent in these part out look for my scalp if you think i will not be such a encumbrance that i 'll greatly endanger you riley h be muttered sinclair i 'll take that chance but they be another thing well it be not exactly nacheral and reasonable for a girl to go around in the mountain with a man she fire up at that sit straight with the fire flare suddenly in she face through the change of position i have tell you that i trust you riley what do i care about the opinion of the world have not they hound I oh i despise they h be say the cowpuncher again he be indeed so abashed by this outbreak that he merely steal a glance at she face and then study the fire again do this gent cartwright tie up with you story all the fire leave she yes she whisper he feel that she be search he face as if suddenly in doubt of he will you let I tell you -- everything shoot ahead some part will be hard to believe lady they will not be nothing as hard to believe as what i have see you do with my own eye then she begin to tell she story and she find a vast comfort in see the ugly stern face of sinclair light by the burning end of he cigarette he never look at she but always fix he stare on the sea of blackness which be the lower valley all the trouble begin with a theory my father feel that the thing for a girl be to be educate in the east and marry in the west he be full of maxim you see ` they turn out knowledge in city they turn out man in mountain ' be one of he maxim he think and argue and live along those line so as soon as i be half grow -- oh i be a wild tomboy eh cut in sinclair i could really do the thing then that you would like to have a woman do she say i could ride anything swim like a fish in snow water climb run and do anything a boy could do i suppose that be the sort of a woman you admire I exclaimed riley with violence it be not so jig i be revise my idea on woman lately besides i never give 'em much think before he say all this without glance at she so that she be able to indulge in a smile before she go on just at that point when i be about to become a true daughter of the west dad snap I off to school in the east and then for year and year there be no west at all for I except a little trip here and there in vacation time the rest of it be just study and play all in the east i still like the west -- in theory you know h be muttered riley and then i think it be a year ago i have a letter from dad with important news in it he have just come back from a hunting trip with a young fellow who he think represent everything fine in the west he be big good-looking steady have a large estate dad set he mind on have I marry he and he tell I so in the letter of course i be upset at the idea of marry a man i do not know but dad always have a very controlling way with he i have lose any habit of think for myself in important matter besides there be a consolation dad send the picture of he man along with he letter the picture be in profile and it show I a fine-looking fellow with a glorious carriage a high head and ocean of strength and manliness i really fall in love with that picture to begin with i think that it be destiny for I and that i have to love that man whether i wish to or not i admit that picture into my inmost life dream about it keep it near I in my room and just about that time come news that my father be seriously ill and then that he have die and that he last wish be for I to come west at once and marry my choose husband of course i come at once i be too sick and sad for dad to think much about my own future and when i step off the train i meet the first shock my husband to be be wait for I he be enough like the picture for I to recognize he and that be all he be tall and strong enough and manly enough but in full face i think he be narrow between the eye and -- it be cartwright yes yes how do you guess that i dunno say sinclair softly but when that gent ride off today something tell I that i be go to tangle with he later on go on he be very kind to I after the first moment of disappointment -- you see i have be dream about he for a good many week -- i grow to like he and accept he again he do all that he could to make the trip home agreeable he do not press himself on I he do nothing to make I feel that he understand dad 's wish about we marriage and expect I to live up to they after the funeral it be the same way he come to see I only now and then he be courteous and attentive and he seem to be fond of I a fox snarl sinclair grow more and more excited as this narrative continue that be the way with one of they kind they play a game never out in the open wait till they win and then act the devil go on perhaps you be right he visit become more and more frequent finally he ask I to marry he that bring the truth of my position home to I and i find all at once that though i have rather like he as a friend i have to quake at the idea of he as a husband sinclair snap he cigarette into the coal of the fire and set he jaw she like he in he anger but what could i do all of the last part of dad 's life have be pointed toward this one thing i feel that he would come out of he grave and haunt I i ask for one more day to think it over he tell I to take a month or a year as i pleased and that make I ashamed i tell he on the spot that i would marry he but that i do not love he i 'll tell you what he answer -- curse he exclaim sinclair what through the year that be comin ' he would teach you to love he that be exactly what he say in those very word how do you guess that i 'll tell you i get a sort of a second sight for the way of a snake or a ornery hoss or a sneak of a man go on i think you have at any rate after i have tell he i would marry he he press I to set the date as early as possible and i agree there be only a ten-day interval those ten day be fill i keep myself busy so that i would not have a chance to think about the future though of course i do not really know how i dread it i talk to the only girl who be near enough to I to be call a friend ` find a man you can respect that be the main thing ' she always say ` you 'll learn to love he later on ' it be a great comfort to I i keep think back to that advice all the time they be nothing worse than a talky woman declare sinclair hotly go on then all at once the day come i 'll never forget how i waken that morning and look out at the sun i have a queer feeling that even the sunshine would never seem the same after that day it be like go to a death so you go to this gent and tell he just how you feel and he let you promise slide no sinclair groan i could not go to he i do not dare i do not imagine that i ever think of such a thing then there be crowd of people around all day give I good wish and all the time i feel like death somehow i get to the church everything be hazy to I and my heart be thunder all the time in the church there be a blur of face all at once the blur clear i see jude cartwright and i know i could not marry he brave girl cry sinclair he relief come out in almost a shout you stop there at the last minute ah if i have no i do not stop i go on to the altar and meet he there and -- you be not marry to he i be go on sinclair say huskily the end of it come somehow i find a flood of people call to I and press around I and all the time i be think of nothing but the new ring on my finger and the weight -- the horrible weight of it we go back to my father 's house i manage to get away from all the merrymaking and go to my room the minute the door close behind I and shut away they voice and singing into the distance i feel that i have save one last minute of freedom i go to the window and look out at the mountain the star be come out all at once my knee give way and i begin to weep on the window sill i hear voice come and i know that i must not let they see I with the tear run down my face but the tear would not stop come i run to the door and lock it then someone try to open the door and i hear the voice of my aunt jane call i gather all my nerve and make my voice steady i tell she that i could not let anyone in that i be prepare a surprise for they ` be you happy dear ' ask aunt jane i make myself laugh ` so happy ' i call back to she then they go away but as soon as they be go i know that i could never go out and meet they partly because i have no surprise for they partly because i do not want they to see the tear stain and my red eye somehow little silly thing be as big and as important as the main thing -- that i could never be the real wife of jude cartwright can you understand jig once when i have a deer under my trigger i let he go because he have a funny-shaped horn sure it be the little thing that run a gent 's life go on i know that i have to escape but how could i escape in a place where everybody know I first i thought of change my clothes then another thing -- man 's clothes the moment that idea come i be sure it be the thing i open the door very softly there be no one upstairs just then i run into my cousin 's room -- he be a youngster of fifteen -- and snatch the first boot and clothes that i could find and rush back to my own room i jump into they hardly know what i be do for they be begin to call to I from downstairs i open the door and call back to they and i hear jude cartwright answer in a big voice i turn around and see myself in the mirror in boy 's clothes with my face as white as a sheet my eye stare my hair pour down over my shoulder i run to the bureau and find a scissors then i hesitate a moment you do not dream how hard it be to do my hair be long you see below my waist and i have always be proud of it but i close my eye and gritted my tooth and cut it off with great slash close to my head then i stand with all that mass of hair shine in my hand and a queer light feeling in my head but i feel that i be free i clamp on my cousin 's hat -- how queer it feel with all that hair cut off i bundle the hair into my pocket because they must not dream what i have do then someone beat on the door ` come ' i call to they i run to the window the house be build on a slope and it be not a very long drop to the ground i suppose but to I it seem neck-breaking that distance it be dark and i climb out and hang by my hand but i could not find courage to let go then i try to climb back but there be not any strength in my arm i cry out for help but the singing downstairs must have muffle the sound my finger grow numb -- they slip on the sill -- and then i fall the fall stun I i guess for a moment when i open my eye i see the star and know that i be free i start up then and strike straight across country at first i do not care where i go so long as it be away but when i get over the first hill i make up a plan that be to go for the railroad and take a train i do it there be a long walk ahead of I before i reach the station and with my cousin 's big boot wobble on my foot i be very tired when i reach it there be some freight car on the siding and there be hay on the floor of one of they i crawl into the open door and go to sleep after a while i wake up with a great jarring and jolting and noise i find the car pitch dark the door be close and pretty soon by the roar of the wheel under I and the swing of the floor of the car i know that a engine have pick up the empty car it be a terrible time for I i have hear story of tramp lock into car and starve there before the door be open before the morning shone through the crack of the board i go through all the pain of a death from thirst but before noon the train stop and the car be drop at a siding i climb out when they open the door the man who see I only laugh i suppose he could have arrest I ` all right kid but you be hit the road early in life eh ' those be the first word that be speak to I as a man i do not know where i should go but the train have take I south and that make I remember a town where my father have live for a long time -- sour creek i start to get to this place the hardest thing i have to do be the very first thing and that be to take my ragged head of hair into a barber shop and get it trim i be sure that the barber would know i be a girl but he do not suspect ` be a long time in the wild youngster eh ' be all he say and then i know that i be safe because people here in the west be not suspicious they let a stranger go with one look by the time i reach sour creek i be nearly over be ashamed of my clothes and then i find this place and work as a schoolteacher i think you know the rest she lean close to sinclair be i wrong to leave he sinclair rub he chin you would ought to have tell he straight off he say firmly but see you go through with the wedding -- well take it all in all you leaving of he be about the rightest thing i ever hear of quiet fall between they but what be i go to do and where be it all go to end a small voice inquire of sinclair at last roll up in they blanket and go to sleep he advise she curtly i be figure steady on this here thing jig jig follow that advice sinclair have leave the fire and be walk up and down from one end of the little plateau to the other with a strong long step as for the girl she feel that a incalculable burden have be shift from she shoulder by the tell of this tale that burden she know must have fall on another person and it be not unpleasant to know that riley sinclair be the man gradually the sense of strangeness fade as she grow drowsy it seem the most natural thing in the world for she to be up here at the top of the world with a man she have know two day and before she sleep the last thing of which she be conscious be the head of sinclair in the broad sombrero brushing to and fro across the star 18 with a bang the screen door of sheriff kern 's office have creak open and shut four time at interval and each man enter in turn with a howdy to the sheriff have stamp the dust out of the wrinkle of he ride boot hitch up he trousers carefully and slump into a chair not until the last of he handpick posse have take he place do the sheriff begin he speech gent he say how long have i be a sheriff eighteen to twenty year say bill wood and it be be twenty year of bad time for the safecracker and gunman of these part thanks say the sheriff hastily and how many that i have once put my hand on have get loose again bill wood answer be the senior member none you score be exactly one hundred percent sheriff kern sigh gent he say the average be plumb spoil it cause a general lifting of head and then a respectful silence to have offer sympathy would have be insulting to ask question be beneath they dignity but four pair of eye burn with curiosity the least curious be arizona he be a fat oily man from the southland whose past be unknown in the vicinity of woodville and arizona happen to be by no means desirous of rescue that past from oblivion he hold the southlander 's contempt for the man and way of the north he presence in the office be explain by the fact that he have long before discover it to be a excellent thing to stand in with the sheriff after this statement from kern therefore he first glance at he three companion and observe they agitation he become somewhat stir himself and pucker he fat brow above he eye as he glance back at kern you have hear of the killing of quade ask the sheriff yesterday say red chalmer and that they get the killer nope it be a gent you would never have suspect -- that skinny little schoolteacher gaspar i never like the look of he say red chalmer gloomily i always get to have a second thought about a gent that be too smooth with the lady and that be this here jig so he do the shooting it be a fight over sally bent explain the sheriff sandersen and some of the rest in sour creek fix up a posse and go out and grab gaspar they give he a lynch trial and be about to string he up when a stranger name sinclair a man who have join up with the posse step out and hold for keep gaspar and turn he over to I to be hang all proper and legal i hear about all this and go out to the bent house first thing this morning to get gaspar who be leave there in charge of this sinclair any of you ever hear about he a general bowing of head follow as the man begin to consider all save arizona who never think when he could avoid it and positively never use he memory he habitually allow the dead past to bury its dead it appear to I like i have hear of a sinclair up to colma murmur bill wood that be four or five year back and i b ` lieve he be call a sure man in a fight that be he mutter the sheriff he be greatly relieve to know that he antagonist have already achieve so comfortable a reputation a big lean hungry-eyed gent with a restless pair of hand he come along with I while i be bring gaspar but i do not think nothing about it most nacheral i leave it to you boy settle themselves they lean forward in they chair we be talk about hoss and suchlike which sinclair talk uncommon slick he seem a know gent and i open up to he but in the middle of thing he paw out he colt as smooth as you ever see and he shove it under my nose sheriff kern pause he be wear glove in spite of the fact that he be in he office these glove seem to have a peculiarly businesslike meaning for the other and now they watch fascinate while the sheriff tug he finger deeper into the glove as if he be get ready for action he clear he throat and manage to snap out the rest of the shameful statement he stick I up boy and he tell jig to beat it up the trail then he back off keep I cover all the time until he be around the hill the minute he be out of sight i follered he but when it come into view he and gaspar be high-tail through the hill i do not have no rifle and it be plumb foolish to chase two killer with nothing but a colt which i leave it to you gent would have be crazy sheriff assert red chalmer i dunno sigh arizona pat he fat stomach reminiscently i dunno i guess you be right kern the other glare at he and the sheriff become purple so i come back and figure that i would best get together the handiest little bunch of fight man i could lay hand on that be why i send for you four clumsily they make they acknowledgement because say kern it do not take no senator to see that something have get to be do sour creek be after gaspar and now it 'll be after sinclair too but they get clear of I and i be the sheriff of woodville it be up to woodville to get 'em back be i right again they nod and the sheriff grow warmer as he talk snatch off a glove and mop he forehead as he arm fall he note that arizona have see something which fascinate he he eye follow every gesture of the sheriff 's hand be that the whole story ask arizona the whole thing declare kern stoutly and he glare at the man from the southland because if it be anything worse say arizona innocently we would ought to know it the honor of woodville be at stake oh it be bad enough this way grumble joe stockton and the sheriff hastily restore he glove grunt assent now boy let 's hear some plan first thing say red chalmer rise be for each of we to pick out the best hoss in he string and then we 'll all ride over to the place where they leave and pick up the trail not a bad idea approve kern there be a general rise sit down say arizona who alone have not budge in he chair without obey they turn to he be that the morris trail kern ask arizona sure well you be not get a chance of pick up the trail of two hoss out of two hundred in silence they receive the truth of this assertion then joe stockton speak he be not exactly a troublemaker but he take advantage of every disturbance that come he way and improve it to the last scruple sinclair come from colma accord to bill and colma be north ride north kern and the north trail will keep we tolerable close to sinclair we can tend to gaspar later on -- unless he be a pile more dangerous 'n he look yes sinclair be the main one say the sheriff he be more 'n a hundred gaspar boy the north trail look good to I we can pick up gaspar later on as joe stockton say straight for colma that be where we 'll strike hold on cut in arizona patently they regard he with disfavor there be something blandly superior in arizona 's demeanor he have a way of put forth he opinion as though it be not the slightest effort for he to penetrate truth which be securely veil from the eye of ordinary man now he look calmly almost contemptuously upon the sheriff and the rest of the posse gent have any of you ever see this jig you talk about ride a hoss I of course say the sheriff anything about he strike you when he be in a saddle sure get a funny arm motion like he be fan he rib with he elbow to keep cool go on arizona grin the sheriff chuckle would you pick he for a good hand on a long trail never in a million year say the sheriff be he kern seem to admit he inferiority by ask this question he bite he lip and be about to go on and answer himself when arizona cut in with : never in a million year sheriff he could not do twenty mile in a day without be lay up what be the point of all this arizona i 'll show you pronto let 's go back to sinclair the other day he be one of a bunch that pretty near get gaspar hang eh yep but at the last minute he save jig sure i just be tell you that they inability to follow arizona 's train of thought irritated the other he literally hold they in the palm of he hand as he develop he argument why do he save jig he go on because when gaspar be about to swing they be something about he that strike sinclair what be it i dunno except that jig be tolerable young look and pretty helpless even though you say he kill quade say he kill he burst put the sheriff it be plumb prove on he i would sure like to see that proof say the man from the southland the point be that sinclair take pity on he and keep he from the noose then he stay that night guard he and get more and more interested this jig have get a pile of education i have hear he talk today you come over the hill sinclair see woodville figure that be the place where jig 'll be hung and he lose he nerve he stick you up and get jig free all right d'you think he 'll stop at that do not he know that jig 's plumb helpless on the trail and know that d'you think he 'll split with jig and leave the schoolteacher to be pick up the first thing no sir he 'll stick with jig and see he through well all the better snap the sheriff that be go to make we trail shorter -- if what you say turn out true it be true well enough sinclair right now be camping somewhere in the hill near sour creek wait for thing to quiet down before he hit the out-trail with this gaspar he would not be fool enough for that grumble the sheriff fool have any one of you professional man hunter figure yet on hunting for 'em near sour creek be not you-all be talk long trail -- colma and what not they be crush all you say be true if sinclair saddle himself with the tenderfoot might as well tie so much lead around he neck he 'll do it though say arizona carelessly i know he it cause a new focus of attention upon he and this time arizona seem to regret that he stand in the limelight you know he ask joe stockton softly the bright black eye of the fat man glitter and flicker from face to face he seem to be gauge they and decide how much he could say -- or how little sure i drift up to this country one season and ride there i hear a pile about this sinclair and see he a couple of time how good a man d'you figure he to be with a gun ask the sheriff without apparent interest good enough sigh arizona good enough partner presently the sheriff show that he be a man capable of take good advice even though he could not stamp it as he own original device boy he say i figure that what arizona have say be tolerable sound arizona what d'you advise next that we go to sour creek pronto -- and sit down and wait a chorus of exclamation arise arizona grow impatient with such stupidity sinclair come to sour creek to do something i dunno what he want but what he want he be not get yet and he be the sort that 'll stay till he do he work i have get in touch with the authority higher up boy declare kern sinclair and gaspar be both outlaw with a price on they head will not that change sinclair 's mind and make he move on you do not know sinclair persist arizona you do not know he at all sheriff grab you hoss boy i be follow arizona 's lead pour out of the door in silence the omniscience of arizona lay heavily upon they mind inside the sheriff linger with the wise man from the southland if i be to get in touch with colma fatty what d'you think they would be able to tell I about you record up there the olive skin of arizona become a bleached drab i dunno he say rather thickly and all the while he little black eye be glitter and shift nothing much kern he glance steady by the way when you have you glove off a while ago i see something on you wrist that look like a rope gall kern if i be to tell the boy that what d'you figure they would think about they sheriff it be kern 's turn to change color for a moment he hesitate and then he drop a hand lightly on arizona 's shoulder look here arizona he mutter in the ear of the fat man what you be before you hit woodville i dunno and i do not care i figure we come to a place where we have both best keep we mouth shut eh shake say arizona and they go out the door almost arm in arm 19 for jude cartwright the world be go mad as he spur down the hill away from sinclair and the girl it be really only the second time in he life that he have be thwart in a important matter to be sure he have be raise roughly among rough man but among the roughest of they the repute of he family and the awe of he father 's wide authority have serve he as a shield in more way than jude himself could realize he have grow very much accustomed to have he way all thing be make smooth for he and when he reach the age when he begin to think of marriage and be tentatively court half a dozen girl of the district unhoped-for great fortune have fairly drop into he path the close acquaintance with old mervin in that hunting trip have be entirely accidental and he have be astounded by the marriage contract which mervin shortly after propose between the two family ordinarily even jude cartwright with all he self-esteem would never have aspire to a star so remote as mervin 's daughter the miracle however happen he see himself in the way to be the richest man on the range the possessor of the most lovely wife that dream be first prick by the inexplicable disappearance of the girl on they marriage day he have lay that disappearance to foul play that she could have leave he through any personal aversion never enter he complacent young head he go out on the quest after the neighbor district have be comb for he wife and he have spend the intervene month in a ceaseless search which grow more and more dishearten it be only by chance that he remember that mervin have live for some time in sour creek and only with the faintest hope of find a clue that he decide to visit that place in he heart he be convince that the girl be dead but if she be really hide it be quite possible that she might have remember the town where she father have make he first success with cattle now the coincidence that have bring he face to face with she stunned he he be still only gradually recover from it it be totally incredible that she should have flee at all and it be entirely beyond the range of credence that modest elizabeth mervin should have don the clothes of a man and should be wander through the hill with a male companion but when he wonder die away he feel little or no pity for he wife the pang that he feel be the torture of offended pride indeed the fact that he have lose he wife mean less to he than that he wife have see he physically beat by another man he writhe in he saddle at the memory instantly he mind flash back to the detail of the scene he rehearse it with himself in a different role beat the cowpuncher to a helpless pulp of bruised muscle snatch away he wife but even if he have be able to do that what would the outcome be he could not let the world know the truth -- that he wife have flee from he in horror on they marriage day that she have wonder about in the clothes of a man that she be the companion of another man and if he bring she back certainly all these fact would come to light the close-cropped hair alone would be damning evidence he frame a wild tale of abduction by villain of a injury a sickness a fever that force a doctor to cut she hair short he have no sooner frame the story than he throw it away as useless with all he soul he begin to wish for the only possible solution which would save the remnant of he ruin self-respect and keep he from the peril of discovery the girl must indubitably die by the time he come to this conclusion he have strike out of the hill and as he horse hit the level go and pick up speed the heart of jude cartwright become lighter he would get weapon and the finest horse money could buy in sour creek trail the pair take they by surprise and kill they both then back to the homeland and a new life already he see himself in it he name surround with a glamour of pathetic romance as the sad widower with a mystery darken he past and future it be a agreeable gloom into which he fall self-pity warm he and loosen he fierceness he sigh with regret for he own misfortune in this frame of mind he reach sour creek and its hotel while he write he name in the yellowed register he over-heard loud conversation in the farther end of the room two man have be outlaw that day -- john gaspar the schoolteacher who kill quade and riley sinclair a stranger from the north pay no further attention to the talk he pass on into the general merchandise store which fill most of the lower story of the hotel there he find the hardware department and prominent among the hardware be the gun rack he go over the colt and with a expert hand take up the gun while the gray-headed storekeeper advance a eulogium upon each weapon he attention be distract by the entrance of a tall painfully thin man who seem in great haste what be all this about cold foot whitey he ask cold foot and sinclair i dunno sandersen except that word come in from woodville that sinclair stick up the sheriff on he way in with jig and sinclair get clean away what could have be in he head to grab jig i dunno say sandersen apparently much perturb they outlaw 'em both whitey there be a eagerness in this question so poorly conceal that cartwright jerk up he head and regard sandersen with interest both reply whitey you seem sort of pleased sandersen i know that sinclair would come to a bad end say sandersen more soberly why i think they say you cotton to he when the boy be figure he might have have something to do with quade I well yes for a minute but out at the necktie party whitey i keep watch he think a lot more 'n he say and gent like that be always dangerous always reply whitey but it be the last time sinclair 'll show he face in sour creek -- alive say sandersen if he do show he face alive it 'll be a dead face pronto you can lay to that sandersen seem to turn this fact over and over in he mind with immense satisfaction and yet pursue the storekeeper think of a full-grown man break the law to save such a skinny little shrimp of a gent as jig eh more like a pretty girl than a boy jig be cartwright exclaimed and both of the other turn toward he here be the gun for I he say huskily and that gun belt -- fill -- and this holster they 'll all do and a handy outfit say whitey that gun 'll be a friend in need what make you think they 'll be a need ask cartwright with such unnecessary violence that the other both stare he go on more smoothly : what be you say about a girl-faced gent the schoolteacher -- he plug a feller name quade sinclair get he clean away from sheriff kern and what sort of a look gent be sinclair long brown and pretty husky-looking with a mean eye you have name he where would you meet up with he over in the hill yonder just where the north trail come over the rise they be sit down under a tree rest they hoss when i come along i get into a argument with this sinclair -- long riley he call himself riley 's he first name we pass some word pretty soon i give he the lie he make a reach for he gun i tell he i be not arm and dare he to try he fist he take off he belt and we go at it a strong man but he do not know nothing about hand fighting i have he about ready to give up and beg I to quit when this jig this girl-faced man you talk about -- he pull a gun and slug I in the back of the head with it remove he sombrero he show on the back of he head the great welt which have be make when he strike the ground with the weight of sinclair on top of he it be examine with intense interest by the other two dirty work say sandersen sympathetically the storekeeper say nothing at all but begin to fold up a bolt of cloth which lay half unrolled on the counter it knock I cold continue cartwright and when i come to they be not no sign nor trace of 'em buckle on the belt he shove the revolver viciously home in the holster i 'll land that pair before the posse get to 'em and when i land 'em i will not do no argue with fist say i call that nerve put in the storekeeper with patent admiration in he eye while he smooth a fold of the cloth run agin ' one gent like sinclair be bad enough -- let alone tackle two at once but you would ought to take out a big insurance on you life friend before you take that trail it be liable to be all out-trail and no come back a great deal of enthusiasm fade from cartwright 's face how come he ask briefly nothing much but they say this sinclair be quite a gunfighter my friend up in he home town they scare the baby by talk about sinclair h be murmured cartwright he can not win always and maybe i 'll be the lucky man but he go out of the store with he head thoughtfully inclined think of meet up with they two all alone and not know what they be sigh sandersen he be lucky to be alive i 'll tell a man whitey grin plenty of nerve in a gent like that go on sandersen he pale blue eye become dreamy get you gat out will you bill bill sandersen obliged look at the butt d'you see any point on it nope do you look at that welt on the stranger 's head sure do you see a little cut in the middle of the welt come to think of it i sure do well sandersen how d'you make out that a gun butt would make a cut like that what be you drive at whitey i be just discount the stranger say whitey i dunno what other talent he be get but he be sure a fine nacheral liar 20 it be some time before riley sinclair interrupt he pacing and turn stride over to the dim outline of the sleep girl she do not speak and lean close above she he hear she regular breathing wait until he be satisfy that she sleep he begin to move rapidly first with long soft step he go to he saddle which be perch on a ridge of rock this he raise with infinite care gather up the stirrup and the cinch so that nothing might drag or strike with this bundle secure he once more go close to the figure of the sleeper and this time drop on one knee beside she he could see nothing distinctly by the starlight but she forehead gleam with one faint highlight and there be the pale glimmer of one hand above the blanket for the moment he almost abandon the plan on which he have resolve which be no less than to attempt to ride into sour creek and return to the girl before she waken in the dawn but suppose that he fail and that she waken to find herself alone in the mountain wilderness he shudder at the idea yet he see no other issue for she than to attempt the execution of he plan he rise hastily and walk off let he weight fall on he toe altogether so that the spur might not jingle even that brief rest have so far refresh he mustang that he be greet with flatten ear and fly heel these effort sinclair meet with a smile and terrible whisper curse whose familiar sound seem to soothe the horse he saddle at once still use care to avoid noise and swing steeply down the side of the mountain on the descend trail he could cut by one half the mile they have traverse wind up the slope recklessly he ride give the wise pony its head most of the time and only see that it do not exceed a certain speed for when a horse pass a certain rate of go it become as reckless as a drunken man once or twice they flounder onto sheer gravel slide which the broncho take by fling back on its haunch and go down with stiffly brace foreleg but on the whole the mustang take care of itself admirably in a amazingly short time they strike the more placid footing of the valley and sinclair look up could not believe that he have be so short a time ago at the top of the flat-crested mountain he give little time to wonder however but cut across the valley floor at a steady lope from the top of the mountain the light of sour creek be a close-gathered patch from the level they appear as a scattering line sinclair hold straight toward they keep away to the leave so as to come onto the well-beaten trail which he know run in that direction he find it and let the mustang drop back to a steady dogtrot for if the journey to sour creek be now a short distance there would be a hard ride back to the flat-topped mountain if he wish to accomplish he business and return before the full dawn he must be there by that time for who could tell what the girl might do when she find herself alone therefore he save the cattle pony as much as possible he be fairly close to sour creek the light fan out broader and broader as he approach suddenly two figure loom up before he in the night he come near and make out a barelegged boy ride without a saddle and drive a cow before he he be a very angry herdsman this boy he keep up a continual monologue direct at the cow and he horse and so he do not hear the approach of riley sinclair until the outlaw be close upon he then he hitch himself around with he hand on the hip of he old horse sway violently with the jerk of the gait he be glad of the company it seem evening mister you be not hi corson be you nope i be not hi kind of late driving that cow be not you the boy swear with shrill fluency we buy old spot over at the apwell place and the darned old fool keep break down fence and run back every time she get a chance be not nothing so foolish as a cow why do not you dad sell she for beef beef the boy laugh say mister i would as soon try to chew leather they be not nothing but bone and skin and meanness to old spot but she be a good milker when she come in fresh she give pretty nigh onto four gallon a milking be that so sure be hard to milk though kick the hat right off 'n you head if you do not watch she never see such a fool cow as old spot hey take advantage of this diversion in the attention of she guardian spot have amble off to the side of the road the boy dart he horse after she and send she trot down the trail with click hoof and long sweeping step that scuff up a stifle dust be not very good to heat a milker up by run 'em son reprove sinclair i know it be not but it would not make I sorry if old spot just nacherally drop down dead -- she give I that much trouble look at she now doggone she spot have turn broadside to they and wait for the boy to catch up before she would take another forward step you just come in to sour creek yep i be strange to this town well you sure could not have pick a more fussed-up time how come well you hear about the killing of quade i reckon not a word you be not where you be these day oh yonder in the hill chip rock eh well quade be a gent that live out the norm trail and he have a fuss with the schoolteacher over sally bent and the schoolteacher up and murder quade and they raise a posse and go out to hang gaspar the teacher and they be keep from it by a stranger call sinclair when the sheriff come to get gaspar and hang he legal and all that sinclair stick up the sheriff and take gaspar away and now they be both outlawed i hear tell and they be a price on they head the lad bring it out in one huge sentence sputter over the word in he haste how much of a price i dunno it keep grow everybody around woodville and sour creek be chip in to raise that price they sure want to get gaspar and sinclair bad gaspar be not much he be a kind of sissy but sinclair be a killer -- and then some sinclair raise he head to the black solemn mountain then he look back to he companion why have he kill anybody lately he leave one for dead right today you do not mean it he sure must be bad oh he be bad right enough they be a gent name cartwright come into town today with he head all bang up he would meet up with gaspar and sinclair in the hill not know nothing about they get into a argument with sinclair and not be arm he have it out with fist he be beat up sinclair pretty bad -- he be a good deal of a man -- when gaspar sneak up and whang he on the back of the head with the butt of he colt they ride off and leave he for dead but pretty soon he wake up he come on into sour creek rarin ' and tearin ' and huntin ' for revenge sure will be a bad mess if he meet up with sinclair ag ` in reckon it have ought to be reply sinclair like to see this gent that wade into two outlaw with he bare fist he be a man right enough get a room up in the hotel must have a pile of money because he take the big room onto the north end of the hotel the room that be as big as a house nothin ' else suit he at all dad tell I i be not get nothing particular on hand murmur sinclair maybe i can get in on this manhunt -- if they be not start already the boy laugh everybody in town have be try to get in on that manhunt but it be not any use sheriff kern have get a handpick posse -- every one a fightin ' fool dad say wish you luck though they be not start till the morning well here 's where i branch off s ` long hey spot you old fool git along will you sinclair watch the youngster fade into the gloom behind the amble cow then he strike on toward sour creek but before he reach the main street he wind off to the left and let he horse drift slowly beyond the outlying house he problem have become greatly complicate by the information from the boy he have a double purpose which be to see cartwright in the first place and then sandersen for these be the separate stumble block for jig and for himself for cartwright he see a solution through which he could avoid a killing but sandersen must die he skirt behind the most northerly outlying shed of the hotel dismount there and throw the rein then he slip back into the shadow of the main building directly above he he see three dark window bunch together this must be cartwright 's room 21 it seem patent to bill sandersen earlier that afternoon that fate have stack the card against riley sinclair bill sandersen indeed believe in fate he feel that great hidden force have always control he life move he hither and yon accord to they pleasure to the dreamy mind of the mystic man be accident and all they perform be the dictate of the power and the brain of the other world sandersen could tell at what definite moment hunch have seize he he have look at the side of the mountain and suddenly feel without any reason or volition on he part that he be impel to search that mountainside for gold-bearing ore he have never fall into the habit of use he reason he be a wonderful gambler play with singular abandon and usually win it matter not what he hold in he hand if the urge come to he and the surety that he be go to bet he would wager everything in he wallet all that he could borrow on a pair of trey and when such a fit be on he the overwhelming confidence that shine in he face usually overpower the other man sit in at the game more than once a full house have be lay down to he wretched pair there be other occasion when he have lose the very boot he wear but the time of win naturally overbalance the loss in the mind of bill it be not he who win and it be not he who lose it be fate which rule he and that fate he feel at present have side against riley sinclair a sort of pity for the big cowpuncher move he he know that he and quade and lowrie deserve death in its most terrible form for they betrayal of hal sinclair in the desert and nothing but fate he be sure could save he from the avenger fate however have definitely intervene what save blind fate could have step into the mind of sinclair and make he keep cold foot from the rope when that hanging would have remove forever all suspicion that sinclair himself have kill quade another man would have attribute both of those action to common decency in sinclair but sandersen always hunt out more profound reason in order to let the fact of he own salvation from sinclair 's gun sink more definitely into he brain he trot he horse into the hill that afternoon when he come back he hear that the posse be in town to another it might have seem odd that the posse be there instead of on the trail of the outlaw but sandersen never think of so practical a question to he it be as clear as day the posse have be bring to sour creek by fate in order that he sandersen might enlist in its rank and help in the great work of run down sinclair for after all it be work primarily to he own interest there be something ironically absurd about it he sandersen have commit the mortal crime of abandon hal sinclair in the desert be now give the support of legal society to destroy the just avenger of that original crime it be hardly any wonder that sandersen saw in all this the hand of fate he go straight to the hotel and up to the room which the sheriff have engage cartwright be come out with a black face as sandersen enter the former turn at the door and face kern and the four assistant of the sheriff i 'll tell you what you 'll do you wise gent he growl you 'll miss he altogether you hear and then he stamp down the hall sandersen carefully remove he hat as he go in he be quite aware that cartwright must have be just refuse a place on the posse and he do not wish to appear too confident he pay he compliment to the bunch except arizona to whom he be introduce the sheriff forestall he request you have come for a job in the posse bill hastily sandersen cut in before the other should pronounce a final judgment i do not blame you for turn down cartwright he say a gent like that who do not know the country be not much use on the trail eh the point be bill that i get all the man i need i do not want a whole gang but i get a special reason sheriff besides a tolerable fast hoss that might come in handy for a chase i sling a tolerable fast gun sheriff but beyond that all i get a grudge a grudge ask the sheriff prick he ear so do cartwright have a grudge cut in arizona dryly perhaps after all sandersen feel fate might not be with he in this quest for sinclair he say earnestly : you see boy it be I that raise the posse that run down cold foot in the first place it be I that back up sinclair all the way through the trail and i feel like some of the blame for what happen be come to I i want to square thing up and get a chance at sinclair i want it mighty bad you know I kern gimme a chance will you well that sound like reason admit the sheriff eh boy the posse nod its general head with the usual exception of arizona who seem to take a particular pleasure in diverge from the judgment of the other just a minute gent he say do not it strike you that they 's something the same with cartwright and sandersen both of 'em in particular anxious to cut in on this party both of 'em have grudge cartwright say he do not want no share of the money if you catch gaspar and sinclair be that right for you too sandersen it sure be i want the fun not the coin say sandersen boy resume arizona it round up to this : sinclair come down here to sour creek for a purpose sandersen begin to listen intently he even dread this fat man from the southland i dunno what this purpose be go on arizona but mostly when a gent like sinclair make a trip they be a man at the far end of it -- because this be not he range now if it be a man why should not it be one of these two cartwright or sandersen who both pack a grudge against sinclair sinclair be rest somewhere up yonder in they hill i be sure of that he be wait there to get a chance to finish he business in sour creek and that business be cartwright or sandersen i dunno which now i be agin ' take in sandersen when we be private i 'll tell you my reason why there be something of a insult in this speech and the tall man take instant offense partner he drawl it look to I like they reason could be speak personal to I suppose you step outside and we talk shop arizona smile it take a man of some courage and stand to refuse such a invitation without lose caste but for some reason arizona be the last man in the world whom one could accuse of be a coward sandersen he say coldly i do not mean to step on you toe you may be as good a man as the next the reason that i get agin ' you be not personal whatever which they be thing i get a right to think I be a officer of the law for the time be if you hold a grudge agin ' I for what i have say you and I can talk it over after this here job 's do be that square i s ` pose it be get to be reply sandersen gent do the word of you fat friend go here leave to themselves the posse probably would have refuse arizona 's advice on general principle but arizona do not leave they to themselves sure my word go he hasten to put in the sheriff and all of we work like a closed hand -- all together there be a subtle flattery about this that please the sheriff and the other reckon it all in all say sheriff i think we better figure you out sandersen besides they be not anything to keep you and cartwright and the rest from rig up a little posse of you own sinclair be up yonder in the hill wait -- suddenly he stop sandersen be shake as if by a violent ague and he face lose all color become a sickly white and we be go to find he by ourselves s ` long sandersen and thanks for drop in no hard feeling mind to this friendly dismissal sandersen return no answer he turn away with a wide stare eye and go through the doorway like a man walk in a dream arizona be instantly on he foot you see boy he ask exultantly i be right when you say sinclair be wait up there in the hill sandersen be scared i be right he be one of they that sinclair be after and that be why he want to throw in with we and why the devil should not he ask the sheriff for a good reason sheriff reason that 'll save we a pile of ride we 'll sit tight here in sour creek for a while and catch sinclair right here d'you know how by watch cartwright and sandersen as sure as they be a sky over we sinclair be go to make a try at one of 'em they both hate he well you can lay to it that he hate 'em back and a man that sinclair hate he be go to get sooner or later -- chiefly sooner sheriff keep a eye on they two tonight and you 'll have sinclair playing right into you hand look to I mutter red chalmer like you have a grudge agin ' cartwright and sandersen use they for live bait and we for a trap why not ask arizona sit down and rub he fat hand much pleased with himself why not i would like to know in the meantime bill sandersen have go down to the street still with the stare eye of a sleep walker it be evening and from the open street he look out and up to the mountain grow blue and purple against the sky he have hear hal sinclair talk about riley and riley 's love for the higher mountain they be he country and a great surety drop upon he that the fat man of the posse have be right somewhere in those mountain sinclair be lurk ready for a descent upon sour creek now sandersen grow cold all that be superstitious in he nature take he by the throat the fate which he have feel to be fight with he he now be equally sure be align against he otherwise why have the posse refuse to accept he as a member for only one reason : he be doom to die by the hand of riley sinclair and then no doubt riley sinclair would fall in turn by the bullet of the posse the shadow be pour out of the gorge of the western mountain and night begin to invade the hollow of sour creek every downward step of those shadow be to the feverish imagination of sandersen a forecast of the come of sinclair -- sinclair come in spite of the posse in spite of the price upon he head in the few moment during which sandersen remain in the street watch the tumult grow in he mind he be afraid he be mortally in terror of something more than physical death and like the cornered rat he feel a sudden urge to go out and meet the danger halfway a dozen picture come to he of sinclair slip into the town under cover of the night of the stealthy approach of the gunplay that would follow why not take the desperate chance of go out to find the assailant and take he by surprise instead the mountain -- that be the country of sinclair instinctively he eye fall and cling on the greatest height he could see a flat-topped mountain due west of sour creek sandersen swing into he saddle and drive out of sour creek toward the goal and into the deepen gloom of the evening 22 in the darkness beneath the north window of the hotel sinclair consult he watch hold it close until he could make out the dim position of the hand against the white dial it be too early for cartwright to be in bed unless he be a very long sleeper so sinclair wait a continual danger lay beside he the kitchen door constantly bang open and shut as the chinese cook trot out and back carry scrap to the waste barrel or bring he new-washing tin to hang on a rack in the open air a resource on which he be force to fall back on account of he cramped quarter but the cook never leave the bright shaft of light which fall through the doorway behind and above he and consequently he could not see into the thick darkness where sinclair crouch only a few yard away and the cowpuncher remain moveless from time to time he look up and still the window be black after what seem a eternity there be a flicker as when the wick of a lamp be light and then a steady glow as the chimney be put on again that glow brighten decrease become a unchanging light the wick have be trim and cartwright be in for the evening however the cook have not cease he pilgrimage at the very moment when sinclair have straighten to attempt the climb up the side of the house the cook come out and crouch on the upper step hum a jangling tune and suck audibly a long-stemmed pipe the queer-smelling smoke drift across to sinclair for a moment he be on the verge of attempt a quick leap and a tie and gag of the oriental but he desist instead sinclair flatten himself against the wall and wait providence come to he assistance at that crisis someone call from the interior of the house there be a odd-sounding exclamation from the cook and then the latter jump up and scurry inside slam the screen door behind he with a great racket sinclair raise he head and survey the side of the wall for the last time the sill of the window of the first floor be no higher than he shoulder the eaves above that window project well out and they would afford a excellent hold by which he could swing himself up but have swing up the great problem be to obtain sufficient purchase for he knee to keep from slide off before he have a chance to steady himself once on the ledge of those eaves he could stand up and look through any one of the three window into the room which accord to the boy cartwright occupy he lift himself onto the sill of the first window bump he nose sharply against the pane of the glass then begin the more difficult task he straighten and fix he finger firmly on the ledge above he wait until he palm and the fingertip have sweat into a steady grip then he step as far as possible to one side and spring up with a great heave of the shoulder but the effort be too great he not only flung himself far enough up but too far and he descend knee strive for a hold slip off as if from a oil surface he come down with a jar the full length of he arm a fall that fling he down on he back on the ground with a stifled curse he leap up again it seem that the noise of that fall must have resound for a great distance but as he stand there listen no one draw near someone come out of the front door of the hotel laugh the cowpuncher try again he manage the first stage of the ascent as before very easily but make the second effort he exceed too much in caution and fall short however the fall do not include a topple all the way to the ground he foot land softly on the sill and at the same time voice turn the corner of the building beside he sinclair flatten himself against the pane of the lower window and hold he breath two man be beneath he they head be level with he foot he could have kick the hat off they head without the slightest trouble it be a mystery that they do not see he he think until he recall that all man at night naturally face outward from a wall it be a instinct they stand close together talk rather low the one be fairly tall and the other squat the shorter man light a cigarette the match light glint on a oily olive skin and so much of the profile as he could see be faintly familiar he send he memory lurch back into far place and old time but he have no nerve for reminiscence he recall himself to the danger of the moment and listen to they talk what be happen the taller man be say so far nothing grunt the other and how long do you feel we would ought to keep it up i dunno i 'll tell you when i get tired speaking personal fatty i be kind of tired of it right now i want to hit the hay buck up buck up partner we 'll get he yet now it flash into the mind of sinclair that it must be a pair of crooked gambler work on some fat purse in the hotel come out here to arrange plan because they fail to extract the bank roll as quickly as they desire otherwise there could be no meaning to this talk of get someone but between you and I grumble the big man it look from the first like a bum game fatty that be the trouble with you red you be not get any patience how do a cat catch a mouse by sit down and wait -- maybe three hour and the hungrier she get the longer she 'll wait and the stiller she 'll sit a man could take a good lesson out 'n that you always get a pile of fancy word protest the big man sinclair saw fatty put he hand on the shoulder of he companion plainly he be the dominant force of the two in spite of he lack of height red as sure as you be bear they 's something go to happen this here night my scar be itch red and that mean something again the mind of sinclair flash back to something familiar a man who prophesy by the itching of he scar but once more the danger of the moment make he mind a blank to all else what scar ask red scratch i get when i be a kid flash the fat man that be all oh chuckle red plainly unconvinced well we 'll play the game a little longer that be the talk partner i tell you we get this trap bait and it be _ get _ to catch presently they drift around the corner of the building and out of sight for a moment sinclair wonder what that trap could be which the fat man have bait so carefully he mind revert to he original picture of a card game cheap trickster sharper with the card he decide and with that decision he banish they both from he mind there be no other sign of life around he all of sour creek live in the main street or go to bed at this hour of the early night the back of the hotel be safe from observance except for the horse shed and the back of the shed be turn to he he feel safe and now he turn settle he finger into a new grip on the eaves and make he third attempt it succeed to a nicety he right knee catch solidly on the ledge he get a fingertip hold on the board and stand up straighten himself slowly he look into the room through a corner of the window pane cartwright sit with he back to the window a lamp beside he on the table write he have throw off he heavy outer shirt and he wear only a cotton undershirt he heavy shoulder and big-muscled arm show to great advantage with the light and sharp shadow define each ridge now and then he lift he head to think then he bent to he write again it occur to sinclair to fling the window up boldly and when cartwright turn cover he with a gun but the chance include he position on the ledge be very much against he cartwright would probably snatch at he own gun which lay before he in its holster on the table and whirling he would try a snap shoot the only other alternative be to raise the window -- and that with cartwright four pace away first sinclair take stock of the interior of the room it be larger than most parlor he have see there be a big double bed on each side of it plainly it be intend to accommodate a whole party and sinclair smile at the vanity of the man who have insist on take the best you have no wonder sour creek know the room he have rent in the corner be a great fireplace capable of take a six-foot log at least he admire the massive andiron palpably of home manufacture in sour creek 's blacksmith shop it prove the age of the building no one would waste money on such a fireplace in these day a little stove would do twice the work of that great hungry chimney there be two great chest of drawer also each look as if it be build up from the floor and make immovable such be its weight the bed also be of a ancient and solid school of furniture make to be sure everything be sadly run down on the floor the thin old carpet be worn completely through at the side of the bed both mirror above the chest of drawer be sadly crack and the table at which cartwright sit lean to the right under the weight of the arm he rest on it have thus take in the detail of the battle ground sinclair make ready for the attack he make sure of he footing on the ledge give a last glance over he shoulder to see that no one be in sight and then begin to work at the window move it fraction of a inch at a time 23 when the window be half raise -- the work of a full ten minute -- sinclair draw he revolver and rest the barrel on the sill he continue to lift the sash but now he use he left hand alone and thereby the noise become louder and more frequent cartwright occasionally raise he head but probably he be become accustomed to the sound now the window be raise to its full height and sinclair prepare for the command which would jerk cartwright 's hand above he head and make he turn slowly to look into the mouth of the gun weight which he could have handle easily with a lurch become tenfold heavier with the slowness of the lift eventually both shoulder be in the room and he be kneel on the sill cartwright raise he hand slowly luxuriously and stretch it be a movement so opportune that sinclair almost laugh aloud he twist he leg over the sill and drop lightly on the floor no noise he call softly the arm of cartwright become freeze in they position above he head he turn slowly with little jerky movement as though he have to fight to make himself look and then he see sinclair keep 'em up command the cowpuncher and get out of that chair real soft and slow that be it without a word cartwright obey there be no need of speech indeed for a score of expression flash into he face go over and lock the door he obey keep he arm above he head all the way across the room while sinclair jerk the new colt out of its holster and toss it on the farthest bed in the meantime cartwright linger at the door for a moment with he hand on the key no doubt he fight for the split part of a second with a wild temptation to jerk that door open and leap into the safety of the hall sinclair read that think in the tremor of the big man 's body but presently discretion prevail cartwright turn the key and face about he be a deadly gray and he lip be work now he begin wait till i start talk urge sinclair come over here and sit down you be too close to the door to suit I just now this be a pile better cartwright obey quietly sit down he lock he hand nervously about one knee and look up with he eye to sinclair i come in for a quiet talk say sinclair drop he gun into the holster that movement draw a sudden brighten of the eye of cartwright who now straighten in he chair as if he have regain hope do not make no mistake say sinclair follow the meaning of that change accurately i be pretty handy with this old gun partner and on you just now they be not any reason why i should take my time or any chance when it come to shooting unconsciously cartwright moisten he white lip and he eye grow big again except that the minute you shoot you be a dead one sinclair I oh no when a gun 's hear they 'll run to the room where the shot 's be fire and when they get the lock open i 'll be go the way i come from sinclair smile genially on he enemy do not start raise any crop of delusion friend i mean business -- a lot then talk business i 'll listen oh thanks i come here about you wife he watch cartwright wince in he heart he pity the man all the story of cartwright 's spoil boyhood and viciously selfish youth be write in he face for the reading of such a man as sinclair the rancher 's son have begin well enough lack of discipline have undo he but whether he fault be fix or changeable sinclair could not tell it be largely to learn this that he take the chance for the interview go on say cartwright in the first place d'you know why she leave you a anguish come across cartwright 's face it teach sinclair at least one thing -- that the man love she you be the reason -- maybe I i never see she till two day ago that be a tolerable ugly thing to say cartwright well i get tolerable ugly reason for say it answer the other the cowpuncher sigh i follow the way you drift but you be wrong partner fact be i do not know cold foot be a girl till this evening cartwright sneer and sinclair stiffen in he chair son he say gravely the worst enemy i get will all tell you that riley sinclair do not handle he own word careless and i give you my solemn word of honor that i do not know she be a girl till this evening and that right away after i find it out i come down here to straighten thing out with you if i could will you believe it it be a strange study to watch the work in the face of cartwright -- of hope passion doubt hatred he lean closer to sinclair he big hand clutch together sinclair i wish i could believe it look I in the eye man i can stand it by the lord it be true but sinclair have you come down to find out if i would take she back would you the other grow instantly crafty she be do I a pile of wrong sinclair she have say the cowpuncher he go on gently : she must of cut into you pride a lot oh if it be know say cartwright turn pale at the think she would make I a laugh stock I old cartwright 's son yep that would be bad he wonder at the frank egoism of the youth i leave it to you say cartwright settle back in he chair something have ought to be do to punish she besides she be a weight on you hand and i can see you would be anxious to get rid of she quick how d'you aim to punish she asked sinclair I sure kind of a hard thing to do would not it be cartwright 's eye grow small way could be find he swallow hard i would find a heap of way to make she wish she have die sooner 'n shame I i s ` pose you could say sinclair slowly he lower he glance for a moment to keep he scorn from stand up in he eye but i have hear of man cartwright that would love a woman so hard that they would forgive anything the world 's full of fool say the rich rancher he stab a stern forefinger into the palm of he other hand she be get to do a lot of explain before i 'll look at she she be get to make I a accounting of every day she be spend since i last see she at -- at the wedding ask sinclair cruelly cartwright writhe in the chair till it groan beneath he uneasy weight she tell you that look here go on sinclair assume a new tone of frank inquiry let 's see if we can not find out why she leave you they be not any reason -- just plain fool woman that be all but maybe she do not love you cartwright do you ever think of that the big man stare not love I who _ would _ she love then be they anybody in they part that could bring she as much as i could be they anybody that have as good a house as mine or as much land or as much cattle do not i take she over the ground and show she what it amount to do not i offer she she pick of my own string of ride horse do you do as much as that

land together that could be find in they part anyway -- he grin -- i get the land and why not let the girl go then why ask cartwright eagerly who want she you maybe if you would let she go not in a thousand year she be mine they be not no face but hers that i can see opposite to I at the table -- not one besides she be mine and i be go to keep she -- after i have teach she a lesson or two sinclair wipe he forehead hastily eagerness to jump at the throat of the man consume he he force a smile on he thin lip and persistently look down but think how easy it would be cartwright think how easy you could get a divorce on the grounds of desertion and drag all this shame into the court they 's way of hush these here thing up it would be easy she would not put up no defense mostlike you would win you case and if anybody ask question they would simply say she be crazy and that you be lucky to get rid of she they would not blame you none and it would not be no disgrace to be desert by a crazy woman would it cartwright draw back into a shell of opposition you talk pretty hot for this because i be tell you the way out for both of you i can not see it she be come back to I nobody else be go to get she i have set my mind on it partner do not you see that neither of you could ever be happy oh we would be happy enough i would forgive she -- after a while yes but what about she about

underground but you sinclair you need coin you be footloose suppose you be to take she and bring she to -- do not cry sinclair again do not say it cartwright think it over again have mercy on she man she could make some home happy be you go to destroy that chance say what kind of talk be this ask the big man now say sinclair look to you own rotten soul the strength of cartwright be cut away at the root the color be strike out of he face as by a mortal blow what d'you mean he whisper you do not deserve a man 's chance but i be go to give it to you go get you gun cartwright cartwright slink back in he chair do you mean murder sinclair i mean a fair fight you be a gunman you be raise and train for gunfight i would not have no chance sinclair control he scorn then i 'll fight left-handed i be a right-handed man cartwright and i 'll take you with my gun in my left hand that even we up i guess no it do not but with the cry on he lip the glance of cartwright flicker past sinclair he grow thoughtful less flabby he seem to be calculate he chance as he glance rest on the window all right he whisper a fearful eye on sinclair as if he fear the latter would change he mind gimme a fair break i 'll do it sinclair shift he gun to he left hand and turn to look at the window which cartwright have be watch with such intense interest he have not half turn however when a gun bark at he very ear it seem a tongue of flame spat in from the window there be a crash of glass and the lamp be snuff some accurate shot have cut the burning wick out of the lamp with he bullet so nicely place that though the lamp reel it do not fall 24 with the spurt of flame sinclair leap back until he shoulder graze the wall he crouch beside the massive chest of drawer it might partially shelter he from fire from the window there fall one of those deadly breathing space of silence -- silence except for the chattering of the lamp as it steady on the table and finally be still there be a light crunching noise from the opposite side of the room cartwright have move and put he foot on a fragment of the shatter chimney sinclair study the window it be a rectangle of dim light but nothing show in that frame he who have fire the shot must have crouch at once or else have draw to one side he wait with he gun poise step be sound far away in the building step which approach rapidly voice be call somewhere on the farther side of the room cartwright must have find the best shelter he could and sinclair shrewdly guess that it would be on the far side of the chest of drawer which face he in the meantime he study the blank rectangle of the window sooner or later the man who stand on the ledge would risk a look into the dark interior otherwise he would not be human and sure enough presently the faintest shadow of a outline encroach on the solid rectangle of faint light sinclair aim just to the right and fire at once there be a splash of red flame and a thunder report from the other side of the room cartwright have fire at the flash of sinclair 's gun and the bullet smash into the chest beside sinclair as for sinclair 's own bullet it bring only a stifled curse from the window no good riley sing out the voice this wall 's too thick for a colt sinclair have fling himself softly forward on he stomach he gun in readiness and level in the direction of cartwright there be the prime necessity now heavy footfall rush down the hall and a storm of voice break in upon he at the same time cartwright 's gun spat fire again the bullet buzz angrily above sinclair 's head he own bring a yell of pain sharp as the yelp of a coyote keep quiet cartwright order the man at the window you 'll get yourself kill if you keep risk it sheriff he voice rise and ring blow the lock off 'n that door we get he there be a instant reply in the explosion of a gun the crash of broken metal the door swing slowly in admit a dim twilight into the room the light show sinclair one thing -- the dull outline of cartwright he whip up he gun and then hesitate it would be murder he have kill before but never save in fair fight standing in a clear light before he enemy he know that he could not kill this rat he detest he think of the wreck life of the girl and set he tooth still he could not fire cartwright he say softly i get you cover you right hand 's on the floor with you gun do not raise that hand in the shadow against the wall cartwright move but he obey the revolver still glimmer on the floor a new and desperate thought come to sinclair -- to rush straight for the window shoot down the man on the ledge and risk the leap to the ground scatter back call the man on the ledge that settle the last chance of sinclair there be guard on the ground scatter about the house he could never get out that way keep out of the light by the door command the man at the window and start shoot for the chest of drawer on the left-hand side of the room -- and aim low down it may take time but we 'll get he obviously the truth of that statement be too clear for sinclair to deny it he review he situation with the swift calm of a old gambler he have try he desperate coup and have fail there be nothing to do but accept the failure or else make a still more desperate effort to rectify he position risk everything on a final play he must get out of the room the window be hopelessly block there remain the open door but the hall beyond the door be crowd with man perhaps they very number would work against they even now they could be hear cautiously maneuver they would shoot through the door in he general direction unaimed shot with the hope of a chance hit and eventually they would strike he down suppose he be to steal close to the door leap over the bed and plunge out among they he colt spit lead and fire that unexpected attack would cleave a passage for he the more he think of it the more clearly he see that the chance of escape to the street be at least one in three and yet he hesitate if he make that break two or three innocent man would go down before he bullet as he spring out shooting to kill he shrink from the thought he be amaze at himself never before have he be so tender of expedient he have always fight to win -- cleanly but to win why be he suddenly remember that to these man he be a outlaw fit meat for the first bullet they could send home have he be one of they he would have take up a position in that very hall just as they be do slowly reluctantly fight himself as he do it he shove he revolver back into he holster and determine to take the chance of that surprise attack with he empty hand against they gun if they do not drop he the instant he leap out he would be among they too close for gunplay unless they take the chance of kill they own man keep he gaze fix on cartwright across the room -- for the moment he show he intention cartwright would shoot -- he maneuver softly toward the bed cartwright turn he head but make no move to lift he gun there be a reason the light from the door fall nearer to the rancher than it do to sinclair to cartwright he must be no more than a shapeless blur a gun explode from the doorway with only a glint of steel as the muzzle be shove around the jamb the bullet crash harmlessly into the wall behind he another try the sharp stifle odor of burn powder begin to fill the room sting the nostril of sinclair cartwright be cough in a stifled fashion on the far side of the room as if he fear a loud noise would draw a bullet he way all at once there be no sound in the hotel and as the wave of silence spread sinclair be aware that the whole little town be listen wait watch not a whisper in the hall not a stir from cartwright across the room the quiet make the drama seem unreal then that voice outside the window which seem to be sinclair 's nemesis cry : steady boy something 's go to happen he be get ready buck up boy in a moment of madness sinclair decide to rush that window and dispose of the cool-minded speaker at all cost before he die there at least be the one man he wish to kill he follow that impulse long enough to throw himself sidle along the floor so as not to betray he real strategic position to those at the door and he splash two bullet into the wall trim the side of the window only clear deep-throated laughter come in response i tell you boy i read he mind and he be mad at I eh but riley sinclair hardly hear the mocking answer he have glide back behind the bed the instant the shot be fire as he move two gun appear for a flicker instant around the edge of the doorway one on each side they muzzle kick up rapidly one two three four five six and each as he fire spread the shot carefully from side to side sinclair hear the bullet bite and splinter the woodwork close to the floor the chest of drawer stagger with the impact he raise he own gun watch one of the jump muzzle for a instant and then try a snap shoot the report of he revolver be bite off short by the clang of metal there be a shout curse from the hallway he have blow the gun cleanly out of the sharpshooter 's hand before the amaze rumble from the hall die away sinclair have act he shove he weapon back in its holster and clear the bed with a fly leap from the corner of he eye he see cartwright snatch up he gun and take a chance shot that whistle close to he head and then sinclair plunge into the hall one glimmer chance of success remain on the side of the door toward which he drive there be only three man in the hall behind he be more far more but they weapon be neutralize they could not fire without risk a miss that would be certain to lodge a bullet in the body of one of the man before sinclair those man be kneel for they have be reach out and firing low around the door to rake the floor of the room at the appearance of sinclair they start up he see a gun jerk high for a snap shot and swerving as he leap he drive out with all he weight behind he fist the knuckle bit through flesh to the bone there be a jarring impact and now only two man be before he one of they drop he gun -- it be he who have just empty he weapon into the room -- and fling himself at sinclair with outspread arm the cowpuncher snap up he knee and the blow crumple the other back and to the side he spring on toward the last man who bar he way and all this in the split part of a second chance take a hand against he in the very act of striking he foot lodge on the first senseless body and he catapult forward on he hand he strike the leg of the third man as he fall down they go together and sinclair lurch up from under the weight only to be overtake by many reach hand from behind that instant of delay have lose the battle for he and as he strive to whirl and fight himself clear a arm curl around he neck shut off he breath a great weight jar between he shoulder and he pitch down to the floor he stop fight he feel he gun slip from the holster deft strong hand jerk he arm behind he and tie the wrist firmly together then he be draw to he foot all this without a word speak only the pant and struggle of hard-drawn breath not until he stand on he foot again with a bleeding-faced fellow rise with dazed eye and another clamber up unsteadily with both hand press against he head do the captor give voice and they voice be a yell of triumph that be take up in two direction outside the hotel they become suddenly excite riotously happy in the overflow of they joy they be good-natured some one catch up sinclair 's hat and jam it on he head another slap he on the shoulder a fine game fight say the latter it be the man with the smeared face he be grin through he wound hardest punch i ever get but i do not blame you partner presently he see sheriff kern the latter be perfectly cool perfectly grave it be he arm that have coil around the neck of sinclair and throttle he into submission you do not come out to kill sinclair why i be not use to slaughterhouse work say sinclair with equal calm although he be pant besides it be not worth it murder never be kind of late to come to that idea son now just trot along with I will you he pause where 's arizona cartwright lurch out of the room with he naked gun in he hand red drip from the shallow wound where sinclair 's bullet have nick he he plunge at the captive yell stop that fool snap the sheriff half a dozen man put themselves between the outlaw and the avenger cartwright straggle vainly between you and I say sinclair coldly to the sheriff i think that skunk would plug I while i get my hand tie the sheriff flash a know glance up at he tall prisoner 's face i dunno sinclair kind of look that way although cartwright have be persuade to restore he gun to its cover he pass through the crowd until he confront sinclair now the table be turn eh i 'll take the high hand from now on sinclair it be no good say sinclair dryly the gent that shoot out the light have a chance to see something before he do the shooting and what he see must have show that you be yaller cartwright -- yaller as a yaller dog cartwright fling he fist with a curse into the face of the cowpuncher the weight of the blow jar he back against the wall but he meet the glare of cartwright with a steady eye a thin trickle of crimson run down he cut lip the sheriff rush in between and master cartwright 's arm one more little trick like that stranger and i 'll turn you over to the boy they get way of teaching gent manners how be you raise anyway suddenly sober cartwright draw back from dark glance on every side fellow he say in a shake voice i forget he hand be tie but i be kind of work up he try to murder I it be all right partner drawl red chalmer and he lay a strong hand on the shoulder of cartwright it be all right we all allow for one break but do not do something like that twice -- not in these part sinclair walk beside the sheriff while the crowd pour past he and down the hall when they reach the head of the stair they find the light room below fill with excited upturned face at the sight of the sheriff and he prisoner they roar they applause the face be blot and blur by a veil of rapidly widely wave sombrero the sheriff pause halfway down the stair and hold up he hand sinclair halt beside he look disdainfully over the crowd instantly noise and movement cease it be a spectacular picture the stubby little sheriff and the tall lean wolflike man he have capture it seem a vivid illustration of the power of the law over the lawbreaker sinclair glance down in wonder at kern it be in character for the sheriff to make a speech a moment later the sheriff 's own word have explain he reason for the impromptu address boy he say i figure some of you have get a almighty big wish to see sinclair on the end of a rope eh a deep growl answer he speak personal go on the sheriff smoothly i do not see how he be do a thing worth hang he take a prisoner away from I and he be resist arrest that be all sinclair have get a name as a killer maybe he be but i know he be not do no kill around these part that be come to light yet i 'll tell you another thing a minute ago he could have send three man to death and maybe come off with a free skin but he choose to take he chance without shoot to kill he try to fight he way out with he hand sooner 'n blow the head off of gent that never do he no harm except to get in he way well boy that be something you do not often see and i tell you this right now : if they be any lynch talk around this here town you can lay to it that you 'll have to shoot you way to

any free drink let 'em drift the way of arizona hey arizona step out and make a bow will you but no arizona appear the crowd cheer he and then cheer the generous sheriff kern have win more by he frankness than he could possibly have win in half a dozen spectacular exploit with a gun 25 the crowd swirl out of the hotel before the sheriff and he prisoner and then swirl back again no use follow the sheriff if they hope for detail they know he silence of old instead they pick off the member who have take part in some phase of the fight and draw they aside as sinclair go on down the street the populace of sour creek be leave pool behind he various orator be give account of how the whole thing have happen sinclair have neither eye nor ear for they but he look back and up to the western sky with a flat-topped mountain clearly outline against it there be he country and in he country he have leave jig alone and helpless a feeling of utter desolation and failure come over he he have start with a double-goal -- sandersen or cartwright or both he have fail lamentably of reach either one he look back to the sheriff squat insignificant gray-headed what a man to have block he but who be this arizona he ask i dunno seem to have know you somewhere maybe a friend of yours sinclair h be say the cowpuncher maybe tell I : be it he that be outside the window and trim the light on I you get

get other reason say sinclair what be he full name be not that curious i be not hear of anybody else that know it he be a cool head this arizona seem to read you mind and know jest how you would jump sinclair i would have be off comb the trail but he seem to know that you would come into town i 'll sure keep he in mind if i ever meet up with he murmur sinclair be this where i bunk the sheriff have pause before a squat dumpy building and be work noisily at the lock with a big key now that he back be necessarily toward he prisoner two of the posse step up close beside sinclair they have none of the sheriff 's nonchalance one of they be the man whose head have make the acquaintance of sinclair 's knee and both be ready for instant action of any description i be rhinehart say one softly keep I in mind sinclair i be he that you smash with you knee dirty work i 'll see you when you get out of the lockup -- if that ever happen the voice of sinclair be not so soft i 'll meet you in jail or out

into he voice as he speak and the other shrink instinctively a pace in the meantime the sheriff have succeed in turn the rust lock which squeak back the door grumble on its heavy hinge sinclair step into the musty close atmosphere within do not look like you have much use for this here outfit he say to the sheriff the latter light a lantern nope he say it sure beat all how the luck run sinclair we would have a pretty bad time with crook around these part and they that be nab in sour creek get away about two out of three before they be bring to I at woodville so the boy get together and pony up for this little jail and it be as neat a pile of mud and steel as ever you see look at they bar kind of rusty they look but inside they be toolproof oh it be a up-to-date outfit this jail it be be a comfort to I and it be a credit to sour creek but the trouble be that since it be build they be not be more 'n one or two to put in it maybe you can make out here for the night have you over to woodville in a couple of day sinclair he bring he prisoner into a cagelike cell heavily guard with bar on all side the adobe wall have be trust in no direction the steel lining be the strength of the sour creek jail the sheriff himself set about shake out the blanket when this be do he bid he two companion draw they gun and stand guard at the steel door to the cell not that i do not trust you a good deal sinclair he say but i know that a gent sometimes take big chance so say he cut the bond of he prisoner but instead of make a plunge at the door sinclair merely stretch he long arm luxuriously above he head the sheriff slip out of the door and close it after he a heavy and prolonged clangor follow as steel jar home against steel do not go sheriff say sinclair i need a chat with you i be in no hurry and here be the gent we be talk about here 's arizona the sheriff have wave he two companion out of the jail as soon as the prisoner be securely lodge and no sooner be this do and they have depart through the doorway than the heavy figure of arizona himself appear he come slowly into the circle of the lantern light a oddly change man he swaggering gait with heel that pound heavily be go he slink forward soft-footed he head usually so buoyantly erect be now sink lower and forward he high color have fade to a drab olive in fact from a free-swinging jovial somewhat overbearing demeanor arizona have change to a mien of malicious and rather frightened cunning in this wise he advance heedless of the curious and astonished sheriff until he face be literally press against the bar he peer steadily at sinclair on the face of the latter there have be at first blank surprise then a gradually dawn recognition finally he walk slowly to the bar as sinclair approach the fat cowpuncher draw back with linger catlike step as if he grudge every inch of he retreat and yet dare not remain to meet sinclair by the eternal say sinclair it be dago arizona halt quiver with emotion which the sheriff could not identify save for a blind intense malice the tall man turn to the sheriff smile : dago lansing eh never hear that name say the sheriff maybe not reply sinclair but that be the man i -- you lie cry arizona huskily and he fat swift hand flutter nervously around the butt of the revolver sheriff they be not nothing but lie stock up in he do not believe nothing he say huh chuckle sinclair why kern he be a man about eight year ago that i -- pause he look into the convulse face of arizona who be apparently tortured with apprehension i will not go on dago say sinclair mildly but -- so you have carry this grudge all these day eh arizona toss up he head for a moment he be the arizona the sheriff have know but he laughter be too strident and it be easy to see that he be at a point of hysterically high tension well i would have carry it eighty year as easy as eight declare arizona i be wait all this time and now i get you sinclair you 'll rot behind the bar the best part of the life that be leave to you and when you come out -- i 'll meet you ag ` in sinclair smile in a singular fashion sorry to disappoint you dago but i be not come out i be go to stay put i be through the other blink how come it be something you could not figure say sinclair calmly and he eye the fat man as if from a great distance sinclair be remember the day eight year ago in a lumber camp to the north when a shiver meager shifty-eyed youngster have come among they ask for work they have take pity on he those big lumberjack put he up give he money keep he at the bunk house then article begin to disappear watch money it be sinclair who have catch the friendless stripling in the act of sleight of hand in the middle of the night when the laborer tire out sleep as if stunned and when the other would have let the cringe weep youth go with a lecture and the return of he illicit spoil it be the stern sinclair who have insist on drive home the lesson he force they to strip dago to the waist two stalwart hold he hand and sinclair lay on the whip and dago the moment the lash fall cease he wail and beg and stand quiver with he head bent he tooth set and grit until the punishment be end it be sinclair also when the thing be end and the other would have thrust the boy out penniless who split the contents of he wallet with dago he remember the word he have speak to the striple that day eight year before you be not have much luck out here in the west kid but stay around go south learn to ride a hoss they be nothing that put heart and honesty in a man like a

make a mistake with you kid but do what i have tell you to do and one of these day you 'll meet up with I and beat I to the draw and take everything you get as a grudge out on I but you can not do it unless you turn into a man dago have listen in the most profound silence accept the money without thanks and disappear never to be hear from again in the sleek-faced man before he sinclair could hardly recognize that slender fellow of the lumber camp only the bright and agile eye be the same that and a certain telltale nervousness of hand the color be come back into he face i guess i have do it arizona be say i guess we be square up sinclair yep and a balance on you side maybe maybe not but i have follow you advice long riley i have never forget a word of it it be print into I he make a significant short gesture as if he be snap a whip and a snarl of undying malice curl he lip as long as you live sinclair he add as long as you live i 'll remember even the sheriff shudder at that glimpse into the black soul of a man sinclair alone be unmoved i reckon you have bark enough arizona he suggest s ` pose you trot along i get to have word with my friend the sheriff arizona wave he fat hand he be recover he ordinary poise and with a smile good night to the sheriff he turn away through the door nice friendly sort eh remark sinclair the moment he be alone with kern i still get the chill say the sheriff sure have get a wicked pair of eye that arizona kern cast a apprehensive glance at the closed door yet in spite of the fact that it be close he lower he voice what in thunder have you do to he sinclair about eight year ago -- begin sinclair and then stop short let it go he go on no matter what arizona be today he be sure improve on the gent i use to know what be do be do besides i make a mistake that time i go too far with he and a mistake be like borrow money sheriff it lay up interest and keep compound when you have to pay back what you do a long time ago you find it be a terrible pile that be all i get to say about arizona sheriff kern nod that be straight talk sinclair he say softly but what be it you want to see I about cold foot say sinclair at once the sheriff brighten that be right he say hurriedly you get the right idea now partner glad to see you be use hoss sense and if you gimme a idea of the trail that 'll lead to cold foot i can see to it that you get out of this mess pretty pronto after all you be not do no real harm except for nick cartwright in the arm and i figure that he need a little punishment it 'll cool he temper down you think i ought to tell you where cold foot be ask sinclair without emotion why not he and I sit around the same campfire sheriff and eat off 'n the same deer at this the sheriff wince i know he murmur it be hard -- mighty hard he continue more smoothly : but listen to I partner there be twenty-five-hundred dollar on the head of cold foot why not come in why not split on it plenty for both of we and speak personal i could use half that money and maybe you could use the other half just as well i 'll tell you what i 'll do say sinclair i 'll give you the layout for find cold foot ride west out of sour creek and head for a flat-topped mountain on the shoulder just under the head of the peak you 'll find cold foot go get he the sheriff catch he breath then whirl on he heel the sharp voice of sinclair call he back wait a minute i be not through when you catch cold foot you go after he without gun how come because you might hurt he and he can not fight sheriff even if he be to pull a gun he could not hit nothing with it he could not hit the ground he be stand on with a gun sheriff kern scratch he head and when you get he go on sinclair tell he to go back and take up he life where he leave off because they be no harm come to he great gun man no harm come to he with a murder to he count and a price on he head i mean what i say break it to he real gentle and who pay for the killing of quade sinclair smile he be find it far easier to do it than he have ever imagine the moment he make the resolve he way be smooth for he i pay for quade he say quietly what d'you mean because i kill he sheriff now go tell cold foot that he score be clean 26 toward the flat-topped mountain with the feeling of he fate upon he bill sandersen push he mustang through the late evening while the darkness fall he have long since stop think reasoning there be only the strong blind feeling that he must meet sinclair face to face and decide he destiny in one brief struggle so he keep on until he shadow fall faintly on he path before he long shapeless grotesque he turn and see the moon come up above the eastern mountain a wan sickly moon hardly out of she first quarter and even in the pure mountain air she light be dim but it give thought and pause to sandersen first there be the outcropping of a singular superstition which he have hear long before and never remember until this moment : that a moon see over the left shoulder mean the worst of bad luck it bode very ill for the end of this adventure suppose he be able only partially to surprise the big cowpuncher from the north and that there be a call for fight what chance would he have in the dim and bewildering light of that moon against the surety of sinclair who shoot he know as other man point the finger -- instinctively hit the target it would be a mere butchery not a battle send he mustang into a copse of young tree he dismount he mind be make up not to attempt the blow until the first light of dawn he would try to reach the top of the flat-crested mountain well before sunup when there would be a real light instead of this ghostly and partial illumination from the moon among the tree he sit down and take up the dreadful watch of the night sleep never come near he he be turn the back page of he memory review he past with the singular clearness of a man about to die for sandersen have this mortal certainty rest upon he mind that he must try to strike down sinclair and that he would fail and failure mean only one alternative -- death he be perfectly confident that this be the truth he know with prophetic surety that he would never again see the kind light of the sun that in a half-light in the cold of the dawn a bullet would end he life what he see in the past be not comforting a long train of vivid memory come up in he mind he have accomplish nothing in the total course of he life he have not make a man he friend or win the love of a woman in all he attempt to succeed in life there have be nothing but disastrous failure and wherever he move he involve other in he fall certainly the prospect trip with the three other man have be worse than all the rest but it have be typical it have be he who first suggest the trip and he have round the party together and sustain it with enthusiasm it have be he who lead it into the mountain and across the desert and on the terrible return trip he know with a abide sense of guilt that he alone could have check the murderous and cowardly impulse of quade he alone could have overrule quade and lowrie or fail to overrule they he should at least have stay with the cripple and help he on with the chance of death for they both when he think of that noble opportunity lose he writhe it would have gain the deathless affection of hal sinclair and save that young strong life it would have win he more it would have make riley sinclair he ally so long as he live and how easy to have do it he think look back instead he have give way and already the result have be the death of three man the tale be not yet tell he be sure another death be due a curse lay on that entire party and it would not be end until he sandersen the soul of the enterprise fall the moon grow old in the west then he take the saddle again and ride brood up the trail he horse stumble over the stone as the animal grow wearier in the climb and then keep he gaze fasten above he he see the outline of the crest grow more and more distinct he look behind in the east the light be grow the whole horizon be rim with a pale glow now he spirit rise even this gray dawn be far better than the treacherous moonlight a daylight calm come over he he be stronger surer of himself impatiently he draw out he colt and look to its action the familiar weight add to he self-belief it become possible for he to fight and be possible to fight it be also possible to conquer presently he reach a bald upland the fresh wind of the morning strike he face and he breathe deep of it why could he not return to sour creek as a hero and why could he not collect the price on the head of riley sinclair the thought make he alert savage a moment later he head push up to the level of the shoulder of the mountain he see he quarry in the dimness of that early dawn he make out the form of a sleeper huddle in blanket but it be enough that must be riley sinclair it could not be another and all he premonition be correct suddenly he become aware that he could not fail it be impossible as gloomy as he have be before he spirit now leap to the height he swing down from the saddle softly slowly and go up the hill without once draw he eye from that motionless form in the blanket once something stir to the right and far below he he flash a glance in that direction and see that it be a hobble horse though not the horse of sinclair but that matter nothing the second horse might be among the tree ease he step and tighten the grip on he revolver he draw closer should he shoot without warn no he would lean over the sleeper call he name and let he waken and see he death before it come to he otherwise the triumph would be rob of half of its sweetness now he have come sufficiently near to make out distinctly that there be only one sleeper have sinclair and cold foot separate if so this must be sinclair the latter might have the boldness to linger so close to danger but certainly never cold foot even if he have once work he courage to the point of kill a man he step closer lean and then by the half-light make out the pale delicate feature of the schoolteacher for the moment sandersen be stun with disappointment and yet he spirit rise again almost at once if sinclair have flee all the better he would not return at least for a long time and in the meantime he sandersen would collect the money on the head of cold foot with the colt close to the breast of jig he say : wake up cold foot the girl open she eye struggle to sit up and be thrust back by the muzzle of the gun hold with rocklike firmness in the hand of sandersen riley -- what -- she mutter sleepily and then she make out the face of sandersen distinctly instantly she be wide awake whiter than ever stare better to take the desperado alive than dead -- far better cold foot would make a show in sour creek for the glorification of sandersen as he ride down through the main street and the man would come out to see the prize which even sheriff kern and he posse have not yet be able to take roll over on you face cold foot obey without a murmur there be a coiled rope by the cinder of the fire sandersen cut off a convenient length and bind the slender wrist behind the back of the schoolteacher then he jerk he quarry to a sit posture where 's sinclair go to he astonishment cold foot 's face brighten wonderfully oh then you have not find he you have not find he thank goodness sandersen study the schoolteacher closely it be impossible to mistake the frankness of the latter 's face by gun he say at last i see it all now the skunk sneak off in the middle of the night and leave you alone here to face the music jig flush as she exclaim : that be not true he be never run away in he life maybe not mutter sandersen apprehensively maybe he 'll come back ag ` in maybe he be just ride off after something and will be back at once the old fear sweep over he he apprehensive glance flicker over the rock and tree around he -- a thousand secure hiding place he face the schoolteacher again look here jig : you be charge with a murder you see i can take you dead or alive and the shot that bump you off might bring sinclair run to find out what would happen and he would go the same way but will you promise to keep you mouth shut and give no warning when sinclair heave in sight take you pick it do not make no difference to I one way or the other but i can not have the two of you on my hand to he surprise jig do not answer at once be not i make myself clear speak out i will not promise say cold foot raise the colorless face then by thunder i 'll -- in the sudden contorting of he face she see she death but as she close she eye and wait for the report and the tear of the bullet she hear he mutter : no they be a better way a moment later she mouth be wrench open and a huge wadded bandanna be stuff into it sandersen push she back to the ground and toss the blanket over she again you be not much of a man jig but as a bait for my trap you 'll do tolerable well you be right : sinclair 's come back and when he come i 'll be wait for he out of sight behind the rock but listen to this jig if you wrastle around and try to get that gag out of you mouth i be not go to take no chance whether sinclair 's in sight or not i be go to drill you clean now lie still and keep think on what i tell you i mean it all with a final scowl he leave she and hurry to the rock it make a ideal shelter for he purpose on three side the rock make a thick and effectual parapet a thousand bullet might splash harmlessly against that stone and through crevice he command the whole sweep of the mountainside beneath they the courage which have be grow in sandersen now reach a climax below he lay the helpless body of one prize -- from a distance apparently a sound and quiet sleeper though sandersen could see the terrify glint of jig 's eye but he forget that a moment later when he see the form of a horseman break out of covert from the tree farther down the mountain and immediately disappear again sinclair he study the barrel of the revolver but the horseman appear no more in the brighten and misty dawn it be only after a long pause that there issue from the tree not riley sinclair but the squat thick form of arizona 27 behind the sheriff 's apprehensive glance there have be reason true the door have close upon arizona and the door be thick but the moment arizona have pass through the door he clap he ear to the keyhole and listen hold he breath for he be certain that the moment he back be turn the shameful story of he exploit in the lumber camp eight year before would come out for the edification of kern if so it mean ruin for he arizona be close to he all this district would be close by the story of he early light-fingeredness he feel as if he be be drive to the wall consequently he listen with set tooth to the early question of the sheriff then he breathe easier still incredulous when he hear sinclair refuse to tell the tale still he linger dread that the truth might out and so hear the talk turn to a new channel -- cold foot cold foot mean many thing to sour creek to arizona the schoolteacher mean only one thing -- twenty-five-hundred dollar and arizona be break to he hungry ear come the tiding : i 'll tell you what i 'll do i 'll give you the layout for find cold foot ride west out of sour creek and head for a flat-topped mountain on the shoulder just under the head you 'll find cold foot go get he to arizona it seem as if this last injunction be personal advice he wait to hear no more if he have pause for a moment he might have learn that the hope of twenty-five hundred be a illusion and a snare he see the bright vision of a small fortune place in he hand as the result of a single gunplay he have see the schoolteacher he know by instinct that there be no fight quality in jig and the moment he hear the location it be as good as cash in he pocket he be sure there be only one difficulty he must beat out the sheriff to that end he hurry to the stable behind the hotel break all record for speed in get the saddle on he roan mare and then jog she quietly out of town so as to rouse no suspicion but hardly be he past the outskirts hardly credit he good luck that the sheriff himself be not yet on the way than he touch the flank with he spur and send the mare fly west in the west the moon be drop behind the upper range as he ride through the foothill when he begin to climb the side of the mountain the dawn begin to grow so much the better for arizona but know that he have only cold foot to deal with he do not adopt all the caution of sandersen on the same trail instead he cut boldly straight for the shoulder of the mountain know what he would find there on he arrival in the nearest grove he leave he horse and then walk swiftly up to the level there the first thing that catch he eye be the form wrap in the blanket but the next thing he see be the pale glimmer of the dawn on the barrel of a revolver he reach for he own gun only to see over the rock above he the grin face of sandersen arise too late arizona call the tall man too late for one job partner but just in time for the next arizona curse softly steadily through snarl lip what job sinclair he be go but he 'll be back any minute and it 'll need we both to down he arizona we 'll split on sinclair 's reward disgust and wrath consume arizona without other answer he stride to the prostrate form slash the rope and tear the handkerchief from between the tooth of cold foot the schoolteacher sit up gasp for breath purple of face leave he be cry sandersen he voice shrill with anger leave he be he be the bait arizona and we be the trap that 'll catch sinclair but arizona curse again bitterly leave that bait lie till the sun burn it up you 'll never catch sinclair with it how come from around the rock sandersen appear and walk down to the fat man because sinclair 's already catch if he have expect the tall man to groan with disappointment there be a surprise in store for he sandersen exclaim shrilly for joy sinclair take take dead then dead why you do not mean he be take alive yes i sure do and i do the figure that lead up to he be catch the slender form of jig rise before they tremble it be not true it be not true there be not enough of you in sour creek to take riley sinclair be not it true ask arizona all right son you 'll meet he pronto in the sour creek jail unless the boy finish they party of the other day and string you up before you get inside the jail this bring a peculiar low-pitched moan from cold foot cheer up say sandersen you be not swing yet awhile but he be hurt if he be alive he be terribly wounded arizona beat down the appealing hand with a brutal gesture no he be not particular hurt just he neck squashed a bit where the sheriff throttle he he do not fight enough to get hurt curse he frown sandersen shake he head he be a fight man arizona if they ever be one it seem that everything infuriate the fat man what d'you know about it lanky he demand of sandersen do not i run the affair be not it I that plant the whole trap be not it I that know he would come into town for you or cartwright cartwright gasp jig sure we nail he in cartwright 's room just the way i say we would and they laugh at I the fool he might have gather singular inference from the lowered head of jig and the soft murmur : i might have know -- i might have know he would try for I and i might have have the pleasure of drill he clean say arizona harking back to it with savage pleasure but i shoot out the light i want he to die slow and before the end i want to pry he eye open and make he see my face and know that it be I that do for he that be what i want but he turn yaller and would not fight he would not kill say jig coldly but for courage -- i laugh at you arizona easy scowl the cowpuncher easy jig you be not behind the bar yet you be in reach of my fist and i would think nothing of bust you in the face shut up till i talk to you the misty eye of sandersen brighten a little and grow hard there be a great deal of fight spirit in the man and he easy victory of that morning have rouse he to a battle pitch look to I like you be not run this here party arizona he say dryly if there be any direction to give cold foot i 'll give 'em it be I that take he no direct answer could arizona find to this true statement and as always when a man be at a loss for word he temper rise and he fist clench for the first time he look at sandersen with a eye of savage calculation he have come to hope of a tidy little fortune he have find it snatch out of he hand and as he measure sandersen he heart rise twenty-five-hundred dollar would fairly well equip he in life the anger fade out of he eye and in its place come the cold gleam of the man who think and calculate all at once he begin to smile a mirthless smile that be of the lip only maybe you be right sandersen but i be think you would have to prove that you take cold foot ' prove it sure the boy would not be apt to believe that sleepy sandersen wake up and take cold foot alive instantly the gorge of sandersen rise and he begin to see red be you out to find trouble fatty the adjective find no comfortable lodging place in the mind of arizona I sure i be not i be just state fact the way i know 'em well the fact you know be not worth a damn no it be grow clearer and clearer to the fat man that between he and twenty-five-hundred dollar there stand only the unamiable figure of the long lean cowpuncher he steady he eye till a fix glitter come in it he hate lean man by instinct and distrust they sure they be not how you go to get around the fact that i do take cold foot well sandersen you see that they 's twenty-five-hundred dollar hang on the head of this cold foot certainly and i see ten way of spending just that amount so do i say arizona you do partner you have hear I talk arizona you be talk mighty queer what d'ye mean now suppose it be I that bring in cold foot who have get the money why you that bring he in yep I and suppose i bring he in with two murder charge to he instead of one i do not foller you what be the second murder fatty you sandersen blink and give back a little plainly he be begin to fear that the reason of arizona be unbalanced he shake he head i 'll show you how it 'll be charge to cold foot say the fat man take the cartridge belt of jig he shake the revolver out of the holster and pump a shot into the ground the sharp crack of the explosion rouse no echo for a perceptible space then it strike back at they from a solid wall of rock almost as loud as it have be in fact off among the hill the echo be repeat to a faint whisper arizona drop the revolver carelessly on the ground fatty you have go nutty say sandersen i 'll tell you a yarn say arizona sandersen look past he to the east the light be grow rapidly about the mountain in another moment or so that sunrise which he have be look forward to with such solemn dread would occur he be safe of course and still that sense of impend danger would not leave he he note jig erect very pale watch they with intense and frightened interest here be the story go on the fat man i come out of sour creek hunting for cold foot i come straight to this here mountain halfway up the side i hear a shot i hurry along and soft-foot on to this shoulder i see cold foot stand over the dead body of sandersen then i stick up cold foot and take he back to sour creek and get the reward will not that be two murder on he head the thin swede rub he chin for a grown man fatty you be do a lot of suppose i be go to turn it into fact say arizona how with a chunk of lead pull you gun you lanky fool it seem to jig watch with terrible interest that sandersen stare not at arizona as he go for he gun but beyond the stubby cowpuncher -- far behind and into the east where the dawn be grow brighter lose its color as sunrise do just before the rising of the sun he long arm jerk back the revolver whip into he hand and he stiffen he forearm for the shot all that jig see with eye sharpen so that each movement seem to be take whole seconds be a sneering arizona wait till the last second when he move however it be with a almost leisurely flip of the wrist the heavy colt be conjure into he hand with graceful ease the big weapon slip out and explode before sandersen 's forefinger have curl around the trigger out of the hand of the swede slip the gun and clang unheeded on the ground at he foot she see a patch of red spring up on he breast while he lurch forward with long stiff stride throw up he hand to the east and pitch on he face she turn from the dead thing at she foot the white rim of the sun have just slide over the top of a mountain 28 she drop to she knee and with a sudden hysterical strength she be able to turn he on he back he be dead the first glimpse of he face tell she that she look up into the eye of the murderer arizona be methodically clean he gun he color have not change there be a singular placidity about all he movement i just hurry up what be come to he say arizona coolly as he finish reload he colt sinclair be after he and that mean he be do for oddly enough she find that she be neither very much afraid of the fat man nor do she loathe he for he crime he seem outside of the jurisdiction of the law which govern most man you say sinclair be in jail sure and he be but they do not make jail strong enough in these part to hold sinclair he would have come out and land sandersen just as he be go to come out and land cartwright what have he get agin ' cartwright d'you know oh it be incredible that he could talk so calmly with the dead man before he i do not know she murmur and draw back well take it all in all pursued arizona this deal of mine be pretty rotten but you would swing just the same for one murder as for two they will not hang you no deader eh and when they come to look at it this be pretty neat sandersen be not no good everybody know that but he have one thing i want -- which be you and the twenty-five hundred that go with the gent that bring you into sour creek so at the price of one bullet i get the coin pretty neat i say ag ` in drop the revolver back into the holster he pat it with a caress hand there be you gun go on arizona chuckle it be get a bullet fire out of it there be sandersen 's gun with no bullet fire show that while he be stalk you you shoot and drill he here be my gun with no sign of a shot fire which prove that i just slide in here and stick you up from behind while you be look over the gent you would just kill he rub he hand together and brace himself firmly on he stubby leg look almost benevolently on jig not only do she lose she horror of he but she gain a impersonal detach interest in the workings of he mind she look on he not as a man but as a monster in the guise of a man two death she say quietly for you money you work cheaply arizona jig 's criticism seem to pique he how come sandersen 's death by you bullet and mine when i die in the law both to you account arizona because you know i be innocent i know it but a hunch be not proof in the eye of the law besides i do not work so cheap sandersen be no good he be not worth think about and as for you jig though i do not like to throw it in you face as a schoolteacher you may be all right but as a man you be not worth a damn nope i will not give neither of you a thought -- except for sinclair ah he and you have be bunky if he ever should find out what i do he would go on my trail maybe he will anyway and he be a bad one to have on a gent 's trail you fear he she ask curiously for it have seem impossible that this cold-blooded gunman fear any living thing he roll a cigarette meditatively before he answer sure he say i fear he i be not a fool it be he that start I and he that give I the first main lesson but i be not get the nacheral talent with a gun that sinclair have get nod he head in confirmation he expression soften as with the admiration of one artist for a greater kindred spirit the proof be that they be a long list of gunfight in sinclair 's past but not more death than you can count on the finger of one hand and they that he kill be plumb no good the rest he wing and let 'em go that be he way and it take a artist with a gun to work like that yep he be a great man curse he only one weak thing i ever hear of he do he buckle to the sheriff and tell he where to find you scratch a match on he trousers the cowpuncher be amaze to hear jig cry : you lie he gape at she until the match singe he finger that be a tolerable loud word for a kid to use apparently he meditate punishment but then he shrug he shoulder and light he cigarette wild horse could not have drag it out of he jig be repeat say say the fat man grin how d'you know _ i _ know where you be like a blow in the face it silence she she look miserably down to the ground be it possible that sinclair have betray she not for the murder of quade he would be more apt to confess that himself and indeed she dread the confession but if he let she be drag back if she identity become known she face what be more horrible to she than hang and that be life with cartwright which remind I say arizona that the old sheriff may not wait for morning before he start after you just slope down the hill and saddle you hoss will you automatically she obey wild thought run through she mind to go back to sour creek mean a return to cartwright and then nothing could save she from he halfway to she saddle she foot strike metal she own gun which arizona have drop after firing the bullet be there not a possibility of escape she hear arizona hum idly behind she plainly he be entirely off guard bend with the speed of a bird in pick up a seed she scoop up the gun whirling with the heavy weapon extend she forefinger curl on the trigger but as she turn the humming of arizona change to a low snarl she see he come like a bolt the gun explode of its own volition it seem to she but arizona have swerve in he course and the shot go wild the next instant he strike she the gun be wrench from she hand and a powerful arm catch she and whirl she up only to hurl she to the ground arizona 's snarl pant face bent over she in the very midst of that fury she feel arizona stiffen and freeze the snarl stop he nerveless arm fall away and she be allow to stagger to she foot she find he stare at she with a peculiar horror murder gun whisper arizona now she understand that he know she see he change humble disarm before she but even then she do not understand the profound meaning of that moment in the life of arizona but to have understand she would have have to know how that life begin in a city slum she would have have to see the career of the sneak thief which culminate in the episode of the lumber camp eight year before she would have have to understand how the lesson from the hand of big sinclair have begin the change which transform the sneak into the dangerous man of action and now the second change have come for arizona have make the unique discovery that he could be ashamed he would have laugh have another tell he virtue be a name and no more to the fat man but in spite of himself those eight year under free sky have alter he he have be grow when he think he be stand still when the eye plunge forty mile from mountain to mountain through crystal-clear air the mind be enlarged he have live exclusively among hard-handed man rejoice in a strength greater than they own he suddenly find that the feeble hand from which he have so easily tear the weapon a moment before have in a instant acquire strength to make or break he all that jig could discern of this be that she life be no longer in danger and that she enemy have be disarm but she be not prepare for what follow drag off he hat as if he act reluctantly he eye sink until they rest on the ground at she foot lady he say i do not know i do not even dream what you be 29 gradually she find she breath and greater self-possession you mean i be free she ask he you will not make I go into sour creek he face twist as if in pain make you he ask violently i would blow the head off the first one that try to make you take a step suddenly it seem to she that all this be order and arrange that some mysterious providence have send this man here to save she from sandersen and all the horror that the future promise just as sinclair have save she once before from a danger which he himself have half create i get this to say go on arizona struggle for the word look to I like you might have need of a friend to help you along wherever you be go he shake he thick shoulder sure give I a jolt to think of what you must have go through wander around here all by yourself i sure do not see how you do it and all this time the man whom arizona have kill be lie face up to the morning hardly a pace behind he but she dare not try to analyze this man she could only feel vaguely that a ally have be give she a ally of strength he too must have sense what be in she mind you 'll be want this i reckon return the colt to she he slowly drag he glance from the ground and let it cross she face for a fleeting instant she slip the gun back into its holster and now suppose we go down the hill and get you hoss evidently he be painfully eager to get the dead man out of sight yet he pause while he pick up she saddle they 'll be along pretty pronto -- the sheriff and he man they 'll take care of -- he lead the way down to she hobble horse he saddle it swiftly while she stand aside and watch when he be do he turn to she maybe we better be start it would not come in very handy for kern to find we here eh obediently she come with one hand he hold the stirrup while the other steady she weight by the elbow as she raise she foot in spite of herself she shiver at he touch a moment later from the saddle she be look down into a darkly crimsoned face plainly he have understand that impulse of aversion but he say nothing there be a low neigh from the other side of the hill in answer to he soft whistle and then out of the tree come a beautifully form roan mare with high head and prick ear with mincing step she go straight to she master and jig see the face of the other brighten but he be gloomy again by the time he have swing into the saddle now he say where away you be come with I she ask with a new touch of alarm she regret she tone the moment she have speak she see arizona wince lady he say suppose i come clean to you i be in my time about everything that be bad i be not do a killing except squarely sinclair teach I that and you get to allow that what i do to sandersen be after i give he all the advantage in the draw i take even chance and i give he better than a even break be not that correct she nod fascinate by the struggle in he face between pride and shame and anger worse 'n that he go on force out the bitter truth i be everything down to a sharp with the card which be tolerable low but i get this to say : i be play clean with you i 'll prove it before i be do if you want I to break loose and leave you alone say the word and i be go if you want I to stay and help where i can help say the word and i stay and take order come out with it gather he rein he sit very straight and look she fairly and squarely in the eye for the first time since he have discover the truth about cold foot in spite of herself jig find that she be draw to trust the fat man she let a smile grow let she glance become as level and as straight as he own she rein she horse beside he and stretch out she hand i know you mean what you say say jig and i do not care what you have be in the past i _ do _ need a friend -- desperately riley sinclair say that a friend be the most sacred thing in the world i do not ask that much but of all the man i know you be the only one who can help I as i need to be help will you shake hand for a new start between we lady say the cowpuncher huskily this sure mean a lot to I and the -- other thing -- you 'll forget i never know you say the girl smile at he again until this moment oh it be a go cry arizona now try I out jig see he self-respect come back to he see he eye grow bright and clear arizona be like a man with a new good resolution he want to test he strength and astonish someone with he change there be one great thing in which i need help she say good and what be that riley sinclair be in jail h be muttered arizona he be not in on a serious charge let he stay a while stiffen in the saddle he stare at she do sinclair know what ask the girl but she flush in spite of herself that you be not a man yes for a moment he consider she crimson face gloomily you and sinclair be sort of pal i guess he say at length faintly she reply in the affirmative and she secret be write as clearly as sunlight on she face yet she keep she eye raise bravely as for arizona the newborn hope die in he and then flicker back to a evil life if sinclair be in he way why give up why not remove this obstacle as he have remove other in he time the hurry voice of the girl break in on he somber thought he go to sour creek to help I as soon as he find out that i be not a man he put himself in terrible danger there on my account do cartwright have something to do with you and he yes but arizona make no effort to read she riddle she go on : now that he have be take i know what have happen to keep I out of danger he tell -- that you be a woman no he would not do that because he know that be the last thing in the world that i want reveal but he be tell they that he kill quade and now he be in danger of he life let 's ride on say arizona i get to think a pile she do not speak while the horse wind down the steep side of the mountain mile after mile rise behind they the sun increase in power flash on the leaf of the tree and begin to burn the face with its slanting heat now and then she venture a side-glance at arizona and always she find he in a brown study vaguely she know that he be fight the old battle of good and evil in the silence of the morning finally he stop he horse and turn to she again they be in the foothill by this time and they have draw out from the tree to a little level space on the top of a rise the morning mist be thin rapidly in the heart of the hollow beneath they far off they hear the lowing of cow be drive into the pasture land after the morning milking and they could make out tiny figure in the field lady arizona be say to she they be one gent in the world that i have get a eight-year-old grudge agin ' i have swear to get he sooner or later and that gent be riley sinclair make it something else and i 'll work for you till the skin 's off my hand but sinclair -- he stop study she intently will you tell I one thing how much do sinclair mean to you a great deal say the girl gently but if you hate he i can not ask you he be a hard man say arizona and he be get a mean name lady you know that but when you say that he mean a lot to you maybe it be because he be take a big chance for you in sour creek and -- she shake she head it be more than that -- much more well i guess i understand say arizona bury the last of he hope arizona look straight into the sun eight year ago he be a better man than i be say he at length and he be a better man still lady i be go to get riley sinclair free 30 as arizona have predict sheriff kern be greatly tempt not to start on the hard ride for the mountain before morning and finally he follow he impulse with the first break of the dawn he be up and a few minute later he have take the trail alone there be no need of number for that matter to tell a single man that he no longer need dread the law but it be only common decency to inform he of the charge and kern be a decent sort he be thoughtful on the trail a great many thing have happen to upset the sheriff the capture of sinclair take it all in all be a important event to be sure the chief glory be attributable to the cunning of arizona nevertheless the community be sure to pay homage to the skill of the sheriff who have lead the party and manage the capture but now the sheriff find himself regret the capture and all its attendant glory not even a personal grudge against the man who have take he first prisoner from he could give a edge to the sheriff 's satisfaction for during the late hour of the precede night he have hear from sinclair the true story of the killing of quade not a murder but a fair fight and he have hear more -- the whole unhappy tale which begin with the death of hal sinclair in the desert a story which now include so far as the sheriff know three death with a promise of another in the future it be little wonder that he be disturb he philosophy be of the kind that be build up in a country of horse hard ride hard work hard fight accord to the precept of that philosophy sinclair would have shirk a vital moral duty have he fail to avenge the pitiful death of he brother the sheriff put himself into the boot of the man who be now he prisoner and face a sentence of death in that man 's place he know that he would have take the same course it be a matter of necessary principle and the sheriff also know that no jury in the country could allow sinclair to go free it might not be the death sentence but it would certainly be a prison term as bad as death these thought consume the time for the sheriff until he horse have labor up the height and he come to the little plateau where so much have happen outside of he ken and there he see bill sandersen with the all-seeing sun on he dead eye for a moment the sheriff could not believe what he see sandersen be in the phrase of the land sinclair 's meat it suddenly seem to he that sinclair must have break from jail and do this killing during the night but a moment 's reflection assure he that this could not be the mind of the sheriff whirl not sinclair certainly the man have be dead for some hour in the sky far above and to the north there be certain black speck move in great circle that drift gradually south the buzzard be already come to the dead he watch they for a moment with the sinking of the heart which always come to the man of the mountain desert when he see those grim bird it be not sinclair but who then he examine the body and the wound it be a center shot nicely place certainly not the sort of shot that cold foot accord to the description which sinclair have give of the latter 's marksmanship would be apt to make but there be no other conclusion to come to cold foot have certainly be here accord to sinclair 's confession and it be certainly reasonable to suppose that cold foot have commit this crime the sheriff place the hat of sinclair over he face and swing back into he saddle he must hurry back to sour creek and send up a burial party for no one would have a interest in inter the body in the town but once in the saddle he pause again the thought of the schoolteacher have kill so formidable a fighter as sandersen stick in he mind as a thing too contrary to probability moreover the sheriff have grow extremely cautious he have make one great failure very recently -- the escape of this same cold foot he would have fail again have it not be for arizona he shudder at the thought of how he reputation would have be ruin have he go on the trail and allow sinclair to double back to sour creek and take the town by surprise dismount he throw he rein and go back to review the scene of the killing there be plenty of track around the place the gravel obscure a great part of the mark and still other print be blur by the dead grass but there be pocket of rich loamy soil moist enough and firm enough to take a impression as clearly as paper take ink the sheriff remove the right shoe from the foot of sandersen and make a series of fresh print they be quite distinctive the heel be turn out to such a extent that the track be always a narrow indentation where the heel fall on the soft soil he identify the same track in many place and dismiss the other track the sheriff proceed to make up a trail history for sandersen here he come up the hill on foot here he pause beside the ember of the fire and remain standing for a long time for the mark be work in deeply after a time the trail go -- he follow it with difficulty over the hard-packed gravel -- up the side of the hill to a semicircular arrangement of rock and there distinct in the soil be the impression of the body where the cowpuncher have lie down the sheriff lay down in turn and at once he be sure why sandersen have choose this spot he be defend perfectly on three side from bullet and in the meantime through crevice in the rock he maintain a clear outlook over the whole side of the hill obviously sandersen have lie down to keep watch for what for cold foot of course on whose head a price rest or at least so sinclair must have believe at the time the news have not yet be publish abroad that cold foot have be exculpate by the confession of sinclair to the killing of quade so much be clear but presently sandersen have rise and go down the hill again leave from the other side of the rock have he cover cold foot when the latter return to he camp have be absent when sandersen first arrive no the track down the hill be leisurely not the long stride which a man would make to get close to one whom he have cover with a revolver from a distance reach the shoulder of the mountain kern puzzle anew he begin a fresh study of the track those of cold foot be instantly know by the tiny size of the mark of the sole the sheriff remember that he have often wonder at the smallness of the schoolteacher 's foot cold foot be there and sandersen be dead again it seem certain that cold foot have be guilty of the crime but the sheriff keep on systematically hunting for new evidence he find no third set of track for some time but when he do find they they be very clear -- a short broad foot the imprint of a heavy man a fat man then no doubt from the length of the footprint it be very doubtful if the man be tall and certainly by the clearness of the indentation the man be heavy the sheriff could tell by make a track beside that of the quarry a second possibility therefore have enter and the sheriff feel a reasonable conviction that this must be the guilty man now he comb the whole area for some means of identify the third man who have be on the mountainside but nothing have be drop except a brilliant bandanna wad compactly together which the sheriff recognize as belong to sandersen there be only one definite means of recognize the third man very faint in the center of the impression make by he sole be two cross arrow the sign of the bootmaker the sheriff shake he head could he examine the sole of the boot of every man in the vicinity of sour creek even if he limit he inquiry to those who be short and stocky and might there not be many a man who wear the same type of boot he fling himself gloomily into he saddle again and this time he head straight down the trail for sour creek at the hotel he be surround by a excited knot of people who wish to know how he have

where the sole have lie there be a sharply define pair of cross arrow a short fat heavy man the sheriff raise he glance and examine the bulky shoulder of the man then he hastily swallow the rest of he coffee yet there might be a dozen other short stocky man in town whose boot have the same impression he look thoughtfully out the kitchen window strive to remember some clue but as far as he could make out the only time arizona and sandersen have cross have be when the latter apply for a place on the posse surely a small thing to make a man commit a murder if you gimme the job of guard sinclair

sneak thief whom sinclair have first meet in the lumber camp and he know instinctively that this be the first time since that unpleasant episode that arizona have be corner the loathing leave sinclair

gent want I to help he on a mortgage -- only fifty buck to meet a payment and they be half a dozen would mortgage they soul if i would stake 'em to enough downstairs to get they into a crap game or something then let they have the money they need why it would not be more than a hundred dollar altogether a hundred be a hundred why should i throw it away on they bum because after you have do it you 'll have a dozen man who 'll follow you you 'll have a mob sure but what of that expect I to lead a attack on a jail eh throw my life away by gun i think you would like that you do not have to

they think a injustice be be do they 'll risk they neck to right it and if you work on they in the right way you can have twenty man who 'll risk everything to get riley out but there will not be a risk if twenty man rush the jail the guard will simply throw down they gun and give up well i wonder muttered cartwright i be sure of it jude do you think a deputy will let himself be kill simply to keep a prisoner safely they will not do it you do not know this kern i _ do _ know he and i know that he be human i have see he beat once already by sinclair you keep come back to he jude if you do this thing for I she say steadily i 'll go back with you i do not love you but if i go back i 'll keep you from a great deal of shameful talk i be sorry truly that i leave i could not help it it be a impulse that -- take I by the throat and if i go back i 'll honestly try to make you a good wife she falter a little before that last word and she voice fall but jude cartwright be wholly fascinate by the color in she face and the softness of she voice he mistake for a sudden rise of tenderness they be only one thing i get to ask -- you and sinclair -- have you ever -- i mean -- have you ever tell he you be pretty fond of he -- that you love he he blurt it out stammer certainly she know that she answer be a lie though it be true in the letter i have never tell he so she say firmly but i owe he a great debt -- he must not die because he be a gentleman jude all the time she be speak he watch she with ferret sharpness think busily before she end he have reach he decision i be go to raise that mob jude what a ring in she voice if he have be in doubt he would have know then no matter what she say she love riley sinclair he smile sourly down on she keep you thanks you 'll hear news of sinclair before morning and he stalk out of the room 33 cartwright go downstairs in the highest good humor he have be convince of two thing in the interview with he wife : the first be that she could be induce to return to he the second be that she love riley sinclair he do not hate she for such fickleness he merely despise she for she lack of brain no thinking woman could hesitate a moment between the ranch and the lumber tract of cartwright and the empty purse of riley sinclair as for hatred that he concentrate on the head of sinclair himself he have already excellent reason for hate the rangy cowpuncher those reason be now intensify and give weight by what he have recently learn he determine to raise a mob but not to accomplish he wife 's desire what she have say about the weakness of jail the strength of sinclair and the probability that once out he would take the trail of the rancher appeal vigorously to he imagination he do not dream that such a man as sinclair would hesitate at a killing and love the girl the first thing sinclair would do would be to remove the obstacle through the simple expedient of a well-placed bullet but the girl have not only convinced he in this direction she have teach he where he strength lay and she have point a novel use for that strength he go to work instantly when he enter the big back room of the hotel which be use for card and surreptitious drinking a little patient-faced man in a corner who have be suck a pipe all evening and watch the crap game hungrily be the first object of he charity ten dollar slip into the pocket of the little cowpuncher bring he out of he chair with a grin of gratitude and bewilderment a moment later he be on he knee call to the dice in a cackle voice cross the room cartwright pick out two more obviously stall gambler and give they a new start return to the table he find that the game be lag in the first place he have from the start supply most of the sinew of war to that game also two disgruntled member have go break in he absence through try to plunge for the spoil of the evening they sit back with black face and watch he come we be get down to a small game say the gray-headed man who be deal but cartwright have other idea a friend 's a friend he say jovially and a gent that be be play beside I all evening i figure for a friend sit in boy i 'll stake you to a couple of round eh gladly they come astonished and exchange glance cartwright have make a sour loser all the game this sudden generosity take they off balance it let in a merciful light upon the cruel criticism which they have be level at he in private the pale man with the blond eyelash and the fade blue eye who have be dexterously stack the card all through the game decide at that moment that he would not only stop cheat but he would even lose some of he ill-gotten gain back into the game only a sudden rush of unbelievable luck keep he from execute he generous and silent promise this pale-faced man be name whitey from the excessive blondness of he hair and he pallor he be not popular in sour creek but he be much respect a proof of he ingenuity be that he have cheat at card in that community for five year and still he have never be catch at he work he be not a bold-talking man in fact he never start argument or trouble of any kind but he be a most dexterous and thoroughgoing fighter when he be corner in fact he be what be widely know as a finisher and it be whitey whom cartwright have choose as the leader of the mob which he intend raise he wait until the first shuffle be in progress after the hand then he begin he theme understand the sheriff be pretty strong for this sinclair that murder quade he say carelessly ` murder ' be a tolerable strong word come back the unfriendly answer maybe it be a fair fight cartwright laugh maybe it be he say whitey interrupted himself in the act of shove the pack across to be cut he raise he pale eye to the face of the rancher what make you laugh cartwright nothing say jude hastily nothing at all if you gent do not know sinclair it be not up to I to give you light let he go nothing more be say during that hand which whitey win jude apparently bluff shamelessly buck he up to fifty dollar and then he allow himself to be call with a pair of ten against a full house not only do he lose but he start a laugh against himself and he join in cheerfully he be aware of whitey frown curiously at he and smile faintly which be the nearest that whitey ever come to laughter and indeed the laugh cost cartwright more than money but it be a price -- the price he be pay for the adherence of whitey what about this sinclair ask the man with the great red blotchy freckle across he face and the back of he neck so that the skin between look red and raw you come from up north which be he direction too know anything about he he look like pretty much of a man to I and the sheriff say he be a square shooter from the word go maybe he be say cartwright but i do not want to go around digging the ground away from nobody 's reputation whatever he be get he will not last long say whitey definitely he 'll swing sure it be cartwright 's opening he take advantage of it dexterously without too much haste he even yawn to show he lack of interest well i get a hundred that say he do not hang he observe quietly and look full at whitey across the table it be a challenge which the gambling spirit of the latter could not afford to overlook money talk begin whitey then he check himself do you _ know _ anything cartwright sure i do not say jude in the manner of one who have abundant knowledge in reserve but they say that the sheriff and sinclair have become regular bunky do not do nothing hardly but sit and chin with each other over in the jail ever know kern to do that before they shake they head which be a sign that sinclair may be all right say the sober whitey which be a sign that he might have something on the sheriff say jude cartwright i do not say that he _ have _ mind you but it look kind of queer he yank a prisoner away from the sheriff one day and the next day he be take for murder do the sheriff have much to do with he take no he do not by all account it be arizona that do the take planning and everything and after sinclair be take what do the sheriff do he get on the trail of arizona and have he check in for murder of another gent maybe arizona be guilty maybe he be not but it kind of look as if they be something between sinclair and kern do not it at this bold exposition of possibility they pause kern be figure tolerable straight declare whitey sure he be that be because he do not talk none and do he work besides he be a killer that be he job so be sinclair a killer maybe he do fight quade square but quade be not the only one why boy this sinclair have get a record as long as my arm in silence they sit around the table each man think hard the professional gunman get scant sympathy from ordinary cowpuncher now i drop in at the jail say the man of the great freckle and come to think about it i hear sinclair singing and i see he polish he spur sure he be get ready for a ride put in cartwright there be a growl from the other they be slowly turn they interest from the game to cartwright what d'you mean a ride get another hundred say cartwright calmly that when the morning come it will not find sinclair in the jail at once they be absolutely silence for money talk in a eloquent voice deliberately cartwright count out the two stack of shimmering twenty-dollar gold piece five to a stack one hundred that he do not hang another hundred that he be not in the jail when the morning come any taker boy it have ought to be easy money -- if everything 's square whitey make a move but finally merely raise he hand and rub he chin he be watch that gold on the table with catlike interest a man _ must _ know something to be so sure i would like to know murmur the man of the freckle disconnectedly well say cartwright they be not much of a mystery about it for one thing if the sheriff be plumb set on keep they two why do not he take 'em over to woodville today where they be a jail they could not bust out of eh again they be silence and in a argument when a man fall silent it simply mean that he be think hard on the other side but as far as i be concerned go on cartwright yawning again it do not make no difference one way or another sour creek be not my town and i do not care if it get the ha-ha for have its jail bust open of course after the bird have fly the sheriff will ride hard after 'em -- on the wrong trail whitey raise he slender agile efficient hand gent he say something have get to be do this man cartwright be give we the truth he be get he hunch and hunch be mostly always right speak out whitey say the man with the freckle encouragingly i like you style of think nod he acknowledgment whitey say : the main thing seem to be that sinclair and arizona be old hand at kill and they have ought to be hang well if the sheriff be not get the rope maybe we could help he out eh 34 the moment she husband be go jig drop back in she chair and bury she face in she arm weep but there be a sort of sad happiness in make sacrifice for those we love and presently jig be laugh through she tear and tremble as she wipe the tear away after a time she be able to make herself ready for another appearance in the street of sour creek she practice back and forth in she room that exaggerated swagger jerk she sombrero rakishly over one eye cock up she cartridge belt at one side and swing down the stair she go straight to the jail and meet the sheriff at the door where he sit smoke a stub of a pipe he gape widely at the sight of she smoke streaming up past he eye then he rise and shake hand violently all i get to say jig he remark be that the other be the one that make the big mistake when i go and arrest you i be just follow in line but i be sorry and i be mighty glad that you be find to be ok wanly she smile and thank he fox he good wish i would like to see sinclair she say kern 's amiability increase the best thing i know about you jig be that you be not turn sinclair down now that he be in trouble go right back in the jail he and arizona be chin wait a minute i guess i get to keep a eye on you to see you do not pass nothing through the bar keep clean back from they bar jig and then you can talk all you want i 'll stay here where i can watch you but can not hear be that square nothing squarer in the world say jig and go in she leave the sheriff grin vacantly into the dark there be a peculiar something in jig 's smile that soften man but when she step into the sphere of the lantern light that spread faintly through the cell she be astonish to see arizona and sinclair kneel opposite each other shooting dice with abandon and snap of the finger they rise laugh at the sight of she and come to the bar but you be not worried ask jig you be not upset by all this it be arizona who answer a strangely change arizona since he entrance into the jail look here he say gaily why should we be worryin ' be not we get a good sound roof over we head with a set of blanket to sleep in he smile at tall sinclair then change he voice thing fall through he say softly glance at the far-off shadowy figure of the sheriff sorry but we 'll work this out yet i know she answer she lower she voice to caution i be only go to stay a moment to keep away suspicion listen something be go to happen tonight that will set you both free do not ask I what it be but among those cottonwood behind the blacksmith shop i be go to have two good horse saddle and ready for you one will be you roan arizona and i 'll have a good horse for you riley and when you be free start for those horse sinclair lay hold on the bar with he big hand and press he face close to the iron stare at she you be not come along with we he ask i -- no be you go to stay here perhaps i do not know -- i have not make up my mind have cartwright -- she break away from those entangle question i must go but you 'll be at the place with the horse yes then so long till the time come and -- you be a brick jig once outside the jail she set to work at once as for get the roan it be the simplest thing in the world there be no one in the stable behind the hotel and no one to ask question she calmly saddle the roan mount he and ride by a wider detour to the cottonwood behind the blacksmith shop she own horse be to be for sinclair but before she take he she go into the hotel and the first man she find on the veranda be cartwright he come to she at once shift away from the other how be thing good say cartwright be not you hear 'em talk here and there about the hotel man stand in knot of three and four talk in low voice be they talk about _ that _ sure they be say cartwright relieved you be not hear nothing not a word then the thing for you to do be to keep under cover you do not want to get mix up in this thing eh i suppose not keep out of sight honey the crowd will start pretty soon and tear thing loose he could not resist one savage thrust a rope or a pair of rope will do the work rope one to tie kern and one to tie he deputy he explain smoothly where you go now get they retreat ready she whisper excitedly i have already warn they where to go to get the horse she wave to he and step back into the night convince that all be well as for cartwright he hesitate stare after she after all if he plan develop it would be wise for he to allow the other to do the work of mischief he have no wish to be actively mix up with a lynch party sometimes there be after result and if he have do no more than talk there would be small hold upon he by the law moreover thing be go smoothly under the guidance of whitey the pale-faced man have throw himself body and soul into the movement it be a rare thing to see whitey excited other man be readily impressed after a time when anger have reach a certain point where man melt into hot action these fix figure of man would sweep into fluid action and then the fate of arizona and sinclair would be determine it pleased cartwright more than any action of he life to feel that he have stir up this movement it please he still more to know that he could now step back and watch the work of ruin go on it be like disturb the one small stone which start the avalanche which eventually smash the far-off forest so much be do then and now why not make sure that the very last means of retreat for the pair be block the girl go to get the horse and if by the one chance in twenty the two should actually break out of the jail it would remain to cartwright to kill the horse or the man he do not care which he slip behind the hotel and presently see the girl come out of the stable with she horse he follow skulk softly behind she until he reach the appoint place among the cottonwood the tree grow tall and thick of trunk and about they basis be a growth of dense shrubbery it be a simple thing to conceal two saddle horse in a hollow which sink into the edge of the shrubbery cartwright 's first desire be to couch himself in shoot distance then he remember that shooting with a revolver by moonlight be uncertain work he slip away to the hotel and get a rifle ready enough man be mill through the lower room of the hotel the point of discussion have long since be pass the ringleader have make up they mind they go about with face so black that those who be ask to join hardly have the courage to question there be broad-voiced rumor grow swiftly something be wrong -- something be very wrong it be like that mysterious whisper which go through the forest before the heavy storm strike something be terribly wrong and must be right how the ringleader have reason nobody pause to ask it be sufficient that a score of man be say : the sheriff figure on let sinclair and arizona go a typical scene between two man they meet casually one man whistle the other thoughtful what be the bad luck ask the whistler no time for whistle say the other say what you mean i ask you just this say the gloomy man with a mystery of much knowledge in he face : be gent around here go to be murder and the murderer go free well sinclair and arizona -- that be what be up they be go to bust loose i dunno about arizona but sinclair they say be a square shooter who tell you that sinclair himself he be get a rep as long as my arm he be a bad one son you do not say i do say and something have get to be do or sour creek will not be a decent man 's town no more let I in off they go arm in arm cartwright see half a dozen little interview of this nature as he enter the hotel man be excite they hardly know why there be no need for reason in a mob one have only to cry kill and the mob will start of its own volition to find something that may be slay also a mob have no conscience and no remorse it be the nearest thing to a devil that exist and it be also the nearest thing to the divine mercy and courage it be braver than the bravest man it be more timorous than the most fearful it be fiercer than a lion gentler than a lamb all these thing by turn and each one to the exclusion of all the other now the thundercloud be pile on the horizon and cartwright could feel the electricity in the air he go to pop i get to have a rifle what for you know say cartwright significantly the hotelkeeper nod he bring out a old winchester still mobile of action and deadly with that weapon under he arm cartwright start back but then he remember that there be excellent chance of miss even with a rifle when he be shoot through the shadow and by the treacherous moonlight it would be better far better to have he horse with he then if he actually succeed in wound one or both of they he could run he victim down or perhaps keep up a steady fire of rifle shot from the rear that would bring half the town pour out to join in the chase so he swing back to the stable saddle he horse trot it around in a comfortably wide detour and come within sound distance of the cottonwood behind the blacksmith shop he dismount and lead he horse into a dense growth of shrubbery that close approach would have be impossible without alarming the girl have it not be for a stiff wind blow across into he face completely muffle the noise of he come in the bush he ensconce himself safely only a few yard away he keep he eye on the opening among the cottonwood behind which the girl and the two horse move from time to time grow more and more visible as the moon climb above the horizon mist he tighten he grip on the rifle and amuse himself with draw bead on stump and bright bit of foliage from time to time he must be ready for any sort of action if the two should ever appear while he wait sound reach he ear from the town sound eloquent of purpose he listen to they as to beautiful music it be a low distinct and continuous humming sound voice of man go into it low as the growl of a angered dog and there be a background of slam door and footstep on veranda sour creek be muster for the assault 35 now that sound have enter the jail and it have a peculiar effect it be like that distant murmuring of the storm which walk over the treetop far away it make the sheriff and he two prisoner lift they head and look at one another in silence for the sheriff be most unprofessionally tilted back in a chair with he foot brace against the bar of the cell while he chat with he bad man about man woman and event the sheriff have a distinct curiosity to learn how arizona have recover so suddenly from he blue funk unquestionably the fat man have recover he voice be as steady now as any man 's and the old insolent glitter be in he eye he square he shoulder and blow he smoke straight at the face of the sheriff as he talk what cause it the sheriff could not tell this rehabilitation of a fight man but he connect the influence of sinclair with the change by this time sinclair himself be the more restless of the two while arizona sit at ease on the bunk the tall man range up and down the cell with long noiseless step turn quickly back and forth beside the bar he have spend he nervous energy cheer up arizona until the latter be fill with a reckless careless courage what would happen arizona could not guess but sinclair have assure he that something _ would _ happen and he trust implicitly to the word of he tall companion sooner or later he would learn that they be hopeless and sinclair dread the breakdown which he know would follow that discovery in he heart sinclair know that there would be no hope no chance the girl he feel have be sweep off she foot with some absurd dream of free they for he own part he have implicit faith in the strength of the toolproof steel of the bar on the one hand and the gun of the sheriff on the other as long as they hold they would keep they prisoner the key to freedom be the key to the sheriff 's heart and sinclair be too much of a man to whine he have come to the end of he trail and that be evident in the restlessness of he walk to and fro the love of the one thing on earth that he care for be he accord to arizona and there be nothing to make the fat man lie it seem to riley sinclair that at the very moment he have set he hand upon priceless gold the treasure be crumble to dead sand he have lose she by the very thing that win she in the midst of he pacing he stop and lift he head just as the sheriff and arizona do the same thing the far-off murmur hum and moan toward they gather strength then the sheriff push back he chair and go to the front of the jail they hear he give direction to he deputy to find out what the murmur mean when kern return he be patently worried gent he say i have hear that same sort of a sound twice before and it mean business none of the three speak again until the door of the jail be burst open and the deputy come on they run kern he gasp as he reach the sheriff they be come who every man in sour creek they try to get I with 'em i tell 'em i would stay and then slip off they want both of these they want 'em bad they be go to fight to get 'em do they want to grab arizona and sinclair ask the sheriff with surprising lack of emotion do not think they be guilty you be wrong they think they be sure guilty and they be go to lynch 'em he whisper this but he panting make the word louder than he think sinclair hear and by the shudder of arizona he know that he companion have hear as well now come the low-pitched voice of the sheriff : be you with I pat the deputy recede why man you be not go to fight the whole town i would fight the whole town say the sheriff smoothly but i do not need you with I you be through partner close the door soft when you go out pat make no argument offer no sentimental protest of devotion he be glad of any excuse and he retreat at once after he go the sheriff and sinclair hear the heavy door of the jail lock kern come back carry a bundle outside the murmuring have increase at a single leap to a roar the rush for the jail be begin arizona shrink back against the wall he little eye glare desperately at sinclair he last hope in the emergency but sinclair look to the sheriff the bundle in the arm of the latter unrolled and show two cartridge belt with gun append next still in silence the sheriff unlock the door to the cell sinclair the tall cowpuncher leap beside he arizona skirt away to one side stealthily none of that command kern no crooked work arizona i be give you a fight chance for you life here he toss a gun and belt to sinclair the latter without a word buckle it on now quick work boy say the sheriff it be go to be the second time in my life that prisoner have get away and tie I up understand they be not go to be no massacre if i can help it gent like sinclair do not come in pair and he be go to have a fight chance boy tie I up fast and throw I in the corner i 'll tell 'em that you slug I through the bar and get the key away you hear as he speak he throw arizona a gun and belt and the latter imitate sinclair in buckle it on but the fat man then make for the door of the cell outside the rush reach the entrance to the jail and split on it the voice leap into a tumult by thunder demand arizona be you go to wait for _ that _ you want kern to get into trouble ask sinclair grab this end and tie he ankle while i fix he hand frantically they work together be you comfortable sheriff he lay securely truss in a corner of the passageway dead easy boy now what be you plan be there a back way out no way in or out but the front door you get to wait till they smash it there they start now then dive out as they rush they will not be expect nothing like that but gag I first hastily sinclair obey the door of the jail be shake and groan under the attack from without and the shout be a steady roar then he hurry to the front of the little building arizona be already there gun in hand watch the door bulge under the impact evidently they have catch up a heavy timber and a dozen man be pound it against the massive door sinclair catch the gun arm of he companion fatty he say hastily gunplay will spoil everything we get to take 'em by surprise fast run will save we maybe fast shooting be not any good when it be one man agin ' fifty and these boy mean business arizona reluctantly let he gun drop back in its holster he nod to sinclair the latter give he direction swiftly speak loudly to make he voice carry over the roar of the crowd when the door go down which it 'll do pretty pronto i 'll dive out from this side and you run from the other side straight into the crowd i 'll turn to the right and you turn to the leave the minute you be around the corner of the building shoot back over you shoulder or straight into the air it 'll make 'em think that you have stop and be go to fight 'em off from the corner they 'll take it slow you can bet then beat it straight on for the cottonwood behind the blacksmith shop they 'll drop we the minute we show sure we get the long chance and nothing more be that good enough for you he be reward in the dimness by a glint in the eye of arizona and then the fat man grip he hand you and I agin ' the world in the meantime the door be bulge in the center under blow of increase weight a second batter ram be now bring into play and the rain of blow be uncease still between shock the door spring back but there be a telltale rattle at every blow finally as a yell spring up from the crowd at the sight the upper hinge snap loudly and the door sag in both timber be now apparently swing at the same moment under the joint impact the door be literally lift from its last hinge and hurl inward and with it lunge the two batter ram and the man who have wield they they tumble headlong carry away by the very weight of they successful blow now call sinclair and he spring with a indian yell over the head of the sprawl man in the doorway and into the thick of the crowd half a dozen of the draw gun whip up at the sight but no one could make sure in the half-light of the identity of the man who have dash out they imagination place the two prisoner safely behind the bar inside before they could think twice a second figure leap through the doorway and pass they in the opposite direction then they awaken to the fact but they awaken in confusion a dozen shot blaze in either direction but they be wild snapshot of man take off balance two leap take sinclair through the thick of the astonished man before he he come to the scattering edge and see a man dive at he the cowpuncher beat the butt of he gun into the latter 's face and speed on whipping around the corner of the little jail with bullet whistle after he he own gun as he leap out of sight he fire into the ground and he hear a similar shot from the far side of the building those two shot as he have predict check the pursuer one vital second and keep they mill in front of the jail then they spill out around the corner each man run low he gun ready but sinclair deep in the darkness of the tree shadow behind the jail be already out of sight he catch a glimpse of arizona sprinting ahead of he for dear life they reach the cottonwood together and be greet by a low shout from the girl she be run out from the shelter drag the horse after she arizona go into he saddle with a single leap sinclair pause to take the jump with he hand on the pommel and as he lift himself up with a jump a gun blaze in point-blank range from the nearest shrubbery there be a yell from arizona not of pain but of rage they see he gun glisten in he hand and swerve he horse to disturb the aim of the marksman he weapon 's first report blended with the second shot from the bush a tongue of dart flame straight at the flash of a target arizona have fire and there be a answering yell out of the dark of the shrubbery a great form leap with a grotesque shadow beneath it on the moon-whitened ground cartwright cry sinclair as the big man collapse and become a shapeless inanimate black heap straight ahead arizona be already spur and sinclair wave once to the white face of jig then shoot after he companion while the tree and shrubbery to they left emit a sudden swarm of man and bark gun but to strike a rapidly move object with a revolver be never easy and to strike by the moonlight be difficult indeed a dangerous flight of slug bore the air around the fugitive for the first hundred yard of they flight but after that the firing cease as the man of sour creek run for they horse straight on into the night ride the pair \* \* \* \* \* one year have make arizona a little plumper and one year have draw riley sinclair more lean and somber when they ride out on the shoulder of a flat-topped mountain and look down into the hollow where the late afternoon sun be already send broad shadow out from every rise of ground sour creek be a blur and a twinkle of glass in the distance come to think of it say arizona it be just one year today riley be it that that brung you back here and I unknow the tall man make no answer but shaded he eye to peer down into the valley and arizona make no attempt to pursue the conversation he be long since accustom to the silence of he travel mate see that sinclair show no disposition either to speak or move he leave the big cowpuncher to himself and start off through the tree in search of game the sign of a deer catch he eye and hurry he on into a futile chase from which he return in the early dark of the evening he be guide by the fire which sinclair have kindle on the shoulder but to he surprise as he draw nearer the fire dwindle very much as if riley have entirely forget to replenish it with dry wood a year of wild life have sharpen the caution of arizona that neglect of he fire be by no means in keep with the usual method of sinclair before he come to the last spur of the hill arizona dismount and steal up on foot he listen intently there be not a sound of anyone move about there be only a occasional crackle of the die fire when he come to the edge of the shoulder arizona raise he head cautiously to peer over he see a faintly illumined picture of riley sinclair sit with he hat off he face raise and such a light in he face that there need no play of the fire to tell its meaning beside he sit a girl more distinct for she be dress in white and the fire gleam and curl and model she hair and cast a highlight on she chin she throat and she hand in the brown hand of sinclair arizona wince down out of sight and steal back under the tree doggone I he say to he horse they both remember the day end of the project gutenberg ebook of the rangeland avenger by max brand
