produce by imran ghory stan goodman richard prairie and pg distribute proofreader discourse : biological & geological essay by thoma h huxley 1894 preface the contents of the present volume with three exception be either popular lecture or address deliver to scientific body with which i have be officially connect i be not sure which give I the more trouble for i have not be one of those fortunate person who be able to regard a popular lecture as a mere _ hors d'oeuvre _ unworthy of be rank among the serious effort of a philosopher and who keep they fame as scientific hierophant unsullied by attempt -- at least of the successful sort -- to be understand of the people on the contrary i find that the task of put the truth learn in the field the laboratory and the museum into language which without bate a jot of scientific accuracy shall be generally intelligible tax such scientific and literary faculty as i possess to the uttermost indeed my experience have furnish I with no better corrective of the tendency to scholastic pedantry which beset all those who be absorb in pursuit remote from the common way of man and become habituate to think and speak in the technical dialect of they own little world as if there be no other if the popular lecture thus as i believe find one moiety of its justification in the self-discipline of the lecturer it surely find the other half in its effect on the auditory for though various sadly comical experience of the result of my own effort have lead I to entertain a very moderate estimate of the purely intellectual value of lecture though i venture to doubt if more than one in ten of a average audience carry away a accurate notion of what the speaker have be drive at yet be that not equally true of the oratory of the hustings of the house of common and even of the pulpit yet the child of this world be wise in they generation and both the politician and the priest be justify by result the living voice have a influence over human action altogether independent of the intellectual worth of that which it utter many year ago i be a guest at a great city dinner a famous orator endow with a voice of rare flexibility and power a bear actor range with ease through every part from refine comedy to tragic unction be call upon to reply to a toast the orator be a very busy man a charming conversationalist and by no means despise a good dinner and i imagine rise without have give a think to what he be go to say the rhythmic roll of sound be admirable the gesture perfect the earnestness impressive nothing be lack save sense and occasionally grammar when the speaker sit down the applause be terrific and one of my neighbor be especially enthusiastic so when he have quiet down i ask he what the orator have say and he could not tell I that sagacious person john wesley be report to have reply to some one who question the propriety of he adaptation of sacred word to extremely secular air that he do not see why the devil should be leave in possession of all the best tune and i do not see why science should not turn to account the peculiarity of human nature thus exploit by other agency : all the more because science by the nature of its be can not desire to stir the passion or profit by the weakness of human nature the most zealous of popular lecturer can aim at nothing more than the awakening of a sympathy for abstract truth in those who do not really follow he argument and of a desire to know more and better in the few who do at the same time it must be admit that the popularization of science whether by lecture or essay have its drawback success in this department have its peril for those who succeed the people who fail take they revenge as we have recently have occasion to observe by ignore all the rest of a man 's work and glibly label he a more popularizer if the falsehood be not too glaring they would say the same of faraday and helmholtz and kelvin on the other hand of the affliction cause by person who think that what they have pick up from popular exposition qualify they for discuss the great problem of science it may be say as the radical toast say of the power of the crown in bygone day that it have increase be increase and ought to be diminish the oddity of english as she be speak might be abundantly parallel by those of science as she be misunderstand in the sermon the novel and the lead article and a collection of the grotesque travesty of scientific conception in the shape of essay on such trifle as the nature of life and the origin of all thing which reach I from time to time might well be bind up with they the tenth essay in this volume unfortunately bring I i will not say into collision but into a position of critical remonstrance with regard to some charge of physical heterodoxy bring by my distinguished friend lord kelvin against british geology as president of the geological society of london at that time -lrb- 1869 -rrb- i think i might venture to plead that we be not such heretic as we seem to be and that even if we be recantation would not affect the question of evolution i be glad to see that lord kelvin have just reprint he reply to my plea -lrb- 1 -rrb- and i refer the reader to it i shall not presume to question anything that on such ripe consideration lord kelvin have to say upon the physical problem involve but i may remark that no one can have assert more strongly than i have do the necessity of look to physics and mathematics for help in regard to the earliest history of the globe -lrb- see pp 108 and 109 of this volume -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ popular lecture and address _ ii macmillan and co 1894 -rrb- and i take the opportunity of repeat the opinion that whether what we call geological time have the lower limit assign to it by lord kelvin or the higher assume by other philosopher whether the germ of all live thing have originate in the globe itself or whether they have be import on or in meteorite from without the problem of the origin of those successive fauna and flora of the earth the existence of which be fully demonstrate by paleontology remain exactly where it be for i think it will be admit that the germ bring to we by meteorite if any be not ovum of elephant nor of crocodile not cocoa-nut nor acorn not even egg of shell-fish and coral but only those of the lowest form of animal and vegetable life therefore since it be prove that from a very remote epoch of geological time the earth have be people by a continual succession of the higher form of animal and plant these either must have be create or they have arise by evolution and in respect of certain group of animal the well - established fact of paleontology leave no rational doubt that they arise by the latter method in the second place there be no datum whatever which justify the biologist in assign any even approximately definite period of time either long or short to the evolution of one species from another by the process of variation and selection in the ninth of the follow essay i have take pain to prove that the change of animal have go on at very different rate in different group of live being that some type have persist with little change from the paleozoic epoch till now while other have change rapidly within the limit of a epoch in 1862 -lrb- see below p 303 304 -rrb- in 1863 -lrb- vol ii p 461 -rrb- and again in 1864 -lrb- ibid p 89-91 -rrb- i argue not as a matter of speculation but from paleontological fact the bearing of which i believe up to that time have not be show that any adequate hypothesis of the cause of evolution must be consistent with progression stationariness and retrogression of the same type at different epoch of different type in the same epoch and that darwin 's hypothesis fulfil these condition accord to that hypothesis two factor be at work variation and selection next to nothing be know of the cause of the former process nothing whatever of the time require for the production of a certain amount of deviation from the exist type and as respects selection which operate by extinguish all but a small minority of variation we have not the slightest means of estimate the rapidity with which it do its work all that we be justified in say be that the rate at which it take place may vary almost indefinitely if the famous paint - root of florida which kill white pig but not black one be abundant and certain in its action black pig might be substitute for white in the course of two or three year if on the other hand it be rare and uncertain in action the white pig

sink at we foot in the midst of the city of norwich the digger would very soon find themselves at work in that white substance almost too soft to be call rock with which we be all familiar as chalk not only here but over the whole county of norfolk the well-sinker might carry he shaft down many hundred foot without come to the end of the chalk and on the sea-coast where the wave have pare away the face of the land which breast they the scarped face of the high cliff be often wholly form of the same material northward the chalk may be follow as far as yorkshire on the south coast it appear abruptly in the picturesque western bay of dorset and break into the needle of the isle of wight while on the shore of kent it supply that long line of white cliff to which england owe she name of albion be the thin soil which cover it all wash away a curved band of white chalk here broader and there narrower might be follow diagonally across england from lulworth in dorset to flamborough head in yorkshire -- a distance of over 280 mile as the crow fly from this band to the north sea on the east and the channel on the south the chalk be largely hide by other deposit but except in the weald of kent and sussex it enter into the very foundation of all the south-eastern county attain as it do in some place a thickness of more than a thousand foot the english chalk must be admit to be a mass of considerable magnitude nevertheless it cover but a insignificant portion of the whole area occupy by the chalk formation of the globe much of which have the same general character as ours and be find in detach patch some less and other more extensive than the english chalk occur in north-west ireland it stretch over a large part of france -- the chalk which underlie pari be in fact a continuation of that of the london basin it run through denmark and central europe and extend southward to north africa while eastward it appear in the crimea and in syrium and may be trace as far as the shore of the sea of aral in central asia if all the point at which true chalk occur be circumscribe they would lie within a irregular oval about 3000 mile in long diameter -- the area of which would be as great as that of europe and would many time exceed that of the largest exist inland sea -- the mediterranean thus the chalk be no unimportant element in the masonry of the earth 's crust and it impress a peculiar stamp vary with the condition to which it be expose on the scenery of the district in which it occur the undulating downs and round coomb cover with sweet-grassed turf of we inland chalk country have a peacefully domestic and mutton - suggest prettiness but can hardly be call either grand or beautiful but on we southern coast the wall-sided cliff many hundred foot high with vast needle and pinnacle stand out in the sea sharp and solitary enough to serve as perch for the wary cormorant confer a wonderful beauty and grandeur upon the chalk headland and in the east chalk have its share in the formation of some of the most venerable of mountain range such as the lebanon what be this wide-spread component of the surface of the earth and whence do it come you may think this no very hopeful inquiry you may not unnaturally suppose that the attempt to solve such problem as these can lead to no result save that of entangle the inquirer in vague speculation incapable of refutation and of verification if such be really the case i should have select some other subject than a piece of chalk for my discourse but in truth after much deliberation i have be unable to think of any topic which would so well enable I to lead you to see how solid be the foundation upon which some of the most startling conclusion of physical science rest a great chapter of the history of the world be write in the chalk few passage in the history of man can be support by such a overwhelming mass of direct and indirect evidence as that which testify to the truth of the fragment of the history of the globe which i hope to enable you to read with you own eye to-night let I add that few chapter of human history have a more profound significance for ourselves i weigh my word well when i assert that the man who should know the true history of the bit of chalk which every carpenter carry about in he breeches - pocket though ignorant of all other history be likely if he will think he knowledge out to its ultimate result to have a truer and therefore a better conception of this wonderful universe and of man 's relation to it than the most learn student who be deep-read in the record of humanity and ignorant of those of nature the language of the chalk be not hard to learn not nearly so hard as latin if you only want to get at the broad feature of the story it have to tell and i propose that we now set to work to spell that story out together we all know that if we burn chalk the result be quicklime chalk in fact be a compound of carbonic acid gas and lime and when you make it very hot the carbonic acid fly away and the lime be leave by this method of procedure we see the lime but we do not see the carbonic acid if on the other hand you be to powder a little chalk and drop it into a good deal of strong vinegar there would be a great bubbling and fizzing and finally a clear liquid in which no sign of chalk would appear here you see the carbonic acid in the bubble the lime dissolve in the vinegar vanish from sight there be a great many other way of show that chalk be essentially nothing but carbonic acid and quicklime chemist enunciate the result of all the experiment which prove this by state that chalk be almost wholly compose of carbonate of lime it be desirable for we to start from the knowledge of this fact though it may not seem to help we very far towards what we seek for carbonate of lime be a widely-spread substance and be meet with under very various condition all sort of limestone be compose of more or less pure carbonate of lime the crust which be often deposit by water which have drain through limestone rock in the form of what be call stalagmite and stalactite be carbonate of lime or to take a more familiar example the fur on the inside of a tea-kettle be carbonate of lime and for anything chemistry tell we to the contrary the chalk might be a kind of gigantic fur upon the bottom of the earth-kettle which be keep pretty hot below let we try another method of make the chalk tell we its own history to the unassisted eye chalk look simply like a very loose and open kind of stone but it be possible to grind a slice of chalk down so thin that you can see through it -- until it be thin enough in fact to be examine with any magnifying power that may be think desirable a thin slice of the fur of a kettle might be make in the same way if it be examine microscopically it would show itself to be a more or less distinctly laminated mineral substance and nothing more but the slice of chalk present a totally different appearance when place under the microscope the general mass of it be make up of very minute granule but imbed in this matrix be innumerable body some smaller and some larger but on a rough average not more than a hundredth of a inch in diameter have a well-defined shape and structure a cubic inch of some specimen of chalk may contain hundred of thousand of these body compacted together with incalculable million of the granule the examination of a transparent slice give a good notion of the manner in which the component of the chalk be arrange and of they relative proportion but by rub up some chalk with a brush in water and then pour off the milky fluid so as to obtain sediment of different degree of fineness the granule and the minute round body may be pretty well separate from one another and submit to microscopic examination either as opaque or as transparent object by combine the view obtain in these various method each of the rounded body may be prove to be a beautifully-constructed calcareous fabric make up of a number of chamber communicate freely with one another the chambered body be of various form one of the commonest be something like a badly-grown raspberry be form of a number of nearly globular chamber of different size congregate together it be call _ globigerina _ and some specimen of chalk consist of little else than _ globigerinoe _ and granule let we fix we attention upon the _ globigerina _ it be the spoor of the game we be track if we can learn what it be and what be the condition of its existence we shall see we way to the origin and past history of the chalk a suggestion which may naturally enough present itself be that these curious body be the result of some process of aggregation which have take place in the carbonate of lime that just as in winter the rime on we window simulate the most delicate and elegantly arborescent foliage -- prove that the mere mineral water may under certain condition assume the outward form of organic body -- so this mineral substance carbonate of lime hide away in the bowels of the earth have take the shape of these chambered body i be not raise a merely fanciful and unreal objection very learn man in former day have even entertain the notion that all the form thing find in rock be of this nature and if no such conception be at present hold to be admissible it be because long and vary experience have now show that mineral matter never do assume the form and structure we find in fossil if any one be to try to persuade you that a oyster-shell -lrb- which be also chiefly compose of carbonate of lime -rrb- have crystallize out of sea-water i suppose you would laugh at the absurdity you laughter would be justify by the fact that all experience tend to show that oyster-shell be form by the agency of oyster and in no other way and if there be no better reason we should be justify on like grounds in believe that _ globigerina _ be not the product of anything but vital activity happily however better evidence in proof of the organic nature of the _ globigerinoe _ than that of analogy be forthcoming it so happen that calcareous skeleton exactly similar to the _ globigerinoe _ of the chalk be be form at the present moment by minute living creature which flourish in multitude literally more numerous than the sand of the sea-shore over a large extent of that part of the earth 's surface which be cover by the ocean the history of the discovery of these live _ globigerinoe _ and of the part which they play in rock building be singular enough it be a discovery which like other of no less scientific importance have arise incidentally out of work devote to very different and exceedingly practical interest when man first take to the sea they speedily learn to look out for shoal and rock and the more the burthen of they ship increase the more imperatively necessary it become for sailor to ascertain with precision the depth of the water they traverse out of this necessity grow the use of the lead and sound line and ultimately marine-surveying which be the recording of the form of coast and of the depth of the sea as ascertain by the sounding-lead upon chart at the same time it become desirable to ascertain and to indicate the nature of the sea-bottom since this circumstance greatly affect its goodness as hold ground for anchor some ingenious tar whose name deserve a better fate than the oblivion into which it have fall attain this object by arm the bottom of the lead with a lump of grease to which more or less of the sand or mud or broken shell as the case might be adhered and be bring to the surface but however well adapt such a apparatus might be for rough nautical purpose scientific accuracy could not be expect from the armed lead and to remedy its defect -lrb- especially when apply to sound in great depths -rrb- lieut brooke of the american navy some year ago invent a most ingenious machine by which a considerable portion of the superficial layer of the sea-bottom can be scoop out and bring up from any depth to which the lead descend in 1853 lieut brooke obtain mud from the bottom of the north atlantic between newfoundland and the azore at a depth of more than 10000 foot or two mile by the help of this sound apparatus the specimen be send for examination to ehrenberg of berlin and to bailey of west point and those able microscopist find that this deep-sea mud be almost entirely compose of the skeleton of live organism -- the greater proportion of these be just like the _ globigerinoe _ already know to occur in the chalk thus far the work have be carry on simply in the interest of science but lieut brooke 's method of sound acquire a high commercial value when the enterprise of lay down the telegraph-cable between this country and the united state be undertake for it become a matter of immense importance to know not only the depth of the sea over the whole line along which the cable be to be lay but the exact nature of the bottom so as to guard against chance of cut or fray the strand of that costly rope the admiralty consequently order captain dayman a old friend and shipmate of mine to ascertain the depth over the whole line of the cable and to bring back specimen of the bottom in former day such a command as this might have sound very much like one of the impossible thing which the young prince in the fairy tale be order to do before he can obtain the hand of the princess however in the month of June and July 1857 my friend perform the task assign to he with great expedition and precision without so far as i know have meet with any reward of that kind the specimen or atlantic mud which he procure be send to I to be examine and report upon -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : see appendix to captain dayman 's _ deep-sea sounding in the north atlantic ocean between ireland and newfoundland make in hm cyclops _ publish by order of the lord commissioner of the admiralty 1858 they have since form the subject of a elaborate memoir by messr parker and jone publish in the _ philosophical transaction _ for 1865 -rrb- the result of all these operation be that we know the contour and the nature of the surface-soil cover by the north atlantic for a distance of 1700 mile from east to west as well as we know that of any part of the dry land it be a prodigious plain -- one of the widest and most even plain in the world if the sea be drain off you might drive a waggon all the way from valentium on the west coast of ireland to trinity bay in newfoundland and except upon one sharp incline about 200 mile from valentia i be not quite sure that it would even be necessary to put the skid on so gentle be the ascent and descent upon that long route from valentia the road would lie down-hill for about 200 mile to the point at which the bottom be now cover by 1700 fathom of sea-water then would come the central plain more than a thousand mile wide the inequality of the surface of which would be hardly perceptible though the depth of water upon it now vary from 10000 to 15000 foot and there be place in which mont blanc might be sink without show its peak above water beyond this the ascent on the american side commence and gradually lead for about 300 mile to the newfoundland shore almost the whole of the bottom of this central plain -lrb- which extend for many hundred mile in a north and south direction -rrb- be cover by a fine mud which when bring to the surface dry into a greyish white friable substance you can write with this on a blackboard if you be so inclined and to the eye it be quite like very soft grayish chalk examine chemically it prove to be compose almost wholly of carbonate of lime and if you make a section of it in the same way as that of the piece of chalk be make and view it with the microscope it present innumerable _ globigerinoe _ embed in a granular matrix thus this deep - sea mud be substantially chalk i say substantially because there be a good many minor difference but as these have no bearing on the question immediately before we -- which be the nature of the _ globigerinoe _ of the chalk -- it be unnecessary to speak of they _ globigerinoe _ of every size from the smallest to the largest be associate together in the atlantic mud and the chamber of many be fill by a soft animal matter this soft substance be in fact the remains of the creature to which the _ globigerinoe _ shell or rather skeleton owe its existence -- and which be a animal of the simplest imaginable description it be in fact a mere particle of live jelly without define part of any kind -- without a mouth nerve muscle or distinct organ and only manifest its vitality to ordinary observation by thrust out and retract from all part of its surface long filamentous process which serve for arm and leg yet this amorphous particle devoid of everything which in the higher animal we call organ be capable of feed grow and multiply of separate from the ocean the small proportion of carbonate of lime which be dissolve in sea-water and of build up that substance into a skeleton for itself accord to a pattern which can be imitate by no other known agency the notion that animal can live and flourish in the sea at the vast depths from which apparently live _ globigerinoe _ have be bring up do not agree very well with we usual conception respect the condition of animal life and it be not so absolutely impossible as it might at first sight appear to be that the _ globigcrinoe _ of the atlantic sea-bottom do not live and die where they be find as i have mention the sounding from the great atlantic plain be almost entirely make up of _ globigerinoe _ with the granule which have be mention and some few other calcareous shell but a small percentage of the chalky mud -- perhaps at most some five per cent of it -- be of a different nature and consist of shell and skeleton compose of silex or pure flint these silicious body belong partly to the lowly vegetable organism which be call _ diatomaceoe _ and partly to the minute and extremely simple animal term _ radiolaria _ it be quite certain that these creature do not live at the bottom of the ocean but at its surface -- where they may be obtain in prodigious number by the use of a properly construct net hence it follow that these silicious organism though they be not heavier than the lightest dust must have fall in some case through fifteen thousand foot of water before they reach they final resting-place on the ocean floor and consider how large a surface these body expose in proportion to they weight it be probable that they occupy a great length of time in make they burial journey from the surface of the atlantic to the bottom but if the _ radiolarium _ and diatom be thus rain upon the bottom of the sea from the superficial layer of its water in which they pass they life it be obviously possible that the _ globigerinoe _ may be similarly derive and if they be so it would be much more easy to understand how they obtain they supply of food than it be at present nevertheless the positive and negative evidence all point the other way the skeleton of the full-grown deep-sea _ globigerinoe _ be so remarkably solid and heavy in proportion to they surface as to seem little fitted for float and as a matter of fact they be not to be find along with the diatom and _ radiolarium _ in the uppermost stratum of the open ocean it have be observe again that the abundance of _ globigerinoe _ in proportion to other organism of like kind increase with the depth of the sea and that deep-water _ globigerinoe _ be larger than those which live in shallower part of the sea and such fact negative the supposition that these organism have be sweep by current from the shallows into the deep of the atlantic it therefore seem to be hardly doubtful that these wonderful creature live and die at the depths in which they be find -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : during the cruise of hm _ bulldog _ command by sir leopold m ` clintock in 1860 living star-fish be bring up cling to the lowest part of the sounding-line from a depth of 1260 fathom midway between cape farewell in greenland and the rockall bank dr wallich ascertain that the sea-bottom at this point consist of the ordinary _ globigerina _ ooze and that the stomach of the star-fish be full of _ globigerinoe _ this discovery remove all objection to the existence of live _ globigerinoe _ at great depths which be base upon the suppose difficulty of maintain animal life under such condition and it throw the burden of proof upon those who object to the supposition that the _ globigerinoe _ live and die where they be find -rrb- however the important point for we be that the living _ globigerinoe _ be exclusively marine animal the skeleton of which abound at the bottom of deep sea and that there be not a shadow of reason for believe that the habit of the _ globigerinoe _ of the chalk differ from those of the exist species but if this be true there be no escape the conclusion that the chalk itself be the dry mud of a ancient deep sea in work over the sounding collect by captain dayman i be surprise to find that many of what i have call the granule of that mud be not as one might have be tempt to think at first the more powder and waste of _ globigerinoe _ but that they have a definite form and size i term these body _ coccolith _ and doubt they organic nature dr wallich verify my observation and add the interesting discovery that not unfrequently body similar to these coccolith be aggregate together into spheroid which lie term _ coccosphere _ so far as we know these body the nature of which be extremely puzzling and problematical be peculiar to the atlantic sounding but a few year ago mr sorby in make a careful examination of the chalk by means of thin section and otherwise observe as ehrenberg have do before he that much of its granular basis possess a definite form compare these form particle with those in the atlantic sounding he find the two to be identical and thus prove that the chalk like the surroundings contain these mysterious coccolith and coccosphere here be a further and most interesting confirmation from internal evidence of the essential identity of the chalk with modern deep-sea mud _ globigerinoe _ coccolith and coccosphere be find as the chief constituent of both and testify to the general similarity of the condition under which both have be form -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : i have recently trace out the development of the coccolith from a diameter of 1\/7000th of a inch up to they largest size -lrb- which be about 1\/1000th -rrb- and no longer doubt that they be produce by independent organism which like the _ globigerinoe _ live and die at the bottom of the sea -rrb- the evidence furnish by the hew face and superposition of the stone of the pyramid that these structure be build by man have no greater weight than the evidence that the chalk be build by _ globigerinoe _ and the belief that those ancient pyramid-builder be terrestrial and air-breathing creature like ourselves be not better base than the conviction that the chalk-maker live in the sea but as we belief in the building of the pyramid by man be not only ground on the internal evidence afford by these structure but gather strength from multitudinous collateral proof and be clinch by the total absence of any reason for a contrary belief so the evidence draw from the _ globigerinoe _ that the chalk be a ancient sea-bottom be fortify by innumerable independent line of evidence and we belief in the truth of the conclusion to which all positive testimony tend receive the like negative justification from the fact that no other hypothesis have a shadow of foundation it may be worth while briefly to consider a few of these collateral proof that the chalk be deposit at the bottom of the sea the great mass of the chalk be compose as we have see of the skeleton of _ globigerinoe _ and other simple organism imbed in granular matter here and there however this hardened mud of the ancient sea reveal the remains of higher animal which have live and die and leave they hard part in the mud just as the oyster die and leave they shell behind they in the mud of the present sea there be at the present day certain group of animal which be never find in fresh water be unable to live anywhere but in the sea such be the coral those coralline which be call _ polyzoon _ those creature which fabricate the lamp-shell and be call _ brachiopoda _ the pearly _ nautilus _ and all animal ally to it and all the form of sea-urchin and star-fish not only be all these creature confine to salt water at the present day but so far as we record of the past go the condition of they existence have be the same : hence they occurrence in any deposit be as strong evidence as can be obtain that that deposit be form in the sea now the remains of animal of all the kind which have be enumerate occur in the chalk in greater or less abundance while not one of those form of shell-fish which be characteristic of fresh water have yet be observe in it when we consider that the remains of more than three thousand distinct species of aquatic animal have be discover among the fossil of the chalk that the great majority of they be of such form as be now meet with only in the sea and that there be no reason to believe that any one of they inhabit fresh water -- the collateral evidence that the chalk represent a ancient sea-bottom acquire as great force as the proof derive from the nature of the chalk itself i think you will now allow that i do not overstate my case when i assert that we have as strong grounds for believe that all the vast area of dry land at present occupy by the chalk be once at the bottom of the sea as we have for any matter of history whatever while there be no justification for any other belief no less certain it be that the time during which the country we now call south-east england france germany poland russium egypt arabium syrium be more or less completely cover by a deep sea be of considerable duration we have already see that the chalk be in place more than a thousand foot thick i think you will agree with I that it must have take some time for the skeleton of animalcule of a hundredth of a inch in diameter to heap up such a mass as that i have say that throughout the thickness of the chalk the remains of other animal be scatter these remains be often in the most exquisite state of preservation the valve of the shell-fish be commonly adherent the long spine of some of the sea-urchin which would be detach by the smallest jar often remain in they place in a word it be certain that these animal have live and die when the place which they now occupy be the surface of as much of the chalk as have then be deposit and that each have be cover up by the layer of _ globigerina _ mud upon which the creature imbed a little higher up have in like manner live and die but some of these remains prove the existence of reptile of vast size in the chalk sea these live they time and have they ancestor and descendant which assuredly imply time reptile be of slow growth there be more curious evidence again that the process of cover up or in other word the deposit of _ globigerina _ skeleton do not go on very fast it be demonstrable that a animal of the cretaceous sea might die that its skeleton might lie uncovered upon the sea-bottom long enough to lose all its outward covering and appendage by putrefaction and that after this have happen another animal might attach itself to the dead and naked skeleton might grow to maturity and might itself die before the calcareous mud have bury the whole case of this kind be admirably describe by sir charle lyell he speak of the frequency with which geologist find in the chalk a fossilize sea-urchin to which be attach the lower valve of a _ cranium _ this be a kind of shell-fish with a shell compose of two piece of which as in the oyster one be fix and the other free the upper valve be almost invariably want though occasionally find in a perfect state of preservation in the white chalk at some distance in this case we see clearly that the sea-urchin first live from youth to age then die and lose its spine which be carry away then the young _ cranium _ adhere to the bared shell grow and perish in its turn after which the upper valve be separate from the lower before the echinus become envelop in chalky mud -lrb- 4 -rrb- a specimen in the museum of practical geology in london still further prolong the period which must have elapse between the death of the sea - urchin and its burial by the _ globigerinoe _ for the outward face of the valve of a _ cranium _ which be attach to a sea-urchin -lrb- _ micraster _ -rrb- be itself overrun by a incrusting coralline which spread thence over more or less of the surface of the sea-urchin it follow that after the upper valve of the _ cranium _ fall off the surface of the attach valve must have remain exposed long enough to allow of the growth of the whole coralline since coralline do not live embedded in mud -lrb- 4 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : _ element of geology _ by sir charle lyell bart fb p 23 -rrb- the progress of knowledge may one day enable we to deduce from such fact as these the maximum rate at which the chalk can have accumulate and thus to arrive at the minimum duration of the chalk period suppose that the valve of the _ cronium _ upon which a coralline have fix itself in the way just describe be so attach to the sea-urchin that no part of it be more than a inch above the face upon which the sea-urchin rest then as the coralline could not have fix itself if the _ cranium _ have be cover up with chalk mud and could not have live have itself be so cover it follow that a inch of chalk mud could not have accumulate within the time between the death and decay of the soft part of the sea-urchin and the growth of the coralline to the full size which it have attain if the decay of the soft part of the sea-urchin the attachment growth to maturity and decay of the _ cranium _ and the subsequent attachment and growth of the coralline take a year -lrb- which be a low estimate enough -rrb- the accumulation of the inch of chalk must have take more than a year : and the deposit of a thousand foot of chalk must consequently have take more than twelve thousand year the foundation of all this calculation be of course a knowledge of the length of time the _ cranium _ and the coralline need to attain they full size and on this head precise knowledge be at present want but there be circumstance which tend to show that nothing like a inch of chalk have accumulate during the life of a _ cranium _ and on any probable estimate of the length of that life the chalk period must have have a much longer duration than that thus roughly assign to it thus not only be it certain that the chalk be the mud of a ancient sea - bottom but it be no less certain that the chalk sea exist during a extremely long period though we may not be prepare to give a precise estimate of the length of that period in year the relative duration be clear though the absolute duration may not be definable the attempt to affix any precise date to the period at which the chalk sea begin or end its existence be baffle by difficulty of the same kind but the relative age of the cretaceous epoch may be determine with as great ease and certainty as the long duration of that epoch you will have hear of the interesting discovery recently make in various part of western europe of flint implement obviously work into shape by human hand under circumstance which show conclusively that man be a very ancient denizen of these region it have be prove that the whole population of europe whose existence have be reveal to we in this way consist of savage such as the esquimaux be now that in the country which be now france they hunt the reindeer and be familiar with the way of the mammoth and the bison the physical geography of france be in those day different from what it be now -- the river somme for instance have cut its bed a hundred foot deeper between that time and this and it be probable that the climate be more like that of canada or siberium than that of western europe the existence of these people be forget even in the tradition of the oldest historical nation the name and fame of they have utterly vanish until a few year back and the amount of physical change which have be effect since they day render it more than probable that venerable as be some of the historical nation the worker of the chip flint of hoxne or of amien be to they as they be to we in point of antiquity but if we assign to these hoar relic of long-vanished generation of man the greatest age that can possibly be claim for they they be not older than the drift or boulder clay which in comparison with the chalk be but a very juvenile deposit you need go no further than you own sea-board for evidence of this fact at one of the most charming spot on the coast of norfolk cromer you will see the boulder clay form a vast mass which lie upon the chalk and must consequently have come into existence after it huge boulder of chalk be in fact include in the clay and have evidently be bring to the position they now occupy by the same agency as that which have plant block of syenite from norway side by side with they the chalk then be certainly older than the boulder clay if you ask how much i will again take you no further than the same spot upon you own coast for evidence i have speak of the boulder clay and drift as rest upon the chalk that be not strictly true interpose between the chalk and the drift be a comparatively insignificant layer contain vegetable matter but that layer tell a wonderful history it be full of stump of tree stand as they grow fir-tree be there with they cone and hazel-bush with they nut there stand the stool of oak and yew tree beech and alder hence this stratum be appropriately call the forest-bed it be obvious that the chalk must have be upheave and convert into dry land before the timber tree could grow upon it as the boll of some of these tree be from two to three foot in diameter it be no less clear that the dry land thus form remain in the same condition for long age and not only do the remains of stately oak and well-grown fir testify to the duration of this condition of thing but additional evidence to the same effect be afford by the abundant remains of elephant rhinoceros hippopotamus and other great wild beast which it have yield to the zealous search of such man as the rev mr gunn when you look at such a collection as he have form and bethink you that these elephantine bone do veritably carry they owner about and these great grinder crunch in the dark wood of which the forest - bed be now the only trace it be impossible not to feel that they be as good evidence of the lapse of time as the annual ring of the tree stump thus there be a write upon the wall of cliff at cromer and whoso run may read it it tell we with a authority which can not be impeach that the ancient sea-bed of the chalk sea be raise up and remain dry land until it be cover with forest stock with the great game the spoil of which have rejoice you geologist how long it remain in that condition can not be say but the whirligig of time bring its revenge in those day as in these that dry land with the bone and tooth of generation of long-lived elephant hide away among the gnarled root and dry leaf of its ancient tree sink gradually to the bottom of the icy sea which cover it with huge mass of drift and boulder clay sea-beast such as the walrus now restricted to the extreme north paddle about where bird have twitter among the topmost twig of the fir-tree how long this state of thing endure we know not but at length it come to a end the upheaved glacial mud harden into the soil of modern norfolk forest grow once more the wolf and the beaver replace the reindeer and the elephant and at length what we call the history of england dawn thus you have within the limit of you own county proof that the chalk can justly claim a very much greater antiquity than even the oldest physical trace of mankind but we may go further and demonstrate by evidence of the same authority as that which testify to the existence of the father of man that the chalk be vastly older than adam himself the book of genesis inform we that adam immediately upon he creation and before the appearance of eve be place in the garden of eden the problem of the geographical position of eden have greatly vex the spirit of the learn in such matter but there be one point respect which so far as i know no commentator have ever raise a doubt this be that of the four river which be say to run out of it euphrate and hiddekel be identical with the river now know by the name of euphrate and tigri but the whole country in which these mighty river take they origin and through which they run be compose of rock which be either of the same age as the chalk or of later date so that the chalk must not only have be form but after its formation the time require for the deposit of these later rock and for they upheaval into dry land must have elapse before the smallest brook which feed the swift stream of the great river the river of babylon begin to flow thus evidence which can not be rebut and which need not be strengthen though if time permit i might indefinitely increase its quantity compel you to believe that the earth from the time of the chalk to the present day have be the theater of a series of change as vast in they amount as they be slow in they progress the area on which we stand have be first sea and then land for at least four alternation and have remain in each of these condition for a period of great length nor have these wonderful metamorphosis of sea into land and of land into sea be confine to one corner of england during the chalk period or cretaceous epoch not one of the present great physical feature of the globe be in existence we great mountain range pyrenee alp himalaya ande have all be upheave since the chalk be deposit and the cretaceous sea flow over the site of sinaus and ararat all this be certain because rock of cretaceous or still later date have share in the elevatory movement which give rise to these mountain chain and may be find perch up in some case many thousand foot high upon they flank and evidence of equal cogency demonstrate that though in norfolk the forest-bed rest directly upon the chalk yet it do so not because the period at which the forest grow immediately follow that at which the chalk be form but because a immense lapse of time represent elsewhere by thousand of foot of rock be not indicate at cromer i must ask you to believe that there be no less conclusive proof that a still more prolonged succession of similar change occur before the chalk be deposit nor have we any reason to think that the first term in the series of these change be know the oldest sea-bed preserve to we be sand and mud and pebble the wear and tear of rock which be form in still older ocean but great as be the magnitude of these physical change of the world they have be accompany by a no less striking series of modification in its living inhabitant all the great class of animal beast of the field fowl of the air creep thing and thing which dwell in the water flourish upon the globe long age before the chalk be deposit very few however if any of these ancient form of animal life be identical with those which now live certainly not one of the higher animal be of the same species as any of those now in existence the beast of the field in the day before the chalk be not we beast of the field nor the fowl of the air such as those which the eye of man have see fly unless he antiquity date infinitely further back than we at present surmise if we could be carry back into those time we should be as one suddenly set down in australium before it be colonize we should see mammal bird reptile fish insect snail and the like clearly recognizable as such and yet not one of they would be just the same as those with which we be familiar and many would be extremely different from that time to the present the population of the world have undergo slow and gradual but incessant change there have be no grand catastrophe -- no destroyer have sweep away the form of life of one period and replace they by a totally new creation : but one species have vanish and another have take its place creature of one type of structure have diminish those of another have increase as time have pass on and thus while the difference between the living creature of the time before the chalk and those of the present day appear startling if place side by side we be lead from one to the other by the most gradual progress if we follow the course of nature through the whole series of those relic of she operation which she have leave behind it be by the population of the chalk sea that the ancient and the modern inhabitant of the world be most completely connect the group which be die out flourish side by side with the group which be now the dominant form of life thus the chalk contain remains of those strange fly and swim reptile the pterodactyl the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus which be find in no later deposit but abound in precede age the chambered shell call ammonite and belemnite which be so characteristic of the period precede the cretaceous in like manner die with it but amongst these fading remainder of a previous state of thing be some very modern form of life look like yankee pedlar among a tribe of red indian crocodile of modern type appear bony fish many of they very similar to exist species almost supplant the form of fish which predominate in more ancient sea and many kind of live shell - fish first become know to we in the chalk the vegetation acquire a modern aspect a few living animal be not even distinguishable as species from those which exist at that remote epoch the _ globigerina _ of the present day for example be not different specifically from that of the chalk and the same maybe say of many other _ foraminifera _ i think it probable that critical and unprejudiced examination will show that more than one species of much higher animal have have a similar longevity but the only example which i can at present give confidently be the snake 's - head lampshell -lrb- _ terebratulina caput serpenti _ -rrb- which live in we english sea and abound -lrb- as _ terebratulina stria _ of author -rrb- in the chalk the longest line of human ancestry must hide its diminished head before the pedigree of this insignificant shell-fish we englishman be proud to have a ancestor who be present at the battle of hasting the ancestor of _ terebratulina caput serpenti _ may have be present at a battle of _ ichthyosaurium _ in that part of the sea which when the chalk be form flow over the site of hasting while all around have change this _ terebratulina _ have peacefully propagate its species from generation to generation and stand to this day as a living testimony to the continuity of the present with the past history of the globe up to this moment i have state so far as i know nothing but well - authenticated fact and the immediate conclusion which they force upon the mind but the mind be so constitute that it do not willingly rest in fact and immediate cause but seek always after a knowledge of the remoter link in the chain of causation take the many change of any give spot of the earth 's surface from sea to land and from land to sea as a established fact we can not refrain from ask ourselves how these change have occur and when we have explain they -- as they must be explain -- by the alternate slow movement of elevation and depression which have affect the crust of the earth we go still further back and ask why these movement i be not certain that any one can give you a satisfactory answer to that question assuredly i can not all that can be say for certain be that such movement be part of the ordinary course of nature inasmuch as they be go on at the present time direct proof may be give that some part of the land of the northern hemisphere be at this moment insensibly rise and other insensibly sink and there be indirect but perfectly satisfactory proof that a enormous area now cover by the pacific have be deepen thousand of foot since the present inhabitant of that sea come into existence thus there be not a shadow of a reason for believe that the physical change of the globe in past time have be effect by other than natural cause be there any more reason for believe that the concomitant modification in the form of the living inhabitant of the globe have be bring about in other way before attempt to answer this question let we try to form a distinct mental picture of what have happen in some special case the crocodile be animal which as a group have a very vast antiquity they abound age before the chalk be deposit they throng the river in warm climate at the present day there be a difference in the form of the joint of the back-bone and in some minor particulars between the crocodile of the present epoch and those which live before the chalk but in the cretaceous epoch as i have already mention the crocodile have assume the modern type of structure notwithstanding this the crocodile of the chalk be not identically the same as those which live in the time call older tertiary which succeed the cretaceous epoch and the crocodile of the older tertiary be not identical with those of the newer tertiary nor be these identical with exist form i leave open the question whether particular species may have live on from epoch to epoch but each epoch have have its peculiar crocodile though all since the chalk have belong to the modern type and differ simply in they proportion and in such structural particulars as be discernible only to train eye how be the existence of this long succession of different species of crocodile to be account for only two supposition seem to be open to we -- either each species of crocodile have be specially create or it have arise out of some pre-existing form by the operation of natural cause choose you hypothesis i have choose mine i can find no warranty for believe in the distinct creation of a score of successive species of crocodile in the course of countless age of time science give no countenance to such a wild fancy nor can even the perverse ingenuity of a commentator pretend to discover this sense in the simple word in which the writer of genesis record the proceedings of the fifth and six day of the creation on the other hand i see no good reason for doubt the necessary alternative that all these varied species have be evolve from pre - exist crocodilian form by the operation of cause as completely a part of the common order of nature as those which have effect the change of the inorganic world few will venture to affirm that the reasoning which apply to crocodile lose its force among other animal or among plant if one series of species have come into existence by the operation of natural cause it seem folly to deny that all may have arise in the same way a small beginning have lead we to a great end if i be to put the bit of chalk with which we start into the hot but obscure flame of burn hydrogen it would presently shine like the sun it seem to I that this physical metamorphosis be no false image of what have be the result of we subject it to a jet of fervent though nowise brilliant thought to-night it have become luminous and its clear ray penetrate the abyss of the remote past have bring within we ken some stage of the evolution of the earth and in the shift without haste but without rest of the land and sea as in the endless variation of the form assume by live being we have observe nothing but the natural product of the force originally possess by the substance of the universe ii the problem of

in partibus _ -rrb- whose business it be to turn all the wonderfully packed store of appliance to account and to accumulate before the ship return to england such addition to natural knowledge as shall justify the labor and cost involve in the fitting out and maintenance of the expedition under the able and zealous superintendence of the hydrographer admiral richard every precaution which experience and forethought could devise have be take to provide the expedition with the material condition of success and it would seem as if nothing short of wreck or pestilence both most improbable contingency could prevent the _ challenger _ from do splendid work and open up a new era in the history of scientific voyage the dispatch of this expedition be the culmination of a series of such enterprise gradually increase in magnitude and importance which the admiralty greatly to its credit have carry out for some year past and the history of which be give by dr wyville thomson in the beautifully illustrated volume entitle the depths of the sea publish since he departure in the spring of the year 1868 my friend dr wb carpenter at that time one of the vice-president of the royal society be with I in ireland where we be work out together the structure and development of the crinoid i have long previously have a profound conviction that the land of promise for the naturalist the only remain region where there be endless novelty of extraordinary interest ready to the hand which have the means of gather they be the bottom of the deep sea i have even have a glimpse of some of these treasure for i have see the year before with prof sar the form which i have already mention dredge by he son at a depth of 300 to 400 fathom off the loffoten island i propounded my view to my fellow-labourer and we discuss the subject many time over we microscope i strongly urge dr carpenter to use he influence at head-quarter to induce the admiralty probably through the council of the royal society to give we the use of a vessel properly fit with dredging gear and all necessary scientific apparatus that many heavy question as to the state of thing in the depths of the ocean which be still in a state of uncertainty might be definitely settle after full consideration dr carpenter promise he hearty co - operation and we agree that i should write to he on he return to london indicate generally the result which i anticipate and sketch out what i conceive to be a promising line of inquiry the council of the royal society warmly support the proposal and i give here in chronological order the short and eminently satisfactory correspondence which lead to the admiralty place at the disposal of dr carpenter and myself the gunboat _ lightninq _ under the command of staff - commander may rn in the summer of 1868 for a trial cruise to the north of scotland and afterwards to the much wider survey in hm _ porcupine _ captain calver rn which be make with the

wyville thomson not be a cynic should relegate the land of promise to the bottom of the deep sea they may still more wonder what manner of milk and honey the _ challenger _ expect to find and they perplexity may well rise to its maximum when they seek to divine the manner in which that milk and honey be to be get out of so inaccessible a canaan i will therefore endeavor to give some answer to these question in a order the reverse of that in which i have state they apart from hook and line and ordinary net fisherman have from time immemorial make use of two kind of implement for get at sea - creature which live beyond tide-mark -- these be the dredge and the trawl the dredge be use by oyster-fishermen imagine a large bag the mouth of which have the shape of a elongate parallelogram and be fasten to a iron frame of the same shape the two long side of this rim be fashion into scraper chain attach the end of the frame to a stout rope so that when the bag be drag along by the rope the edge of one of the scraper rest on the ground and scrape whatever it touch into the bag the oyster-dredger take one of these machine in he boat and when he have reach the oyster-bed the dredge be toss overboard as soon as it have sink to the bottom the rope be pay out sufficiently to prevent it from pull the dredge directly upward and be then make fast while the boat go ahead the dredge be thus drag along and scrape oyster and other sea-animal and plant stone and mud into the bag when the dredger judge it to be full he haul it up pick out the oyster throw the rest overboard and begin again dredge in shallow water say ten to twenty fathom be a easy operation enough but the deeper the dredger go the heavier must be he vessel and the stouter he tackle while the operation of haul up become more and more laborious dredging in 150 fathom be very hard work if it have to be carry on by manual labor but by the use of the donkey-engine to supply power -lrb- 2 -rrb- and of the contrivance know as accumulator to diminish the risk of snap the dredge rope by the rolling and pitching of the vessel the dredge have be work deeper and deeper until at last on the 22nd of July 1869 hm _ porcupine _ be in the bay of biscay captain calver she commander perform the unprecedented feat of dredging in 2435 fathom or 14610 foot a depth nearly equal to the height of mont blanc the dredge be rapidly haul on deck at one o'clock in the morning of the 23rd after a absence of 7-1\/4 hour and a journey of upward of eight statute mile with a hundred weight and a half of solid contents -lrb- footnote 2 : the emotional side of the scientific nature have its singularity many person will call to mind a certain philosopher 's tenderness over he watch -- the little creature -- which be so singularly lose and find again but dr wyville thomson surpass the owner of the watch in he loving-kindness towards a donkey-engine this little engine be the comfort of we life once or twice it be overstrain and then we pity the willing little thing pant like a overtax horse -rrb- the trawl be a sort of net for catch those fish which habitually live at the bottom of the sea such as sole plaice turbot and gurnett the mouth of the net may be thirty or forty foot wide and one edge of its mouth be fasten to a beam of wood of the same length the two end of the beam be support by curved piece of iron which raise the beam and the edge of the net which be fasten to it for a short distance while the other edge of the mouth of the net trail upon the ground the closed end of the net have the form of a great pouch and as the beam be drag along the fish rouse from the bottom by the sweeping of the net readily pass into its mouth and accumulate in the pouch at its end after drift with the tide for six or seven hour the trawl be haul up the marketable fish be pick out the other throw away and the trawl send overboard for another operation more than a thousand sail of well-found trawler be constantly engage in sweep the sea around we coast in this way and it be to they that we owe a very large proportion of we supply of fish the difficulty of trawl like that of dredge rapidly increase with the depth at which the operation be perform and until the other day it be probable that trawl at so great a depth as 100 fathom be something unheard of but the first news from the _ challenger _ open up new possibility for the trawl dr wyville thomson write -lrb- nature march 20 1873 -rrb- : -- for the first two or three haul in very deep water off the coast of portugal the dredge come up fill with the usual ` atlantic ooze ' tenacious and uniform throughout and the work of hour in sift give the very smallest possible result we be extremely anxious to get some idea of the general character of the fauna and particularly of the distribution of the higher group and after various suggestion for modification of the dredge it be propose to try the ordinary trawl we have a compact trawl with a 15-feet beam on board and we send it down off cape st vincent at a depth of 600 fathom the experiment look hazardous but to we great satisfaction the trawl come up all right and contain with many of the larger invertebrate several fish after the first attempt we try the trawl several time at depths of 1090 1525 and finally 2125 fathom and always with success to the coral-fisher of the mediterranean who seek the precious red coral which grow firmly fix to rock at a depth of sixty to eighty fathom both the dredge and the trawl would be useless they therefore have recourse to a sort of frame to which be fasten long bundle of loosely net hempen cord and which be lower by a rope to the depth at which the hempen cord can sweep over the surface of the rock and break off the coral which be bring up entangled in the cord a similar contrivance have arise out of the necessity of deep-sea exploration in the course of the dredging of the _ porcupine _ it be frequently find that while few object of interest be bring up within the dredge many live creature come up stick to the outside of the dredge-bag and even to the first few fathom of the dredge-rope the mouth of the dredge doubtless rapidly fill with mud and thus the thing it should have bring up be shut out to remedy this inconvenience captain calver devise a arrangement not unlike that employ by the coral - fisher he fasten half a dozen swab such as be use for dry deck to the dredge a swab be something like what a birch-broom would be if its twig be make of long coarse hempen yarn these drag along after the dredge over the surface of the mud and entangled the creature live there -- multitude of which twist up in the strand of the swab be bring to the surface with the dredge a further improvement be make by attach a long iron bar to the bottom of the dredge bag and fasten large bunch of teased-out hemp to the end of this bar these tangle bring up immense quantity of such animal as have long arm or spine or prominence which readily become catch in the hemp but they be very destructive to the fragile organism which they imprison and now that the trawl can be successfully work at the greatest depths it may be expect to supersede they at least wherever the ground be soft enough to permit of trawl it be obvious that between the dredge the trawl and the tangle there be little chance for any organism except such as be able to burrow rapidly to remain safely at the bottom of any part of the sea which the _ challenger _ undertake to explore and for the first time in the history of scientific exploration we have a fair chance of learn what the population of the depths of the sea be like in the most widely different part of the world and now arise the next question the means of exploration be fairly adequate what form of life may be look for at these vast depths the systematic study of the distribution of live being be the most modern branch of biological science and come into existence long after morphology and physiology have attain a considerable development this naturally do not imply that from the time man begin to observe natural phenomenon they be ignorant of the fact that the animal and plant of one part of the world be different from those in other region or that those of the hill be different from those of the plain in the same region or finally that some marine creature be find only in the shallows while other inhabit the deep nevertheless it be only after the discovery of america that the attention of naturalist be powerfully draw to the wonderful difference between the animal population of the central and southern part of the new world and that of those part of the old world which lie under the same parallel of latitude so far back as 1667 abraham mylius in he treatise de animalium origine et migratione populorum argue that since there be innumerable species of animal in america which do not exist elsewhere they must have be make and place there by the deity : buffon no less forcibly insist upon the difference between the fauna of the old and new world but the first attempt to gather fact of this order into a whole and to coordinate they into a series of generalization or law of geographical distribution be not a century old and be contain in the specimen zoologia geographica quadrupedum domicilium et migrationes sisten publish in 1777 by the learn brunswick professor eberhard zimmermann who illustrate he work by what he call a tabulum zoographica which be the oldest distributional map know to I in regard to matter of fact zimmermann 's chief aim be to show that among terrestrial mammal some occur all over the world while other be restricted to particular area of greater or smaller extent and that the abundance of species follow temperature be greatest in warm and least in cold climate but marine animal he think obey no such law the arctic and atlantic sea he say be as full of fish and other animal as those of the tropics it be therefore clear that cold do not affect the dweller in the sea as it do land animal and that this must be the case follow from the fact that sea water propter varias quas continet bitumini spiritusque particula freeze with much more difficulty than fresh water on the other hand the heat of the equatorial sun penetrate but a short distance below the surface of the ocean moreover accord to zimmermann the incessant disturbance of the mass of the sea by wind and tide so mix up the warm and the cold that life be evenly diffuse and abundant throughout the ocean in 1810 risso in he work on the ichthyology of nice lay the foundation of what have since be term bathymetrical distribution or distribution in depth by show that region of the sea bottom of different depths could be distinguish by the fish which inhabit they there be the _ littoral region _ between tide mark with its sand-eels pipe fish and blenny : the _ seaweed region _ extend from low - water-mark to a depth of 450 foot with its wrass ray and flat fish and the _ deep-sea region _ from 450 foot to 1500 foot or more with its file-fish shark gurnard cod and sword-fish more than twenty year later mm audouin and milne edward carry out the principle of distinguish the fauna of different zone of depth much more minutely in they recherch pour servir  l'histoire naturelle du littoral de la france publish in 1832 they divide the area include between highwater-mark and lowwater-mark of spring tide -lrb- which be very extensive on account of the great rise and fall of the tide on the normandy coast about st malo where they observation be make -rrb- into four zone each characterize by its peculiar invertebrate inhabitant beyond the fourth region they distinguish a fifth which be never uncovered and be

animal which live in different zone of depth will prove that the shell have be transport into the position in which they be find while on the other hand the absence of shell in a deposit will not justify the conclusion that the water in which it be form be devoid of animal inhabitant inasmuch as they might have be only too deep for habitation the new line of investigation thus open by the french naturalist be follow up by the norwegian sar in 1835 by edward forbe in we own country in 1840 -lrb- 4 -rrb- and by oerst in denmark a few year later the genius of forbe combine with he extensive knowledge of botany invertebrate zoology and geology enable he to do more than any of he compeer in bring the importance of distribution in depth into notice and he research in the aegean sea and still more he remarkable paper on the geological relation of the exist fauna and flora of the british isle publish in 1846 in the first volume of the memoirs of the geological survey of great britain attract universal attention -lrb- footnote 4 : in the paper in the _ memoirs of the survey _ cite further on forbe write : -- in a essay ` on the association of mollusca on the british coast

usually denominate ` the littoral zone ' ` the region of laminaria ' ` the region of coral-line ' and ` the region of coral ' a extensive series of research chiefly conduct by the member of the committee appoint by the british association to investigate the marine geology of britain by means of the dredge have not invalidate this classification and the research of professor lovn in the norwegian and lapland sea have bear out they correctness the first two of the region above mention have be previously notice by lamoureux in he account of the distribution -lrb- vertically -rrb- of sea-weed by audouin and milne edward in they _ observation on the natural history of the coast of france _ and by sar in the preface to he _ beskrivelser og jagttayelser _ -rrb- on the coast of the

-rrb- and the deep sea or coral region -lrb- from 50 fathom to beyond 100 fathom -rrb- but in the deeper water of the aegean sea between the shore and a depth of 300 fathom forbe be able to make out no fewer than eight zone of life in the course of which the number and variety of form gradually diminish until beyond 300 fathom life disappear altogether hence it appear as if descent in the sea have much the same effect on life as ascent on land recent investigation appear to show that forbe be right enough in he classification of the fact of distribution in depth as they be to be observe in the aegean and though at the time he write one or two observation be extant which might have warn he not to generalize too extensively from he aegean experience he own dredging work be so much more extensive and systematic than that of any other naturalist that it be not wonderful he should have feel justified in build upon it nevertheless so far as the limit of the range of life in depth go forbe ' conclusion have be completely negatived and the greatest depths yet attain show not even a approach to a zero of life : -- during the several cruise of hm ship _ lightning _ and _ porcupine _ in the year 1868 1869 and 1870 say dr wyville thomson fifty-seven haul of the dredge be take in the atlantic at depths beyond 500 fathom and sixteen at depths beyond 1000 fathom and in all case life be abundant in 1869 we take two cast in depths greater than 2000 fathom in both of these life be abundant and with the deepest cast 2435 fathom off the month of the bay of biscay we take live well-marked and characteristic example of all the five invertebrate sub - kingdom and thus the question of the existence of abundant animal life at the bottom of the sea have be finally settle and for all depths for there be no reason to suppose that the depth anywhere exceed between three and four thousand fathom and if there be nothing in the condition of a depth of 2500 fathom to prevent the full development of a varied fauna it be impossible to suppose that even a additional thousand fathom would make any great difference -lrb- 5 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : _ the depths of the sea _ p 30 result of a similar kind obtain by previous observer be state at length in the sixth chapter pp 267-280 the dredging carry out by count pourtale under the authority of professor peirce the superintendent of the united state coast survey in the year 1867 1868 and 1869 be particularly noteworthy and it be probably not too much to say in the word of professor agassiz that we owe to the coast survey the first broad and comprehensive basis for a exploration of the sea bottom on a large scale open a new era in zoological and geological research -rrb- as dr wyville thomson 's recent letter cite above show the use of the trawl at great depths have bring to light a still greater diversity of life fish come up from a depth of 600 to more than 1000 fathom all in a peculiar condition from the expansion of the air contain in they body on they relief from the extreme pressure they eye especially have a singular appearance protrude like great globe from they head bivalve and univalve mollusca seem to be rare at the greatest depths but starfish sea urchin and other echinoderm zoophyte sponge and protozoan abound it be obvious that the _ challenger _ have the privilege of open a new chapter in the history of the living world she can not send down she dredge and she trawl into these virgin depths of the great ocean without bring up a discovery even though the thing itself may be neither rich nor rare the fact that it come from that depth in that particular latitude and longitude will be a new fact in distribution and as such have a certain importance but it may be confidently assume that the thing bring up will very frequently be zoological novelty or better still zoological antiquity which in the tranquil and little-changed depths of the ocean have escape the cause of destruction at work in the shallows and represent the predominant population of a past age it have be see that audouin and milne edward foresee the general influence of the study of distribution in depth upon the interpretation of geological phenomenon forbe connect the two order of inquiry still more closely and in the thoughtful essay on the connection between the distribution of the exist fauna and flora of the british isle and the geological change which have affect they area especially during the epoch of the northern drift to which reference have already be make he put forth a most pregnant suggestion in certain part of the sea bottom in the immediate vicinity of the british island as in the clyde district among the hebride in the moray firth and in the german ocean there be depressed area form a kind of submarine valley the centre of which be from 80 to 100 fathom or more deep these depression be inhabit by assemblage of marine animal which differ from those find over the adjacent and shallower region and resemble those which be meet with much farther north on the norwegian coast forbe call these scandinavian detachment northern outlier how do these isolate patch of a northern population get into these deep place to explain the mystery forbe call to mind the fact that in the epoch which immediately precede the present the climate be much colder -lrb- whence the name of glacial epoch apply to it -rrb- and that the shell which be find fossil or sub-fossil in deposit of that age be precisely such as be now to be meet with only in the scandinavian or still more arctic region undoubtedly during the glacial epoch the general population of we sea have universally the northern aspect which be now present only by the northern outlier just as the vegetation of the land down to the sea-level have the northern character which be at present exhibit only by the plant which live on the top of we mountain but as the glacial epoch pass away and the present climatal condition be develop the northern plant be able to maintain themselves only on the bleak height on which southern form could not compete with they and in like manner forbe suggest that after the glacial epoch the northern animal then inhabit the sea become restricted to the deep in which they could hold they own against invader from the south better fitted than they to flourish in the warmer water of the shallows thus depth in the sea correspond in its effect upon distribution to height on the land the same idea be apply to the explanation of a similar anomaly in the fauna of the aegean : -- in the deepest of the region of depth of the aegean the representation of a northern fauna be maintain partly by identical and partly by representative form the presence of the latter be essentially due to the law -lrb- of representation of parallel of latitude by zone of depth -rrb- whilst that of the former species depend on they transmission from they parent sea during a former epoch and subsequent isolation that epoch be doubtless the newer pliocene or glacial era when the _ mya trunca _ and other northern form now extinct in the mediterranean and find fossil in the sicilian tertiary range into that sea the change which there destroy the _ shallow water _ glacial form do not affect those live in the depths and which still survive -lrb- 6 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : _ memoirs of the geological survey of great britain _ vol i p 390 -rrb- the conception that the inhabitant of local depression of the sea bottom might be a remnant of the ancient population of the area which have hold they own in these deep fastness against a invade fauna as briton and gael have hold out in wale and in scotland against encroach teuton thus broach by forbe receive a wider application than forbe have dream of when the sound machine first bring up specimen of the mud of the deep sea as i have point out elsewhere -lrb- 7 -rrb- it at once become obvious that the calcareous sticky mud of the atlantic be make up in the main of shell of _ globigerina _ and other _ foraminifera _ identical with those of which the true chalk be compose and the identity extend even to the presence of those singular body the coccolith and coccosphere the true nature of which be not yet make out here then be organism as old as the cretaceous epoch still alive and do they work of rock-making at the bottom of exist sea what if _ globigerina _ and the coccolith should not be the only survivor of a world pass away which be hide beneath three mile of salt water the letter which dr wyville thomson write to dr carpenter in may 1868 out of which all these expedition have grow show that this query have become a practical problem in dr thomson 's mind at that time and the desirableness of solve the problem be put in the foreground of he reason for urge the government to undertake the work of exploration : -- -lrb- footnote 7 : see above on a piece of chalk p 13 -rrb- two year ago m sar swedish government inspector of fishery have a opportunity in he official capacity of dredge off the loffoten island at a depth of 300 fathom i visit norway shortly after he return and have a opportunity of study with he father professor sar some of he result animal form be _ abundant _ many of they be new to science and among they be one of surpass interest the small crinoid of which you have a specimen and which we at once recognize as a degraded type of the _ apiocrinidoe _ a order hitherto regard as extinct which attain its maximum in the pear encrinite of the jurassic period and whose latest representative hitherto know be the _ bourguettocrinus _ of the chalk some year previously mr absjornsen dredging in 200 fathom in the hardangerfjord procure several example of a starfish -lrb- _ brisinga _ -rrb- which seem to find its nearest ally in the fossil genus _ protaster _ these observation place it beyond a doubt that animal life be abundant in the ocean at depths vary from 200 to 300 fathom that the form at these great depths differ greatly from those meet with in ordinary dredging and that at all event in some case these animal be closely ally to and would seem to be directly descend from the fauna of the early tertiary i think the latter result might almost have be anticipate and probably further investigation will largely add to this class of datum and will give we a opportunity of testing we determination of the zoological position of some fossil type by a examination of the soft part of they recent representative the main cause of the destruction the migration and the extreme modification of animal type appear to be change of climate chiefly depend upon oscillation of the earth 's crust these oscillation do not appear to have range in the northern portion of the northern hemisphere much beyond 1000 foot since the commencement of the tertiary epoch the temperature of deep water seem to be constant for all latitudes at 39  so that a immense area of the north atlantic must have have its condition unaffected by tertiary or post-tertiary oscillation -lrb- 8 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 8 : the depths of the sea pp 51-52 -rrb- as we shall see the assumption that the temperature of the deep sea be everywhere 39  f -lrb- 4  cent -rrb- be a error which dr wyville thomson adopt from eminent physical writer but the general justice of the reasoning be not affect by this circumstance and dr thomson 's expectation have be to some extent already verify thus besides _ globigerina _ there be eighteen species of deep-sea _ foraminifera _ identical with species find in the chalk imbed in the chalky mud of the deep sea in many locality be innumerable cup - shaped sponge provide with six-rayed silicious spiculum so disposed that the wall of the cup be form of a lacework of flinty thread not less abundant in some part of the chalk formation be the fossil know as _ ventriculite _ well describe by dr thomson as elegant vase or cup with branch root-like basis or group of regularly or irregularly spread tube delicately fret on the surface with a impressed network like the finest lace and he add when we compare such recent form as _ aphrocalliste iphiteon holtenia _ and _ askonema _ with certain series of the chalk _ ventriculite _ there can not be the slightest doubt that they belong to the same family -- in some case to very nearly ally genus -lrb- 9 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 9 : _ the depths of the sea _ p 484 -rrb- professor duncan find several coral from the coast of portugal more nearly ally to chalk form than to any other the stalk crinoid or feather star so abundant in ancient time be now exclusively confine to the deep sea and the late exploration have yield form of old affinity the existence of which have hitherto be unsuspected the general character of the group of star fish imbed in the white chalk be almost the same as in the modern fauna of the deep atlantic the sea urchin of the deep sea while none of they be specifically identical with any chalk form belong to the same general group and some closely approach extinct cretaceous genus take these fact in conjunction with the positive evidence of the existence during the cretaceous epoch of a deep ocean where now lie the dry land of central and southern europe northern africa and western and southern asia and of the gradual diminution of this ocean during the older tertiary epoch until it be represent at the present day by such teacupful as the caspian the black sea and the mediterranean the supposition of dr thomson and dr carpenter that what be now the deep atlantic be the deep atlantic -lrb- though merge in a vast easterly extension -rrb- in the cretaceous epoch and that the _ globigerina _ mud have be accumulate there from that time to this seem to I to have a great degree of probability and i agree with dr wyville thomson against sir charle lyell -lrb- it take two of we to have any chance against he authority -rrb- in demur to the assertion that to talk of chalk have be uninterruptedly form in the atlantic be as inadmissible in a geographical as in a geological sense if the word chalk be to be use as a stratigraphical term and restricted to _ globigerina _ mud deposit during the cretaceous epoch of course it be improper to call the precisely similar mud of more recent date chalk if on the other hand it be to be use as a mineralogical term i do not see how the modern and the ancient chalk be to be separate -- and look at the matter geographically i see no reason to doubt that a boring rod drive from the surface of the mud which form the floor of the mid-atlantic would pass through one continuous mass of _ globigerina _ mud first of modern then of tertiary and then of mesozoic date the chalk of different depths and age be distinguish merely by the different form of other organism associate with the _ globigerinoe _ on the other hand i think it must be admit that a belief in the continuity of the modern with the ancient chalk have nothing to do with the proposition that we can in any sense whatever be say to be still live in the cretaceous epoch when the _ challenger 's _ trawl bring up a _ ichthyosaurus _ along with a few living specimen of _ belemnite _ and _ turrilite _ it may be admit that she have come upon a cretaceous outlier a geological period be characterize not only by the presence of those creature which live in it but by the absence of those which have only come into existence later and however large a proportion of true cretaceous form may be discover in the deep sea the modern type associate with they must be abolish before the fauna as a whole could with any propriety be term cretaceous i have now indicate some of the chief line of biological inquiry in which the _ challenger _ have special opportunity for do good service and in follow which she will be carry out the work already commence by the _ lightning _ and _ porcupine _ in they cruise of 1868 and subsequent year but biology in the long run rest upon physics and the first condition for arrive at a sound theory of distribution in the deep sea be the precise ascertainment of the condition of life or in other word a full knowledge of all those phenomenon which be embrace under the head of the physical geography of the ocean excellent work have already be do in this direction chiefly under the superintendence of dr carpenter by the _ lightning _ and the _ porcupine _ -lrb- 10 -rrb- and some datum of fundamental importance to the physical geography of the sea have be fix beyond a doubt -lrb- footnote 10 : _ proceedings of the royal society _ 1870 and 1872 -rrb- thus though it be true that sea-water steadily contract as it cool down to its freezing point instead of expand before it reach its freezing point as fresh water do the truth have be steadily ignore by even the highest authority in physical geography and the erroneous conclusion deduce from they erroneous premise have be widely accept as if they be ascertain fact of course if sea-water like fresh water be heaviest at a temperature of 39  f and get lighter as it approach 32  f the water of the bottom of the deep sea could not be colder than 39  but one of the first result of the careful ascertainment of the temperature at different depths by means of thermometer specially contrived for the avoidance of the error produce by pressure be the proof that below 1000 fathom in the atlantic down to the greatest depths yet sound the water have a temperature always lower than 38  fahr whatever be the temperature of the water at the surface and that this low temperature of the deepest water be probably the universal rule for the depths of the open ocean be show among other by captain chimmo 's recent observation in the indian ocean between ceylon and sumatra where the surface water range from 85  -81  fahr the temperature at the bottom at a depth of 2270 to 2656 fathom be only from 34  to 32  fahr as the mean temperature of the superficial layer of the crust of the earth may be take at about 50  fahr it follow that the bottom layer of the deep sea in temperate and hot latitudes be on the average much colder than either of the body with which it be in contact for the temperature of the earth be constant while that of the air rarely fall so low as that of the bottom water in the latitudes in question and even when it do have time to affect only a comparatively thin stratum of the surface water before the return of warm weather how do this apparently anomalous state of thing come about if we suppose the globe to be cover with a universal ocean it can hardly be doubt that the cold of the region towards the pole must tend to cause the superficial water of those region to contract and become specifically heavier under these circumstance it would have no alternative but to descend and spread over the sea bottom while its place would be take by warmer water draw from the adjacent region thus deep cold polar-equatorial current and superficial warmer equatorial-polar current would be set up and as the former would have a less velocity of rotation from west to east than the region towards which they travel they would not be due southerly or northerly current but south-westerly in the northern hemisphere and north-westerly in the southern while by a parity of reasoning the equatorial-polar warm current would be north-easterly in the northern hemisphere and south - easterly in the southern hence as a north-easterly current have the same direction as a south-westerly wind the direction of the northern equatorial-polar current in the extra-tropical part of its course would pretty nearly coincide with that of the anti-trade wind the freezing of the surface of the polar sea would not interfere with the movement thus set up for however bad a conductor of heat ice may be the unfrozen sea-water immediately in contact with the undersurface of the ice must need be colder than that further off and hence will constantly tend to descend through the subjacent warmer water in this way it would seem inevitable that the surface water of the northern and southern frigid zone must sooner or later find they way to the bottom of the rest of the ocean and there accumulate to a thickness dependent on the rate at which they absorb heat from the crust of the earth below and from the surface water above if this hypothesis be correct it follow that if any part of the ocean in warm latitudes be shut off from the influence of the cold polar underflow the temperature of its deep should be less cold than the temperature of corresponding depths in the open sea now in the mediterranean nature offer a remarkable experimental proof of just the kind need it be a landlocked sea which run nearly east and west between the twenty-ninth and forty-fifth parallel of north latitude roughly speak the average temperature of the air over it be 75  fahr in July and 48  in January this great expanse of water be divide by the peninsula of italy -lrb- include sicily -rrb- continuous with which be a submarine elevation carry less than 1200 foot of water which extend from sicily to cape bon in africa into two great pool -- a eastern and a western the eastern pool rapidly deepen to more than 12000 foot and send off to the north its comparatively shallow branch the adriatic and the aegean sea the western pool be less deep though it reach some 10000 foot and just as the western end of the eastern pool communicate by a shallow passage not a sixth of its greatest depth with the western pool so the western pool be separate from the atlantic by a ridge which run between cape trafalgar and spartel on which there be hardly 1000 foot of water all the water of the mediterranean which lie deeper than about 150 fathom therefore be shut off from that of the atlantic and there be no communication between the cold layer of the atlantic -lrb- below 1000 fathom -rrb- and the mediterranean under these circumstance what be the temperature of the mediterranean everywhere below 600 foot it be about 55  fahr and consequently at its greatest depths it be some 20  warmer than the corresponding depths of the atlantic it seem extremely difficult to account for this difference in any other way than by adopt the view so strongly and ably advocate by dr carpenter that in the exist distribution of land and water such a circulation of the water of the ocean do actually occur as theoretically must occur in the universal ocean with which we start it be quite another question however whether this theoretic circulation true cause as it may be be competent to give rise to such movement of sea-water in mass as those current which have commonly be regard as northern extension of the gulf-stream i shall not venture to touch upon this complicated problem but i may take occasion to remark that the cause of a much simpler phenomenon -- the stream of atlantic water which set through the strait of gibraltar eastward at the rate of two or three mile a hour or more do not seem to be so clearly make out as be desirable the fact appear to be that the water of the mediterranean be very slightly denser than that of the atlantic -lrb- 10278 to 10265 -rrb- and that the deep water of the mediterranean be slightly denser than that of the surface while the deep water of the atlantic be if anything lighter than that of the surface moreover while a rapid superficial current be set in -lrb- always save in exceptionally violent easterly wind -rrb- through the strait of gibraltar from the atlantic to the mediterranean a deep undercurrent -lrb- together with variable side current -rrb- be set out through the strait from the mediterranean to the atlantic dr carpenter adopt without hesitation the view that the cause of this indraught of atlantic water be to be seek in the much more rapid evaporation which take place from the surface of the mediterranean than from that of the atlantic and thus by lower the level of the former give rise to a indraught from the latter but be there any sound foundation for the three assumption involve here firstly that the evaporation from the mediterranean as a whole be much greater than that from the atlantic under corresponding parallel secondly that the rainfall over the mediterranean make up for evaporation less than it do over the atlantic and thirdly suppose these two question answer affirmatively : be not these source of loss in the mediterranean fully cover by the prodigious quantity of fresh water which be pour into it by great river and submarine spring consider that the water of the ebro the rhine the po the danube the don the dnieper and the nile all flow directly or indirectly into the mediterranean that the volume of fresh water which they pour into it be so enormous that fresh water may sometimes be bale up from the surface of the sea off the delta of the nile while the land be not yet in sight that the water of the black sea be half fresh and that a current of three or four mile a hour constantly stream from it mediterraneanward through the bosphorus -- consider in addition that no fewer than ten submarine spring of fresh water be know to burst up in the mediterranean some of they so large that admiral smyth call they subterranean river of amazing volume and force and it would seem on the face of the matter that the sun must have enough to do to keep the level of the mediterranean down and that possibly we may have to seek for the cause of the small superiority in saline contents of the mediterranean water in some condition other than solar evaporation again if the gibraltar indraught be the effect of evaporation why do it go on in winter as well as in summer all these be question more easily ask than answer but they must be answer before we can accept the gibraltar stream as a example of a current produce by indraught with any comfort the mediterranean be not include in the _ challenger 's _ route but she will visit one of the most promising and little explore of hydrographical region -- the north pacific between polynesium and the asiatic and american shore and doubtless the store of observation upon the current of this region which she will accumulate when compare with what we know of the north atlantic will throw a powerful light upon the present obscurity of the gulf-stream problem iii on some of the result of the expedition of hm _ challlenger _ -lrb- 1875 -rrb- in may 1873 i draw attention -lrb- 1 -rrb- to the important problem connect with the physics and natural history of the sea to the solution of which there be every reason to hope the cruise of hm _ challenger _ would furnish important contribution the expectation then express have not be disappointed report to the admiralty papers communicate to the royal society and large collection which have already be send home have show that the _ challenger 's _ staff have make admirable use of they great opportunity and that on the return of the expedition in 1874 they performance will be fully up to the level of they promise indeed i be dispose to go so far as to say that if nothing more come of the _ challenger _ expedition than have hitherto be yield by she exploration of the nature of the sea bottom at great depths a full scientific equivalent of the trouble and expense of she equipment would have be obtain -lrb- footnote 1 : see the precede essay -rrb- in order to justify this assertion and yet at the same time not to claim more for professor wyville thomson and he colleague than be they due i must give a brief history of the observation which have precede they exploration of this recondite field of research and endeavor to make clear what be the state of knowledge in December 1872 and what new fact have be add by the scientific staff of the _ challenger _ so far as i have be able to discover the first successful attempt to bring up from great depths more of the sea bottom than would adhere to a sounding-lead be make by sir john ross in the voyage to the arctic region which he undertake in 1818 in the appendix to the narrative of that voyage there will be find a account of a very ingenious apparatus call clam -- a sort of double scoop -- of he own contrivance which sir john ross have make by the ship 's armourer and by which be in baffin 's bay in 72  30 ' n and 77  15 ' w he succeed in bring up from 1050 fathom -lrb- or 6300 foot -rrb- several pound of a fine green mud which form the bottom of the sea in this region captain -lrb- now sir edward -rrb- sabine who accompany sir john ross on this cruise say of this mud that it be soft and greenish and that the lead sink several foot into it a similar fine green mud be find to compose the sea bottom in davi strait by goodsir in 1845 nothing be certainly know of the exact nature of the mud thus obtain but we shall see that the mud of the bottom of the antarctic sea be describe in curiously similar term by dr hooker and there be no doubt as to the composition of this deposit in 1850 captain penny collect in assistance bay in kingston bay and in melville bay which lie between 73

the residuum of the melt ice consist for the most part of the silicious case of diatomaceous plant and of the silicious spiculum of sponge while mixed with these be a certain number of the equally

west point lieutenant brooke of the united state navy who be employ in survey the sea of kamschatka have succeed in obtain specimen of the sea bottom from greater depths than any hitherto reach namely from 2700 fathom -lrb- 16200 foot -rrb- in 56  46 ' n and 168  18 ' e and from 1700 fathom -lrb- 10200 foot -rrb- in 60  15 ' n and 170  53 ' e on examine these microscopically professor bailey find as ehrenberg have do in the case of mud obtain on the opposite side of the arctic region that the fine mud be make up of shell of _ diatomacoe _ of spiculum of sponge and of _ radiolarium _ with a small admixture of mineral matter but without a trace of any calcareous organism still more complete information have be obtain concern the nature of the sea bottom in the cold zone around the south pole between the year 1839 and 1843 sir jame clark ross execute he famous antarctic expedition in the course of which he penetrate at two widely distant point of the antarctic zone into the high latitudes of the shore of victorium land and of graham 's land and reach the parallel of 80  s sir jame ross be himself a naturalist of no mean acquirement and dr hooker -lrb- 3 -rrb- the present president of the royal society accompany he as naturalist to the expedition so that the observation upon the fauna and flora of the antarctic region make during this cruise be sure to have a peculiar value and importance even have not the attention of the voyager be particularly direct to the importance of note the occurrence of the minutest form of animal and vegetable life in the ocean -lrb- footnote 3 : now sir joseph hooker 1894 -rrb- among the scientific instruction for the voyage draw up by a committee of the royal society however there be a remarkable letter from von humboldt to lord minto then first lord of the admiralty in which among other thing he dwell upon the significance of the research into the microscopic composition of rock and the discovery of the great share which microscopic organism take in the formation of the crust of the earth at the present day make by ehrenberg in the year 1836-39 ehrenberg in fact have show that the extensive bed of rotten-stone or tripolus which occur in various part of the world and notably at bilin in bohemia consist of accumulation of the silicious case and skeleton of _ diatomaceoe _ sponge and _ radiolarium _ he have prove that similar deposit be be form by _ diatomaceoe _ in the pool of the thiergarten in berlin and elsewhere and have point out that if it be commercially worth while rotten-stone might be manufacture by a process of diatom-culture observation conduct at cuxhaven in 1839 have reveal the existence at the surface of the water of the baltic of live diatom and _ radiolarium _ of the same species as those which in a fossil state constitute extensive rock of tertiary age at caltanisetta zante and oran on the shore of the mediterranean moreover in the fresh-water rotten-stone bed of bilin ehrenberg have trace out the metamorphosis effect apparently by the action of percolate water of the primitively loose and friable deposit of organize particle in which the silex exist in the hydrated or soluble condition the silex in fact undergo solution and slow redeposition until in ultimate result the excessively fine-grained sand each particle of which be a skeleton become convert into a dense opaline stone with only here and there a indication of a organism from the consideration of these fact ehrenberg as early as the year 1839 have arrive at the conclusion that rock altogether similar to those

importance in connection with these view and they be so clearly state in the former work which be somewhat inaccessible that i make no apology for quote they at length -- the water and the ice of the south polar ocean be alike find to abound with microscopic vegetable belong to the order _ diatomaceoe _ though much too small to be discernible by the naked eye they occur in such countless myriad as to stain the berg and the pack ice wherever they be wash by the swell of the sea and when enclose in the congeal surface of the water they impart to the brash and pancake ice a pale ochreous color in the open ocean northward of the frozen zone this order though no doubt almost universally present generally elude the search of the naturalist except when its species be congregate amongst that mucous scum which be sometimes see float on the wave and of whose real nature we be ignorant or when the color contents of the marine animal who feed on these alga be examine to the south however of the belt of ice which encircle the globe between the parallel of 50  and 70  s and in the water comprise between that belt and the highest latitude ever attain by man this vegetation be very conspicuous from the contrast between its color and the white snow and ice in which it be imbed insomuch that in the eightieth degree all the surface ice carry along by the current the side of every berg and the base of the great victorium barrier itself within reach of the swell be tinge brown as if the polar water be charge with oxide of iron as the majority of these plant consist of very simple vegetable cell enclose in indestructible silex -lrb- as other alga be in carbonate of lime -rrb- it be obvious that the death and decomposition of such multitude must form sedimentary deposit proportionate in they extent to the length and exposure of the coast against which they be wash in thickness to the power of such agent as the wind current and sea which sweep they more energetically to certain position and in purity to the depth of the water and nature of the bottom hence we detect they remains along every icebound shore in the depths of the adjacent ocean between 80 and 400 fathom off victorium barrier -lrb- a perpendicular wall of ice between one and two hundred foot above the level of the sea -rrb- the bottom of the ocean be cover with a stratum of pure white or green mud compose principally of the silicious shell of the _ diatomaceoe _ these on be put into water render it cloudy like milk and take many hour to subside in the very deep water off victorium and graham 's land this mud be particularly pure and fine but towards the shallow shore there exist a greater or less admixture of disintegrated rock and sand so that the organic compound of the bottom frequently bear but a small proportion to the inorganic the universal existence of such a invisible vegetation as that of the antarctic ocean be a truly wonderful fact and the more from its not be accompany by plant of a high order during the year we spend there i have be accustom to regard the phenomenon of life as differ totally from what obtain throughout all other latitudes for everything living appear to be of animal origin the ocean swarm with _ mollusca _ and particularly entomostracous _ crustacea _ small whale and porpoise the sea abound with penguin and seal and the air with bird the animal kingdom be ever present the larger creature prey on the smaller and these again on smaller still all seem carnivorous the herbivorous be not recognize because feed on a microscopic herbage of whose true nature i have form a erroneous impression it be therefore with no little satisfaction that i now class the _ diatomaceoe _ with plant probably maintain in the south polar ocean that balance between the vegetable and the animal kingdom which prevail over the surface of we globe nor be the sustenance and nutrition of the animal kingdom the only function these minute production may perform they may also be the purifier of the vitiate atmosphere and thus execute in the antarctic latitudes the office of we tree and grass turf in the temperate region and the broad leaf of the palm & c in the tropics with respect to the distribution of the _ diatomaceoe _ dr hooker remark : -- there be probably no latitude between that of spitzbergen and victorium land where some of the species of either country do not exist : iceland britain the mediterranean sea north and south america and the south sea island all possess antarctic _ diatomaceoe _ the silicious coat of species only known living in the water of the south polar ocean have during past age contribute to the formation of rock and thus they outlive several successive creation of organize being the phonolite stone of the rhine and the tripolus stone contain species identical with what be now contribute to form a sedimentary deposit -lrb- and perhaps at some future period a bed of rock -rrb- extend in one continuous stratum for 400 measure mile i allude to the shore of the victorium barrier along whose coast the sounding examine be invariably charge with diatomaceous remains constitute a bank which stretch 200 mile north from the base of victorium barrier while the average depth of water above it be 300 fathom or 1800 foot again some of the antarctic species have be detect float in the atmosphere which overhang the wide ocean between africa and america the knowledge of this marvellous fact we owe to mr darwin who when he be at sea off the cape de verd island collect a impalpable powder which fall on captain fitzroy 's ship he transmit this dust to ehrenberg who ascertain it to consist of the silicious coat chiefly of american _ diatomaceoe _ which be be waft through the upper region of the air when some meteorological phenomenon check they in they course and deposit they on the ship and surface of the ocean the existence of the remains of many species of this order -lrb- and amongst they some antarctic one -rrb- in the volcanic ash pumice and scoria of active and extinct volcano -lrb- those of the mediterranean sea and ascension island for instance -rrb- be a fact bearing immediately upon the present subject mount erebus a volcano 12400 foot high of the first class in dimension and energetic action rise at once from the ocean in the seventy-eighth degree of south latitude and abreast of the _ diatomaceoe _ bank which repose in part on its base hence it may not appear preposterous to conclude that as vesuvius receive the water of the mediterranean with its fish to eject they by its crater so the subterranean and subaqueous force which maintain mount erebus in activity may occasionally receive organic matter from the bank and disgorge it together with those volcanic product ash and pumice along the shore of graham 's land and the south shetland island we have a parallel combination of igneous and aqueous action accompany with a equally copious supply of _ diatomaceoe _ in the gulf of erebus and terror fifteen degree north of victorium land and place on the opposite side of the globe the sounding be of a similar nature with those of the victorium land and barrier and the sea and ice as full of _ diatomaceoe _ this be not only prove by the deep sea lead but by the examination of berg which once strand have float off and become reversed expose a accumulation of white friable mud freeze to they basis which abound with these vegetable remain the _ challenger _ have explore the antarctic sea in a region intermediate between those examine by sir jame ross 's expedition and the observation make by dr wyville thomson and he colleague in every respect confirm those of dr hooker : -- on the 11th of February lat 60  52 ' s long 80  20 ' e and march 3 lat 53  55 ' s long 108  35 ' e the sound instrument come up fill with a very fine cream-coloured paste which scarcely effervesce with acid and dry into a very light impalpable white powder this when examine under the microscope be find to consist almost entirely of the frustule of diatom some of they wonderfully perfect in all the detail of they ornament and many of they break up the species of diatom enter into this deposit have not yet be work up but they appear to be referable chiefly to the genus _ fragillarium coscinodiscus choetocero asteromphalus _ and _ dictyocha _ with fragment of the separated rod of a singular silicious organism with which we be unacquainted and which make up a large proportion of the finer matter of this deposit mix with the diatom there be a few small _ globigerinoe _ some of the test and spicule of radiolarian and some sand particle but these foreign body be in too small proportion to affect the formation as consist practically of diatom alone on the 4th of February in lat 52  29 ' s long 71  36 e a little to the north of the hear island the tow-net drag a few fathom below the surface come up nearly fill with a pale yellow gelatinous mass this be find to consist entirely of diatom of the same species as those find at the bottom by far the most abundant be the little bundle of silicious rod fasten together loosely at one end separate from one another at the other end and the whole bundle loosely twist into a spindle the rod be hollow and contain the characteristic endochrome of the _ diatomaceoe _ like the _ globigerina _ ooze then which it succeed to the southward in a band apparently of no great width the material of this silicious deposit be derive entirely from the surface and intermediate depths it be somewhat singular that diatom do not appear to be in such large number on the surface over the diatom ooze as they be a little further north this may perhaps be account for by we not have strike they belt of depth with the tow-net or it be possible that when we find it on the 11th of February the bottom deposit be really shift a little to the south by the warm current the excessively fine flocculent _ dbris _ of the diatom take a certain time to sink the belt of diatom ooze be certainly a little further to the southward in long 83  e in the path of the reflux of the agulha current than in long 108  e all along the edge of the ice-pack -- everywhere in fact to the south of the two station -- on the 11th of February on we southward voyage and on the 3rd of march on we return we bring up fine sand and grayish mud with small pebble of quartz and felspar and small fragment of mica - slate chlorite-slate clay-slate gneiss and granite this deposit i have no doubt be derive from the surface like the other but in this case by the melting of iceberg and the precipitation of foreign matter contain in the ice we never see any trace of gravel or sand or any material necessarily derive from land on a iceberg several show vertical or irregular fissure fill with discolor ice or snow but when look at closely the discoloration prove usually to be very slight and the effect at a distance be usually due to the foreign material fill the fissure reflect light less perfectly than the general surface of the berg i conceive that the upper surface of one of these great tabular southern iceberg include by far the greater part of its bulk and culminate in the portion expose above the surface of the sea be form by the pile up of successive layer of snow during the period amounting perhaps to several century during which the ice-cap be slowly force itself over the low land and out to sea over a long extent of gentle slope until it reach a depth considerably above 200 fathom when the lower specific weight of the ice cause a upward strain which at length overcome the cohesion of the mass and portion be rent off and float away if this be the true history of the formation of these iceberg the absence of all land _ dbris _ in the portion expose above the surface of the sea be readily understand if any such exist it must be confine to the lower part of the berg to that part which have at one time or other move on the floor of the ice-cap the iceberg when they be first dispersed float in from 200 to 250 fathom when therefore they have be drift to latitudes of 65  or 64  s the bottom of the berg just reach the layer at which the temperature of the water be distinctly rise and it be rapidly melt and the mud and pebble with which it be more or less charge be precipitated that this precipitation take place all over the area where the iceberg be break up constantly and to a considerable extent be evident from the fact of the sounding be entirely compose of such deposit for the diatom _ globigerinoe _ and radiolarian be present on the surface in large number and unless the deposit from the ice be abundant it would soon be cover and mask by a layer of the exuvium of surface organism the observation which have be detail leave no doubt that the antarctic sea bottom from a little to the south of the fiftieth parallel as far as 80  s be be cover by a fine deposit of silicious mud more or less mixed in some part with the ice-borne _ dbris _ of polar land and with the ejection of volcano the silicious particle which constitute this mud be derive in part from the diatomaceous plant and radiolarian animal which throng the surface and in part from the spiculum of sponge which live at the bottom the evidence respect the corresponding arctic area be less complete but it be sufficient to justify the conclusion that a essentially similar silicious cap be be form around the northern pole there be no doubt that the constituent particle of this mud may agglomerate into a dense rock such as that form at oran on the shore of the mediterranean which be make up of similar material moreover in the case of freshwater deposit of this kind it be certain that the action of percolate water may convert the originally soft and friable fine-grained sandstone into a dense semi-transparent opaline stone the silicious organize skeleton be dissolve and the silex re-deposited in a amorphous state whether such a metamorphosis as this occur in submarine deposit as well as in those form in fresh water do not appear but there seem no reason to doubt that it may and hence it may not be hazardous to conclude that very ordinary metamorphic agency may convert these polar cap into a form of quartzite in the great intermediate zone occupy some 110  of latitude which separate the circumpolar arctic and antarctic area of silicious deposit the diatom and _ radiolarium _ of the surface water and the sponge of the bottom do not die out and so far as some form be concern do not even appear to diminish in total number though on a rough estimate it would appear that the proportion of _ radiolarium _ to diatom be much greater than in the colder sea nevertheless the composition of the deep-sea mud of this intermediate zone be entirely different from that of the circumpolar region the first exact information respect the nature of this mud at depths greater than 1000 fathom be give by ehrenberg in the account which he publish in the monatsberichte of the berlin academy for the year 1853 of the sounding obtain by lieut berryman of the united state navy in the north atlantic between newfoundland and the azore observation which confirm those of ehrenberg in all essential respects have be make by professor bailey myself dr wallich dr carpenter and professor wyville thomson in they earlier cruise and the continuation of the _ globigerina _ ooze over the south pacific have be prove by the recent work of the _ challenger _ by which it be also show for the first time that in pass from the equator to high southern latitudes the number and variety of the _ foraminifera _ diminish and even the _ globigerinoe _ become dwarf and this result it will be observe be in entire accordance with the fact already mention that in the sea of kamschatka the deep-sea mud be find by bailey to contain no calcareous organism thus in the whole of the intermediate zone the silicious deposit which be be form there as elsewhere by the accumulation of sponge - spiculum _ radiolarium _ and diatom be obscure and overpower by the immensely greater amount of calcareous sediment which arise from the aggregation of the skeleton of dead _ foraminifera _ the similarity of the deposit thus compose of a large percentage of carbonate of lime and a small percentage of silex to chalk regard merely as a kind of rock which be first point out by ehrenberg -lrb- 5 -rrb- be now admit on all hand nor can it be reasonably doubt that ordinary metamorphic agency be competent to convert the modern chalk into hard limestone or even into crystalline marble -lrb- footnote 5 : the follow passage in ehrenberg 's memoir on _ the organism in the chalk which be still live _ -lrb- 1839 -rrb- be conclusive : -- 7 the dawn period of the exist living organic creation if such a period be distinguishable -lrb- which be doubtful -rrb- can only be suppose to have exist on the other side of and below the chalk formation and thus either the chalk with its widespread and thick bed must enter into the series of newer formation or some of the accept four great geological period the quaternary tertiary and secondary formation contain organism which still live it be more probable in the proportion of 3 to 1 that the transition or primary period be not different but that it be only more difficult to examine and understand by reason of the gradual and prolonged chemical decomposition and metamorphosis of many of its organic constituent 10 by the mass-forming _ infasorium _ and _ polythalamium _ secondary be not distinguishable from tertiary formation and from what have be say it be possible that at this very day rock mass be form in the sea and be raise by volcanic agency the constitution of which on the whole be altogether similar to that of the chalk the chalk remain distinguishable by its organic remains as a formation but not as a kind of rock -rrb- ehrenberg appear to have take it for grant that the _ globigerinoe _ and other _ foraminifera _ which be find in the deep-sea mud live at the great depths in which they remains be find and he support this opinion by produce evidence that the soft part of these organism be preserved and may be demonstrate by remove the calcareous matter with dilute acid in 1857 the evidence for and against this conclusion appear to I to be insufficient to warrant a positive conclusion one way or the other and i express myself in my report to the admiralty on captain dayman 's sounding in the follow term : -- when we consider the immense area over which this deposit be spread the depth at which its formation be go on and its similarity to chalk and still more to such rock as the marl of caltanisetta the question whence be all these organism derive become one of high scientific interest three answer have suggest themselves : -- in accordance with the prevalent view of the limitation of life to comparatively small depths it be imagine either : 1 that these organism have drift into they present position from shallower water or 2 that they habitually live at the surface of the ocean and only fall down into they present position 1 i conceive that the first supposition be negative by the extremely marked zoological peculiarity of the deep-sea fauna have the _ globigerinoe _ be drift into they present position from shallow water we should find a very large proportion of the characteristic inhabitant of shallow water mix with they and this would the more certainly be the case as the large _ globigerinoe _ so abundant in the deep-sea sounding be in proportion to they size more solid and massive than almost any other _ foraminifera _ but the fact be that the proportion of other _ foraminifera _ be exceedingly small nor have i find as yet in the deep-sea deposit any such matter as fragment of molluscous shell of _ echinus _ & c which abound in shallow water and be quite as likely to be drift as the heavy _ globigerinoe _ again the relative proportion of young and fully form _ globigerinoe _ seem inconsistent with the notion that they have travel far and it seem difficult to imagine why have the deposit be accumulate in this way _ coscinodiscus _ should so almost entirely represent the _ diatomaceoe _ 2 the second hypothesis be far more feasible and be strongly support by the fact that many _ polycistineoe -lrb- radiolarium -rrb- _ and _ coscinodiscus _ be well know to live at the surface of the ocean mr macdonald assistant - surgeon of hm _ herald _ now in the south-western pacific have lately send home some very valuable observation on live form of this kind meet with in the stomach of oceanic mollusk and therefore certainly inhabitant of the superficial layer of the ocean but it be a singular circumstance that only one of the form figure by mr macdonald be at all like a _ globigerina _ and there be some peculiarity about even this which make I greatly doubt its affinity with that genus the form indeed be not unlike that of a _ globigerina _ but it be provide with long radiate process of which i have never see any trace in _ globigerina _ do they exist they might explain what otherwise be a great objection to this view viz how be it conceivable that the heavy _ globigerina _ should maintain itself at the surface of the water if the organic body in the deep-sea sounding have neither be drift nor have fall from above there remain but one alternative -- they must have live and die where they be important objection however at once suggest themselves to this view how can animal life be conceive to exist under such condition of light temperature pressure and aeration as must obtain at these vast depths to this one can only reply that we know for a certainty that even very highly-organized animal do continue to live at a depth of 300 and 400 fathom inasmuch as they have be dredge up thence and that the difference in the amount of light and heat at 400 and at 2000 fathom be probably so to speak very far less than the difference in complexity of organization between these animal and the humbler _ protozoan _ and _ protophyta _ of the deep-sea sounding i confess though as yet far from regard it prove that the _ globigerinoe _ live at these depths the balance of probability seem to I to incline in that direction and there be one circumstance which weigh strongly in my mind it may be take as a law that any genus of animal which be find far back in time be capable of live under a great variety of circumstance as regard light temperature and pressure now the genus _ globigerina _ be abundantly represent in the cretaceous epoch and perhaps earlier i abstain however at present from draw any positive conclusion prefer rather to await the result of more extended observation -lrb- 6 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : appendix to report on deep-sea sounding in the atlantic ocean by lieut-commander joseph dayman 1857 -rrb- dr wallich professor

fact the recent work of the _ challenger _ fully confirm major owen 's statement in the paper recently publish in the proceedings of the royal society -lrb- 8 -rrb- from which a quotation have already be make professor wyville thomson say : -- i have form and express a very strong opinion on the matter it seem to I that the evidence be conclusive that the _ foraminifera _ which form the _ globigerina _ ooze live on the bottom and that the occurrence of individual on the surface be accidental and exceptional but after go into the thing carefully and consider the mass of evidence which have be accumulate by mr murray i now admit that i be in error and i agree with he that it may be take as prove that all the material of such deposit with the exception of course of the remains of animal which we now know to live at the bottom at all depths which occur in the deposit as foreign body be derive from the surface -lrb- footnote 8 : preliminary note on the nature of the sea-bottom procure by the sounding of hm _ challenger _ during she cruise in the southern sea in the early part of the year 1874 -- _ proceedings of the royal society _ nov 26 1874 -rrb- mr murray have combine with a careful examination of the sounding a constant use of the tow-net usually at the surface but also at depths of from ten to one hundred fathom and he find the closest relation to exist between the surface fauna of any particular locality and the deposit which be take place at the bottom in all sea from the equator to the polar ice the tow-net contain _ globigerinoe _ they be more abundant and of a larger size in warmer sea several variety attain a large size and present marked varietal character be find in the intertropical area of the atlantic in the latitude of kerguelen they be less numerous and smaller while further south they be still more dwarf and only one variety the typical _ globigerina bulloide _ be represent the living _ globigerinoe _ from the tow-net be singularly different in appearance from the dead shell we find at the bottom the shell be clear and transparent and each of the pore which penetrate it be surround by a raise crest the crest round adjacent pore coalesce into a roughly hexagonal network so that the pore appear to lie at the bottom of a hexagonal pit at each angle of this hexagon the crest give off a delicate flexible calcareous spine which be sometimes four or five time the diameter of the shell in length the spine radiate symmetrically from the direction of the center of each chamber of the shell and the sheaf of long transparent needle cross one another in different direction have a very beautiful effect the smaller inner chamber of the shell be entirely fill with a orange-yellow granular sarcode and the large terminal chamber usually contain only a small irregular mass or two or three small mass run together of the same yellow sarcode stick against one side the remainder of the chamber be empty no definite arrangement and no approach to structure be observe in the sarcode and no differentiation with the exception of round bright-yellow oil-globule very much like those find in some of the radiolarian which be scatter apparently irregularly in the sarcode we never have be able to detect in any of the large number of _ globigerinoe _ which we have examine the least trace of pseudopodium or any extension in any form of the sarcode beyond the shell \* \* \* \* \* in specimen take with the tow-net the spine be very usually absent but that be probably on account of they extreme tenuity they be break off by the slightest touch in fresh example from the surface the dot indicate the origin of the lose spine may almost always be make out with a high power there be never spine on the _ globigerinoe _ from the bottom even in the shallowest water there can now be no doubt therefore that _ globigerinoe _ live at the top of the sea but the question may still be raise whether they do not also live at the bottom in favor of this view it have be urge that the shell of the _ globigerinoe _ of the surface never possess such thick wall as those which be foul at the bottom but i confess that i doubt the accuracy of this statement again the occurrence of minute _ globigerinoe _ in all stage of development at the greatest depths be bring forward as evidence that they live _ in situ _ but consider the extent to which the surface organism be devour without discrimination of young and old by _ salpoe _ and the like it be not wonderful that shell of all age should be among the rejectamenta nor can the presence of the soft part of the body in the shell which form the _ globigerina _ ooze and the fact if it be one that animal live at the bottom use they as food be consider as conclusive evidence that the _ globigerinoe _ live at the bottom such as die at the surface and even many of those which be swallow by other animal may retain much of they protoplasmic matter when they reach the depths at which the temperature sink to 34  or 32  fahrenheit where decomposition must become exceedingly slow another consideration appear to I to be in favor of the view that the _ globigerinoe _ and they ally be essentially surface animal this be the fact bring out by the _ challenger 's _ work that they have a southern limit of distribution which can hardly depend upon anything but the temperature of the surface water and it be to be remark that this southern limit occur at a lower latitude in the antarctic sea than it do in the north atlantic accord to dr wallich -lrb- the north atlantic sea bed p 157 -rrb- _ globigerina _ be the prevailing form in the deposit between the faroe island and iceland and between iceland and east greenland -- or in other word in a region of the sea-bottom which lie altogether north of the parallel of 60  n while in the southern sea the _ globigerinoe _ become dwarf and almost disappear between 50  and 55  s on the other hand in the sea of kamschatka the _ globigerinoe _ have vanish in 56  n so that the persistence of the _ globigerina _ ooze in high latitudes in the north atlantic would seem to depend on the northward curve of the isothermal peculiar to this region and it be difficult to understand how the formation of _ globigerina _ ooze can be affect by this climatal peculiarity unless it be effect by surface animal whatever may be the mode of life of the _ foraminifera _ to which the calcareous element of the deep-sea chalk owe its existence the fact that it be the chief and most widely spread material of the sea-bottom in the intermediate zone throughout both the atlantic and pacific ocean and the indian ocean at depths from a few hundred to over two thousand fathom be establish but it be not the only extensive deposit which be now take place in 1853 count pourtals a officer of the united state coast survey which have do so much for scientific hydrography observe that the mud form the sea-bottom at depths of one hundred and fifty fathom in 31  32 ' n 79  35 ' w off the coast of florida be a mixture in about equal proportion of _ globigerinoe _ and black sand probably greensand as it make a green mark when crush on paper professor bailey examine these grain microscopically find that they be cast of the interior cavity of _ foraminifera _ consist of a mineral know as _ glauconite _ which be a silicate of iron and alumina in these cast the minutest cavity and finest tube in the foraminifer be sornetilne reproduce in solid counterpart of the glassy mineral while the calcareous original have be entirely dissolve away contemporaneously with these observation the indefatigable ehrenberg have discover that the greensand of the geologist be largely make up of cast of a similar character and prove the existence of _ foraminifera _ at a very ancient geological epoch by discover such cast in a greensand of lower silurian age which occur near st petersburg subsequently messr parker and jone discover similar cast in process of formation the original shell not have disappear in specimen of the sea-bottom of the australian sea bring home by the late professor juke and the _ challenger _ have observe a deposit of a similar character in the course of the agulha current near the cape of good hope and in some other locality not yet define it would appear that this infiltration of _ foraminifera _ shell with _ glauconite _ do not take place at great depths but rather in what may be term a sublittoral region range from a hundred to three hundred fathom it can not be ascribe to any local cause for it take place not only over large area in the gulf of mexico and the coast of florida but in the south atlantic and in the pacific but what be the condition which determine its occurrence and whence the silex the iron and the alumina -lrb- with perhaps potash and some other ingredient in small quantity -rrb- of which the _ glauconite _ be compose proceed be a point on which no light have yet be throw for the present we must be content with the fact that in certain area of the intermediate zone greensand be replace and represent the primitively calcareo - silicious ooze the investigation of the deposit which be now be form in the basin of the mediterranean by the late professor edward forbe by professor williamson and more recently by dr carpenter and a comparison of the result thus obtain with what be know of the surface fauna have bring to light the remarkable fact that while the surface and the shallows abound with _ foraminifera _ and other calcareous shell organism the indication of life become scanty at depths beyond 500 or 600 fathom while almost all trace of it disappear at greater depths and at 1000 to 2000 fathom the bottom be cover with a fine clay dr carpenter have discuss the significance of this remarkable fact and he be dispose to attribute the absence of life at great depths partly to the absence of any circulation of the water of the mediterranean at such depths and partly to the exhaustion of the oxygen of the water by the organic matter contain in the fine clay which he conceive to be form by the finest particle of the mud bring down by the river which flow into the mediterranean however this may be the explanation thus offer of the presence of the fine mud and of the absence of organism which ordinarily live at the bottom do not account for the absence of the skeleton of the organism which undoubtedly abound at the surface of the mediterranean and it would seem to have no application to the remarkable fact discover by the _ challenger _ that in the open atlantic and pacific ocean in the midst of the great intermediate zone and thousand of mile away from the embouchure of any river the sea-bottom at depths approach to and beyond 3000 fathom no longer consist of _ globigerina _ ooze but of a excessively fine red clay professor thomson give the follow account of this capital discovery : -- accord to we present experience the deposit of _ globigerina _ ooze be limit to water of a certain depth the extreme limit of the pure characteristic formation be place at a depth of somewhere about 2250 fathom cross from these shallower region occupy by the ooze into deeper sounding we find universally that the calcareous formation gradually pass into and be finally replace by a extremely fine pure clay which occupy speak generally all depths below 2500 fathom and consist almost entirely of a silicate of the red oxide of iron and alumina the transition be very slow and extend over several hundred fathom of increase depth the shell gradually lose they sharpness of outline and assume a kind of ` rotten ' look and a brownish color and become more and more mixed with a fine amorphous red-brown powder which increase steadily in proportion until the lime have almost entirely disappear this brown matter be in the finest possible state of subdivision so fine that when after sift it to separate any organism it might contain we put it into jar to settle it remain for day in suspension give the water very much the appearance and color of chocolate in indicate the nature of the bottom on the chart we come from experience and without any theoretical consideration to use three term for sounding in deep water two of these gl oz and r cl be very definite and indicate strongly-marked formation with apparently but few character in common but we frequently get sounding which we could not exactly call ' _ globigerina _ ooze ' or ` red clay ' and before we be fully aware of the nature of these we be in the habit of indicate they as ` gray ooze ' -lrb- gr oz -rrb- we now recognize the ` gray ooze ' as a intermediate stage between the _ globigerina _ ooze and the red clay we find that on one side as it be of a ideal line the red clay contain more and more of the material of the calcareous ooze while on the other the ooze be mix with a increase proportion of ` red clay ' although we have meet with the same phenomenon so frequently that we be at length able to predict the nature of the bottom from the depth of the sounding with absolute certainty for the atlantic and the southern sea we have perhaps the best opportunity of observe it in we first section across the atlantic between teneriffe and st thoma the first four station on this section at depths from 1525 to 2220 fathom show _ globigerina _ ooze from the last of these which be about 300 mile from teneriffe the depth gradually increase to 2740 fathom at 500 and 2950 fathom at 750 mile from teneriffe the bottom in these two sounding might have be call ` gray ooze ' for although its nature have alter entirely from the _ globigerina _ ooze the red clay into which it be rapidly pass still contain a considerable admixture of carbonate of lime the depth go on increase to a distance of 1150 mile from teneriffe when it reach 3150 fathom there the clay be pure and smooth and contain scarcely a trace of lime from this great depth the bottom gradually rise and with decrease depth the gray color and the calcareous composition of the ooze return three sounding in 2050 1900 and 1950 fathom on the ` dolphin rise ' give highly characteristic example of the _ globigerina _ formation pass from the middle plateau of the atlantic into the western trough with depths a little over 3000 fathom the red clay return in all its purity and we last sound in 1420 fathom before reach sombrero restore the _ globigerina _ ooze with its peculiar associate fauna this section show also the wide extension and the vast geological importance of the red clay formation the total distance from teneriffe to sombrero be about 2700 mile proceed from east to west we have -- about 80 mile of volcanic mud and sand 350 _ globigerina _ ooze 1050 red clay 330 _ globigerina _ ooze 850 red clay 40 _ globigerina _ ooze give a total of 1900 mile of red clay to 720 mile of _ globigerina _ ooze the nature and origin of this vast deposit of clay be a question of the very greatest interest and although i think there can be no doubt that it be in the main solve yet some matter of detail be still involve in difficulty my first impression be that it might be the most minutely divide material the ultimate sediment produce by the disintegration of the land by river and by the action of the sea on expose coast and hold in suspension and distribute by ocean current and only make itself manifest in place unoccupied by the _ globigerina _ ooze several circumstance seem however to negative this mode of origin the formation seem too uniform : wherever we meet with it it have the same character and it only vary in composition in contain less or more carbonate of lime again the be gradually become more and more convinced that all the important element of the _ globigerina _ ooze live on the surface and it seem evident that so long as the condition on the surface remain the same no alteration of contour at the bottom could possibly prevent its accumulation and the surface condition in the mid-atlantic be very uniform a moderate current of a very equal temperature pass continuously over elevation and depression and everywhere yield to the tow-net the ooze-forming _ foraminifera _ in the same proportion the mid-atlantic swarm with pelagic _ mollusca _ and in moderate depths the shell of these be constantly mix with the _ globigerina _ ooze sometimes in number sufficient to make up a considerable portion of its bulk it be clear that these shell must fall in equal number upon the red clay but scarcely a trace of one of they be ever bring up by the dredge on the red clay area it might be possible to explain the absence of shell-secreting animal live on the bottom on the supposition that the nature of the deposit be injurious to they but then the idea of a current sufficiently strong to sweep they away be negative by the extreme fineness of the sediment which be be lay down the absence of surface shell appear to be intelligible only on the supposition that they be in some way remove we conclude therefore that the ` red clay ' be not a additional substance introduce from without and occupy certain depressed region on account of some law regulate its deposition but that it be produce by the removal by some means or other over these area of the carbonate of lime which form probably about 98 per cent of the material of the _ globigerina _ ooze we can trace indeed every successive stage in the removal of the carbonate of lime in descend the slope of the ridge or plateau where the _ globigerina _ ooze be form to the region of the clay we find first that the shell of pteropod and other surface _ mollusca _ which be constantly fall on the bottom be absent or if a few remain they be brittle and yellow and evidently decay rapidly these shell of _ mollusca _ decompose more easily and disappear sooner than the smaller and apparently more delicate shell of rhizopod the smaller _ foraminifera _ now give way and be find in lessen proportion to the larger the coccolith first lose they thin outer border and then disappear and the club of the rhabdolith get wear out of shape and be last see under a high power as infinitely minute cylinder scatter over the field the larger _ foraminifera _ be attack and instead of be vividly white and delicately sculpture they become brown and worn and finally they break up each accord to its fashion the chamber-wall of _ globigerina _ fall into wedge-shaped piece which quickly disappear and a thick rough crust break away from the surface of _ orbulina _ leave a thin inner sphere at first beautifully transparent but soon become opaque and crumble away in the meantime the proportion of the amorphous ` red clay ' to the calcareous element of all kind increase until the latter disappear with the exception of a few scattered shell of the larger _ foraminifera _ which be still find even in the most characteristic sample of the ` red clay ' there seem to be no room leave for doubt that the red clay be essentially the insoluble residue the _ ash _ as it be of the calcareous organism which form the _ globigerina _ ooze after the calcareous matter have be by some means remove a ordinary mixture of calcareous _ foraminifera _ with the shell of pteropod form a fair sample of _ globigerina _ ooze from near st thoma be carefully wash and subject by mr buchanan to the action of weak acid and he find that there remain after the carbonate of lime have be remove about 1 per cent of a reddish mud consist of silica alumina and the red oxide of iron this experiment have be frequently repeat with different sample of _ globigerina _ ooze and always with the result that a small proportion of a red sediment remain which possess all the character of the red clay \* \* \* \* \* it seem evident from the observation here record that _ clay _ which we have hitherto look upon as essentially the product of the disintegration of older rock may be under certain circumstance a organic formation like chalk that as a matter of fact a area on the surface of the globe which we have show to be of vast extent although we be still far from have ascertain its limit be be cover by such a deposit at the present day it be impossible to avoid associate such a formation with the fine smooth homogeneous clay and schist poor in fossil but show worm - tube and track and bunch of doubtful branch thing such as oldhamium silicious sponge and thin-shelled peculiar shrimp such formation more or less metamorphose be very familiar especially to the student of palaeozoic geology and they often attain a vast thickness one be incline from the great resemblance between they in composition and in the general character of the include fauna to suspect that these may be organic formation like the modern red clay of the atlantic and southern sea accumulation of the insoluble ash of shell creature the dredging in the red clay on the 13th of march be usually rich the bag contain example those with calcareous shell rather stunt of most of the characteristic deep-water group of the southern sea include _ umbellularium euplectellum pterocrinus brisinga ophioglypha pourtalesium _ and one or two _ mollusca _ this be however very rarely the case generally the red clay be barren or contain only a very small number of form it must be admit that it be very difficult at present to frame any satisfactory explanation of the mode of origin of this singular deposit of red clay i can not say that the theory put forward tentatively and with much reservation by professor thomson that the calcareous matter be dissolve out by the relatively fresh water of the deep current from the antarctic region appear satisfactory to I nor do i see my way to the acceptance of the suggestion of dr carpenter that the red clay be the result of the decomposition of previously-formed greensand at present there be no evidence that greensand cast be ever form at great depths nor have it be prove that _ glauconite _ be decomposable by the agency of water and carbonic acid i think it probable that we shall have to wait some time for a sufficient explanation of the origin of the abyssal red clay no less than for that of the sublittoral greensand in the intermediate zone but the importance of the establishment of the fact that these various deposit be be form in the ocean at the present day remain the same whether its _ rationale _ be understand or not for suppose the globe to be evenly cover with sea to a depth say of a thousand fathom -- then whatever might be the mineral matter compose the sea-bottom little or no deposit would be form upon it the abrade and denude action of water at such a depth be exceedingly slight next imagine sponge _ radiolarium foraminifera _ and diatomaceous plant such as those which now exist in the deep-sea to be introduce : they would be distribute accord to the same law as at present the sponge -lrb- and possibly some of the _ foraminifera _ -rrb- cover the bottom while other _ foraminifera _ with the _ radiolarium _ and _ diatomacea _ would increase and multiply in the surface water in accordance with the exist state of thing the _ radiolarium _ and diatom would have a universal distribution the latter gathering most thickly in the polar region while the _ foraminifera _ would be largely if not exclusively confine to the intermediate zone and as a consequence of this distribution a bed of chalk would begin to form in the intermediate zone while cap of silicious rock would accumulate on the circumpolar region suppose further that a part of the intermediate area be raise to within two or three hundred fathom of the surface -- for anything that we know to the contrary the change of level might determine the substitution of greensand for the chalk while on the other hand if part of the same area be depress to three thousand fathom that change might determine the substitution of a different silicate of alumina and iron -- namely clay -- for the chalk that would otherwise be form if the _ challenger _ hypothesis that the red clay be the residue leave by dissolve _ foraminiferous _ skeleton be correct then all these deposit alike would be directly or indirectly the product of live organism but just as a silicious deposit may be metamorphose into opal or quartzite and chalk into marble so known metamorphic agency may metamorphose clay into schist clay-slate slate gneiss or even granite and thus by the agency of the lowest and simplest of organism we imaginary globe might be cover with stratum of all the chief kind of rock of which the known crust of the earth be compose of indefinite thickness and extent the bearing of the conclusion which be now either establish or highly probable respect the origin of silicious calcareous and clayey rock and they metamorphic derivative upon the archaeology of the earth the elucidation of which be the ultimate object of the geologist be of no small importance a hundred year ago the singular insight of linnaeus enable he to say that fossil be not the child but the parent of rock -lrb- 9 -rrb- and the whole effect of the discovery make since he time have be to compile a larger and larger commentary upon this text it be at present a perfectly tenable hypothesis that all siliceous and calcareous rock be either directly or indirectly derive from material which have at one time or other form part of the organize framework of live organism whether the same generalization may be extend to aluminous rock depend upon the conclusion to be draw from the fact respect the red clay area bring to light by the _ challenger _ if we accept the view take by wyville thomson and he colleague -- that the red clay be the residuum leave after the calcareous matter of the _ globigerinoe _ ooze have be dissolve away -- then clay be as much a product of life as limestone and all know derivative of clay may have form part of animal body -lrb- footnote 9 : petrifica montium calcariorum non filius sed parente sunt cum omni calx oriatur ab animalibus -- _ systema natura _ ed xii t iii p 154 it must be recollect that linnaeus include silex as well as limestone under the name of calx and that he would probably have arrange diatom among animal as part of chaos ehrenberg quote another even more pithy passage which i have not be able to find in any edition of the _ systema _ accessible to I : sic lapide ab animalibus nec vice versa sic rune saxei non primaevus sed tempori filia -rrb- so long as the _ globigerinoe _ actually collect at the surface have not be demonstrate to contain the element of clay the _ challenger _ hypothesis as i may term it must be accept with reserve and provisionally but at present i can not but think that it be more probable than any other suggestion which have be make accept it provisionally we arrive at the remarkable result that all the chief know constituent of the crust of the earth may have form part of live body that they may be the ash of protoplasm that the _ rupe saxei _ be not only _ temporis _ but _ vitae filiae _ and consequently that the time during which life have be active on the globe may be indefinitely greater than the period the commencement of which be mark by the oldest known rock whether fossiliferous or unfossiliferous and thus we be lead to see where the solution of a great problem and apparent paradox of geology may lie satisfactory evidence now exist that some animal in the existing world have be derive by a process of gradual modification from pre-existing form it be undeniable for example that the evidence in favor of the derivation of the horse from the later tertiary _ hipparion _ and that of the _ hipparion _ from _ anchitherium _ be as complete and cogent as such evidence can reasonably be expect to be and the further investigation into the history of the tertiary mammalium be push the greater be the accumulation of evidence have the same tendency so far from palaeontology lending no support to the doctrine of evolution -- as one see constantly assert -- that doctrine if it have no other support would have be irresistibly force upon we by the palaeontological discovery of the last twenty year if however the diverse form of life which now exist have be produce by the modification of previously-existing less divergent form the recent and extinct species take as a whole must fall into series which must converge as we go back in time hence if the period represent by the rock be greater than or co-extensive with that during which life have exist we ought somewhere among the ancient formation to arrive at the point to which all these series converge or from which in other word they have diverge -- the primitive undifferentiated protoplasmic living thing whence the two great series of plant and animal have take they departure but as a matter of fact the amount of convergence of series in relation to the time occupy by the deposition of geological formation be extraordinarily small of all animal the higher _ vertebra _ be the most complex and among these the carnivore and hoofed animal -lrb- _ ungulata _ -rrb- be highly differentiate nevertheless although the different line of modification of the _ carnivora _ and those of the _ ungulata _ respectively approach one another and although each group be represent by less differentiate form in the older tertiary rock than at the present day the oldest tertiary rock do not bring we near the primitive form of either if in the same way the convergence of the varied form of reptile be measure against the time during which they remains be preserve -- which be represent by the whole of the tertiary and mesozoic formation -- the amount of that convergence be far smaller than that of the line of mammal between the present time and the beginning of the tertiary epoch and it be a broad fact that the lower we go in the scale of organization the fewer sign be there of convergence towards the primitive form from whence all must have diverge if evolution be a fact nevertheless that it be a fact in some case be prove and i for one have not the courage to suppose that the mode in which some species have take they origin be different from that in which the rest have originate what then have become of all the marine animal which on the hypothesis of evolution must have exist in myriad in those sea wherein the many thousand foot of cambrian and laurentian rock now devoid or almost devoid of any trace of life be deposit sir charle lyell long ago suggest that the azoic character of these ancient formation might be due to the fact that they have undergo extensive metamorphosis and reader of the principle of geology will be familiar with the ingenious manner in which he contrast the theory of the gnome who be acquaint only with the interior of the earth with those of ordinary philosopher who know only its exterior the metamorphism contemplate by the great modern champion of rational geology be mainly that bring about by the exposure of rock to subterranean heat and where no such heat could be show to have operate he opponent assume that no metamorphosis could have take place but the formation of greensand and still more that of the red clay -lrb- if the _ challenger _ hypothesis be correct -rrb- afford a insight into a new kind of metamorphosis -- not igneous but aqueous -- by which the primitive nature of a deposit may be mask as completely as it can be by the agency of heat and as wyville thomson suggest in the passage i have quote above -lrb- p 17 -rrb- it further enable we to assign a new cause for the occurrence so puzzling hitherto of thousand of foot of unfossiliferous fine-grained schist and slate in the midst of formation deposit in sea which certainly abound in life if the great deposit of red clay now form in the eastern valley of the atlantic be metamorphose into slate and then upheave it would constitute a azoic rock of enormous extent and yet that rock be now form in the midst of a sea which swarm with live being the great majority of which be provide with calcareous or silicious shell and skeleton and therefore be such as up to this time we should have term eminently preservable thus the discovery make by the _ challenger _ expedition like all recent advance in we knowledge of the phenomenon of biology or of the change now be effect in the structure of the surface of the earth be in accordance with and lend strong support to that doctrine of uniformitarianism which fifty year ago be hold only by a small minority of english geologist -- lyell scrope and de la beche -- but now thanks to the long-continued labor of the first two and mainly to those of sir charle lyell have gradually pass from the position of a heresy to that of catholic doctrine apply within the limit of the time register by the known fraction of the crust of the earth i believe that uniformitarianism be unassailable the evidence that in the enormous lapse of time between the deposition of the lowest laurentian stratum and the present day the force which have modify the surface of the crust of the earth be different in kind or greater in the intensity of they action than those which be now occupy in the same work have yet to be produce such evidence as we possess all tend in the contrary direction and be in favor of the same slow and gradual change occur then as now but this conclusion in nowise conflict with the deduction of the physicist from he no less clear and certain datum it may be certain that this globe have cool down from a condition in which life could not have exist it may be certain that in so cool its contracting crust must have undergo sudden convulsion which be to we earthquake as a earthquake be to the vibration cause by the periodical eruption of a geyser but in that case the earth must like other respectable parent have sow she wild oats and get through she turbulent youth before we she child have any knowledge of she so far as the evidence afford by the superficial crust of the earth go the modern geologist can _ ex animo _ repeat the say of hutton we find no vestige of a beginning -- no prospect of a end however he will add with hutton but in thus trace back the natural operation which have succeed each other and mark to we the course of time past we come to a period in which we can not see any further and if he seek to peer into the darkness of this period he will welcome the light proffer by physics and mathematics iv yeast -lrb- 1871 -rrb- it have be know from time immemorial that the sweet liquid which may be obtain by express the juice of the fruit and stem of various plant or by steep malt barley in hot water or by mix honey with water -- be liable to undergo a series of very singular change if freely expose to the air and leave to themselves in warm weather however clear and pellucid the liquid may have be when first prepared however carefully it may have be free by strain and filtration from even the finest visible impurity it will not remain clear after a time it will become cloudy and turbid little bubble will be see rise to the surface and they abundance will increase until the liquid hiss as if it be simmer on the fire by degree some of the solid particle which produce the turbidity of the liquid collect at its surface into a scum which be blow up by the emerge air-bubble into a thick foamy froth another moiety sink to the bottom and accumulate as a muddy sediment or lees when this action have continue with more or less violence for a certain time it gradually moderate the evolution of bubble slacken and finally come to a end scum and lees alike settle at the bottom and the fluid be once more clear and transparent but it have acquire property of which no trace exist in the original liquid instead of be a mere sweet fluid mainly compose of sugar and water the sugar have more or less completely disappear and it have acquire that peculiar smell and taste which we call spirituous instead of be devoid of any obvious effect upon the animal economy it have become possess of a very wonderful influence on the nervous system so that in small dose it exhilarate while in larger it stupefy and may even destroy life moreover if the original fluid be put into a still and heat moderately the first and last product of its distillation be simple water while when the altered fluid be subject to the same process the matter which be first condensed in the receiver be find to be a clear volatile substance which be lighter than water have a pungent taste and smell possess the intoxicating power of the fluid in a eminent degree and take fire the moment it be bring in contact with a flame the alchemist call this volatile liquid which they obtain from wine spirit of wine just as they call hydrochloric acid spirit of salt and as we to this day call refined turpentine spirit of turpentine as the spiritus or breath of a man be think to be the most refined and subtle part of he the intelligent essence of man be also conceive as a sort of breath or spirit and by analogy the most refined essence of anything be call its spirit and thus it have come about that we use the same word for the soul of man and for a glass of gin at the present day however we even more commonly use another name for this peculiar liquid -- namely alcohol and its origin be not less singular the dutch physician van helmont live in the latter part of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth century -- in the transition period between alchemy and chemistry -- and be rather more alchemist than chemist append to he opera omnium publish in 1707 there be a very needful clavi ad obscuriorum sensum referendum in which the follow passage occur -- alcohol -- chymici est liquor aut pulvis summ subtilisatus vocabulo orientalibus quoque cum primis habessinis familiari quibus _ cohol _ speciatim pulverem impalpabilem ex antimonio pro oculis tingendis denotat hodie autem ob analogiam quivi pulvis tenerior ut pulvis oculorum cancri summ subtilisatus _ alcohol _ audit haud aliter ac spiritus rectificatissimus _ alcolisatus _ dicuntur similarly robert boyle speak of a fine powder as alcohol and so late as the middle of the last century the english lexicographer nathan bailey define alcohol as the pure substance of anything separate from the more gross a very fine and impalpable powder or a very pure well-rectified spirit but by the time of the publication of lavoisier 's trait elmentaire de chimie in 1789 the term alcohol alkohol or alkool -lrb- for it be spell in all three way -rrb- which van helmont have apply primarily to a fine powder and only secondarily to spirit of wine have lose its primary meaning altogether and from the end of the last century until now it have i believe be use exclusively as the denotation of spirit of wine and body chemically ally to that substance the process which give rise to alcohol in a saccharine fluid be know tone as fermentation a term base upon the apparent boil up or effervescence of the ferment liquid and of latin origin we teutonic cousin call the same process ghren gsen gschen and gischen but oddly enough we do not seem to have retain they verb or they substantive denote the action itself though we do use name identical with or plainly derive from theirs for the scum and lees these be call in low german gscht and gischt in anglo - saxon gest gist and yst whence we yeast again in low german and in anglo-saxon there be another name for yeast have the form barm or beorm and in the midland county barm be the name by which yeast be still best know in high german there be a third name for yeast hefe which be not represent in english so far as i know all these word be say by philologer to be derive from root expressive of the intestine motion of a ferment substance thus hefe be derive from heben to raise barm from beren or bren to bear up yeast yst and gist have all to do with seething and foam with yeasty wave and gusty breeze the same reference to the swell up of the ferment substance be see in the gallo-latin term levure and leaven it be highly creditable to the ingenuity of we ancestor that the peculiar property of fermented liquid in virtue of which they make glad the heart of man seem to have be know in the remotest period of which we have any record all savage take to alcoholic fluid as if they be to the manner bear we vedic forefather intoxicate themselves with the juice of the soma noah by a not unnatural reaction against a superfluity of water appear to have take the earliest practicable opportunity of qualify that which he be oblige to drink and the ghost of the ancient egyptian be solace by picture of banquet in which the wine-cup pass round graven on the wall of they tomb a knowledge of the process of fermentation therefore be in all probability possess by the prehistoric population of the globe and it must have become a matter of great interest even to primaeval wine-bibber to study the method by which fermented liquid could be surely manufacture no doubt it be soon discover that the most certain as well as the most expeditious way of make a sweet juice ferment be to add to it a little of the scum or lees of another ferment juice and it can hardly be question that this singular excitation of fermentation in one fluid by a sort of infection or inoculation of a little ferment take from some other fluid together with the strange swell foam and hiss of the fermented substance must have always attract attention from the more thoughtful nevertheless the commencement of the scientific analysis of the phenomenon date from a period not earlier than the first half of the seventeenth century at this time van helmont make a first step by point out that the peculiar hissing and bubbling of a fermented liquid be due not to the evolution of common air -lrb- which he as the inventor of the term gas call gas ventosum -rrb- but to that of a peculiar kind of air such as be occasionally meet with in cave mine and well and which he call gas sylvestre but a century elapse before the nature of this gas sylvestre or as it be afterwards call fixed air be clearly determine and it be find to be identical with that deadly choke-damp by which the life of those who descend into old well or mine or brewer ' vat be sometimes suddenly end and with the poisonous ariform fluid which be produce by the combustion of charcoal and now go by the name of carbonic acid gas during the same time it gradually become evident that the presence of sugar be essential to the production of alcohol and the evolution of carbonic acid gas which be the two great and conspicuous product of fermentation and finally in 1787 the italian chemist fabronus make the capital discovery that the yeast ferment the presence of which be necessary to fermentation be what he term a vegeto-animal substance that be a body which give of ammoniacal salt when it be burn and be in other way similar to the gluten of plant and the albumen and casein of animal these discovery prepare the way for the illustrious frenchman lavoisier who first approach the problem of fermentation with a complete conception of the nature of the work to be do the word in which he express this conception in the treatise on elementary chemistry to which reference have already be make mark the year 1789 as the commencement of a revolution of not less moment in the world of science than that which simultaneously burst over the political world and soon engulf lavoisier himself in one of its mad eddy we may lay it down as a incontestable axiom that in all the operation of art and nature nothing be create a equal quantity of matter exist both before and after the experiment : the quality and quantity of the element remain precisely the same and nothing take place beyond change and modification in the combination of these element upon this principle the whole art of perform chemical experiment depend we must always suppose a exact equality between the element of the body examine and those of the product of its analysis hence since from must of grape we procure alcohol and carbonic acid i have a undoubted right to suppose that must consist of carbonic acid and alcohol from these premiss we have two mode of ascertain what pass during vinous fermentation : either by determine the nature of and the element which compose the fermentable substance or by accurately examine the product result from fermentation and it be evident that the knowledge of either of these must lead to accurate conclusion concern the nature and composition of the other from these consideration it become necessary accurately to determine the constituent element of the fermentable substance and for this purpose i do not make use of the compound juice of fruit the rigorous analysis of which be perhaps impossible but make choice of sugar which be easily analyze and the nature of which i have already explain this substance be a true vegetable oxyd with two basis compose of hydrogen and carbon bring to the state of a oxyd by means of a certain proportion of oxygen and these three element be combine in such a way that a very slight force be sufficient to destroy the equilibrium of they connection after give the detail of he analysis of sugar and of the product of fermentation lavoisier continue : -- the effect of the vinous fermentation upon sugar be thus reduce to the mere separation of its element into two portion one part be oxygenate at the expense of the other so as to form carbonic acid while the other part be disoxygenate in favor of the latter be convert into the combustible substance call alkohol therefore if it be possible to re-unite alkohol and carbonic acid together we ought to form sugar -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : _ element of chemistry _ by m lavoisier translate by robert kerr second edition 1793 -lrb- pp 186-196 -rrb- -rrb- thus lavoisier think he have demonstrate that the carbonic acid and the alcohol which be produce by the process of fermentation be equal in weight to the sugar which disappear but the application of the more refined method of modern chemistry to the investigation of the product of fermentation by pasteur in 1860 prove that this be not exactly true and that there be a deficit of from 5 to 7 per cent of the sugar which be not cover by the alcohol and carbonic acid evolve the greater part of this deficit be account for by the discovery of two substance glycerine and succinic acid of the existence of which lavoisier be unaware in the fermented liquid but about 1-1\/2 per cent still remain to be make good accord to pasteur it have be appropriate by the yeast but the fact that such appropriation take place can not be say to be actually prove however this may be there can be no doubt that the constituent element of fully 98 per cent of the sugar which have vanish during fermentation have simply undergo rearrangement like the soldier of a brigade who at the word of command divide themselves into the independent regiment to which they belong the brigade be sugar the regiment be carbonic acid succinic acid alcohol and glycerine from the time of fabronus onward it have be admit that the agent by which this surprising rearrangement of the particle of the sugar be effect be the yeast but the first thoroughly conclusive evidence of the necessity of yeast for the fermentation of sugar be furnish by appert whose method of preserve perishable article of food excite so much attention in france at the beginning of this century gay-lussac in he mmoire sur la fermentation -lrb- 2 -rrb- allude to appert 's method of preserve beer-wort unfermented for a indefinite time by simply boil the wort and close the vessel in which the boiling fluid be contain in such a way as thoroughly to exclude air and he show that if a little yeast be introduce into such wort after it have cool the wort at once begin to ferment even though every precaution be take to exclude air and this statement have since receive full confirmation from pasteur -lrb- footnote 2 : _ annale de chimie _ 1810 -rrb- on the other hand schwann schroeder and dutch and pasteur have amply prove that air may be allow to have free access to beer-wort without exciting fermentation if only efficient precaution be take to prevent the entry of particle of yeast along with the air thus the truth that the fermentation of a simple solution of sugar in water depend upon the presence of yeast rest upon a unassailable foundation and the inquiry into the exact nature of the substance which possess such a wonderful chemical influence become profoundly interesting the first step towards the solution of this problem be make two century ago by the patient and painstaking dutch naturalist leeuwenhoek who in the year 1680 write thus : -- saepissime examinavus fermnentum cerevisiae semperque hoc ex globulis per materiam pellucidam fluitantibus quarm cerevisiam esse censuus constare observavus : vidi etiam evidentissime unumquemque hujus fermentus globulum denuo ex sex distincti globuli constare accurate eidem quantitate et formae cui globulis sanguinis nostri respondentibus verum talis mihi de horum origine et formatione conceptus formabam globuli nempe ex quibus farina tritici hordei avenae fagotritici se constat aquae calore dissolvi et aquae commisceri hac vero aqua quam cerevisiam vocare licet refrigescente multo ex minimis particulis in cerevisium coadunarus et hoc pacto efficere particulam sive globulum quae sexta pars est globuli faecis et iterum sex ex hisce globulis conjungus -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : leeuwenhoek _ arcana natura detecta _ ed nov 1721 -rrb- thus leeuwenhoek discover that yeast consist of globule float in a fluid but he think that they be merely the starchy particle of the grain from which the wort be make rearrange he discover the fact that yeast have a definite structure but not the meaning of the fact a century and a half elapse and the investigation of yeast be recommence almost simultaneously by cagniard de la tour in france and by schwann and ktzing in germany the french observer be the first to publish he result and the subject receive at he hand and at those of he colleague the botanist turpin full and satisfactory investigation the main conclusion at which they arrive be these the globular or oval corpuscle which float so thickly in the yeast as to make it muddy though the largest be not more than one two-thousandth of a inch in diameter and the smallest may measure less than one seven-thousandth of a inch be live organism they multiply with great rapidity by give off minute bud which soon attain the size of they parent and then either become detach or remain united form the compound globule of which leeuwenhoek speak though the constancy of they arrangement in six exist only in the worthy dutchman 's imagination it be very soon make out that these yeast organism to which turpin give the name of _ torulum cerevisioe _ be more nearly ally to the lower fungus than to anything else indeed turpin and subsequently berkeley and hoffmann believe that they have trace the development of the _ torulum _ into the well-known and very common mould -- the _ penicillium glaucum _ other observer have not succeed in verify these statement and my own observation lead I to believe that while the connection between _ torulum _ and the mould be a very close one it be of a different nature from that which have be suppose i have never be able to trace the development of _ torulum _ into a true mould but it be quite easy to prove that species of true mould such as _ penicillium _ when sow in a appropriate nidus such as a solution of tartrate of ammonia and yeast-ash in water with or without sugar give rise to _ toruloe _ similar in all respects to _ t cerevisioe _ except that they be on the average smaller moreover bail have observe the development of a _ torulum _ larger than _ t cerevisioe _ from a _ mucor _ a mould ally to _ penicillium _ it follow therefore that the _ toruloe _ or organism of yeast be veritable plant and conclusive experiment have prove that the power which cause the rearrangement of the molecule of the sugar be intimately connect with the life and growth of the plant in fact whatever arrest the vital activity of the plant also prevent it from exciting fermentation such be the fact with regard to the nature of yeast and the change which it effect in sugar how be they to be account for before modern chemistry have come into existence stahl stumble with the stride of genius upon the conception which lie at the bottom of all modern view of the process put forward the notion that the ferment be in a state of internal motion communicate that motion to the sugar and thus cause its resolution into new substance and lavoisier as we have see adopt substantially the same view but fabronus full of the then novel conception of acid and basis and double decomposition propound the hypothesis that sugar be a oxide with two basis and the ferment a carbonate with two basis that the carbon of the ferment unite with the oxygen of the sugar and give rise to carbonic acid while the sugar unite with the nitrogen of the ferment produce a new substance analogous to opium this be decompose by distillation and give rise to alcohol next in 1803 thnard propound a hypothesis which partake somewhat of the nature of both stahl 's and fabronus 's view i do not believe with lavoisier he say that all the carbonic acid form proceeds from the sugar how in that case could we conceive the action of the ferment on it i think that the first portion of the acid be due to a combination of the carbon of the ferment with the oxygen of the sugar and that it be by carry off a portion of oxygen from the last that the ferment cause the fermentation to commence -- the equilibrium between the principle of the sugar be disturb they combine afresh to form carbonic acid and alcohol the three view here before we may be familiarly exemplify by suppose the sugar to be a card-house accord to stahl the ferment be somebody who knock the table and shake the card-house down accord to fabroni the ferment take out some card but put other in they place accord to thnard the ferment simply take a card out of the bottom story the result of which be that all the other fall as chemistry advance fact come to light which put a new face upon stahl 's hypothesis and give it a safer foundation than it previously possess the general nature of these phenomenon may be thus state : -- a body a without give to or take from another body b any material particle cause b to decompose into other substance c d e the sum of the weight of which be equal to the weight of b which decompose thus bitter almond contain two substance amygdalin and synaptase which can be extract in a separate state from the bitter almond the amygdalin thus obtain if dissolve in water undergo no change but if a little synaptase be add to the solution the amygdalin split up into bitter almond oil prussic acid and a kind of sugar a short time after cagniard de la tour discover the yeast plant liebig strike with the similarity between this and other such process and the fermentation of sugar put forward the hypothesis that yeast contain a substance which act upon sugar as synaptase act upon amygdalin and as the synaptase be certainly neither organize nor alive but a mere chemical substance liebig treat cagniard de la tour 's discovery with no small contempt and from that time to the present have steadily repudiate the notion that the decomposition of the sugar be in any sense the result of the vital activity of the _ torulum _ but though the notion that the _ torulum _ be a creature which eat sugar and excrete carbonic acid and alcohol which be not unjustly ridicule in the most surprising paper that ever make its appearance in a grave scientific journal -lrb- 4 -rrb- may be untenable the fact that the _ toruloe _ be alive and that yeast do not excite fermentation unless it contain live _ toruloe _ stand fast moreover of late year the essential participation of live organism in fermentation other than the alcoholic have be clearly make out by pasteur and other chemist -lrb- footnote 4 : das entrthselte geheimniss der geistigen ghrung -lrb- vorlnfige briefliche mittheilung -rrb- be the title of a anonymous contribution to whler and liebig 's _ annalen der pharmacie _ for 1839 in which a somewhat rabelaisian imaginary description of the organization of the yeast animal and of the manner in which they function be perform be give with a circumstantiality worthy of the author of _ gulliver 's travels _ as a specimen of the writer 's humor he account of what happen when fermentation come to a end may suffice sobald nmlich die thiere keinen zucker mehr vorfinden so fressen sie sich gegenseitig selbst auf be durch eine eigene manipulation geschieht alle wird verdant bis auf die eier welche unverndert durch den darmkanal hineingehen man hat zuletzt wieder ghrungsfhige hefe nmlich den saamen der thiere der brig bleibt -rrb- however it may be ask be there any necessary opposition between the so-called vital and the strictly physico-chemical view of fermentation it be quite possible that the living _ torulum _ may excite fermentation in sugar because it constantly produce as a essential part of its vital manifestation some substance which act upon the sugar just as the synaptase act upon the amygdalin or it may be that without the formation of any such special substance the physical condition of the living tissue of the yeast plant be sufficient to effect that small disturbance of the equilibrium of the particle of the sugar which lavoisier think sufficient to effect its decomposition platinum in a very fine state of division -- know as platinum black or _ noir de platine _ -- have the very singular property of cause alcohol to change into acetic acid with great rapidity the vinegar plant which be closely ally to the yeast plant have a similar effect upon dilute alcohol cause it to absorb the oxygen of the air and become convert into vinegar and liebig 's eminent opponent pasteur who have do so much for the theory and the practice of vinegar-making himself suggest that in this case -- la cause du phnomne physique quus accompagne la vie de la plante rside dans un tat physique propre analog  celuus du noir de platine mais il est essentiel de remarquer que cet tat physique de la plante est troitement li avec la vie de cette plante -lrb- 5 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : _ etude sur les mycodermes _ comptes-rendus liv 1862 -rrb- now if the vinegar plant give rise to the oxidation of alcohol on account of its merely physical constitution it be at any rate possible that the physical constitution of the yeast plant may exert a decomposing influence on sugar but without presume to discuss a question which lead we into the very arcana of chemistry the present state of speculation upon the _ modus operandus _ of the yeast plant in produce fermentation be represent on the one hand by the stahlian doctrine support by liebig accord to which the atom of the sugar be shake into new combination either directly by the _ toruloe _ or indirectly by some substance form by they and on the other hand by the thnardian doctrine support by pasteur accord to which the yeast plant assimilate part of the sugar and in so do disturb the rest and determine its resolution into the product of fermentation perhaps the two view be not so much oppose as they seem at first sight to be but the interest which attach to the influence of the yeast plant upon the medium in which they live and grow do not arise solely from its bearing upon the theory of fermentation so long ago as 1838 turpin compare the _ toruloe _ to the ultimate element of the tissue of animal and plant -- les organes lmentaires de leurs tissus comparable aux petits vgtaux des levures ordinaires sont aussi les dcompositeurs des substance qui les environnent almost at the same time and probably equally guide by he study of yeast schwann be engage in those remarkable investigation into the form and development of the ultimate structural element of the tissue of animal which lead he to recognize they fundamental identity with the ultimate structural element of vegetable organism the yeast plant be a mere sac or cell contain a semi-fluid matter and schwann 's microscopic analysis resolve all live organism in the long run into a aggregation of such sac or cell variously modify and tend to show that all whatever they ultimate complication begin they existence in the condition of such simple cell in he famous mikroskopische untersuchungen schwann speak of _ torulum _ as a cell and in a remarkable note to the passage in which he refer to the yeast plant schwann say : -- i have be unable to avoid mention fermentation because it be the most fully and exactly know operation of cell and represent in the simplest fashion the process which be repeat by every cell of the living body in other word schwann conceive that every cell of the living body exert a influence on the matter which surround and permeate it analogous to that which a _ torulum _ exert on the saccharine solution by which it be bath a wonderfully suggestive thought open up view of the nature of the chemical process of the living body which have hardly yet receive all the development of which they be capable kant define the special peculiarity of the living body to be that the part exist for the sake of the whole and the whole for the sake of the part but when turpin and schwann resolve the living body into a aggregation of quasi-independent cell each like a _ torulum _ lead its own life and have its own law of growth and development the aggregation be dominate and keep work towards a definite end only by a certain harmony among these unit or by the superaddition of a control apparatus such as a nervous system this conception cease to be tenable the cell live for its own sake as well as for the sake of the whole organism and the cell which float in the blood live at its expense and profoundly modify it be almost as much independent organism as the _ toruloe _ which float in beer-wort schwann burden he enunciation of the cell theory with two false supposition the one that the structure he call nucleus -lrb- 6 -rrb- and cell-wall be essential to a cell the other that cell be usually form independently of other cell but in 1839 it be a vast and clear gain to arrive at the conception that the vital function of all the higher animal and plant be the resultant of the force inherent in the innumerable minute cell of which they be compose and that each of they be itself a equivalent of one of the lowest and simplest of independent living being -- the _ torulum _ -lrb- footnote 6 : later investigation have throw a entirely new light upon the structure and the functional importance of the nucleus and have prove that schwann do not over-estimate its importance 1894 -rrb- from purely morphological investigation turpin and schwann as we have see arrive at the notion of the fundamental unity of structure of live being and before long the research of chemist gradually lead up to the conception of the fundamental unity of they composition so far back as 1803 thnard point out in most distinct term the important fact that yeast contain a nitrogenous animal substance and that such a substance be contain in all ferment before he fabronus and fourcroy speak of the vegeto-animal matter of yeast in 1844 mulder endeavor to demonstrate that a peculiar substance which he call protein be essentially characteristic of live matter in 1846 payen write : -- enfin une lous san exception I semble apparatre dans les faits nombreux que j' be observs et conduire  envisager sous un nouveau jour

protoplasm as a name for one portion of those nitrogenous contents of the cell of live plant the close chemical resemblance of which to the essential constituent of live animal be so strongly indicate by payen and through the twenty-five year that have pass since the matter of life be first call protoplasm a host of investigator among whom cohn max schulze and khne must be name as leader have accumulate evidence morphological physiological and chemical in favor of that immense unit de composition lmentaire dans tous les corps vivants de la nature into which payen have so early a clear insight as far back as 1850 cohn write apparently without any knowledge of what payen have say before he : -- the protoplasm of the botanist and the contractile substance and sarcode of the zoologist must be if not identical yet in a high degree analogous substance hence from this point of view the difference between animal and plant consist in this that in the latter the contractile substance as a primordial utricle be enclose within a inert cellulose membrane which permit it only to exhibit a internal motion express by the phenomenon of rotation and circulation while in the former it be not so enclose the protoplasm in the form of the primordial utricle be as it be the animal element in the plant but which be imprison and only become free in the animal or to strip off the metaphor which obscure simple think the energy of organic vitality which be manifest in movement be especially exhibit by a nitrogenous contractile substance which in plant be limit and fetter by a inert membrane in animal not so -lrb- 8 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 8 : cohn ueber protococcus pluviali in the _ nova acta _ for 1850 -rrb- in 1868 think that a untechnical statement of the view current among the leader of biological science might be interesting to the general public i give a lecture embody they in edinburgh those who have not make the mistake of attempt to approach biology either by the high _  priori _ road of mere philosophical speculation or by the mere low _  posteriorus _ lane offer by the tube of a microscope but have take the trouble to become acquaint with well-ascertained fact and with they history will not need to be tell that in what i have to say as regard protoplasm in my lecture on the physical basis of life -lrb- vol i of these essay p 130 -rrb- there be nothing new and as i hope nothing that the present state of knowledge do not justify we in believe to be true under these circumstance my surprise may be imagine when i find that the mere statement of fact and of view long familiar to I as part of the common scientific property of continental worker raise a sort of storm in this country not only by exciting the wrath of unscientific person whose pet prejudice they seem to touch but by give rise to quite superfluous explosion on the part of some who should have be better inform dr stirl for example make my essay the subject of a special critical lecture -lrb- 9 -rrb- which i have read with much interest though i confess the meaning of much of it remain as dark to I as do the secret of hegel after dr stirling 's elaborate revelation of it dr stirling 's method of deal with the subject be peculiar protoplasm be a question of history so far as it be a name of fact so far as it be a thing dr stirling have not take the trouble to refer to the original authority for he history which be consequently a travesty and still less have he concern himself with look at the fact but contents himself with take they also at second-hand a most amusing example of this fashion of deal with scientific statement be furnish by dr stirling 's remark upon my account of the protoplasm of the nettle hair that account be draw up from careful and often - repeat observation of the fact dr stirl think he be offer a valid criticism when he say that my value friend professor stricker give a somewhat different statement about protoplasm but why in the world do not this distinguished hegelian look at a nettle hair for himself before venture to speak about the matter at all why trouble himself about what either stricker or i say when any tyro can see the fact for himself if he be provide with those not rare article a nettle and a microscope but i suppose this would have be _ aufklrung _ -- a recurrence to the base common-sense philosophy of the eighteenth century which like to see before it believe and to understand before it criticise dr stirl wind up he paper with the follow paragraph : -- -lrb- footnote 9 : subsequently publish under the title of as regard protoplasm -rrb- in short the whole position of mr huxley -lrb- 1 -rrb- that all organism consist alike of the same life-matter -lrb- 2 -rrb- which life-matter be for its part due only to chemistry must be pronounced untenable -- nor less untenable -lrb- 3 -rrb- the materialism he would find on it the paragraph contain three distinct assertion concern my view and just the same number of utter misrepresentation of they that which i have number -lrb- 1 -rrb- turn on the ambiguity of the word same for a discussion of which i would refer dr stirl to a great hero of _ aufklrung _ archbishop whately statement number -lrb- 2 -rrb- be in my judgment absurd and certainly i have never say anything resemble it while as to number -lrb- 3 -rrb- one great object of my essay be to show that what be call materialism have no sound philosophical basis as we have see the study of yeast have lead investigator face to face with problem of immense interest in pure chemistry and in animal and vegetable morphology its physiology be not less rich in subject for inquiry take for example the singular fact that yeast will increase indefinitely when grow in the dark in water contain only tartrate of ammonia a small percentage of mineral salt and sugar out of these material the _ toruloe _ will manufacture nitrogenous protoplasm cellulose and fatty matter in any quantity although they be wholly deprive of those ray of the sun the influence of which be essential to the growth of ordinary plant there have be a great deal of speculation lately as to how the living organism bury beneath two or three thousand fathom of water and therefore in all probability almost deprive of light live if any of they possess the same power as yeast -lrb- and the same capacity for live without light be exhibit by some other fungus -rrb- there would seem to be no difficulty about the matter of the pathological bearing of the study of yeast and other such organism i have speak elsewhere it be certain that in some animal devastate epidemic be cause by fungus of low order -- similar to those of which _ torulum _ be a sort of offshoot it be certain that such disease be propagate by contagion and infection in just the same way as ordinary contagious and infectious disease be propagate of course it do not follow from this that all contagious and infectious disease be cause by organism of as definite and independent a character as the _ torulum _ but i think it do follow that it be prudent and wise to satisfy one 's self in each particular case that the germ theory can not and will not explain the fact before have recourse to hypothesis which have no equal support from analogy v on the formation of coal -lrb- 1870 -rrb- the lump of coal in a coal-scuttle very often have a roughly cubical form if one of they be pick out and examine with a little care it will be find that its six side be not exactly alike two opposite side be comparatively smooth and shine while the other four be much rougher and be mark by line which run parallel with the smooth side the coal readily split along these line and the split surface thus form be parallel with the smooth face in other word there be a sort of rough and incomplete stratification in the lump of coal as if it be a book the leaf of which have stick together very closely sometimes the face along which the coal split be not smooth but exhibit a thin layer of dull charred-looking substance which be know as mineral charcoal occasionally one of the face of a lump of coal will present impression which be obviously those of the stem or leaf of a plant but though hard mineral mass of pyrites and even fine mud may occur here and there neither sand nor pebble be meet with when the coal burn the chief ultimate product of its combustion be carbonic acid water and ammoniacal product which escape up the chimney and a greater or less amount of residual earthy salt which take the form of ash these product be to a great extent such as would result from the burning of so much wood these property of coal may be make out without any very refined appliance but the microscope reveal something more black and opaque as ordinary coal be slice of it become transparent if they be cement in canada balsam and rub down very thin in the ordinary way of make thin section of non-transparent body but as the thin slice make in this way be very apt to crack and break into fragment it be better to employ marine glue as the cement material by the use of this substance slice of considerable size and of extreme thinness and transparency may be obtain -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : my assistant in the museum of practical geology mr newton invent this excellent method of obtain thin slice of coal -rrb- now let we suppose two such slice to be prepare from we lump of coal -- one parallel with the bedding the other perpendicular to it and let we call the one the horizontal and the other the vertical section the horizontal section will present more or less round yellow patch and streak scatter irregularly through the dark brown or blackish ground substance while the vertical section will exhibit mere elongate bar and granule of the same yellow material dispose in line which correspond roughly with the general direction of the bedding of the coal this be the microscopic structure of a ordinary piece of coal but if a great series of coal from different locality and seam or even from different part of the same seam be examine this structure will be find to vary in two direction in the anthracitic or stone-coal which burn like coke the yellow matter diminish and the ground substance become more predominant blacker and more opaque until it become impossible to grind a section thin enough to be translucent while on the other hand in such as the better-bed coal of the neighborhood of bradford which burn with much flame the coal be of a far lighter color and transparent section be very easily obtain in the browner part of this coal sharp eye will readily detect multitude of curious little coin-shaped body of a yellowish brown color embed in the dark brown ground substance on the average these little brown body may have a diameter of about one-twentieth of a inch they lie with they flat surface nearly parallel with the two smooth face of the block in which they be contain and on one side of each there may be discern a figure consist of three straight linear mark which radiate from the center of the disk but do not quite reach its circumference in the horizontal section these disk be often convert into more or less complete ring while in the vertical section they appear like thick hoop the side of which have be press together the disk be therefore flatten bag and favourable section show that the three-rayed mark be the expression of three cleft which penetrate one wall of the bag the side of the bag be sometimes closely approximate but when the bag be less flatten they cavity be usually fill with numerous irregularly round hollow body have the same kind of wall as the large one but not more than one seven-hundredth of a inch in diameter in favourable specimen again almost the whole ground substance appear to be make up of similar body -- more or less carbonized or blacken -- and in these there can be no doubt that with the exception of patch of mineral charcoal here and there the whole mass of the coal be make up of a accumulation of the larger and of the smaller sac but in one and the same slice every transition can be observe from this structure to that which have be describe as characteristic of ordinary coal the latter appear to rise out of the former by the breaking-up and increase carbonization of the larger and the smaller sac and in the anthracitic coal this process appear to have go to such a length as to destroy the original structure altogether and to replace it by a completely carbonize substance thus coal may be say speaking broadly to be compose of two constituent : firstly mineral charcoal and secondly coal proper the nature of the mineral charcoal have long since be determine its structure show it to consist of the remains of the stem and leave of plant reduce a little more than they carbon again some of the coal be make up of the crushed and flatten bark or outer coat of the stem of plant the inner wood of which have completely decay away but what i may term the saccular matter of the coal which either in its primary or in its degraded form constitute by far the greater part of all the bituminous coal i have examine be certainly not mineral charcoal nor be its structure that of any stem or leaf hence its real nature be at first by no means apparent and have be the subject of much discussion the first person who throw any light upon the problem as far as i have be able to discover be the well-known geologist professor morri it be now thirty-four year since he carefully describe and figure the coin-shaped body or larger sac as i have call they in a note append to the famous paper on the coalbrookdale coal-field publish at that time by the present president of the geological society mr prestwich with much sagacity professor morri divine the real nature of these body and boldly affirm they to be the spore-case of a plant ally to the living club-moss but discovery sometimes make a long halt and it be only a few year since mr carruther determine the plant -lrb- or rather one of the plant -rrb- which produce these spore-case by find the discoidal sac still adherent to the leaf of the fossilized cone which produce they he give the name of _ flemingite gracili _ to the plant of which the cone form a part the branch and stem of this plant be not yet certainly know but there be no sort of doubt that it be closely ally to the _ lepidodendron _ the remains of which abound in the coal formation the _ lepidodendra _ be shrub and tree which put one more in mind of a _ araucarium _ than of any other familiar plant and the end of the fruiting branch be terminate by cone or catkin somewhat like the body so name in a fir or a willow these conical fruit however do not produce seed but the leaf of which they be compose bear upon they surface sac full of spore or sporangium such as those one see on the under surface of a bracken leaf now it be these sporangium of the lepidodendroid plant _ flemingite _ which be identify by mr carruther with the free sporangium describe by professor morri which be the same as the large sac of which i have speak and more than this there be no doubt that the small sac be the spore which be originally contain in the sporangium the living club-moss be for the most part insignificant and creep herb which superficially very closely resemble true moss and none of they reach more than two or three foot in height but in they essential structure they very closely resemble the earliest lepidodendroid tree of the coal : they stem and leave be similar so be they cone and no less like be the sporangium and spore while even in they size the spore of the _ lepidodendron _ and those of the exist _ lycopodium _ or club-moss very closely approach one another thus the singular conclusion be force upon we that the greater and the smaller sac of the better-bed and other coal in which the primitive structure be well preserve be simply the sporangium and spore of certain plant many of which be closely ally to the exist club - moss and if as i believe it can be demonstrate that ordinary coal be nothing but saccular coal which have undergo a certain amount of that alteration which if continue would convert it into anthracite then the conclusion be obvious that the great mass of the coal we burn be the result of the accumulation of the spore and spore-case of plant other part of which have furnish the carbonized stem and the mineral charcoal or have leave they impression on the surface of the layer of the multitudinous speculation which at various time have be entertain respect the origin and mode of formation of coal several appear to be negatived and put out of court by the structural fact the significance of which i have endeavor to explain these fact for example do not permit we to suppose that coal be a accumulation of peaty matter as some have hold again the late professor quekett be one of the first observer who give a correct description of what i have term the saccular structure of coal and rightly perceive that this structure be something quite different from that of any known plant he imagine that it proceed from some extinct vegetable organism which be peculiarly abundant amongst the coal-forming plant but this explanation be at once show to be untenable when the smaller and the larger sac be prove to be spore or sporangia some once more have imagine that coal be of submarine origin and though the notion be amply and easily refute by other consideration it may be worth while to remark that it be impossible to comprehend how a mass of light and resinous spore should have reach the bottom of the sea or should have stop in that position if they have get there at the same time it be proper to remark that i do not presume to suggest that all coal must need have the same structure or that there may not be coal in which the proportion of wood and spore or spore-case be very different from those which i have examine all i repeat be that none of the coal which have come under my notice have enable I to observe such a difference but accord to principal dawson who have so sedulously examine the fossil remains of plant in north america it be otherwise with the vast accumulation of coal in that country the true coal say dr dawson consist principally of the flatten bark of sigillarioid and other tree intermix with leaf of fern and _ cordaite _ and other herbaceous _ dbris _ and with fragment of decayed wood constitute ` mineral charcoal ' all these material have manifestly alike grow and accumulate where we find they -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ acadian geology _ 2nd edition p 135 -rrb- when i have the pleasure of see principal dawson in london last summer i show he my section of coal and beg he to re-examine some of the american coal on he return to canada with a eye to the presence of spore and sporangium such as i be able to show he in we english and scotch coal he have be good enough to do so and in a letter dated September 26th 1870 he inform I that -- indication of spore-case be rare except in certain coarse shaly coal and portion of coal and in the roof of the seam the most marked case i have yet meet with be the shaly coal refer to as contain _ sporangite _ in my paper on the condition of accumulation of coal -lrb- journal of the geological society vol xxii pp 115 139 and 165 -rrb- the purer coal certainly consist principally of cubical tissue with some true woody matter and the spore-case & c be chiefly in the coarse and shaly layer this be my old doctrine in my two papers in the journal of the geological society and i see nothing to modify it you observation however make it probable that the frequent _ clear spot _ in the cannel be spore-cases dr dawson 's result be the more remarkable as the numerous specimen of british coal from various locality which i have examine tell one tale as to the predominance of the spore and sporangium element in they composition and as it be exactly in the finest and purest coal such as the better-bed coal of lowmoor that the spore and sporangium obviously constitute almost the entire mass of the deposit coal such as that which have be describe be always find in sheet or seam vary from a fraction of a inch to many foot in thickness enclose in the substance of the earth at very various depths between bed of rock of different kind as a rule every seam of coal rest upon a thicker or thinner bed of clay which be know as under-clay these alternation of bed of coal clay and rock may be repeat many time and be know as the coal-measure and in some region as in south wale and in nova scotium the coal-measure attain a thickness of twelve or fourteen thousand foot and enclose eighty or a hundred seam of coal each with its under-clay and separate from those above and below by bed of sandstone and shale the position of the bed which constitute the coal-measure be infinitely diverse sometimes they be tilted up vertically sometimes they be horizontal sometimes curve into great basin sometimes they come to the surface sometimes they be cover up by thousand of foot of rock but whatever they present position there be abundant and conclusive evidence that every under-clay be once a surface soil not only do carbonized root-fibre frequently abound in these under-clay but the stool of tree the trunk of which be break off and confound with the bed of coal have be repeatedly find pass into radiate root still embed in the under-clay on many part of the coast of england what be commonly know as submarine forest be to be see at low water they consist for the most part of short stool of oak beech and fir-tree still fix by they long root in the bed of blue clay in which they originally grow if one of these submarine forest bed should be gradually depressed and cover up by new deposit it would present just the same character as a under-clay of the coal if the _ sigillarium _ and _ lepidodendron _ of the ancient world be substitute for the oak or the beech of we own time in a tropical forest at the present day the trunk of fall tree and the stool of such tree as may have be break by the violence of storm remain entire for but a short time contrary to what might be expect the dense wood of the tree decay and suffer from the ravages of insect more swiftly than the bark and the traveller set he foot on a prostrate trunk find that it be a mere shell which break under he weight and land he foot amidst the insect or the reptile which have seek food or refuge within the tree of the coal forest present parallel condition when the fall trunk which have enter into the composition of the bed of coal be identifiable they be mere double shell of bark flatten together in consequence of the destruction of the woody core and sir charle lyell and principal dawson discover in the hollow stool of coal tree of nova scotium the remains of snail millipede and salamander-like creature embed in a deposit of a different character from that which surround the exterior of the tree thus in endeavor to comprehend the formation of a seam of coal we must try to picture to ourselves a thick forest form for the most part of tree like gigantic club - moss mare ' - tail and tree-fern with here and there some that have more resemblance to we exist yew and fir-tree we must suppose that as the season roll by the plant grow and develop they spore and seed that they shed these in enormous quantity which accumulate on the ground beneath and that every now and then they add a dead frond or leaf or at longer interval a rotten branch or a dead trunk to the mass a certain proportion of the spore and seed no doubt fulfil they obvious function and carry by the wind to unoccupied region extend the limit of the forest many might be wash away by rain into stream and be lose but a large portion must have remain to accumulate like beech-mast or acorn beneath the tree of a modern forest but in this case it may be ask why do not we english coal consist of stem and leave to a much greater extent than it do what be the reason of the predominance of the spore and spore-case in it a ready answer to this question be afford by the study of a living full-grown club-moss shake it upon a piece of paper and it emit a cloud of fine dust which fall over the paper and be the well-known lycopodium powder now this powder use to be and i believe still be employ for two object which seem at first sight to have no particular connection with one another it be or be employ in make lightning and in make pill the coat of the spore contain so much resinous matter that a pinch of lycopodium powder throw through the flame of a candle burn with a instantaneous flash which have long do duty for lightning on the stage and the same character make it a capital coating for pill for the resinous powder prevent the drug from be wet by the saliva and thus bar the nauseous flavor from the sensitive papillum of the tongue but this resinous matter which lie in the wall of the spore and sporangium be a substance not easily alter by air and water and hence tend to preserve these body just as the bituminized cerecloth preserve a egyptian mummy while on the other hand the merely woody stem and leave tend to rot as fast as the wood of the mummy 's coffin have rot thus the mixed heap of spore leave and stem in the coal - forest would be persistently search by the long-continued action of air and rain the leaf and stem would gradually be reduce to little but they carbon or in other word to the condition of mineral charcoal in which we find they while the spore and sporangium remain as a comparatively unaltered and compact residuum there be indeed tolerably clear evidence that the coal must under some circumstance have be convert into a substance hard enough to be roll into pebble while it yet lay at the surface of the earth for in some seam of coal the course of rivulet which must have be live water while the stratum in which they remains be find be still at the surface have be observe to contain rolled pebble of the very coal through which the stream have cut its way the structural fact be such as to leave no alternative but to adopt the view of the origin of such coal as i have describe which have just be state but happily the process be not without analogy at the present day i possess a specimen of what be call white coal from australia it be a inflammable material burning with a bright flame and have much the consistence and appearance of oat-cake which i be inform cover a considerable area it consist almost entirely of a compacted mass of spore and spore-case but the fine particle of blow sand which be scatter through it show that it must have accumulate subarially upon the surface of a soil cover by a forest of cryptogamous plant probably tree-fern as regard this important point of the subarial region of coal i be glad to find myself in entire accordance with principal dawson who base he conclusion upon other but no less forcible consideration in a passage which be the continuation of that already cite he write : -- -lrb- 3 -rrb- the microscopical structure and chemical composition of the bed of cannel coal and earthy bitumen and of the more highly bituminous and carbonaceous shale show they to have be of the nature of the fine vegetable mud which accumulate in the pond and shallow lake of modern swamp when such tine vegetable sediment be mix as be often the case with clay it become similar to the bituminous limestone and calcareo - bituminous shale of the coal-measure -lrb- 4 -rrb- a few of the under-clay which support bed of coal be of the nature of the vegetable mud above refer to but the greater part be argillo-arenaceous in composition with little vegetable matter and bleached by the drainage from they of water contain the product of vegetable decay they be in short loamy or clay soil and must have be sufficiently above water to admit of drainage the absence of sulphuret and the occurrence of carbonate of iron in connection with they prove that when they exist as soil rain-water and not sea-water percolate they -lrb- 5 -rrb- the coal and the fossil forest present many evidence of subarial condition most of the erect and prostrate tree have become hollow shell of bark before they be finally embedded and they wood have break into cubical piece of mineral charcoal land-snail and galley-worm -lrb- _ xylobius _ -rrb- creep into they and they become den or trap for reptile large quantity of mineral charcoal occur on the surface of all the large bed of coal none of these appearance could have be produce by subaqueous action -lrb- 6 -rrb- though the root of the _ sigillarium _ bear more resemblance to the rhizome of certain aquatic plant yet structurally they be absolutely identical with the root of cycad which the stem also resemble further the _ sigillarioe _ grow on the same soil which support conifer _ lepidodendra _ _ cordaite _ and ferns-plant which could not have grow in water again with the exception perhaps of some _ pinnularioe _ and _ asterophyllite _ there be a remarkable absence from the coal measure of any form of properly aquatic vegetation -lrb- 7 -rrb- the occurrence of marine or brackish-water animal in the roof of coal - bed or even in the coal itself afford no evidence of subaqueous accumulation since the same thing occur in the case of modern submarine forest for these and other reason some of which be more fully state in the papers already refer to while i admit that the area of coal accumulation be frequently submerge i must maintain that the true coal be a subarial accumulation by vegetable growth on soil wet and swampy it be true but not submerge i be almost dispose to doubt whether it be necessary to make the concession of wet and swampy otherwise there be nothing that i know of to be say against this excellent conspectus of the reason for believe in the subarial origin of coal but the coal accumulate upon the area cover by one of the great forest of the carboniferous epoch would in course of time have be waste away by the small but constant wear and tear of rain and stream have the land which support it remain at the same level or be gradually raise to a greater elevation and no doubt as much coal as now exist have be destroy after its formation in this way what be now know as coal district owe they importance to the fact that they be area of slow depression during a greater or less portion of the carboniferous epoch and that in virtue of this circumstance mother earth be enable to cover up she vegetable treasure and preserve they from destruction wherever a coal-field now exist there must formerly have be free access for a great river or for a shallow sea bearing sediment in the shape of sand and mud when the coal-forest area become slowly depress the water must have spread over it and have deposit they burden upon the surface of the bed of coal in the form of layer which be now convert into shale or sandstone then follow a period of rest in which the superincumbent shallow water become completely fill up and finally replace by fine mud which settle down into a new under-clay and furnish the soil for a fresh forest growth this flourish and heap up its spore and wood into coal until the stage of slow depression recommence and in some locality as i have mention the process be repeat until the first of the alternate bed have sink to near three mile below its original level at the surface of the earth in reflect on the statement thus briefly make of the main fact connect with the origin of the coal form during the carboniferous epoch two or three consideration suggest themselves in the first place the great phantom of geological time rise before the student of this as of all other fragment of the history of we earth -- spring irrepressibly out of the fact like the djin from the jar which the fisherman so incautiously open and like the djin again be vaporous shift and indefinable but unmistakably gigantic however modest the basis of one 's calculation may be the minimum of time assignable to the coal period remain something stupendous principal dawson be the last person likely to be guilty of exaggeration in this matter and it will be well to consider what he have to say about it : -- the rate of accumulation of coal be very slow the climate of the period in the northern temperate zone be of such a character that the true conifer show ring of growth not larger nor much less distinct than those of many of they modern congener the _ sigillarioe _ and _ calamite _ be not as often suppose compose wholly or even principally of lax and soft tissue or necessarily short-lived the former have it be true a very thick inner bark but they dense woody axis they thick and nearly imperishable outer bark and they scanty and rigid foliage would indicate no very rapid growth or decay in the case of the _ sigillarioe _ the variation in the leaf-scar in different part of the trunk the intercalation of new ridge at the surface represent that of new woody wedge in the axis the transverse mark leave by the stage of upward growth all indicate that several year must have be require for the growth of stem of moderate size the enormous root of these tree and the condition of the coal-swamp must have exempt they from the danger of be overthrow by violence they probably fall in successive generation from natural decay and make every allowance for other material we may safely assert that every foot of thickness of pure bituminous coal imply the quiet growth and fall of at least fifty generation of _ sigillarioe _ and therefore a undisturbed condition of forest growth endure through many century further there be evidence that a immense amount of loose parenchymatous tissue and even of wood perish by decay and we do not know to what extent even the most durable tissue may have disappear in this way so that in many coal-seam we may have only a very small part of the vegetable matter produce undoubtedly the force of these reflection be not diminish when the bituminous coal as in britain consist of accumulate spore and spore - case rather than of stem but suppose we adopt principal dawson 's assumption that one foot of coal represent fifty generation of coal plant and further make the moderate supposition that each generation of coal plant take ten year to come to maturity -- then each foot - thickness of coal represent five hundred year the superimpose bed of coal in one coal-field may amount to a thickness of fifty or sixty foot and therefore the coal alone in that field represent 500 x 50 = 25000 year but the actual coal be but a insignificant portion of the total deposit which as have be see may amount to between two and three mile of vertical thickness suppose it be 12000 foot -- which be 240 time the thickness of the actual coal -- be there any reason why we should believe it may not have take 240 time as long to form i know of none but in this case the time which the coal-field represent would be 25000 x 240 = 6000000 year as afford a definite chronology of course such calculation as these be of no value but they have much use in fix one 's attention upon a possible minimum a man may be puzzle if he be ask how long rome take a-building but he be proverbially safe if he affirm it not to have be build in a day and we geological calculation be all at present pretty much on that foot a second consideration which the study of the coal bring prominently before the mind of any one who be familiar with palaeontology be that the coal flora view in relation to the enormous period of time which it last and to the still vaster period which have elapse since it flourish undergo little change while it endure and in its peculiar character differ strangely little from that which at present exist the same species of plant be to be meet with throughout the whole thickness of a coal-field and the youngest be not sensibly different from the oldest but more than this notwithstanding that the carboniferous period be separate from we by more than the whole time represent by the secondary and tertiary formation the great type of vegetation be as distinct then as now the structure of the modern club-moss furnish a complete explanation of the fossil remains of the _ lepidodendra _ and the frond of some of the ancient fern be hard to distinguish from exist one at the same time it must be remember that there be nowhere in the world at present any _ forest _ which bear more than a rough analogy with a coal-forest the type may remain but the detail of they form they relative proportion they associate be all altered and the tree-fern forest of tasmanium or new zealand give one only a faint and remote image of the vegetation of the ancient world once more a invariably-recurring lesson of geological history at whatever point its study be take up : the lesson of the almost infinite slowness of the modification of live form the line of the pedigree of live thing break off almost before they begin to converge finally yet another curious consideration let we suppose that one of the stupid salamander-like labyrinthodont which potter with much belly and little leg like falstaff in he old age among the coal - forest could have have think power enough in he small brain to reflect upon the shower of spore which keep on fall through year and century while perhaps not one in ten million fulfil its apparent purpose and reproduce the organism which give it birth : surely he might have be excuse for moralize upon the thoughtless and wanton extravagance which nature display in she operation but we have the advantage over we shovel-headed predecessor -- or possibly ancestor -- and can perceive that a certain vein of thrift run through this apparent prodigality nature be never in a hurry and seem to have have always before she eye the adage keep a thing long enough and you will find a use for it she have keep she bed of coal many million of year without be able to find much use for they she have send they down beneath the sea and the sea-beast could make nothing of they she have raise they up into dry land and lay the black vein bare and still for age and age there be no living thing on the face of the earth that could see any sort of value in they and it be only the other day so to speak that she turn a new creature out of she workshop who by degree acquire sufficient wit to make a fire and then to discover that the black rock would burn i suppose that nineteen hundred year ago when julius caesar be good enough to deal with britain as we have deal with new zealand the primaeval briton blue with cold and woad may have know that the strange black stone of which he find lump here and there in he wanderings would burn and so help to warm he body and cook he food saxon dane and norman swarm into the land the english people grow into a powerful nation and nature still wait for a full return of the capital she have invest in the ancient club-moss the eighteenth century arrive and with it jame watt the brain of that man be the spore out of which be develop the modern steam-engine and all the prodigious tree and branch of modern industry which have grow out of this but coal be as much a essential condition of this growth and development as carbonic acid be for that of a club-moss want coal we could not have smelt the iron need to make we engine nor have work we engine when we have get they but take away the engine and the great town of yorkshire and lancashire vanish like a dream manufacture give place to agriculture and pasture and not ten man can live where now ten thousand be amply support thus all this abundant wealth of money and of vivid life be nature 's interest upon she investment in club-moss and the like so long ago but what become of the coal which be burn in yield this interest heat come out of it light come out of it and if we could gather together all that go up the chimney and all that remain in the grate of a thoroughly-burnt coal-fire we should find ourselves in possession of a quantity of carbonic acid water ammonia and mineral matter exactly equal in weight to the coal but these be the very matter with which nature supply the club-moss which make the coal she be pay back principal and interest at the same time and she straightway invest the carbonic acid the water and the ammonia in new form of life feed with they the plant that now live thrifty nature surely no prodigal but most notable of housekeeper vi on the border territory between the animal and the vegetable kingdom -lrb- 1876 -rrb- in the whole history of science there be nothing more remarkable than the rapidity of the growth of biological knowledge within the last half - century and the extent of the modification which have thereby be effect in some of the fundamental conception of the naturalist in the second edition of the rgne animal publish in 1828 cuvier devote a special section to the division of organised being into animal and vegetable in which the question be treat with that comprehensiveness of knowledge and clear critical judgment which characterise he writings and justify we in regard they as representative expression of the most extensive if not the profoundest knowledge of he time he tell we that live being have be subdivide from the earliest time into _ animated being _ which possess sense and motion and _ inanimate being _ which be devoid of these function and simply vegetate although the root of plant direct themselves towards moisture and they leaf towards air and light -- although the part of some plant exhibit oscillate movement without any perceptible cause and the leaf of other retract when touch -- yet none of these movement justify the ascription to plant of perception or of will from the mobility of animal cuvier with he characteristic partiality for teleological reasoning deduce the necessity of the existence in they of a alimentary cavity or reservoir of food whence they nutrition may be draw by the vessel which be a sort of internal root and in the presence of this alimentary cavity he naturally see the primary and the most important distinction between animal and plant follow out he teleological argument cuvier remark that the organization of this cavity and its appurtenance must need vary accord to the nature of the aliment and the operation which it have to undergo before it can be convert into substance fit for absorption while the atmosphere and the earth supply plant with juice ready prepared and which can be absorb immediately as the animal body require to be independent of heat and of the atmosphere there be no means by which the motion of its fluid could be produce by internal cause hence arise the second great distinctive character of animal or the circulatory system which be less important than the digestive since it be unnecessary and therefore be absent in the more simple animal animal further need muscle for locomotion and nerve for sensibility hence say cuvier it be necessary that the chemical composition of the animal body should be more complicated than that of the plant and it be so inasmuch as a additional substance nitrogen enter into it as a essential element while in plant nitrogen be only accidentally join with he three other fundamental constituent of organic being -- carbon hydrogen and oxygen indeed he afterwards affirm that nitrogen be peculiar to animal and herein he place the third distinction between the animal and the plant the soil and the atmosphere supply plant with water compose of hydrogen and oxygen air consist of nitrogen and oxygen and carbonic acid contain carbon and oxygen they retain the hydrogen and the carbon exhale the superfluous oxygen and absorb little or no nitrogen the essential character of vegetable life be the exhalation of oxygen which be effect through the agency of light animal on the contrary derive they nourishment either directly or indirectly from plant they get rid of the superfluous hydrogen and carbon and accumulate nitrogen the relation of plant and animal to the atmosphere be therefore inverse the plant withdraw water and carbonic acid from the atmosphere the animal contribute both to it respiration -- that be the absorption of oxygen and the exhalation of carbonic acid -- be the specially animal function of animal and constitute they fourth distinctive character thus write cuvier in 1828 but in the fourth and fifth decade of this century the greatest and most rapid revolution which biological science have ever undergo be effect by the application of the modern microscope to the investigation of organic structure by the introduction of exact and easily manageable method of conduct the chemical analysis of organic compound and finally by the employment of instrument of precision for the measurement of the physical force which be at work in the live economy that the semi-fluid contents -lrb- which we now term protoplasm -rrb- of the cell of certain plant such as the _ charoe _ be in constant and regular motion be make out by bonaventura corti a century ago but the fact important as it be fall into oblivion and have to be rediscover by treviranus in 1807 robert brown note the more complex motion of the protoplasm in the cell of _ tradescantium _ in 1831 and now such movement of the living substance of plant be well know to be some of the most widely-prevalent phenomenon of vegetable life agardh and other of the botanist of cuvier 's generation who occupy themselves with the lower plant have observe that under particular circumstance the contents of the cell of certain water-weed be set free and move about with considerable velocity and with all the appearance of spontaneity as locomotive body which from they similarity to animal of simple organization be call zoospore even as late as 1845 however a botanist of schleiden 's eminence deal very sceptically with these statement and he scepticism be the more justified since ehrenberg in he elaborate and comprehensive work on the _ infusorium _ have declare the greater number of what be now recognize as locomotive plant to be animal at the present day innumerable plant and free plant cell be know to pass the whole or part of they life in a actively locomotive condition in no wise distinguishable from that of one of the simpler animal and while in this condition they movement be to all appearance as spontaneous -- as much the product of volition -- as those of such animal hence the teleological argument for cuvier 's first diagnostic character -- the presence in animal of a alimentary cavity or internal pocket in which they can carry about they nutriment -- have break down so far at least as he mode of state it go and with the advance of microscopic anatomy the universality of the fact itself among animal have cease to be predicable many animal of even complex structure which live parasitically within other be wholly devoid of a alimentary cavity they food be provide for they not only ready cook but ready digest and the alimentary canal become superfluous have disappear again the male of most rotifer have no digestive apparatus as a german naturalist have remark they devote themselves entirely to the minnedienst and be to be reckon among the few realisation of the byronic ideal of a lover finally amidst the lowest form of animal life the speck of gelatinous protoplasm which constitute the whole body have no permanent digestive cavity or mouth but take in its food anywhere and digest so to speak all over its body but although cuvier 's lead diagnosis of the animal from the plant will not stand a strict test it remain one of the most constant of the distinctive character of animal and if we substitute for the possession of a alimentary cavity the power of take solid nutriment into the body and there digest it the definition so change will cover all animal except certain parasite and the few and exceptional case of non-parasitic animal which do not feed at all on the other hand the definition thus amend will exclude all ordinary vegetable organism cuvier himself practically give up he second distinctive mark when he admit that it be want in the simpler animal the third distinction be base on a completely erroneous conception of the chemical difference and resemblance between the constituent of animal and vegetable organism for which cuvier be not responsible as it be current among contemporary chemist it be now establish that nitrogen be as essential a constituent of vegetable as of animal living matter and that the latter be chemically speak just as complicate as the former starchy substance cellulose and sugar once suppose to be exclusively confine to plant be now know to be regular and normal product of animal amylaceous and saccharine substance be largely manufacture even by the highest animal cellulose be widespread as a constituent of the skeleton of the lower animal and it be probable that amyloid substance be universally present in the animal organism though not in the precise form of starch moreover although it remain true that there be a inverse relation between the green plant in sunshine and the animal in so far as under these circumstance the green plant decompose carbonic acid and exhale oxygen while the animal absorb oxygen and exhale carbonic acid yet the exact research of the modern chemical investigator of the physiological process of plant have clearly demonstrate the fallacy of attempt to draw any general distinction between animal and vegetable on this ground in fact the difference vanish with the sunshine even in the case of the green plant which in the dark absorb oxygen and give out carbonic acid like any animal -lrb- 1 -rrb- on the other hand those plant such as the fungus which contain no chlorophyll and be not green be always so far as respiration be concern in the exact position of animal they absorb oxygen and give out carbonic acid -lrb- footnote 1 : there be every reason to believe that live plant like live animal always respire and in respire absorb oxygen and give off carbonic acid but that in green plant expose to daylight or to the electric light the quantity of oxygen evolve in consequence of the decomposition of carbonic acid by a special apparatus which green plant possess exceed that absorb in the concurrent respiratory process -rrb- thus by the progress of knowledge cuvier 's fourth distinction between the animal and the plant have be as completely invalidate as the third and second and even the first can be retain only in a modified form and subject to exception but have the advance of biology simply tend to break down old distinction without establish new one with a qualification to be consider presently the answer to this question be undoubtedly in the affirmative the famous research of schwann and schleiden in 1837 and the follow year found the modern science of histology or that branch of anatomy which deal with the ultimate visible structure of organism as reveal by the microscope and from that day to this the rapid improvement of method of investigation and the energy of a host of accurate observer have give greater and greater breadth and firmness to schwann 's great generalisation that a fundamental unity of structure obtain in animal and plant and that however diverse may be the fabric or _ tissue _ of which they body be compose all these varied structure result from the metamorphosis of morphological unit -lrb- term _ cell _ in a more general sense than that in which the word cell be at first employ -rrb- which be not only similar in animal and in plant respectively but present a close resemblance when those of animal and those of plant be compare together the contractility which be the fundamental condition of locomotion have not only be discover to exist far more widely among plant than be formerly imagine but in plant the act of contraction have be find to be accompany as dr burdon sanderson 's interesting investigation have show by a disturbance of the electrical state of the contractile substance comparable to that which be find by du bois reymond to be a concomitant of the activity of ordinary muscle in animal again i know of no test by which the reaction of the leaf of the sundew and of other plant to stimulus so fully and carefully study by mr darwin can be distinguish from those act of contraction follow upon stimulus which be call reflex in animal on each lobe of the bilobed leaf of venus 's fly-trap -lrb- _ dionoea muscipulum _ -rrb- be three delicate filament which stand out at right angle from the surface of the leaf touch one of they with the end of a fine human hair and the lobe of the leaf instantly close together -lrb- 2 -rrb- in virtue of a act of contraction of part of they substance just as the body of a snail contract into its shell when one of its horn be irritated -lrb- footnote 2 : darwin _ insectivorous plant _ p 289 -rrb- the reflex action of the snail be the result of the presence of a nervous system in the animal a molecular change take place in the nerve of the tentacle be propagate to the muscle by which the body be retract and cause they to contract the act of retraction be bring about of course the similarity of the act do not necessarily involve the conclusion that the mechanism by which they be effect be the same but it suggest a suspicion of they identity which need careful testing the result of recent inquiry into the structure of the nervous system of animal converge towards the conclusion that the nerve fiber which we have hitherto regard as ultimate element of nervous tissue be not such but be simply the visible aggregation of vastly more attenuate filament the diameter of which dwindle down to the limit of we present microscopic vision greatly as these have be extend by modern improvement of the microscope and that a nerve be in its essence nothing but a linear tract of specially modify protoplasm between two point of a organism -- one of which be able to affect the other by means of the communication so established hence it be conceivable that even the simplest living be may possess a nervous system and the question whether plant be provide with a nervous system or not thus acquire a new aspect and present the histologist and physiologist with a problem of extreme difficulty which must be attack from a new point of view and by the aid of method which have yet to be invent thus it must be admit that plant may be contractile and locomotive that while locomotive they movement may have as much appearance of spontaneity as those of the lowest animal and that many exhibit action comparable to those which be bring about by the agency of a nervous system in animal and it must be allow to be possible that further research may reveal the existence of something comparable to a nervous system in plant so that i know not where we can hope to find any absolute distinction between animal and plant unless we return to they mode of nutrition and inquire whether certain difference of a more occult character than those imagine to exist by cuvier and which certainly hold good for the vast majority of animal and plant be of universal application a bean may be supply with water in which salt of ammonia and certain other mineral salt be dissolve in due proportion with atmospheric air contain its ordinary minute dose of carbonic acid and with nothing else but sunlight and heat under these circumstance unnatural as they be with proper management the bean will thrust forth its radicle and its plumule the former will grow down into root the latter grow up into the stem and leave of a vigorous bean-plant and this plant will in due time flower and produce its crop of bean just as if it be grow in the garden or in the field the weight of the nitrogenous protein compound of the oily starchy saccharine and woody substance contain in the full-grown plant and its seed will be vastly greater than the weight of the same substance contain in the bean from which it spring but nothing have be supply to the bean save water carbonic acid ammonia potash lime iron and the like in combination with phosphoric sulphuric and other acid neither protein nor fat nor starch nor sugar nor any substance in the slightest degree resemble they have form part of the food of the bean but the weight of the carbon hydrogen oxygen nitrogen phosphorus sulphur and other elementary body contain in the bean - plant and in the seed which it produce be exactly equivalent to the weight of the same element which have disappear from the material supply to the bean during its growth whence it follow that the bean have take in only the raw material of its fabric and have manufacture they into bean-stuff the bean have be able to perform this great chemical feat by the help of its green color matter or chlorophyll for it be only the green part of the plant which under the influence of sunlight have the marvellous power of decompose carbonic acid set free the oxygen and lay hold of the carbon which it contain in fact the bean obtain two of the absolutely indispensable element of its substance from two distinct source the watery solution in which its root be plunge contain nitrogen but no carbon the air to which the leaf be expose contain carbon but its nitrogen be in the state of a free gas in which condition the bean can make no use of it -lrb- 3 -rrb- and the chlorophyll -lrb- 4 -rrb- be the apparatus by which the carbon be extract from the atmospheric carbonic acid -- the leaf be the chief laboratory in which this operation be effect -lrb- footnote 3 : i purposely assume that the air with which the bean be supply in the case state contain no ammoniacal salt -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : the recent research of pringsheim have raise a host of question as to the exact share take by chlorophyll in the chemical operation which be effect by the green part of plant it may be that the chlorophyll be only a constant concomitant of the actual deoxidising apparatus -rrb- the great majority of conspicuous plant be as everybody know green and this arise from the abundance of they chlorophyll the few which contain no chlorophyll and be colourless be unable to extract the carbon which they require from atmospheric carbonic acid and lead a parasitic existence upon other plant but it by no means follow often as the statement have be repeat that the manufacturing power of plant depend on they chlorophyll and its interaction with the ray of the sun on the contrary it be easily demonstrate as pasteur first prove that the lowest fungus devoid of chlorophyll or of any substitute for it as they be nevertheless possess the characteristic manufacturing power of plant in a very high degree only it be necessary that they should be supply with a different kind of raw material as they can not extract carbon from carbonic acid they must be furnish with something else that contain carbon tartaric acid be such a substance and if a single spore of the commonest and most troublesome of mould -- _ penicillium _ -- be sow in a saucerful of water in which tartrate of ammonia with a small percentage of phosphate and sulphate be contain and keep warm whether in the dark or expose to light it will in a short time give rise to a thick crust of mould which contain many million time the weight of the original spore in protein compound and cellulose thus we have a very wide basis of fact for the generalisation that plant be essentially characterise by they manufacturing capacity -- by they power of work up mere mineral matter into complex organic compound contrariwise there be a no less wide foundation for the generalisation that animal as cuvier put it depend directly or indirectly upon plant for the material of they body that be either they be herbivorous or they eat other animal which be herbivorous but for what constituent of they body be animal thus dependent upon plant certainly not for they horny matter nor for chondrin the proximate chemical element of cartilage nor for gelatine nor for syntonin the constituent of muscle nor for they nervous or biliary substance nor for they amyloid matter nor necessarily for they fat it can be experimentally demonstrate that animal can make these for themselves but that which they can not make but must in all known case obtain directly or indirectly from plant be the peculiar nitrogenous matter protein thus the plant be the ideal _ proltaire _ of the living world the worker who produce the animal the ideal aristocrat who mostly occupy himself in consume after the manner of that noble representative of the line of zhdarm whose epitaph be write in sartor resartus here be we last hope of find a sharp line of demarcation between plant and animal for as i have already hint there be a border territory between the two kingdom a sort of no-man 's - land the inhabitant of which certainly can not be discriminate and bring to they proper allegiance in any other way some month ago professor tyndall ask I to examine a drop of infusion of hay place under a excellent and powerful microscope and to tell he what i think some organism visible in it be i look and observe in the first place multitude of _ bacterium _ move about with they ordinary intermittent spasmodic wriggle as to the vegetable nature of these there be now no doubt not only do the close resemblance of the _ bacterium _ to unquestionable plant such as the _ oscillatorioe _ and the lower form of _ fungus _ justify this conclusion but the manufacturing test settle the question at once it be only needful to add a minute drop of fluid contain _ bacterium _ to water in which tartrate phosphate and sulphate of ammonia be dissolve and in a very short space of time the clear fluid become milky by reason of they prodigious multiplication which of course imply the manufacture of live bacterium-stuff out of these merely saline matter but other active organism very much larger than the _ bacterium _ attain in fact the comparatively gigantic dimension of 1\/3000 of a inch or more incessantly cross the field of view each of these have a body shape like a pear the small end be slightly incurve and produce into a long curved filament or _ cilium _ of extreme tenuity behind this from the concave side of the incurvation proceed another long cilium so delicate as to be discernible only by the use of the highest power and careful management of the light in the center of the pear-shaped body a clear round space could occasionally be discern but not always and careful watch show that this clear vacuity appear gradually and then shut up and disappear suddenly at regular interval such a structure be of common occurrence among the lowest plant and animal and be know as a _ contractile vacuole _ the little creature thus describe sometimes propel itself with great activity with a curious rolling motion by the lash of the front cilium while the second cilium trail behind sometimes it anchor itself by the hinder cilium and be spin round by the working of the other its motion resemble those of a anchor buoy in a heavy sea sometimes when two be in full career towards one another each would appear dexterously to get out of the other 's way sometimes a crowd would assemble and jostle one another with as much semblance of individual effort as a spectator on the grand mulet might observe with a telescope among the speck represent man in the valley of chamounix the spectacle though always surprising be not new to I so my reply to the question put to I be that these organism be what biologist call _ monads _ and though they might be animal it be also possible that they might like the _ bacterium _ be plant my friend receive my verdict with a expression which show a sad want of respect for authority he would as soon believe that a sheep be a plant naturally pique by this want of faith i have think a good deal over the matter and as i still rest in the lame conclusion i originally express and must even now confess that i can not certainly say whether this creature be a animal or a plant i think it may be well to state the grounds of my hesitation at length but in the first place in order that i may conveniently distinguish this monad from the multitude of other thing which go by the same designation i must give it a name of its own i think -lrb- though for reason which need not be state at present i be not quite sure -rrb- that it be identical with the species _ mona lens _ as define by the eminent french microscopist dujardin though he magnifying power be probably insufficient to enable he to see that it be curiously like a much larger form of monad which he have name _ heteromita _ i shall therefore call it not _ mona _ but _ heteromita lens _ i have be unable to devote to my _ heteromita _ the prolonged study needful to work out its whole history which would involve week or it may be month of unremitting attention but i the less regret this circumstance as some remarkable observation recently publish by messr dallinger and drysdale -lrb- 5 -rrb- on certain monad relate in part to a form so similar to my _ heteromita lens _ that the history of the one may be use to illustrate that of the other these most patient and painstaking observer who employ the highest attainable power of the microscope and relieve one another keep watch day and night over the same individual monad have be enable to trace out the whole history of they _ heteromita _ which they find in infusion of the head of fish of the cod tribe -lrb- footnote 5 : research in the life-history of a cercomonad : a lesson in biogenesis and further research in the life-history of the monad -- _ monthly microscopical journal _ 1873 -rrb- of the four monad describe and figure by these investigator one as i have say very closely resemble _ heteromita lens _ in every particular except that it have a separately distinguishable central particle or nucleus which be not certainly to be make out in _ heteromita lens _ and that nothing be say by messr dallinger and drysdale of the existence of a contractile vacuole in this monad though they describe it in another they _ heteromita _ however multiply rapidly by fission sometimes a transverse constriction appear the hinder half develop a new cilium and the hinder cilium gradually split from its base to its free end until it be divide into two a process which consider the fact that this fine filament can not be much more than 1\/100000 of a inch in diameter be wonderful enough the constriction of the body extend inwards until the two portion be unite by a narrow isthmus finally they separate and each swim away by itself a complete _ heteromita _ provide with its two cilium sometimes the constriction take a longitudinal direction with the same ultimate result in each case the process occupy not more than six or seven minute at this rate a single _ heteromita _ would give rise to a thousand like itself in the course of a hour to about a million in two hour and to a number greater than the generally assume number of human being now live in the world in three hour or if we give each _ heteromita _ a hour 's enjoyment of individual existence the same result will be obtain in about a day the apparent suddenness of the appearance of multitude of such organism as these in any nutritive fluid to which one obtain access be thus easily explain during these process of multiplication by fission the _ heteromita _ remain active but sometimes another mode of fission occur the body become rounded and quiescent or nearly so and while in this rest state divide into two portion each of which be rapidly convert into a active _ heteromita _ a still more remarkable phenomenon be that kind of multiplication which be precede by the union of two monad by a process which be term _ conjugation _ two active _ heteromitoe _ become apply to one another and then slowly and gradually coalesce into one body the two nucleus run into one and the mass result from the conjugation of the two _ heteromitoe _ thus fuse together have a triangular form the two pair of cilium be to be see for some time at two of the angle which answer to the small end of the conjoin monad but they ultimately vanish and the twin organism in which all visible trace of organization have disappear fall into a state of rest sudden wave - like movement of its substance next occur and in a short time the apex of the triangular mass burst and give exit to a dense yellowish glairy fluid fill with minute granule this process which it will be observe involve the actual confluence and mixture of the substance of two distinct organism be effect in the space of about two hour the author whom i quote say that they can not express the excessive minuteness of the granule in question and they estimate they diameter at less than 1\/200000 of a inch under the highest power of the microscope at present applicable such speck be hardly discernible nevertheless particle of this size be massive when compare to physical molecule whence there be no reason to doubt that each small as it be may have a molecular structure sufficiently complex to give rise to the phenomenon of life and as a matter of fact by patient watching of the place at which these infinitesimal living particle be discharge we observer assure themselves of they growth and development into new monad in about four hour from they be set free they have attain a sixth of the length of the parent with the characteristic cilium though at first they be quite motionless and in four hour more they have attain the dimension and exhibit all the activity of the adult these inconceivably minute particle be therefore the germ of the _ heteromita _ and from the dimension of these germ it be easily show that the body form by conjugation may at a low estimate have give exit to thirty thousand of they a result of a matrimonial process whereby the contracting party without a metaphor become one flesh enough to make a malthusian despair of the future of the universe i be not aware that the investigator from whom i have borrow this history have endeavor to ascertain whether they monad take solid nutriment or not so that though they help we very much to fill up the blank in the history of my _ heteromita _ they observation throw no light on the problem we be try to solve -- be it a animal or be it a plant undoubtedly it be possible to bring forward very strong argument in favor of regard _ heteromita _ as a plant for example there be a fungus a obscure and almost microscopic mould term _ peronospora infestan _ like many other fungus the _ peronosporoe _ be parasitic upon other plant and this particular _ peronospora _ happen to have attain much notoriety and political importance in a way not without a parallel in the career of notorious politician namely by reason of the frightful mischief it have do to mankind for it be this _ fungus _ which be the cause of the potato disease and therefore _ peronospora infestan _ -lrb- doubtless of exclusively saxon origin though not accurately know to be so -rrb- bring about the irish famine the plant afflict with the malady be find to be infested by a mould consist of fine tubular filament term _ hyphoe _ which burrow through the substance of the potato plant and appropriate to themselves the substance of they host while at the same time directly or indirectly they set up chemical change by which even its woody framework become blacken sodden and wither in structure however the _ peronospora _ be as much a mould as the common _ penicillium _ and just as the _ penicillium _ multiply by the break up of its hyphoe into separate rounded body the spore so in the _ peronospora _ certain of the hyphoe grow out into the air through the interstice of the superficial cell of the potato plant and develop spore each of these hyphoe usually give off several branch the end of the branch dilate and become closed sac which eventually drop off as spore the spore fall on some part of the same potato plant or carry by the wind to another may at once germinate throw out tubular prolongation which become hyphoe and burrow into the substance of the plant attack but more commonly the contents of the spore divide into six or eight separate portion the coat of the spore give way and each portion then emerge as a independent organism which have the shape of a bean rather narrower at one end than the other convex on one side and depressed or concave on the opposite from the depression two long and delicate cilium proceed one shorter than the other and direct forwards close to the origin of these cilium in the substance of the body be a regularly pulsating contractile vacuole the shorter cilium vibrate actively and effect the locomotion of the organism while the other trail behind the whole body roll on its axis with its pointed end forwards the eminent botanist de bary who be not thinking of we problem tell we in describe the movement of these zoospore that as they swim about foreign body be carefully avoid and the whole movement have a deceptive likeness to the voluntary change of place which be observe in microscopic animal after swarm about in this way in the moisture on the surface of a leaf or stem -lrb- which film though it may be be a ocean to such a fish -rrb- for half a hour more or less the movement of the zoospore become slower and be limit to a slow turn upon its axis without change of place it then become quite quiet the cilium disappear it assume a spherical form and surround itself with a distinct though delicate membranous coat a protuberance then grow out from one side of the sphere and rapidly increase in length assume the character of a hypha the latter penetrate into the substance of the potato plant either by enter a stomate or by bore through the wall of a epidermic cell and ramify as a mycelium in the substance of the plant destroy the tissue with which it come in contact as these process of multiplication take place very rapidly million of spore be soon set free from a single infested plant and from they minuteness they be readily transport by the gentlest breeze since again the zoospore set free from each spore in virtue of they power of locomotion swiftly disperse themselves over the surface it be no wonder that the infection once start soon spread from field to field and extend its ravages over a whole country however it do not enter into my present plan to treat of the potato disease instructively as its history bear upon that of other epidemic and i have select the case of the _ peroganspora _ simply because it afford a example of a organism which in one stage of its existence be truly a monad indistinguishable by any important character from we _ heteromita _ and extraordinarily like it in some respects and yet this monad can be trace step by step through the series of metamorphosis which i have describe until it assume the feature of a organism which be as much a plant as be a oak or a elm moreover it would be possible to pursue the analogy farther under certain circumstance a process of conjugation take place in the _ peronospora _ two separate portion of its protoplasm become fuse together surround themselves with a thick coat and give rise to a sort of vegetable egg call a _ oospore _ after a period of rest the contents of the oospore break up into a number of zoospore like those already describe each of which after a period of activity germinate in the ordinary way this process obviously correspond with the conjugation and subsequent set free of germ in the _ heteromita _ but it may be say that the _ peronospora _ be after all a questionable sort of plant that it seem to be want in the manufacturing power select as the main distinctive character of vegetable life or at any rate that there be no proof that it do not get its protein matter ready make from the potato plant let we therefore take a case which be not open to these objection there be some small plant know to botanist as member of the genus _ colcochaete _ which without be truly parasitic grow upon certain water-weed as lichen grow upon tree the little plant have the form of a elegant green star the branch arm of which be divide into cell its greenness be due to its chlorophyll and it undoubtedly have the manufacturing power in full degree decompose carbonic acid and set oxygen free under the influence of sunlight but the protoplasmic contents of some of the cell of which the plant be make up occasionally divide by a method similar to that which effect the division of the contents of the _ peronospora _ spore and the sever portion be then set free as active monad-like zoospore each be oval and be provide at one extremity with two long active cilium propel by these it swim about for a longer or shorter time but at length come to a state of rest and gradually grow into a _ coleochaete _ moreover as in the _ peronospora _ conjugation may take place and result in a oospore the contents of which divide and be set free as monadiform germ if the whole history of the zoospore of _ peronospora _ and of _ coleochaete _ be unknown they would undoubtedly be class among monad with the same right as _ heteromita _ why then may not _ heteromita _ be a plant even though the cycle of form through which it pass show no term quite so complex as those which occur in _ peronospora _ and _ coleochaete _ and in fact there be some green organism in every respect characteristically plant such as _ chlamydomona _ and the common _ volvox _ or so-called globe animalcule which run through a cycle of form of just the same simple character as those of _ heteromita _ the name of _ chlamydomona _ be apply to certain microscopic green body each of which consist of a protoplasmic central substance invest by a structureless sac the latter contain cellulose as in ordinary plant and the chlorophyll which give the green color enable the _ chlamydomona _ to decompose carbonic acid and fix carbon as they do two long cilium protrude through the cell-wall and effect the rapid locomotion of this monad which in all respects except its mobility be characteristically a plant under ordinary circumstance the _ chlamydomona _ multiply by simple fission each splitting into two or into four part which separate and become independent organism sometimes however the _ chlamydomona _ divide into eight part each of which be provide with four instead of two cilium these zoospore conjugate in pair and give rise to quiescent body which multiply by division find eventually pass into the active state thus so far as outward form and the general character of the cycle of modification through which the organism pass in the course of its life be concern the resemblance between _ chlamydomona _ and _ heteromita _ be of the closest description and on the face of the matter there be no ground for refuse to admit that _ heteromita _ may be relate to _ chlamydomona _ as the colourless fungus be to the green alga _ volvox _ may be compare to a hollow sphere the wall of which be make up of coherent chlamydomonad and which progress with a rotate motion effect by the paddling of the multitudinous pair of cilium which project from its surface each _ volvox _ - monad moreover possess a red pigment spot like the simplest form of eye know among animal the method of fissive multiplication and of conjugation observe in the monad of this locomotive globe be essentially similar to those observe in _ chlamydomona _ and though a hard battle have be fight over it _ volvox _ be now finally surrender to the botanist thus there be really no reason why _ heteromita _ may not be a plant and this conclusion would be very satisfactory if it be not equally easy to show that there be really no reason why it should not be a animal for there be numerous organism present the closest resemblance to _ heteromita _ and like it group under the general name of monad which nevertheless can be observe to take in solid nutriment and which therefore have a virtual if not a actual mouth and digestive cavity and thus come under cuvier 's definition of a animal numerous form of such animal have be describe by ehrenberg dujardin h jame clark and other writer on the _ infusorium _ indeed in another infusion of hay in which my _ heteromita lens _ occur there be innumerable such infusorial animalcule belong to the well-known species _ colpoda cucullus _ -lrb- 6 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : excellently describe by stein almost all of whose statement i have verify -rrb- full-sized specimen of this animalcule attain a length of between 1\/300 or 1\/400 of a inch so that it may have ten time the length and a thousand time the mass of a _ heteromita _ in shape it be not altogether unlike _ heteromita _ the small end however be not produce into one long cilium but the general surface of the body be cover with small actively vibrate ciliary organ which be only longest at the small end at the point which answer to that from which the two cilium arise in _ heteromita _ there be a conical depression the mouth and in young specimen a taper filament which remind one of the posterior cilium of _ heteromita _ project from this region the body consist of a soft granular protoplasmic substance the middle of which be occupy by a large oval mass call the nucleus while at its hinder end be a contractile vacuole conspicuous by its regular rhythmic appearance and disappearance obviously although the _ colpoda _ be not a monad it differ from one only in subordinate detail moreover under certain condition it become quiescent inclose itself in a delicate case or _ cyst _ and then divide into two four or more portion which be eventually set free and swim about as active _ colpodoe _ but this creature be a unmistakable animal and full-sized _ colpodoe _ may be feed as easily as one feed chicken it be only needful to diffuse very finely ground carmine through the water in which they live and in a very short time the body of the _ colpodoe _ be stuff with the deeply-coloured granule of the pigment and if this be not sufficient evidence of the animality of _ colpoda _ there come the fact that it be even more similar to another well-known animalcule _ paramoecium _ than it be to a monad but _ paramoecium _ be so huge a creature compare with those hitherto discuss -- it reach 1\/120 of a inch or more in length -- that there be no difficulty in make out its organization in detail and in prove that it be not only a animal but that it be a animal which possess a somewhat complicated organization for example the surface layer of its body be different in structure from the deeper part there be two contractile vacuole from each of which radiate a system of vessel-like canal and not only be there a conical depression continuous with a tube which serve as mouth and gullet but the food ingest take a definite course and refuse be reject from a definite region nothing be easier than to feed these animal and to watch the particle of indigo or carmine accumulate at the lower end of the gullet from this they gradually project surround by a ball of water which at length pass with a jerk oddly simulate a gulp into the pulpy central substance of the body there to circulate up one side and down the other until its contents be digest and assimilate nevertheless this complex animal multiply by division as the monad do and like the monad undergo conjugation it stand in the same relation to _ heteromita _ on the animal side as _ coleochaete _ do on the plant side start from either and such a insensible series of gradation lead to the monad that it be impossible to say at any stage of the progress where the line between the animal and the plant must be draw there be reason to think that certain organism which pass through a monad stage of existence such as the _ myxomycete _ be at one time of they life dependent upon external source for they protein matter or be animal and at another period manufacture it or be plant and see that the whole progress of modern investigation be in favor of the doctrine of continuity it be a fair and probable speculation -- though only a speculation -- that as there be some plant which can manufacture protein out of such apparently intractable mineral matter as carbonic acid water nitrate of ammonia metallic and earthy salt while other need to be supply with they carbon and nitrogen in the somewhat less raw form of tartrate of ammonia and ally compound so there may be yet other as be possibly the case with the true parasitic plant which can only manage to put together material still better prepare -- still more nearly approximate to protein -- until we arrive at such organism as the _ psorospermioe _ and the _ panhistophyton _ which be as much animal as vegetable in structure but be animal in they dependence on other organism for they food the singular circumstance observe by meyer that the _ torulum _ of yeast though a indubitable plant still flourish most vigorously when supply with the complex nitrogenous substance pepsin the probability that the _ peronospora _ be nourish directly by the protoplasm of the potato-plant and the wonderful fact which have recently be bring to light respect insectivorous plant all favor this view and tend to the conclusion that the difference between animal and plant be one of degree rather than of kind and that the problem whether in a give case a organism be a animal or a plant may be essentially insoluble vii a lobster or the study of zoology -lrb- 1861 -rrb- natural history be the name familiarly apply to the study of the property of such natural body as mineral plant and animal the science which embody the knowledge man have acquire upon these subject be commonly term natural science in contradistinction to other so - call physical science and those who devote themselves especially to the pursuit of such science have be and be commonly term naturalist linnaeus be a naturalist in this wide sense and he systema natura be a work upon natural history in the broadest acceptation of the term in it that great methodising spirit embody all that be know in he time of the distinctive character of mineral animal and plant but the enormous stimulus which linnaeus give to the investigation of nature soon render it impossible that any one man should write another systema natura and extremely difficult for any one to become even a naturalist such as linnaeus be great as have be the advance make by all the three branch of science of old include under the title of natural history there can be no doubt that zoology and botany have grow in a enormously greater ratio than mineralogy and hence as i suppose the name of natural history have gradually become more and more definitely attach to these prominent division of the subject and by naturalist people have mean more and more distinctly to imply a student of the structure and function of live being however this may be it be certain that the advance of knowledge have gradually widen the distance between mineralogy and its old associate while it have draw zoology and botany closer together so that of late year it have be find convenient -lrb- and indeed necessary -rrb- to associate the science which deal with vitality and all its phenomenon under the common head of biology and the biologist have come to repudiate any blood-relationship with they foster-brother the mineralogist certain broad law have a general application throughout both the animal and the vegetable world but the ground common to these kingdom of nature be not of very wide extent and the multiplicity of detail be so great that the student of live being find himself oblige to devote he attention exclusively either to the one or the other if he elect to study plant under any aspect we know at once what to call he he be a botanist and he science be botany but if the investigation of animal life be he choice the name generally apply to he will vary accord to the kind of animal he study or the particular phenomenon of animal life to which he confines he attention if the study of man be he object he be call a anatomist or a physiologist or a ethnologist but if he dissect animal or examine into the mode in which they function be perform he be a comparative anatomist or comparative physiologist if he turn he attention to fossil animal he be a palaeontologist if he mind be more particularly direct to the specific description discrimination classification and distribution of animal he be term a zoologist for the purpose of the present discourse however i shall recognize none of these title save the last which i shall employ as the equivalent of botanist and i shall use the term zoology be denote the whole doctrine of animal life in contradistinction to botany which signify the whole doctrine of vegetable life employ in this sense zoology like botany be divisible into three great but subordinate science morphology physiology and distribution each of which may to a very great extent be study independently of the other zoological morphology be the doctrine of animal form or structure anatomy be one of its branch development be another while classification be the expression of the relation which different animal bear to one another in respect of they anatomy and they development zoological distribution be the study of animal in relation to the terrestrial condition which obtain now or have obtain at any previous epoch of the earth 's history zoological physiology lastly be the doctrine of the function or action of animal it regard animal body as machine impel by certain force and perform a amount of work which can be express in term of the ordinary force of nature the final object of physiology be to deduce the fact of morphology on the one hand and those of distribution on the other from the law of the molecular force of matter such be the scope of zoology but if i be to content myself with the enunciation of these dry definition i should ill exemplify that method of teaching this branch of physical science which it be my chief business to-night to recommend let we turn away then from abstract definition let we take some concrete living thing some animal the commoner the better and let we see how the application of common sense and common logic to the obvious fact it present inevitably lead we into all these branch of zoological science i have before I a lobster when i examine it what appear to be the most striking character it present why i observe that this part which we call the tail of the lobster be make up of six distinct hard ring and a seventh terminal piece if i separate one of the middle ring say the third i find it carry upon its under surface a pair of limb or appendage each of which consist of a stalk and two terminal piece so that i can represent a transverse section of the ring and its appendage upon the diagram board in this way if i now take the fourth ring i find it have the same structure and so have the fifth and the second so that in each of these division of the tail i find part which correspond with one another a ring and two appendage and in each appendage a stalk and two end piece these corresponding part be call in the technical language of anatomy homologous part the ring of the third division be the homolog of the ring of the fifth the appendage of the former be the homolog of the appendage of the latter and as each division exhibit corresponding part in corresponding place we say that all the division be construct upon the same plan but now let we consider the sixth division it be similar to and yet different from the other the ring be essentially the same as in the other division but the appendage look at first as if they be very different and yet when we regard they closely what do we find a stalk and two terminal division exactly as in the other but the stalk be very short and very thick the terminal division be very broad and flat and one of they be divide into two piece i may say therefore that the sixth segment be like the other in plan but that it be modify in its detail the first segment be like the other so far as its ring be concerned and though its appendage differ from any of those yet examine in the simplicity of they structure part correspond with the stem and one of the division of the appendage of the other segment can be readily discern in they thus it appear that the lobster 's tail be compose of a series of segment which be fundamentally similar though each present peculiar modification of the plan common to all but when i turn to the forepart of the body i see at first nothing but a great shield-like shell call technically the carapace end in front in a sharp spine on either side of which be the curious compound eye set upon the end of stout movable stalk behind these on the under side of the body be two pair of long feeler or antenna follow by six pair of jaw fold against one another over the mouth and five pair of leg the foremost of these be the great pincher or claw of the lobster it look at first a little hopeless to attempt to find in this complex mass a series of ring each with its pair of appendage such as i have show you in the abdomen and yet it be not difficult to demonstrate they existence strip off the leg and you will find that each pair be attach to a very definite segment of the under wall of the body but these segment instead of be the lower part of free ring as in the tail be such part of ring which be all solidly unite and bind together and the like be true of the jaw the feeler and the eye - stalk every pair of which be bear upon its own special segment thus the conclusion be gradually force upon we that the body of the lobster be compose of as many ring as there be pair of appendage namely twenty in all but that the six hindmost ring remain free and movable while the fourteen front ring become firmly solder together they back form one continuous shield -- the carapace unity of plan diversity in execution be the lesson teach by the study of the ring of the body and the same instruction be give still more emphatically by the appendage if i examine the outermost jaw i find it consist of three distinct portion a inner a middle and a outer mount upon a common stem and if i compare this jaw with the leg behind it or the jaw in front of it i find it quite easy to see that in the leg it be the part of the appendage which correspond with the inner division which become modify into what we know familiarly as the leg while the middle division disappear and the outer division be hide under the carapace nor be it more difficult to discern that in the appendage of the tail the middle division appear again and the outer vanish while on the other hand in the foremost jaw the so - call mandible the inner division only be leave and in the same way the part of the feeler and of the eye-stalk can be identify with those of the leg and jaw but whither do all this tend to the very remarkable conclusion that a unity of plan of the same kind as that discoverable in the tail or abdomen of the lobster pervade the whole organization of its skeleton so that i can return to the diagram represent any one of the ring of the tail which i draw upon the board and by add a third division to each appendage i can use it as a sort of scheme or plan of any ring of the body i can give name to all the part of that figure and then if i take any segment of the body of the lobster i can point out to you exactly what modification the general plan have undergo in that particular segment what part have remain movable and what have become fix to another what have be excessively develop and metamorphose and what have be suppress but i imagine i hear the question how be all this to be test no doubt it be a pretty and ingenious way of look at the structure of any animal but be it anything more do nature acknowledge in any deeper way this unity of plan we seem to trace the objection suggest by these question be a very valid and important one and morphology be in a unsound state so long as it rest upon the mere perception of the analogy which obtain between fully form part the unchecked ingenuity of speculative anatomist prove itself fully competent to spin any number of contradictory hypothesis out of the same fact and endless morphological dream threaten to supplant scientific theory happily however there be a criterion of morphological truth and a sure test of all homology we lobster have not always be what we see it it be once a egg a semifluid mass of yolk not so big as a pin 's head contain in a transparent membrane and exhibit not the least trace of any one of those organ the multiplicity and complexity of which in the adult be so surprising after a time a delicate patch of cellular membrane appear upon one face of this yolk and that patch be the foundation of the whole creature the clay out of which it would be mould gradually invest the yolk it become subdivide by transverse constriction into segment the forerunner of the ring of the body upon the ventral surface of each of the ring thus sketch out a pair of bud-like prominence make they appearance -- the rudiment of the appendage of the ring at first all the appendage be alike but as they grow most of they become distinguish into a stem and two terminal division to which in the middle part of the body be add a third outer division and it be only at a later period that by the modification or absorption of certain of these primitive constituent the limb acquire they perfect form thus the study of development prove that the doctrine of unity of plan be not merely a fancy that it be not merely one way of look at the matter but that it be the expression of deep-seated natural fact the leg and jaw of the lobster may not merely be regard as modification of a common type -- in fact and in nature they be so -- the leg and the jaw of the young animal be at first indistinguishable these be wonderful truth the more so because the zoologist find they to be of universal application the investigation of a polype of a snail of a fish of a horse or of a man would have lead we though by a less easy path perhaps to exactly the same point unity of plan everywhere lie hide under the mask of diversity of structure -- the complex be everywhere evolve out of the simple every animal have at first the form of a egg and every animal and every organic part in reach its adult state pass through condition common to other animal and other adult part and this lead I to another point i have hitherto speak as if the lobster be alone in the world but as i need hardly remind you there be myriad of other animal organism of these some such as man horse bird fish snail slug oyster coral and sponge be not in the least like the lobster but other animal though they may differ a good deal from the lobster be yet either very like it or be like something that be like it the cray fish the rock lobster and the prawn and the shrimp for example however different be yet so like lobster that a child would group they as of the lobster kind in contradistinction to snail and slug and these last again would form a kind by themselves in contradistinction to cow horse and sheep the cattle kind but this spontaneous grouping into kind be the first essay of the human mind at classification or the call by a common name of those thing that be alike and the arrange they in such a manner as best to suggest the sum of they likeness and unlikeness to other thing those kind which include no other subdivision than the sex or various breed be call in technical language species the english lobster be a species we cray fish be another we prawn be another in other country however there be lobster cray fish and prawn very like ours and yet present sufficient difference to deserve distinction naturalist therefore express this resemblance and this diversity by group they as distinct species of the same genus but the lobster and the cray fish though belong to distinct genus have many feature in common and hence be group together in a assemblage which be call a family more distant resemblance connect the lobster with the prawn and the crab which be express by put all these into the same order again more remote but still very definite resemblance unite the lobster with the woodlouse the king crab the water flea and the barnacle and separate they from all other animal whence they collectively constitute the larger group or class _ crustacea _ but the _ crustacea _ exhibit many peculiar feature in common with insect spider and centipede so that these be group into the still larger assemblage or province _ articula _ and finally the relation which these have to worm and other lower animal be express by combine the whole vast aggregate into the sub-kingdom of _ annulosa _ if i have work my way from a sponge instead of a lobster i should have find it associate by like tie with a great number of other animal into the sub-kingdom _ protozoan _ if i have select a fresh-water polype or a coral the member of what naturalist term the sub-kingdom _ coelentera _ would have group themselves around my type have a snail be choose the inhabitant of all univalve and bivalve land and water shell the lamp shell the squid and the sea-mat would have gradually link themselves on to it as member of the same sub-kingdom of _ mollusca _ and finally start from man i should have be compel to admit first the ape the rat the horse the dog into the same class and then the bird the crocodile the turtle the frog and the fish into the same sub-kingdom of _ vertebra _ and if i have follow out all these various line of classification fully i should discover in the end that there be no animal either recent or fossil which do not at once fall into one or other of these sub-kingdom in other word every animal be organise upon one or other of the five or more plan the existence of which render we classification possible and so definitely and precisely marked be the structure of each animal that in the present state of we knowledge there be not the least evidence to prove that a form in the slightest degree transitional between any of the two group _ vertebrata annulosa mollusca _ and _ coelenterata _ either exist or have exist during that period of the earth 's history which be record by the geologist -lrb- 1 -rrb- nevertheless you must not for a moment suppose because no such transitional form be know that the member of the sub-kingdom be disconnect from or independent of one another on the contrary in they earliest condition they be all similar and the primordial germ of a man a dog a bird a fish a beetle a snail and a polype be in no essential structural respects distinguishable -lrb- footnote 1 : the different grouping necessitate by later knowledge do not affect the principle of the argument -- 1894 -rrb- in this broad sense it may with truth be say that all live animal and all those dead fauna which geology reveal be bind together by a all-pervading unity of organization of the same character though not equal in degree to that which enable we to discern one and the same plan amidst the twenty different segment of a lobster 's body truly it have be say that to a clear eye the smallest fact be a window through which the infinite may be see turn from these purely morphological consideration let we now examine into the manner in which the attentive study of the lobster impel we into other line of research lobster be find in all the european sea but on the opposite shore of the atlantic and in the sea of the southern hemisphere they do not exist they be however represent in these region by very closely ally but distinct form -- the _ homarus americanus _ and the _ homarus capensis : _ so that we may say that the european have one species of _ homuarus _ the american another the african another and thus the remarkable fact of geographical distribution begin to dawn upon we again if we examine the contents of the earth 's crust we shall find in the latter of those deposit which have serve as the great bury grounds of past age numberless lobster-like animal but none so similar to we live lobster as to make zoologist sure that they belong even to the same genus if we go still further back in time we discover in the oldest rock of all the remains of animal construct on the same general plan as the lobster and belong to the same great group of _ crustacea _ but for the most part totally different from the lobster and indeed from any other living form of crustacean and thus we gain a notion of that successive change of the animal population of the globe in past age which be the most striking fact reveal by geology consider now where we inquiry have lead we we study we type morphologically when we determine its anatomy and its development and when compare it in these respects with other animal we make out its place in a system of classification if we be to examine every animal in a similar manner we should establish a complete body of zoological morphology again we investigate the distribution of we type in space and in time and if the like have be do with every animal the science of geographical and geological distribution would have attain they limit but you will observe one remarkable circumstance that up to this point the question of the life of these organism have not come under consideration morphology and distribution might be study almost as well if animal and plant be a peculiar kind of crystal and possess none of those function which distinguish live being so remarkably but the fact of morphology and distribution have to be account for and the science the aim of which it be to account for they be physiology let we return to we lobster once more if we watch the creature in its native element we should see it climb actively the submerged rock among which it delight to live by means of its strong leg or swimming by powerful stroke of its great tail the appendage of the sixth joint of which be spread out into a broad fan-like propeller : seize it and it will show you that its great claw be no mean weapon of offence suspend a piece of carrion among its haunt and it will greedily devour it tear and crush the flesh by means of its multitudinous jaw suppose that we have know nothing of the lobster but as a inert mass a organic crystal if i may use the phrase and that we could suddenly see it exert all these power what wonderful new idea and new question would arise in we mind the great new question would be how do all this take place the chief new idea would be the idea of adaptation to purpose -- the notion that the constituent of animal body be not mere unconnected part but organ work together to a end let we consider the tail of the lobster again from this point of view morphology have teach we that it be a series of segment compose of homologous part which undergo various modification -- beneath and through which a common plan of formation be discernible but if i look at the same part physiologically i see that it be a most beautifully construct organ of locomotion by means of which the animal can swiftly propel itself either backwards or forwards but how be this remarkable propulsive machine make to perform its function if i be suddenly to kill one of these animal and to take out all the soft part i should find the shell to be perfectly inert to have no more power of move itself than be possess by the machinery of a mill when disconnect from its steam-engine or water-wheel but if i be to open it and take out the viscera only leave the white flesh i should perceive that the lobster could bend and extend its tail as well as before if i be to cut off the tail i should cease to find any spontaneous motion in it but on pinch any portion of the flesh i should observe that it undergo a very curious change -- each fiber become shorter and thicker by this act of contraction as it be term the part to which the end of the fiber be attach be of course approximate and accord to the relation of they point of attachment to the centre of motion of the different ring the bend or the extension of the tail result close observation of the newly - open lobster would soon show that all its movement be due to the same cause -- the shorten and thicken of these fleshy fiber which be technically call muscle here then be a capital fact the movement of the lobster be due to muscular contractility but why do a muscle contract at one time and not at another why do one whole group of muscle contract when the lobster wish to extend he tail and another group when he desire to bend it what be it originate direct and control the motive power experiment the great instrument for the ascertainment of truth in physical science answer this question for we in the head of the lobster there lie a small mass of that peculiar tissue which be know as nervous substance cord of similar matter connect he brain of the lobster directly or indirectly with the muscle now if these communicate cord be cut the brain remain entire the power of exert what we call voluntary motion in the part below the section be destroy and on the other hand if the cord remain entire the brain mass be destroy the same voluntary mobility be equally lose whence the inevitable conclusion be that the power of originate these motion reside in the brain and be propagate along the nervous cord in the higher animal the phenomenon which attend this transmission have be investigate and the exertion of the peculiar energy which reside in the nerve have be find to be accompany by a disturbance of the electrical state of they molecule if we could exactly estimate the signification of this disturbance if we could obtain the value of a give exertion of nerve force by determine the quantity of electricity or of heat of which it be the equivalent if we could ascertain upon what arrangement or other condition of the molecule of matter the manifestation of the nervous and muscular energy depend -lrb- and doubtless science will some day or other ascertain these point -rrb- physiologist would have attain they ultimate goal in this direction they would have determine the relation of the motive force of animal to the other form of force find in nature and if the same process have be successfully perform for all the operation which be carry on in and by the animal frame physiology would be perfect and the fact of morphology and distribution would be deducible from the law which physiologist have establish combine with those determine the condition of the surround universe there be not a fragment of the organism of this humble animal whose study would not lead we into region of think as large as those which i have briefly open up to you but what i have be say i trust have not only enable you to form a conception of the scope and purport of zoology but have give you a imperfect example of the manner in which in my opinion that science or indeed any physical science may be best teach the great matter be to make teaching real and practical by fix the attention of the student on particular fact but at the same time it should be render broad and comprehensive by constant reference to the generalisation of which all particular fact be illustration the lobster have serve as a type of the whole animal kingdom and its anatomy and physiology have illustrate for we some of the greatest truth of biology the student who have once see for himself the fact which i have describe have have they relation explain to he and have clearly comprehend they have so far a knowledge of zoology which be real and genuine however limit it may be and which be worth more than all the mere reading knowledge of the science he could ever acquire he zoological information be so far knowledge and not mere hearsay and if it be nay business to fit you for the certificate in zoological science grant by this department i should pursue a course precisely similar in principle to that which i have take to-night i should select a fresh-water sponge a fresh-water polype or a _ cyanoea _ a fresh-water mussel a lobster a fowl as type of the five primary division of the animal kingdom i should explain they structure very fully and show how each illustrate the great principle of zoology have go very carefully and fully over this ground i should feel that you have a safe foundation and i should then take you in the same way but less minutely over similarly select illustrative type of the class and then i should direct you attention to the special form enumerate under the head of type in this syllabus and to the other fact there mention that would speak generally be my plan but i have undertake to explain to you the best mode of acquire and communicate a knowledge of zoology and you may therefore fairly ask I for a more detailed and precise account of the manner in which i should propose to furnish you with the information i refer to my own impression be that the best model for all kind of training in physical science be that afford by the method of teaching anatomy in use in the medical school this method consist of three element -- lecture demonstration and examination the object of lecture be in the first place to awaken the attention and excite the enthusiasm of the student and this i be sure may be effect to a far greater extent by the oral discourse and by the personal influence of a respected teacher than in any other way secondly lecture have the double use of guide the student to the salient point of a subject and at the same time force he to attend to the whole of it and not merely to that part which take he fancy and lastly lecture afford the student the opportunity of seek explanation of those difficulty which will and indeed ought to arise in the course of he study what book shall i read be a question constantly put by the student to the teacher my reply usually be none : write you note out carefully and fully strive to understand they thoroughly come to I for the explanation of anything you can not understand and i would rather you do not distract you mind by read a properly compose course of lecture ought to contain fully as much matter as a student can assimilate in the time occupy by its delivery and the teacher should always recollect that he business be to feed and not to cram the intellect indeed i believe that a student who gain from a course of lecture the simple habit of concentrate he attention upon a definitely limited series of fact until they be thoroughly master have make a step of immeasurable importance but however good lecture may be and however extensive the course of reading by which they be follow up they be but accessory to the great instrument of scientific teaching -- demonstration if i insist unweariedly nay fanatically upon the importance of physical science as a educational agent it be because the study of any branch of science if properly conduct appear to I to fill up a void leave by all other means of education i have the greatest respect and love for literature nothing would grieve I more than to see literary training other than a very prominent branch of education : indeed i wish that real literary discipline be far more attend to than it be but i can not shut my eye to the fact that there be a vast difference between man who have have a purely literary and those who have have a sound scientific training seek for the cause of this difference i imagine i can find it in the fact that in the world of letter learn and knowledge be one and book be the source of both whereas in science as in life learning and knowledge be distinct and the study of thing and not of book be the source of the latter all that literature have to bestow may be obtain by reading and by practical exercise in write and in speak but i do not exaggerate when i say that none of the best gift of science be to be win by these means on the contrary the great benefit which a scientific education bestow whether be training or as knowledge be dependent upon the extent to which the mind of the student be bring into immediate contact with fact -- upon the degree to which he learn the habit of appeal directly to nature and of acquire through he sens concrete image of those property of thing which be and always will be but approximatively express in human language we way of look at nature and of speak about she vary from year to year but a fact once see a relation of cause and effect once demonstratively apprehend be possession which neither change nor pass away but on the contrary form fix centre about which other truth aggregate by natural affinity therefore the great business of the scientific teacher be to imprint the fundamental irrefragable fact of he science not only by word upon the mind but by sensible impression upon the eye and ear and touch of the student in so complete a manner that every term use or law enunciate should afterwards call up vivid image of the particular structural or other fact which furnish the demonstration of the law or the illustration of the term now this important operation can only be achieve by constant demonstration which may take place to a certain imperfect extent during a lecture but which ought also to be carry on independently and which should be address to each individual student the teacher endeavor not so much to show a thing to the learner as to make he see it for himself i be well aware that there be great practical difficulty in the way of effectual zoological demonstration the dissection of animal be not altogether pleasant and require much time nor be it easy to secure a adequate supply of the needful specimen the botanist have here a great advantage he specimen be easily obtain be clean and wholesome and can be dissect in a private house as well as anywhere else and hence i believe the fact that botany be so much more readily and better teach than its sister science but be it difficult or be it easy if zoological science be to be properly study demonstration and consequently dissection must be have without it no man can have a really sound knowledge of animal organization a good deal may be do however without actual dissection on the student 's part by demonstration upon specimen and preparation and in all probability it would not be very difficult be the demand sufficient to organise collection of such object sufficient for all the purpose of elementary teaching at a comparatively cheap rate even without these much might be effect if the zoological collection which be open to the public be arrange accord to what have be term the typical principle that be to say if the specimen expose to public view be so select that the public could learn something from they instead of be as at present merely confuse by they multiplicity for example the grand ornithological gallery at the british museum contain between two and three thousand species of bird and sometimes five or six specimen of a species they be very pretty to look at and some of the case be indeed splendid but i will undertake to say that no man but a profess ornithologist have ever gather much information from the collection certainly no one of the ten of thousand of the general public who have walk through that gallery ever know more about the essential peculiarity of bird when he leave the gallery than when he enter it but if somewhere in that vast hall there be a few preparation exemplify the lead structural peculiarity and the mode of development of a common fowl if the type of the genus the lead modification in the skeleton in the plumage at various age in the mode of nidification and the like among bird be display and if the other specimen be put away in a place where the man of science to whom they be alone useful could have free access to they i can conceive that this collection might become a great instrument of scientific education the last implement of the teacher to which i have advert be examination -- a means of education now so thoroughly understand that i need hardly enlarge upon it i hold that both write and oral examination be indispensable and by require the description of specimen they may be make to supplement demonstration such be the fullest reply the time at my disposal will allow I to give to the question -- how may a knowledge of zoology be best acquire and communicate but there be a previous question which may be move and which in fact i know many be incline to move it be the question why should teacher be encourage to acquire a knowledge of this or any other branch of physical science what be the use it be say of attempt to make physical science a branch of primary education be it not probable that teacher in pursue such study will be lead astray from the acquirement of more important but less attractive knowledge and even if they can learn something of science without prejudice to they usefulness what be the good of they attempt to instil that knowledge into boy whose real business be the acquisition of read writing and arithmetic these question be and will be very commonly ask for they arise from that profound ignorance of the value and true position of physical science which infest the mind of the most highly educate and intelligent class of the community but if i do not feel well assure that they be capable of be easily and satisfactorily answer that they have be answer over and over again and that the time will come when man of liberal education will blush to raise such question -- i should be ashamed of my position here to-night without doubt it be you great and very important function to carry out elementary education without question anything that should interfere with the faithful fulfilment of that duty on you part would be a great evil and if i think that you acquirement of the element of physical science and you communication of those element to you pupil involve any sort of interference with you proper duty i should be the first person to protest against you be encourage to do anything of the kind but be it true that the acquisition of such a knowledge of science as be propose and the communication of that knowledge be calculate to weaken you usefulness or may i not rather ask be it possible for you to discharge you function properly without these aid what be the purpose of primary intellectual education i apprehend that its first object be to train the young in the use of those tool wherewith man extract knowledge from the ever-shifting succession of phenomenon which pass before they eye and that its second object be to inform they of the fundamental law which have be find by experience to govern the course of thing so that they may not be turn out into the world naked defenceless and a prey to the event they might control a boy be teach to read he own and other language in order that he may have access to infinitely wider store of knowledge than could ever be open to he by oral intercourse with he fellow man he learn to write that he means of communication with the rest of mankind may be indefinitely enlarged and that he may record and store up the knowledge he acquire he be teach elementary mathematics that he may understand all those relation of number and form upon which the transaction of man associate in complicated society be build and that he may have some practice in deductive reasoning all these operation of read writing and ciphering be intellectual tool whose use should before all thing be learn and learn thoroughly so that the youth may be enable to make he life that which it ought to be a continual progress in learning and in wisdom but in addition primary education endeavor to fit a boy out with a certain equipment of positive knowledge he be teach the great law of morality the religion of he sect so much history and geography as will tell he where the great country of the world be what they be and how they have become what they be without doubt all these be most fitting and excellent thing to teach a boy i should be very sorry to omit any of they from any scheme of primary intellectual education the system be excellent so far as it go but if i regard it closely a curious reflection arise i suppose that fifteen hundred year ago the child of any well-to-do roman citizen be teach just these same thing read and write in he own and perhaps the greek tongue the element of mathematics and the religion morality history and geography current in he time furthermore i do not think i err in affirm that if such a christian roman boy who have finish he education could be transplant into one of we public school and pass through its course of instruction he would not meet with a single unfamiliar line of thought amidst all the new fact he would have to learn not one would suggest a different mode of regard the universe from that current in he own time and yet surely there be some great difference between the civilisation of the fourth century and that of the nineteenth and still more between the intellectual habit and tone of thought of that day and this and what have make this difference i answer fearlessly -- the prodigious development of physical science within the last two century modern civilisation rest upon physical science take away she gift to we own country and we position among the lead nation of the world be go to-morrow for it be physical science only that make intelligence and moral energy stronger than brute force the whole of modern thought be steep in science it have make its way into the work of we best poet and even the mere man of letter who affect to ignore and despise science be unconsciously impregnate with she spirit and indebted for he best product to she method i believe that the greatest intellectual revolution mankind have yet see be now slowly take place by she agency she be teach the world that the ultimate court of appeal be observation and experiment and not authority she be teach it to estimate the value of evidence she be create a firm and live faith in the existence of immutable moral and physical law perfect obedience to which be the highest possible aim of a intelligent be but of all this you old stereotyped system of education take no note physical science its method its problem and its difficulty will meet the poorest boy at every turn and yet we educate he in such a manner that he shall enter the world as ignorant of the existence of the method and fact of science as the day he be bear the modern world be full of artillery and we turn out we child to do battle in it equip with the shield and sword of a ancient gladiator posterity will cry shame on we if we do not remedy this deplorable state of thing nay if we live twenty year longer we own conscience will cry shame on we it be my firm conviction that the only way to remedy it be to make the element of physical science a integral part of primary education i have endeavor to show you how that may be do for that branch of science which it be my business to pursue and i can but add that i should look upon the day when every schoolmaster throughout this land be a center of genuine however rudimentary scientific knowledge as a epoch in the history of the country but let I entreat you to remember my last word address myself to you as teacher i would say mere book learning in physical science be a sham and a delusion -- what you teach unless you wish to be impostor that you must first know and real knowledge in science mean personal acquaintance with the fact be they few or many -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : it have be suggest to I that these word may be take to imply a discouragement on my part of any sort of scientific instruction which do not give a acquaintance with the fact at first hand but this be not my mean the ideal of scientific teaching be no doubt a system by which the scholar see every fact for himself and the teacher supply only the explanation circumstance however do not often allow of the attainment of that ideal and we must put up with the next best system -- one in which the scholar take a good deal on trust from a teacher who know the fact by he own knowledge can describe they with so much vividness as to enable he audience to form competent idea concern they the system which i repudiate be that which allow teacher who have not come into direct contact with the leading fact of a science to pass they second-hand information on the scientific virus like vaccine lymph if pass through too long a succession of organism will lose all its effect in protect the young against the intellectual epidemic to which they be expose -lrb- the remark on p 222 apply to the natural history collection of the british museum in 1861 the visitor to the natural history museum in 1894 need go no further than the great hall to see the realisation of my hope by the present director

president of the british association for the advancement of science to take advantage of the elevation of the position in which the suffrage of he colleague have for the time place he and cast he eye around the horizon of the scientific world to report to they what could be see from he watch-tower in what direction the multitudinous division of the noble army of the improver of natural knowledge be march what important stronghold of the great enemy of we all ignorance have be recently capture and also with due impartiality to mark where the advanced post of science have be drive in or a long-continued siege have make no progress i propose to endeavor to follow this ancient precedent in a manner suit to the limitation of my knowledge and of my capacity i shall not presume to attempt a panoramic survey of the world of science nor even to give a sketch of what be do in the one great province of biology with some portion of which my ordinary occupation render I familiar but i shall endeavor to put before you the history of the rise and progress of a single biological doctrine and i shall try to give some notion of the fruit both intellectual and practical which we owe directly or indirectly to the work out by seven generation of patient and laborious investigator of the thought which arise more than two century ago in the mind of a sagacious and observant italian naturalist it be a matter of everyday experience that it be difficult to prevent many article of food from become cover with mould that fruit sound enough to all appearance often contain grub at the core that meat leave to itself in the air be apt to putrefy and swarm with maggot even ordinary water if allow to stand in a open vessel sooner or later become turbid and full of live matter the philosopher of antiquity interrogate as to the cause of these phenomenon be provide with a ready and a plausible answer it do not enter they mind even to doubt that these low form of life be generate in the matter in which they make they appearance lucretius who have drunk deeper of the scientific spirit than any poet of ancient or modern time except goethe intend to speak as a philosopher rather than as a poet when he write that with good reason the earth have get the name of mother since all thing be produce out of the earth and many live creature even now spring out of the earth take form by the rain and the heat of the sun -lrb- 1 -rrb- the axiom of ancient science that the corruption of one thing be the birth of another have its popular embodiment in the notion that a seed die before the young plant spring from it a belief so widespread and so fix that saint paul appeal to it in one of the most splendid outburst of he fervid eloquence : -- thou fool that which thou sowest be not quicken except it die -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : it be thus that mr munro render linquitur ut merito maternum noman adepta terra sit e terra quoniam sunt cuncta crea multaque nunc etiam exsistant animalia terris

-rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : 1 corinthian xv 36 -rrb- the proposition that life may and do proceed from that which have no life then be hold alike by the philosopher the poet and the people of the most enlighten nation eighteen hundred year ago and it remain the accept doctrine of learn and unlearned europe through the middle age down even to the seventeenth century it be commonly count among the many merit of we great countryman harvey that he be the first to declare the opposition of fact to venerable authority in this as in other matter but i can discover no justification for this widespread notion after careful search through the exercitationes de generatione the most that appear clear to I be that harvey believe all animal and plant to spring from what he term a _ primordium vegetale _ a phrase which may nowadays be render a vegetative germ and this he say be _ oviforme _ or egg-like not he be careful to add that it necessarily have the shape of a egg but because it have the constitution and nature of one that this _ primordium oviforme _ must need in all case proceed from a living parent be nowhere expressly maintain by harvey though such a opinion may be think to be imply in one or two passage while on the other hand he do more than once use language which be consistent only with a full belief in spontaneous or equivocal generation -lrb- 3 -rrb- in fact the main concern of harvey 's wonderful little treatise be not with generation in the physiological sense at all but with development and he great object be the establishment of the doctrine of epigenesis -lrb- footnote 3 : see the following passage in exercitatio i : -- item _ sponte nascentia _ dicuntur non quod ex _ putredine _ oriunda sint sed quod casu naturae sponte et aequivoc -lrb- ut aiunt

11 -rrb- the first distinct enunciation of the hypothesis that all live matter have spring from pre-existing living matter come from a contemporary though a junior of harvey a native of that country fertile in man great in all department of human activity which be to intellectual europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth century what germany be in the nineteenth it be in italy and from italian teacher that harvey receive the most important part of he scientific education and it be a student train in the same school francesco redus -- a man of the widest knowledge and most versatile ability distinguish alike as scholar poet physician and naturalist -- who just two hundred and two year ago publish he esperienze intorno alla generazione degl ' insettus and give to the world the idea the growth of which it be my purpose to trace redus 's book go through five edition in twenty year and the extreme simplicity of he experiment and the clearness of he argument gain for he view and for they consequence almost universal acceptance redus do not trouble himself much with speculative consideration but attack particular case of what be suppose to be spontaneous generation experimentally here be dead animal or piece of meat say he i expose they to the air in hot weather and in a few day they swarm with maggot you tell I that these be generate in the dead flesh but if i put similar body while quite fresh into a jar and tie some fine gauze over the top of the jar not a maggot make its appearance while the dead substance nevertheless putrefy just in the same way as before it be obvious therefore that the maggot be not generate by the corruption of the meat and that the cause of they formation must be a something which be keep away by gauze but gauze will not keep away ariform body or fluid this something must therefore exist in the form of solid particle too big to get through the gauze nor be one long leave in doubt what these solid particle be for the blowfly attract by the odour of the meat swarm round the vessel and urge by a powerful but in this case misleading instinct lay egg out of which maggot be immediately hatch upon the gauze the conclusion therefore be unavoidable the maggot be not generate by the meat but the egg which give rise to they be bring through the air by the fly these experiment seem almost childishly simple and one wonder how it be that no one ever think of they before simple as they be however they be worthy of the most careful study for every piece of experimental work since do in regard to this subject have be shape upon the model furnish by the italian philosopher as the result of he experiment be the same however vary the nature of the material he use it be not wonderful that there arise in redus 's mind a presumption that in all such case of the seeming production of life from dead matter the real explanation be the introduction of live germ from without into that dead matter -lrb- 4 -rrb- and thus the hypothesis that live matter always arise by the agency of pre-existing living matter take definite shape and have henceforward a right to be consider and a claim to be refute in each particular case before the production of live matter in any other way could be admit by careful reasoner it will be necessary for I to refer to this hypothesis so frequently that to save circumlocution i shall call it the hypothesis of _ biogenesis _ and i shall term the contrary doctrine -- that live matter may be produce by not live matter -- the hypothesis of _ abiogenesis _ -lrb- footnote 4 : pure

odds however redi strong with the strength of demonstrable fact do splendid battle for biogenesis but it be remarkable that he hold the doctrine in a sense which if he lead live in these time would have infallibly cause he to be class among the defender of spontaneous generation omne vivum ex vivo no life without antecedent life aphoristically sum up redus 's doctrine but he go no further it be most remarkable evidence of the philosophic caution and impartiality of he mind that although he have speculatively anticipate the manner in which grub really be deposit in fruit and in the gall of plant he deliberately admit that the evidence be insufficient to bear he out and he therefore prefer the supposition that they be generate by a modification of the living substance of the plant themselves indeed he regard these vegetable growth as organ by means of which the plant give rise to a animal and look upon this production of specific animal as the final cause of the gall and of at any rate some fruit and he propose to explain the occurrence of parasite within the animal body in the same way -lrb- 6 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : the passage -lrb- _ esperienze _ p 129 -rrb- be worth

importance to apprehend redus 's position rightly for the line of thought he lay down for we be those upon which naturalist have be work ever since clearly he hold _ biogenesis _ as against _ abiogenesis _ and i shall immediately proceed in the first place to inquire how far subsequent investigation have bear he out in so do but redus also think that there be two mode of biogenesis by the one method which be that of common and ordinary occurrence the living parent give rise to offspring which pass through the same cycle of change as itself -- like give rise to like and this have be term _ homogenesis _ by the other mode the living parent be suppose to give rise to offspring which pass through a totally different series of state from those exhibit by the parent and do not return into the cycle of the parent this be what ought to be call _ heterogenesis _ the offspring be altogether and permanently unlike the parent the term heterogenesis however have unfortunately be use in a different sense and m milne-edward have therefore substitute for it _ xenogenesis _ which mean the generation of something foreign after discuss redus 's hypothesis of universal biogenesis then i shall go on to ask how far the growth of science justify he other hypothesis of xenogenesis the progress of the hypothesis of biogenesis be triumphant and unchecked for nearly a century the application of the microscope to anatomy in the hand of grow leeuwenhoek swammerdam lyonnet vallisnierus raurnur and other illustrious investigator of nature of that day display such a complexity of organization in the lowest and minutest form and everywhere reveal such a prodigality of provision for they multiplication by germ of one sort or another that the hypothesis of abiogenesis begin to appear not only untrue but absurd and in the middle of the eighteenth century when needham and buffon take up the question it be almost universally discredit -lrb- 7 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : needham write in 1750 say : -- les naturalistes modernes s ` accordent unaninement  tablir comme une vrit certaine que toute plante vient do sa smence spcifique tout animal d'un oeuf ou de quelque choose

par des oeufs transports dans l'air ou dposs dans des eaux dormante par des insectes volans -- _ ibid _ p 176 -rrb- but the skill of the microscope maker of the eighteenth century soon reach its limit a microscope magnify 400 diameter be a _ chef d'oeuvre _ of the optician of that day and at the same time by no means trustworthy but a magnifying power of 400 diameter even when definition reach the exquisite perfection of we modern achromatic lens hardly suffice for the mere discernment of the smallest form of life a speck only 1\/25th of a inch in diameter have at ten inch from the eye the same apparent size as a object 1\/10000th of a inch in diameter when magnify 400 time but form of live matter abound the diameter of which be not more than 1\/40000th of a inch a filter infusion of hay allow to stand for two day will swarm with live thing among which any which reach the diameter of a human red blood - corpuscle or about 1\/3200th of a inch be a giant it be only by bear these fact in mind that we can deal fairly with the remarkable statement and speculation put forward by buffon and needham in the middle of the eighteenth century when a portion of any animal or vegetable body be infuse in water it gradually soften and disintegrate and as it do so the water be find to swarm with minute active creature the so-called infusorial animalcule none of which can be see except by the aid of the microscope while a large proportion belong to the category of smallest thing of which i have speak and which must have look like mere dot and line under the ordinary microscope of the eighteenth century lead by various theoretical consideration which i can not now discuss but which look promising enough in the light of they time buffon and needham doubt the applicability of redus 's hypothesis to the infusorial animalcule and needham very properly endeavor to put the question to a experimental test he say to himself if these infusorial animalcule come from germ they germ must exist either in the substance infuse or in the water with which the infusion be make or in the superjacent air now the vitality of all germ be destroy by heat therefore if i boil the infusion cork it up carefully cement the cork over with mastic and then heat the whole vessel by heap hot ash over it i must need kill whatever germ be present consequently if redus 's hypothesis hold good when the infusion be take away and allow to cool no animalcule ought to be develop in it whereas if the animalcule be not dependent on pre-existing germ but be generate from the infuse substance they ought by and by to make they appearance needham find that under the circumstance in which he make he experiment animalcule always do arise in the infusion when a sufficient time have elapse to allow for they development in much of he work needham be associate with buffon and the result of they experiment fit in admirably with the great french naturalist 's hypothesis of organic molecule accord to which life be the indefeasible property of certain indestructible molecule of matter which exist in all live thing and have inherent activity by which they be distinguish from not live matter each individual living organism be form by they temporary combination they stand to it in the relation of the particle of water to a cascade or a whirlpool or to a mould into which the water be pour the form of the organism be thus determine by the reaction between external condition and the inherent activity of the organic molecule of which it be compose and as the stoppage of a whirlpool destroy nothing but a form and leave the molecule of the water with all they inherent activity intact so what we call the death and putrefaction of a animal or of a plant be merely the break up of the form or manner of association of its constituent organic molecule which be then set free as infusorial animalcule it will be perceive that this doctrine be by no means identical with _ abiogenesis _ with which it be often confound on this hypothesis a piece of beef or a handful of hay be dead only in a limited sense the beef be dead ox and the hay be dead grass but the organic molecule of the beef or the hay be not dead but be ready to manifest they vitality as soon as the bovine or herbaceous shroud in which they be imprison be rent by the macerate action of water the hypothesis therefore must be classify under xenogenesis rather than under abiogenesis such as it be i think it will appear to those who will be just enough to remember that it be propound before the birth of modern chemistry and of the modern optical art to be a most ingenious and suggestive speculation but the great tragedy of science -- the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by a ugly fact -- which be so constantly be enact under the eye of philosopher be play almost immediately for the benefit of buffon and needham once more a italian the abb spallanzanus a worthy successor and representative of redus in he acuteness he ingenuity and he learn subject the experiment and the conclusion of needham to a search criticism it might be true that needham 's experiment yield result such as he have describe but do they bear out he argument be it not possible in the first place he have not completely exclude the air by he cork and mastic and be it not possible in the second place that he have not sufficiently heat he infusion and the superjacent air spallanzanus join issue with the english naturalist on both these plea and he show that if in the first place the glass vessel in which the infusion be contain be hermetically seal by fuse they neck and if in the second place they be expose to the temperature of boiling water for three-quarter of a hour -lrb- 8 -rrb- no animalcule ever make they appearance within they it must be admit that the experiment and argument of spallanzanus furnish a complete and a crush reply to those of needham but we all too often forget that it be one thing to refute a proposition and another to prove the truth of a doctrine which implicitly or explicitly contradict that proposition and the advance of science soon show that though needham might be quite wrong it do not follow that spallanzanus be quite right -lrb- footnote 8 : see spallanzanus _ opere _ vi pp 42 and 51 -rrb- modern chemistry the birth of the latter half of the eighteenth century grow apace and soon find herself face to face with the great problem which biology have vainly try to attack without she help the discovery of oxygen lead to the lay of the foundation of a scientific theory of respiration and to a examination of the marvellous interaction of organic substance with oxygen the presence of free oxygen appear to be one of the condition of the existence of life and of those singular change in organic matter which be know as fermentation and putrefaction the question of the generation of the infusory animalcule thus pass into a new phase for what might not have happen to the organic matter of the infusion or to the oxygen of the air in spallanzanus 's experiment what security be there that the development of life which ought to have take place have not be check or prevent by these change the battle have to be fight again it be needful to repeat the experiment under condition which would make sure that neither the oxygen of the air nor the composition of the organic matter be alter in such a manner as to interfere with the existence of life schulze and schwann take up the question from this point of view in 1836 and 1837 the passage of air through red-hot glass tube or through strong sulphuric acid do not alter the proportion of its oxygen while it must need arrest or destroy any organic matter which may be contain in the air these experimenter therefore contrived arrangement by which the only air which should come into contact with a boil infusion should be such as have either pass through red-hot tube or through strong sulphuric acid the result which they obtain be that a infusion so treated develop no living thing while if the same infusion be afterwards expose to the air such thing appear rapidly and abundantly the accuracy of these experiment have be alternately deny and affirm supposing then to be accept however all that they really prove be that the treatment to which the air be subject destroy _ something _ that be essential to the development of life in the infusion this something might be gaseous fluid or solid that it consist of germ remain only a hypothesis of greater or less probability contemporaneously with these investigation a remarkable discovery be make by cagniard de la tour he find that common yeast be compose of a vast accumulation of minute plant the fermentation of must or of wort in the fabrication of wine and of beer be always accompany by the rapid growth and multiplication of these _ toruloe _ thus fermentation in so far as it be accompany by the development of microscopical organism in enormous number become assimilate to the decomposition of a infusion of ordinary animal or vegetable matter and it be a obvious suggestion that the organism be in some way or other the cause both of fermentation and of putrefaction the chemist with berzelius and liebig at they head at first laugh this idea to scorn but in 1843 a man then very young who have since perform the unexampled feat of attain to high eminence alike in mathematics physics and physiology -- i speak of the illustrious helmholtz -- reduce the matter to the test of experiment by a method alike elegant and conclusive helmholtz separate a putrefying or a ferment liquid from one which be simply putrescible or fermentable by a membrane which allow the fluid to pass through and become intermix but stop the passage of solid the result be that while the putrescible or the fermentable liquid become impregnate with the result of the putrescence or fermentation which be go on on the other side of the membrane they neither putrefy -lrb- in the ordinary way -rrb- nor fermented nor be any of the organism which abound in the ferment or putrefy liquid generate in they therefore the cause of the development of these organism must lie in something which can not pass through membrane and as helmholtz 's investigation be long antecedent to graham 's research upon colloid he natural conclusion be that the agent thus intercept must be a solid material in point of fact helmholtz 's experiment narrow the issue to this : that which excite fermentation and putrefaction and at the same time give rise to live form in a fermentable or putrescible fluid be not a gas and be not a diffusible fluid therefore it be either a colloid or it be matter divide into very minute solid particle the research of schroeder and dusch in 1854 and of schroeder alone in 1859 clear up this point by experiment which be simply refinement upon those of redus a lump of cotton-wool be physically speak a pile of many thickness of a very fine gauze the fineness of the mesh of which depend upon the closeness of the compression of the wool now schroeder and dusch find that in the case of all the putrefiable material which they use -lrb- except milk and yolk of egg -rrb- a infusion boil and then allow to come into contact with no air but such as have be filter through cotton-wool neither putrefy nor fermented nor developed living form it be hard to imagine what the fine sieve form by the cotton-wool could have stop except minute solid particle still the evidence be incomplete until it have be positively show first that ordinary air do contain such particle and secondly that filtration through cotton-wool arrest these particle and allow only physically pure air to pass this demonstration have be furnish within the last year by the remarkable experiment of professor tyndall it have be a common objection of abiogenist that if the doctrine of biogeny be true the air must be thick with germ and they regard this as the height of absurdity but nature occasionally be exceedingly unreasonable and professor tyndall have prove that this particular absurdity may nevertheless be a reality he have demonstrate that ordinary air be no better than a sort of stirabout of excessively minute solid particle that these particle be almost wholly destructible by heat and that they be strain off and the air render optically pure by its be pass through cotton-wool it remain yet in the order of logic though not of history to show that among these solid destructible particle there really do exist germ capable of give rise to the development of live form in suitable menstrua this piece of work be do by m pasteur in those beautiful research which will ever render he name famous and which in spite of all attack upon they appear to I now as they do seven year ago -lrb- 9 -rrb- to be model of accurate experimentation and logical reasoning he strain air through cotton-wool and find as schroeder and dusch have do that it contain nothing competent to give rise to the development of life in fluid highly fit for that purpose but the important further link in the chain of evidence add by pasteur be three in the first place he subject to microscopic examination the cotton-wool which have serve as strainer and find that sundry body clearly recognisable as germ be among the solid particle strain off secondly he prove that these germ be competent to give rise to live form by simply sowing they in a solution fit for they development and thirdly he show that the incapacity of air strain through cotton - wool to give rise to life be not due to any occult change effect in the constituent of the air by the wool by prove that the cotton-wool might be dispense with altogether and perfectly free access leave between the exterior air and that in the experimental flask if the neck of the flask be draw out into a tube and bent downward and if after the contain fluid have be carefully boil the tube be heated sufficiently to destroy any germ which may be present in the air which enter as the fluid cool the apparatus may be leave to itself for any time and no life will appear in the fluid the reason be plain although there be free communication between the atmosphere laden with germ and the germless air in the flask contact between the two take place only in the tube and as the germ can not fall upward and there be no current they never reach the interior of the flask but if the tube be break short off where it proceed from the flask and free access be thus give to germ fall vertically out of the air the fluid which have remain clear and desert for month become in a few day turbid and full of life -lrb- footnote 9 : _ lecture to work man on the cause of the phenomenon of organic nature _ 1863 -lrb- see vol ii of these essay -rrb- -rrb- these experiment have be repeat over and over again by independent observer with entire success and there be one very simple mode of see the fact for one 's self which i may as well describe prepare a solution -lrb- much use by m pasteur and often call pasteur 's solution -rrb- compose of water with tartrate of ammonia sugar and yeast - ash dissolve therein -lrb- 10 -rrb- divide it into three portion in as many flask boil all three for a quarter of a hour and while the steam be pass out stop the neck of one with a large plug of cotton-wool so that this also may be thoroughly steam now set the flask aside to cool and when they contents be cold add to one of the open one a drop of filter infusion of hay which have stand for twenty-four hour and be consequently hill of the active and excessively minute organism know as _ bacterium _ in a couple of day of ordinary warm weather the contents of this flask will be milky from the enormous multiplication of _ bacterium _ the other flask open and expose to the air will sooner or later become milky with _ bacterium _ and patch of mould may appear in it while the liquid in the flask the neck of which be plug with cotton-wool will remain clear for a indefinite time i have seek in vain for any explanation of these fact except the obvious one that the air contain germ competent to give rise to _ bacterium _ such as those with which the first solution have be knowingly and purposely inoculate and to the mould - _ fungus _ and i have not yet be able to meet with any advocate of abiogenesis who seriously maintain that the atom of sugar tartrate of ammonia yeast-ash and water under no influence but that of free access of air and the ordinary temperature re-arrange themselves and give rise to the protoplasm of _ bacterium _ but the alternative be to admit that these _ bacterium _ arise from germ in the air and if they be thus propagate the burden of proof that other like form be generate in a different manner must rest with the assertor of that proposition -lrb- footnote 10 : infusion of hay treat in the same way yield similar result but as it contain organic matter the argument which follow can not be base upon it -rrb- to sum up the effect of this long chain of evidence : -- it be demonstrable that a fluid eminently fit for the development of the lowest form of life but which contain neither germ nor any protein compound give rise to live thing in great abundance if it be expose to ordinary air while no such development take place if the air with which it be in contact be mechanically free from the solid particle which ordinarily float in it and which may be make visible by appropriate means it be demonstrable that the great majority of these particle be destructible by heat and that some of they be germ or live particle capable of give rise to the same form of life as those which appear when the fluid be expose to unpurified air it be demonstrable that inoculation of the experimental fluid with a drop of liquid know to contain live particle give rise to the same phenomenon as exposure to unpurified air and it be further certain that these live particle be so minute that the assumption of they suspension in ordinary air present not the slightest difficulty on the contrary consider they lightness and the wide diffusion of the organism which produce they it be impossible to conceive that they should not be suspend in the atmosphere in myriad thus the evidence direct and indirect in favor of _ biogenesis _ for all known form of life must i think be admit to be of great weight on the other side the sole assertion worthy of attention be that hermetically seal fluid which have be expose to great and long - continue heat have sometimes exhibit living form of low organization when they have be open the first reply that suggest itself be the probability that there must be some error about these experiment because they be perform on a enormous scale every day with quite contrary result meat fruit vegetable the very material of the most fermentable and putrescible infusion be preserve to the extent i suppose i may say of thousand of ton every year by a method which be a mere application of spallanzanus 's experiment the matter to be preserve be well boil in a tin case provide with a small hole and this hole be solder up when all the air in the case have be replace by steam by this method they may be keep for year without putrefy ferment or get mouldy now this be not because oxygen be exclude inasmuch as it be now prove that free oxygen be not necessary for either fermentation or putrefaction it be not because the tin be exhaust of air for _ vibrione _ and _ bacterium _ live as pasteur have show without air or free oxygen it be not because the boil meat or vegetable be not putrescible or fermentable as those who have have the misfortune to be in a ship supply with unskilfully close tin well know what be it therefore but the exclusion of germ i think that abiogenist be bind to answer this question before they ask we to consider new experiment of precisely the same order and in the next place if the result of the experiment i refer to be really trustworthy it by no means follow that abiogenesis have take place the resistance of live matter to heat be know to vary within considerable limit and to depend to some extent upon the chemical and physical quality of the surrounding medium but if in the present state of science the alternative be offer we -- either germ can stand a greater heat than have be suppose or the molecule of dead matter for no valid or intelligible reason that be assign be able to re - arrange themselves into live body exactly such as can be demonstrate to be frequently produce in another way -- i can not understand how choice can be even for a moment doubtful but though i can not express this conviction of mine too strongly i must carefully guard myself against the supposition that i intend to suggest that no such thing as abiogenesis ever have take place in the past or ever will take place in the future with organic chemistry molecular physics and physiology yet in they infancy and every day make prodigious stride i think it would be the height of presumption for any man to say that the condition under which matter assume the property we call vital may not some day be artificially bring together all i feel justified in affirm be that i see no reason for believe that the feat have be perform yet and look back through the prodigious vista of the past i find no record of the commencement of life and therefore i be devoid of any means of form a definite conclusion as to the condition of its appearance belief in the scientific sense of the word be a serious matter and need strong foundation to say therefore in the admit absence of evidence that i have any belief as to the mode in which the exist form of life have originate would be use word in a wrong sense but expectation be permissible where belief be not and if it be give I to look beyond the abyss of geologically record time to the still more remote period when the earth be pass through physical and chemical condition which it can no more see again than a man can recall he infancy i should expect to be a witness of the evolution of live protoplasm from not live matter i should expect to see it appear under form of great simplicity endow like exist fungus with the power of determine the formation of new protoplasm from such matter as ammonium carbonate oxalate and tartrate alkaline and earthy phosphate and water without the aid of light that be the expectation to which analogical reasoning lead I but i beg you once more to recollect that i have no right to call my opinion anything but a act of philosophical faith so much for the history of the progress of redus 's great doctrine of biogenesis which appear to I with the limitation i have express to be victorious along the whole line at the present day as regard the second problem offer to we by redus whether xenogenesis obtain side by side with homogenesis -- whether that be there exist not only the ordinary living thing give rise to offspring which run through the same cycle as themselves but also other produce offspring which be of a totally different character from themselves -- the research of two century have lead to a different result that the grub find in gall be no product of the plant on which the gall grow but be the result of the introduction of the egg of insect into the substance of these plant be make out by vallisnierus raumur and other before the end of the first half of the eighteenth century the tapeworm bladderworm and fluke continue to be a stronghold of the advocate of xenogenesis for a much longer period indeed it be only within the last thirty year that the splendid patience of von siebold van beneden leuckart kchenmeister and other helminthologist have succeed in trace every such parasite often through the strangest wanderings and metamorphosis to a egg derive from a parent actually or potentially like itself and the tendency of inquiry elsewhere have all be in the same direction a plant may throw off bulb but these sooner or later give rise to seed or spore which develop into the original form a polype may give rise to medusae or a pluteus to a echinoderm but the medusa and the echinoderm give rise to egg which produce polype or gluteus and they be therefore only stage in the cycle of life of the species but if we turn to pathology it offer we some remarkable approximation to true xenogenesis as i have already mention it have be know since the time of vallisnierus and of raumur that gall in plant and tumor in cattle be cause by insect which lay they egg in those part of the animal or vegetable frame of which these morbid structure be outgrowth again it be a matter of familiar experience to everybody that mere pressure on the skin will give rise to a corn now the gall the tumor and the corn be part of the living body which have become to a certain degree independent and distinct organism under the influence of certain external condition element of the body which should have develop in due subordination to its general plan set up for themselves and apply the nourishment which they receive to they own purpose from such innocent production as corn and wart there be all gradation to the serious tumor which by they mere size and the mechanical obstruction they cause destroy the organism out of which they be develop while finally in those terrible structure know as cancer the abnormal growth have acquire power of reproduction and multiplication and be only morphologically distinguishable from the parasitic worm the life of which be neither more nor less closely bind up with that of the infested organism if there be a kind of diseased structure the histological element of which be capable of maintain a separate and independent existence out of the body it seem to I that the shadowy boundary between morbid growth and xenogenesis would be efface and i be incline to think that the progress of discovery have almost bring we to this point already i have be favor by mr simon with a early copy of the last publish of the valuable report on the public health which in he capacity of they medical officer he annually present to the lord of the privy council the appendix to this report contain a introductory essay on the intimate pathology of contagion by dr burdon-sanderson which be one of the clearest most comprehensive and well-reasoned discussion of a great question which have come under my notice for a long time i refer you to it for detail and for the authority for the statement i be about to make you be familiar with what happen in vaccination a minute cut be make in the skin and a infinitesimal quantity of vaccine matter be insert into the wound within a certain time a vesicle appear in the place of the wound and the fluid which distend this vesicle be vaccine matter in quantity a hundred or a thousandfold that which be originally insert now what have take place in the course of this operation have the vaccine matter by its irritative property produce a mere blister the fluid of which have the same irritative property or do the vaccine matter contain live particle which have grow and multiply where they have be plant the observation of m chauveau extend and confirm by dr sanderson himself appear to leave no doubt upon this head experiment similar in principle to those of helmholtz on fermentation and putrefaction have prove that the active element in the vaccine lymph be non-diffusible and consist of minute particle not exceed 1\/20000th of a inch in diameter which be make visible in the lymph by the microscope similar experiment have prove that two of the most destructive of epizootic disease sheep-pox and glander be also dependent for they existence and they propagation upon extremely small live solid particle to which the title of _ microzyme _ be apply a animal suffer under either of these terrible disease be a source of infection and contagion to other for precisely the same reason as a tub of ferment beer be capable of propagate its fermentation by infection or contagion to fresh wort in both case it be the solid living particle which be efficient the liquid in which they float and at the expense of which they live be altogether passive now arise the question be these microzyme the result of _ homogenesis _ or of _ xenogenesis _ be they capable like the _ toruloe _ of yeast of arise only by the development of pre-existing germ or may they be like the constituent of a nut-gall the result of a modification and individualisation of the tissue of the body in which they be find result from the operation of certain condition be they parasite in the zoological sense or be they merely what virchow have call heterologous growth it be obvious that this question have the most profound importance whether we look at it from a practical or from a theoretical point of view a parasite may be stamp out by destroy its germ but a pathological product can only be annihilate by remove the condition which give rise to it it appear to I that this great problem will have to be solve for each zymotic disease separately for analogy cut two way i have dwell upon the analogy of pathological modification which be in favor of the xenogenetic origin of microzyme but i must now speak of the equally strong analogy in favor of the origin of such pestiferous particle by the ordinary process of the generation of like from like it be at present a well-established fact that certain disease both of plant and of animal which have all the character of contagious and infectious epidemic be cause by minute organism the smut of wheat be a well-known instance of such a disease and it can not be doubt that the grape-disease and the potato-disease fall under the same category among animal insect be wonderfully liable to the ravages of contagious and infectious disease cause by microscopic _ fungus _ in autumn it be not uncommon to see fly motionless upon a window-pane with a sort of magic circle in white draw round they on microscopic examination the magic circle be find to consist of innumerable spore which have be throw off in all direction by a minute fungus call _ empusa muscoe _ the spore-forming filament of which stand out like a pile of velvet from the body of the fly these spore-forming filament be connect with other which fill the interior of the fly 's body like so much fine wool have eat away and destroy the creature 's viscera this be the full-grown condition of the _ empusa _ if trace back to its earliest stage in fly which be still active and to all appearance healthy it be find to exist in the form of minute corpuscle which float in the blood of the fly these multiply and lengthen into filament at the expense of the fly 's substance and when they have at last kill the patient they grow out of its body and give off spore healthy fly shut up with diseased one catch this mortal disease and perish like the other a most competent observer m cohn who study the development of the _ empusa _ very carefully be utterly unable to discover in what manner the smallest germ of the _ empusa _ get into the fly the spore could not be make to give rise to such germ by cultivation nor be such germ discoverable in the air or in the food of the fly it look exceedingly like a case of abiogenesis or at any rate of xenogenesis and it be only quite recently that the real course of event have be make out it have be ascertain that when one of the spore fall upon the body of a fly it begin to germinate and send out a process which bore its way through the fly 's skin this have reach the interior cavity of its body give off the minute float corpuscle which be the earliest stage of the _ empusa _ the disease be contagious because a healthy fly come in contact with a diseased one from which the spore-bearing filament protrude be pretty sure to carry off a spore or two it be infectious because the spore become scatter about all sort of matter in the neighborhood of the slay fly the silkworm have long be know to be subject to a very fatal and infectious disease call the _ muscardine _ audouin transmit it by inoculation this disease be entirely due to the development of a fungus _ botryti bassiana _ in the body of the caterpillar and its contagiousness and infectiousness be account for in the same way as those of the fly-disease but of late year a still more serious epizootic have appear among the silkworm and i may mention a few fact which will give you some conception of the gravity of the injury which it have inflict on france alone the production of silk have be for century a important branch of industry in southern france and in the year 1853 it have attain such a magnitude that the annual produce of the french sericulture be estimate to amount to a tenth of that of the whole world and represent a money - value of 117000000 franc or nearly five million sterling what may be the sum which would represent the money-value of all the industry connect with the work up of the raw silk thus produce be more than i can pretend to estimate suffice it to say that the city of lyon be build upon french silk as much as manchester be upon american cotton before the civil war silkworm be liable to many disease and even before 1853 a peculiar epizootic frequently accompany by the appearance of dark spot upon the skin -lrb- whence the name of pbrine which it have receive -rrb- have be note for its mortality but in the year follow 1853 this malady break out with such extreme violence that in 1858 the silk-crop be reduce to a third of the amount which it have reach in 1853 and up till within the last year or two it have never attain half the yield of 1853 this mean not only that the great number of people engage in silk grow be some thirty million sterling poorer than they might have be it mean not only that high price have have to be pay for import silkworm egg and that after invest he money in they in pay for mulberry-leaf and for attendance the cultivator have constantly see he silkworm perish and himself plunge in ruin but it mean that the loom of lyon have lack employment and that for year enforce idleness and misery have be the portion of a vast population which in former day be industrious and well-to-do in 1858 the gravity of the situation cause the french academy of science to appoint commissioner of whom a distinguished naturalist m de quatrefage be one to inquire into the nature of this disease and if possible to devise some means of stay the plague in read the report -lrb- 11 -rrb- make by m de quatrefage in 1859 it be exceedingly interesting to observe that he elaborate study of the pbrine force the conviction upon he mind that in its mode of occurrence and propagation the disease of the silkworm be in every respect comparable to the cholera among mankind but it differ from the cholera and so far be a more formidable malady in be hereditary and in be under some circumstance contagious as well as infectious -lrb- footnote 11 : _ tudes sur les maladies actuelles des vers  soie _ p 53 -rrb- the italian naturalist filippus discover in the blood of the silkworm affect by this strange disorder a multitude of cylindrical corpuscle each about 1\/6000th of a inch long these have be carefully study by lebert and name by he _ panhistophyton _ for the reason that in subject in which the disease be strongly develop the corpuscle swarm in every tissue and organ of the body and even pass into the undeveloped egg of the female moth but be these corpuscle cause or mere concomitant of the disease some naturalist take one view and some another and it be not until the french government alarm by the continue ravages of the malady and the inefficiency of the remedy which have be suggest despatch m pasteur to study it that the question receive its final settlement at a great sacrifice not only of the time and peace of mind of that eminent philosopher but i regret to have to add of he health but the sacrifice have not be in vain it be now certain that this devastating cholera-like pbrine be the effect of the growth and multiplication of the _ panhistophyton _ in the silkworm it be contagious and infectious because the corpuscle of the _ panhistophyton _ pass away from the body of the diseased caterpillar directly or indirectly to the alimentary canal of healthy silkworm in they neighborhood it be hereditary because the corpuscle enter into the egg while they be be form and consequently be carry within they when they be lay and for this reason also it present the very singular peculiarity of be inherit only on the mother 's side there be not a single one of all the apparently capricious and unaccountable phenomenon present by the pbrine but have receive its explanation from the fact that the disease be the result of the presence of the microscopic organism _ panhistophyton _ such be the fact with respect to the pbrine what be the indication as to the method of prevent it it be obvious that this depend upon the way in which the _ panhistophyton _ be generate if it may be generate by abiogenesis or by xenogenesis within the silkworm or its moth the extirpation of the disease must depend upon the prevention of the occurrence of the condition under which this generation take place but if on the other hand the _ panhistophyton _ be a independent organism which be no more generate by the silkworm than the mistletoe be generate by the apple-tree or the oak on which it grow though it may need the silkworm for its development in the same way as the mistletoe need the tree then the indication be totally different the sole thing to be do be to get rid of and keep away the germ of the _ panhistophyton _ as might be imagine from the course of he previous investigation m pasteur be lead to believe that the latter be the right theory and guide by that theory he have devise a method of extirpate the disease which have prove to be completely successful wherever it have be properly carry out there can be no reason then for doubt that among insect contagious and infectious disease of great malignity be cause by minute organism which be produce from pre-existing germ or by homogenesis and there be no reason that i know of for believe that what happen in insect may not take place in the highest animal indeed there be already strong evidence that some disease of a extremely malignant and fatal character to which man be subject be as much the work of minute organism as be the pbrine i refer for this evidence to the very striking fact adduce by professor lister in he various well-known publication on the antiseptic method of treatment it appear to I impossible to rise from the perusal of those publication without a strong conviction that the lamentable mortality which so frequently dog the footstep of the most skilful operator and those deadly consequence of wound and injury which seem to haunt the very wall of great hospital and be even now destroy more man than die of bullet or bayonet be due to the importation of minute organism into wound and they increase and multiplication and that the surgeon who save most life will be he who best work out the practical consequence of the hypothesis of redus i commence this address by ask you to follow I in a attempt to trace the path which have be follow by a scientific idea in its long and slow progress from the position of a probable hypothesis to that of a established law of nature we survey have not take we into very attractive region it have lie chiefly in a land flow with the abominable and peopled with mere grub and mouldiness and it may be imagine with what smile and shrug practical and serious contemporary of redus and of spallanzanus may have comment on the waste of they high ability in toiling at the solution of problem which though curious enough in themselves could be of no conceivable utility to mankind nevertheless you will have observe that before we have travel very far upon we road there appear on the right hand and on the leave field laden with a harvest of golden grain immediately convertible into those thing which the most solidly practical man will admit to have value -- viz money and life the direct loss to france cause by the pbrine in seventeen year can not be estimate at less than fifty million sterling and if we add to this what redus 's idea in pasteur 's hand have do for the wine-grower and for the vinegar-maker and try to capitalize its value we shall find that it will go a long way towards repair the money loss cause by the frightful and calamitous war of this autumn and as to the equivalent of redus 's thought in life how can we over-estimate the value of that knowledge of the nature of epidemic and epizootic disease and consequently of the means of check or eradicate they the dawn of which have assuredly commence look back no further than ten year it be possible to select three -lrb- 1863 1864 and 1869 -rrb- in which the total number of death from scarlet - fever alone amount to ninety thousand that be the return of kill the maim and disabled be leave out of sight why it be to be hope that the list of kill in the present bloodiest of all war will not amount to more than this but the fact which i have place before you must leave the least sanguine without a doubt that the nature and the cause of this scourge will one day be as well understand as those of the pbrine be now and that the long-suffered massacre of we innocent will come to a end and thus mankind will have one more admonition that the people perish for lack of knowledge and that the alleviation of the misery and the promotion of the welfare of man must be seek by those who will not lose they pain in that diligent patient loving study of all the multitudinous aspect of nature the result of which constitute exact knowledge or science it be the justification and the glory of this great meeting that it be gather together for no other object than the advancement of the moiety of science which deal with those phenomenon of nature which we call physical may its endeavor be crown with a full measure of success ix geological contemporaneity and persistent type of life -lrb- 1862 -rrb- merchant occasionally go through a wholesome though troublesome and not always satisfactory process which they term take stock after all the excitement of speculation the pleasure of gain and the pain of loss the trader make up he mind to face fact and to learn the exact quantity and quality of he solid and reliable possession the man of science do well sometimes to imitate this procedure and forget for the time the importance of he own small winnings to re - examine the common stock in trade so that he may make sure how far the stock of bullion in the cellar -- on the faith of whose existence so much paper have be circulate -- be really the solid gold of truth the anniversary meeting of the geological society seem to be a occasion well suit for a undertaking of this kind -- for a inquiry in fact into the nature and value of the present result of palaeontological investigation and the more so as all those who have pay close attention to the late multitudinous discussion in which palaeontology be implicate must have feel the urgent necessity of some such scrutiny first in order as the most definite and unquestionable of all the result of palaeontology must be mention the immense extension and impulse give to botany zoology and comparative anatomy by the investigation of fossil remain indeed the mass of biological fact have be so greatly increase and the range of biological speculation have be so vastly widen by the research of the geologist and palaeontologist that it be to be fear there be naturalist in existence who look upon geology as brindley regard river river say the great engineer be make to feed canal and geology some seem to think be solely create to advance comparative anatomy be such a thought justifiable it could hardly expect to be receive with favor by this assembly but it be not justifiable you favorite science have she own great aim independent of all other and if notwithstanding she steady devotion to she own progress she can scatter such rich alms among she sister it should be remember that she charity be of the sort that do not impoverish but blesseth he that give and he that take regard the matter as we will however the fact remain nearly 40000 species of animal and plant have be add to the systema natura by palaeontological research this be a live population equivalent to that of a new continent in mere number equivalent to that of a new hemisphere if we take into account the small population of insect as yet find fossil and the large proportion and peculiar organization of many of the vertebra but beyond this it be perhaps not too much to say that except for the necessity of interpret palaeontological fact the law of distribution would have receive less careful study while few comparative anatomist -lrb- and those not of the first order -rrb- would have be induce by mere love of detail as such to study the minutiae of osteology be it not that in such minutiae lie the only key to the most interesting riddle offer by the extinct animal world these assuredly be great and solid gain surely it be matter for no small congratulation that in half a century -lrb- for palaeontology though it dawn earlier come into full day only with cuvier -rrb- a subordinate branch of biology should have double the value and the interest of the whole group of science to which it belong but this be not all ally with geology palaeontology have establish two law of inestimable importance : the first that one and the same area of the earth 's surface have be successively occupy by very different kind of live being the second that the order of succession establish in one locality hold good approximately in all the first of these law be universal and irreversible the second be a induction from a vast number of observation though it may possibly and even probably have to admit of exception as a consequence of the second law it follow that a peculiar relation frequently subsist between series of stratum contain organic remains in different locality the series resemble one another not only in virtue of a general resemblance of the organic remains in the two but also in virtue of a resemblance in the order and character of the serial succession in each there be a resemblance of arrangement so that the separate term of each series as well as the whole series exhibit a correspondence succession imply time the lower member of a undisturbed series of sedimentary rock be certainly older than the upper and when the notion of age be once introduce as the equivalent of succession it be no wonder that correspondence in succession come to be look upon as a correspondence in age or contemporaneity and indeed so long as relative age only be speak of correspondence in succession _ be _ correspondence in age it be _ relative _ contemporaneity but it would have be very much better for geology if so loose and ambiguous a word as contemporaneous have be exclude from she terminology and if in its stead some term express similarity of serial relation and exclude the notion of time altogether have be employ to denote correspondence in position in two or more series of stratum in anatomy where such correspondence of position have constantly to be speak of it be denote by the word homology and its derivative and for geology -lrb- which after all be only the anatomy and physiology of the earth -rrb- it might be well to invent some single word such as homotaxi -lrb- similarity of order -rrb- in order to express a essentially similar idea this however have not be do and most probably the inquiry will at once be make -- to what end burden science with a new and strange term in place of one old familiar and part of we common language the reply to this question will become obvious as the inquiry into the result of palaeontology be push further those whose business it be to acquaint themselves specially with the work of palaeontologist in fact will be fully aware that very few if any would rest satisfied with such a statement of the conclusion of they branch of biology as that which have just be give we standard repertory of palaeontology profess to teach we far higher thing -- to disclose the entire succession of live form upon the surface of the globe to tell we of a wholly different distribution of climatic condition in ancient time to reveal the character of the first of all live existence and to trace out the law of progress from they to we it may not be unprofitable to bestow on these profession a somewhat more critical examination than they have hitherto receive in order to ascertain how far they rest on a irrefragable basis or whether after all it might not be well for palaeontologist to learn a little more carefully that scientific ar artium the art of say i do not know and to this end let we define somewhat more exactly the extent of these pretension of palaeontology every one be aware that professor bronn 's untersuchungen and professor pictet 's trait de palontologie be work of standard authority familiarly consult by every work palaeontologist it be desirable to speak of these excellent book and of they distinguish author with the utmost respect and in a tone as far as possible remove from carp criticism indeed if they be specially cite in this place it be merely in justification of the assertion that the follow proposition which may be find implicitly or explicitly in the work in question be regard by the mass of palaeontologist and geologist not only on the continent but in this country as express some of the best - establish result of palaeontology thus : -- animal and plant begin they existence together not long after the commencement of the deposition of the sedimentary rock and then succeed one another in such a manner that totally distinct fauna and flora occupy the whole surface of the earth one after the other and during distinct epoch of time a geological formation be the sum of all the stratum deposit over the whole surface of the earth during one of these epoch : a geological fauna or flora be the sum of all the species of animal or plant which occupy the whole surface of the globe during one of these epoch the population of the earth 's surface be at first very similar in all part and only from the middle of the tertiary epoch onward begin to show a distinct distribution in zone the constitution of the original population as well as the numerical proportion of its member indicate a warmer and on the whole somewhat tropical climate which remain tolerably equable throughout the year the subsequent distribution of live being in zone be the result of a gradual lowering of the general temperature which first begin to be feel at the pole it be not now propose to inquire whether these doctrine be true or false but to direct you attention to a much simpler though very essential preliminary question -- what be they logical basis what be the fundamental assumption upon which they all logically depend and what be the evidence on which those fundamental proposition demand we assent these assumption be two : the first that the commencement of the geological record be coval with the commencement of life on the globe the second that geological contemporaneity be the same thing as chronological synchrony without the first of these assumption there would of course be no ground for any statement respect the commencement of life without the second all the other statement cite every one of which imply a knowledge of the state of different part of the earth at one and the same time will be no less devoid of demonstration the first assumption obviously rest entirely on negative evidence this be of course the only evidence that ever can be available to prove the commencement of any series of phenomenon but at the same time it must be recollect that the value of negative evidence depend entirely on the amount of positive corroboration it receive if ab wish to prove a _ alibi _ it be of no use for he to get a thousand witness simply to swear that they do not see he in such and such a place unless the witness be prepare to prove that they must have see he have he be there but the evidence that animal life commence with the lingulum - flag _ eg _ would seem to be exactly of this unsatisfactory uncorroborated sort the cambrian witness simply swear they have not see anybody they way upon which the counsel for the other side immediately put in ten or twelve thousand foot of devonian sandstone to make oath they never see a fish or a mollusk though all the world know there be plenty in they time but then it be urge that though the devonian rock in one part of the world exhibit no fossil in another they do while the lower cambrian rock nowhere exhibit fossil and hence no living be could have exist in they epoch to this there be two reply : the first that the observational basis of the assertion that the lowest rock be nowhere fossiliferous be a amazingly small one see how very small a area in comparison to that of the whole world have yet be fully search the second that the argument be good for nothing unless the unfossiliferous rock in question be not only _ contemporaneous _ in the geological sense but _ synchronous _ in the chronological sense to use the _ alibi _ illustration again if a man wish to prove he be in neither of two place a and b on a give day he witness for each place must be prepare to answer for the whole day if they can only prove that he be not at a in the morning and not at b in the afternoon the evidence of he absence from both be nil because he might have be at b in the morning and at a in the afternoon thus everything depend upon the validity of the second assumption and we must proceed to inquire what be the real meaning of the word contemporaneous as employ by geologist to this end a concrete example may be take the lia of england and the lia of germany the cretaceous rock of britain and the cretaceous rock of southern indium be term by geologist contemporaneous formation but whenever any thoughtful geologist be ask whether he mean to say that they be deposit synchronously he say no -- only within the same great epoch and if in pursue the inquiry he be ask what may be the approximate value in time of a great epoch -- whether it mean a hundred year or a thousand or a million or ten million year -- he reply be i can not tell if the further question be put whether physical geology be in possession of any method by which the actual synchrony -lrb- or the reverse -rrb- of any two distant deposit can be ascertain no such method can be hear of it be admit by all the best authority that neither similarity of mineral composition nor of physical character nor even direct continuity of stratum be _ absolute _ proof of the synchronism of even approximate sedimentary stratum : while for distant deposit there seem to be no kind of physical evidence attainable of a nature competent to decide whether such deposit be form simultaneously or whether they possess any give difference of antiquity to return to a example already give : all competent authority will probably assent to the proposition that physical geology do not enable we in any way to reply to this question -- be the british cretaceous rock deposit at the same time as those of indium or be they a million of year younger or a million of year older be palaeontology able to succeed where physical geology fail standard writer on palaeontology as have be see assume that she can they take it for grant that deposit contain similar organic remains be synchronous -- at any rate in a broad sense and yet those who will study the eleventh and twelfth chapter of sir henry de la beche 's remarkable research in theoretical geology publish now nearly thirty year ago and will carry out the argument there most luminously state to they logical consequence may very easily convince themselves that even absolute identity of organic contents be no proof of the synchrony of deposit while absolute diversity be no proof of difference of date sir henry de la beche go even further and adduce conclusive evidence to show that the different part of one and the same stratum have a similar composition throughout contain the same organic remains and have similar bed above and below it may yet differ to any conceivable extent in age edward forbe be in the habit of assert that the similarity of the organic contents of distant formation be _ prima facie _ evidence not of they similarity but of they difference of age and hold as he do the doctrine of single specific centre the conclusion be as legitimate as any other for the two district must have be occupy by migration from one of the two or from a intermediate spot and the chance against exact coincidence of migration and of imbedding be infinite in point of fact however whether the hypothesis of single or of multiple specific centre be adopt similarity of organic contents can not possibly afford any proof of the synchrony of the deposit which contain they on the contrary it be demonstrably compatible with the lapse of the most prodigious interval of time and with the interposition of vast change in the organic and inorganic world between the epoch in which such deposit be form on what amount of similarity of they fauna be the doctrine of the contemporaneity of the european and of the north american silurian base in the last edition of sir charle lyell 's elementary geology it be state on the authority of a former president of this society the late daniel sharpe that between 30 and 40 per cent of the species of silurian mollusca be common to both side of the atlantic by way of due allowance for further discovery let we double the lesser number and suppose that 60 per cent of the species be common to the north american and the british silurian sixty per cent of species in common be then proof of contemporaneity now suppose that a million or two of year hence when britain have make another dip beneath the sea and have come up again some geologist apply this doctrine in compare the stratum lay bare by the upheaval of the bottom say of st george 's channel with what may then remain of the suffolk crag reasoning in the same way he will at once decide the suffolk crag and the st george 's channel bed to be contemporaneous although we happen to know that a vast period -lrb- even in the geological sense -rrb- of time and physical change of almost unprecedented extent separate the two but if it be a demonstrable fact that stratum contain more than 60 or 70 per cent of species of mollusca in common and comparatively close together may yet be separate by a amount of geological time sufficient to allow of some of the greatest physical change the world have see what become of that sort of contemporaneity the sole evidence of which be a similarity of facy or the identity of half a dozen species or of a good many genus and yet there be no better evidence for the contemporaneity assume by all who adopt the hypothesis of universal fauna and flora of a universally uniform climate and of a sensible cooling of the globe during geological time there seem then no escape from the admission that neither physical geology nor palaeontology possess any method by which the absolute synchronism of two stratum can be demonstrate all that geology can prove be local order of succession it be mathematically certain that in any give vertical linear section of a undisturbed series of sedimentary deposit the bed which lie lowest be the oldest in many other vertical linear section of the same series of course corresponding bed will occur in a similar order but however great may be the probability no man can say with absolute certainty that the bed in the two section be synchronously deposit for area of moderate extent it be doubtless true that no practical evil be likely to result from assume the corresponding bed to be synchronous or strictly contemporaneous and there be multitude of accessory circumstance which may fully justify the assumption of such synchrony but the moment the geologist have to deal with large area or with completely separate deposit the mischief of confound that homotaxi or similarity of arrangement which _ can _ be demonstrate with synchrony or identity of date for which there be not a shadow of proof under the one common term of contemporaneity become incalculable and prove the constant source of gratuitous speculation for anything that geology or palaeontology be able to show to the contrary a devonian fauna and flora in the british island may have be contemporaneous with silurian life in north america and with a carboniferous fauna and flora in africa geographical province and zone may have be as distinctly mark in the palaeozoic epoch as at present and those seemingly sudden appearance of new genus and species which we ascribe to new creation may be simple result of migration it may be so it may be otherwise in the present condition of we knowledge and of we method one verdict -- not prove and not provable -- must be record against all the grand hypothesis of the palaeontologist respect the general succession of life on the globe the order and nature of terrestrial life as a whole be open question geology at present provide we with most valuable topographical record but she have not the means of work they into a universal history be such a universal history then to be regard as unattainable be all the grandest and most interesting problem which offer themselves to the geological student essentially insoluble be he in the position of a scientific tantalus -- doomed always to thirst for a knowledge which he can not obtain the reverse be to be hope nay it may not be impossible to indicate the source whence help will come in commence these remark mention be make of the great obligation under which the naturalist lie to the geologist and palaeontologist assuredly the time will come when these obligation will be repay tenfold and when the maze of the world 's past history through which the pure geologist and the pure palaeontologist find no guidance will be securely thread by the clue furnish by the naturalist all who be competent to express a opinion on the subject be at present agree that the manifold variety of animal and vegetable form have not either come into existence by chance nor result from capricious exertion of creative power but that they have take place in a definite order the statement of which order be what man of science term a natural law whether such a law be to be regard as a expression of the mode of operation of natural force or whether it be simply a statement of the manner in which a supernatural power have think fit to act be a secondary question so long as the existence of the law and the possibility of its discovery by the human intellect be grant but he must be a half-hearted philosopher who believe in that possibility and have watch the gigantic stride of the biological science during the last twenty year doubt that science will sooner or later make this further step so as to become possess of the law of evolution of organic form -- of the unvarying order of that great chain of cause and effect of which all organic form ancient and modern be the link and then if ever we shall be able to begin to discuss with profit the question respect the commencement of life and the nature of the successive population of the globe which so many seem to think be already answer the precede argument make no particular claim to novelty indeed they have be float more or less distinctly before the mind of geologist for the last thirty year and if at the present time it have seem desirable to give they more definite and systematic expression it be because palaeontology be every day assume a greater importance and now require to rest on a basis the firmness of which be thoroughly well assure among its fundamental conception there must be no confusion between what be certain and what be more or less probable -lrb- 1 -rrb- but pend the construction of a surer foundation than palaeontology now possess it may be instructive assume for the nonce the general correctness of the ordinary hypothesis of geological contemporaneity to consider whether the deduction which be ordinarily draw from the whole body of palaeontological fact be justifiable -lrb- footnote 1 : le plus grand service qu'on puisse rendre  la science est d' y faire place nette avant d' y rien construire -- cuvier -rrb- the evidence on which such conclusion be base be of two kind negative and positive the value of negative evidence in connection with this inquiry have be so fully and clearly discuss in a address from the chair of this society -lrb- 2 -rrb- which none of we have forget that nothing need at present be say about it the more as the consideration which have be lay before you have certainly not tend to increase you estimation of such evidence it will be preferable to turn to the positive fact of palaeontology and to inquire what they tell we -lrb- footnote 2 : anniversary address for 1851 _ quart journ geol soc _ vol vii -rrb- we be all accustomed to speak of the number and the extent of the change in the live population of the globe during geological time as something enormous : and indeed they be so if we regard only the negative difference which separate the older rock from the more modern and if we look upon specific and generic change as great change which from one point of view they truly be but leave the negative difference out of consideration and look only at the positive datum furnish by the fossil world from a broader point of view -- from that of the comparative anatomist who have make the study of the greater modification of animal form he chief business -- a surprise of another kind dawn upon the mind and under _ this _ aspect the smallness of the total change become as astonishing as be its greatness under the other there be two hundred know order of plant of these not one be certainly know to exist exclusively in the fossil state the whole lapse of geological time have as yet yield not a single new ordinal type of vegetable structure -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : see hooker 's _ introductory essay to the flora of tasmanium _ p xxiii -rrb- the positive change in pass from the recent to the ancient animal world be greater but still singularly small no fossil animal be so distinct from those now live as to require to be arrange even in a separate class from those which contain exist form it be only when we come to the order which may be roughly estimate at about a hundred and thirty that we meet with fossil animal so distinct from those now live as to require order for themselves and these do not amount on the most liberal estimate to more than about 10 per cent of the whole there be no certainly know extinct order of protozoan there be but one among the coelentera -- that of the rugose coral there be none among the mollusca there be three the cystidea blastoidea and edrioasterida among the echinoderm and two the trilobita and eurypterida among the crustacea make altogether five for the great sub-kingdom of annulosa among vertebrate there be no ordinally distinct fossil fish : there be only one extinct order of amphibium -- the labyrinthodont but there be at least four distinct order of reptilium viz the ichthyosaurium plesiosaurium pterosaurium dinosaurium and perhaps another or two there be no known extinct order of bird and no certainly know extinct order of mammal the ordinal distinctness of the toxodontium be doubtful the objection that broad statement of this kind after all rest largely on negative evidence be obvious but it have less force than may at first be suppose for as might be expect from the circumstance of the case we possess more abundant positive evidence regard fish and marine mollusk than respect any other form of animal life and yet these offer we through the whole range of geological time no species ordinally distinct from those now live while the far less numerous class of echinoderm present three and the crustacea two such order though none of these come down later than the palaeozoic age lastly the reptilium present the extraordinary and exceptional phenomenon of as many extinct as exist order if not more the four mention maintain they existence from the lia to the chalk inclusive some year ago one of you secretary point out another

pleuracanthus _ which differ no more from exist shark than these do from one another again vast as be the number of undoubtedly ganoid fossil fish and great as be they range in time a large mass of evidence have recently be adduce to show that almost all those respect which we possess sufficient information be referable to the same sub-ordinal group as the exist _ lepidosteus polypterus _ and sturgeon and that a singular relation obtain between the older and the younger fish the former the devonian ganoid be almost all member of the same sub-order as _ polypterus _ while the mesozoic ganoid be almost all similarly ally to _ lepidosteus _ -lrb- 5 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : memoirs of the geological survey of the unite kingdom -- decade x preliminary essay upon the systematic arrangement of the fish of the devonian epoch -rrb- again what can be more remarkable than the singular constancy of structure preserve throughout a vast period of time by the family of the pycnodont and by that of the true coelacanth the former persist with but insignificant modification from the carboniferous to the tertiary rock inclusive the latter exist with still less change from the carboniferous rock to the chalk inclusive among reptile the highest living group that of the crocodilium be represent at the early part of the mesozoic epoch by species identical in the essential character of they organization with those now live and differ from the latter only in such matter as the form of the articular facet of the vertebral centra in the extent to which the nasal passage be separate from the cavity of the mouth by bone and in the proportion of the limb and even as regard the mammalium the scanty remains of triassic and oolitic species afford no foundation for the supposition that the organization of the oldest form differ nearly so much from some of those which now live as these differ from one another it be needless to multiply these instance enough have be say to justify the statement that in view of the immense diversity of known animal and vegetable form and the enormous lapse of time indicate by the accumulation of fossiliferous stratum the only circumstance to be wonder at be not that the change of life as exhibit by positive evidence have be so great but that they have be so small be they great or small however it be desirable to attempt to estimate they let we therefore take each great division of the animal world in succession and whenever a order or a family can be show to have have a prolonged existence let we endeavor to ascertain how far the later member of the group differ from the earlier one if these later member in all or in many case exhibit a certain amount of modification the fact be so far evidence in favor of a general law of change and in a rough way the rapidity of that change will be measure by the demonstrable amount of modification on the other hand it must be recollect that the absence of any modification while it may leave the doctrine of the existence of a law of change without positive support can not possibly disprove all form of that doctrine though it may afford a sufficient refutation of many of they the protozoan -- the protozoan be represent throughout the whole range of geological series from the lower silurian formation to the present day the most ancient form recently make know by ehrenberg be exceedingly like those which now exist : no one have ever pretend that the difference between any ancient and any modern foraminifera be of more than generic value nor be the oldest foraminifera either simpler more embryonic or less differentiate than the existing form the coelentera -- the tabulate coral have exist from the silurian epoch to the present day but i be not aware that the ancient _ heliolite _ possess a single mark of a more embryonic or less differentiate character or less high organization than the exist _ heliopora _ as for the aporose coral in what respect be the silurian _ paloeocyclus _ less highly organise or more embryonic than the modern _ fungium _ or the liassic aporosa than the exist member of the same family the _ mollusca _ -- in what sense be the living _ waldheimium _ less embryonic or more specialised than the palaeozoic _ spirifer _ or the exist _ rhynchonelloe cranioe discinoe linguloe _ than the silurian species of the same genus in what sense can _ loligo _ or _ spirulum _ be say to be more specialised or less embryonic than _ belemnite _ or the modern species of lamellibranch and gasteropod genus than the silurian species of the same genus the annulosa -- the carboniferous insecta and arachnida be neither less specialised nor more embryonic than these that now live nor be the liassic cirripedium and macrura while several of the brachyura which appear in the chalk belong to exist genus and none exhibit either a intermediate or a embryonic character the vertebra -- among fish i have refer to the coelacanthinus -lrb- comprise the genus _ coelacanthus holophagus undina _ and _ macropoma _ -rrb- as afford a example of a persistent type and it be most remarkable to note the smallness of the difference between any of these fish -lrb- affect at most the proportion of the body and fin and the character and sculpture of the scale -rrb- notwithstanding they enormous range in time in all the essential of its very peculiar structure the _ macropoma _ of the chalk be identical with the _ coelacanthus _ of the coal look at the genus _ lepidotus _ again persist without a modification of importance from the liassic to the eocene formation inclusively or among the teleosteus -- in what respect be the _ beryx _ of the chalk more embryonic or less differentiate than _ beryx lineatus _ of king george 's sound or to turn to the higher vertebra -- in what sense be the liassic chelonium inferior to those which now exist how be the cretaceous ichthyosaurium plesiosaurium or pterosaurium less embryonic or more differentiate species than those of the lia or lastly in what circumstance be the _ phascolotherium _ more embryonic or of a more generalised type than the modern opossum or a _ lophiodon _ or a _ paloeotherium _ than a modern _ tapirus _ or _ hyrax _ these example might be almost indefinitely multiply but surely they be sufficient to prove that the only safe and unquestionable testimony we can procure -- positive evidence -- fail to demonstrate any sort of progressive modification towards a less embryonic or less generalised type in a great many group of animal of long-continued geological existence in these group there be abundant evidence of variation -- none of what be ordinarily understand as progression and if the known geological record be to be regard as even any considerable fragment of the whole it be inconceivable that any theory of a necessarily progressive development can stand for the numerous order and family cite afford no trace of such a process but it be a most remarkable fact that while the group which have be mention and many besides exhibit no sign of progressive modification there be other co-exist with they under the same condition in which more or less distinct indication of such a process seem to be traceable among such indication i may remind you of the predominance of holostome gasteropoda in the older rock as compare with that of siphonostone gasteropoda in the later a case less open to the objection of negative evidence however be that afford by the tetrabranchiate cephalopoda the form of the shell and of the septal suture exhibit a certain increase of complexity in the newer genus here however one be meet at once with the occurrence of _ orthocera _ and _ baculite _ at the two end of the series and of the fact that one of the simplest genus _ nautilus _ be that which now exist the crinoidea in the abundance of stalk form in the ancient formation as compare with they present rarity seem to present we with a fair case of modification from a more embryonic towards a less embryonic condition but then on careful consideration of the fact the objection arise that the stalk calyx and arm of the palaeozoic crinoid be exceedingly different from the corresponding organ of a larval _ comatulum _ and it might with perfect justice be argue that _ actinocrinus _ and _ eucalyptocrinus _ for example depart to the full as widely in one direction from the stalk embryo of _ comatulum _ as _ comatulum _ itself do in the other the echinidea again be frequently quote as exhibit a gradual passage from a more generalise to a more specialised type see that the elongate or oval spatangoid appear after the spheroidal echinoid but here it might be argue on the other hand that the spheroidal echinoid in reality depart further from the general plan and from the embryonic form than the elongate spatangoid do and that the peculiar dental apparatus and the pedicellaria of the former be mark of at least as great differentiation as the petaloid ambulacra and semita of the latter once more the prevalence of macrurous before brachyurous podophthalmium be apparently a fair piece of evidence in favor of progressive modification in the same order of crustacea and yet the case will not stand much sift see that the macrurous podophthalmium depart as far in one direction from the common type of podophthalmium or from any embryonic condition of the brachyura as the brachyura do in the other and that the middle term between macrura and brachyura -- the anomura -- be little better represent in the older mesozoic rock than the brachyura be none of the case of progressive modification which be cite from among the invertebra appear to I to have a foundation less open to criticism than these and if this be so no careful reasoner would i think be incline to lay very great stress upon they among the vertebra however there be a few example which appear to be far less open to objection it be in fact true of several group of vertebra which have live through a considerable range of time that the endoskeleton -lrb- more particularly the spinal column -rrb- of the older genus present a less ossified and so far less differentiate condition than that of the younger genus thus the devonian ganoid though almost all member of the same sub-order as _ polypterus _ and present numerous important resemblance to the exist genus which possess biconclave vertebra be for the most part wholly devoid of ossified vertebral centra the mesozoic lepidosteida again have at most biconcave vertebra while the exist _ lepidosteus _ have salamandroid opisthocoelous vertebra so none of the palaeozoic shark have show themselves to be possess of ossified vertebra while the majority of modern shark possess such vertebra again the more ancient crocodilium and lacertilium have vertebra with the articular facet of they centra flatten or biconcave while the modern member of the same group have they procoelous but the most remarkable example of progressive modification of the vertebral column in correspondence with geological age be those afford by the pycnodont among fish and the labyrinthodont among amphibium the late able ichthyologist heckel point out the fact that while the pycnodont never possess true vertebral centra they differ in the degree of expansion and extension of the end of the bony arch of the vertebra upon the sheath of the notochord the carboniferous form exhibit hardly any such expansion while the mesozoic genus present a greater and greater development until in the tertiary form the expand end become suturally unite so as to form a sort of false vertebra hermann von meyer again to whose luminous research we be indebted for we present large knowledge of the organization of the older labyrinthodont have prove that the carboniferous _ archegosaurus _ have very imperfectly develop vertebral centra while the triassic _ mastodonsaurus _ have the same part completely ossify -lrb- 6 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : as this address be pass through the press -lrb- march 7 1862 -rrb- evidence lie before I of the existence of a new labyrinthodont -lrb- _ pholidogaster _ -rrb- from the edinburgh coal-field with well-ossified vertebral centra -rrb- the regularity and evenness of the dentition of the _ anoplotherium _ as contrast with that of exist artiodactyle and the assume nearer approach of the dentition of certain ancient carnivore to the typical arrangement have also be cite as exemplification of a law of progressive development but i know of no other case base on positive evidence which be worthy of particular notice what then do a impartial survey of the positively ascertain truth of palaeontology testify in relation to the common doctrine of progressive modification which suppose that modification to have take place by a necessary progress from more to less embryonic form or from more to less generalised type within the limit of the period represent by the fossiliferous rock it negative those doctrine for it either show we no evidence of any such modification or demonstrate it to have be very slight and as to the nature of that modification it yield no evidence whatsoever that the earlier member of any long-continued group be more generalise in structure than the later one to a certain extent indeed it may be say that imperfect ossification of the vertebral column be a embryonic character but on the other hand it would be extremely incorrect to suppose that the vertebral column of the older vertebra be in any sense embryonic in they whole structure obviously if the earliest fossiliferous rock now know be coval with the commencement of life and if they contents give we any just conception of the nature and the extent of the earliest fauna and flora the insignificant amount of modification which can be demonstrate to have take place in any one group of animal or plant be quite incompatible with the hypothesis that all live form be the result of a necessary process of progressive development entirely comprise within the time represent by the fossiliferous rock contrariwise any admissible hypothesis of progressive modification must be compatible with persistence without progression through indefinite period and should such a hypothesis eventually be prove to be true in the only way in which it can be demonstrate viz by observation and experiment upon the exist form of life the conclusion will inevitably present itself that the palaeozoic mesozoic and cainozoic fauna and flora take together bear somewhat the same proportion to the whole series of live being which have occupy this globe as the exist fauna and flora do to they such be the result of palaeontology as they appear and have for some year appear to the mind of a inquirer who regard that study simply as one of the application of the great biological science and who desire to see it place upon the same sound basis as other branch of physical inquiry if the argument which have be bring forward be valid probably no one in view of the present state of opinion will be incline to think the time waste which have be spend upon they elaboration x geological reform -lrb- 1869 -rrb- a great reform in geological speculation seem now to have become necessary it be quite certain that a great mistake have be make -- that british popular geology at the present time be in direct opposition to the principle of natural philosophy -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : on geological time by sir w thomson lld _ transaction of the geological society of glasgow _ vol iii -rrb- in review the course of geological think during the past year for the purpose of discover those matter to which i might most fitly direct you attention in the address which it now become my duty to deliver from the presidential chair the two somewhat alarming sentence which i have just read and which occur in a able and interesting essay by a eminent natural philosopher rise into such prominence before my mind that they eclipse everything else it surely be a matter of paramount importance for the british geologist -lrb- some of they very popular geologist too -rrb- here in solemn annual session assemble to inquire whether the severe judgment thus pass upon they by so high a authority as sir william thomson be one to which they must plead guilty _ san phrase _ or whether they be prepare to say not guilty and appeal for a reversal of the sentence to that higher court of educate scientific opinion to which we be all amenable as you attorney-general for the time be i think i could not do better than get up the case with a view of advise you it be true that the charge bring forward by the other side involve the consideration of matter quite foreign to the pursuit with which i be ordinarily occupy but in that respect i be only in the position which be nine time out of ten occupy by counsel who nevertheless contrive to gain they cause mainly by force of mother-wit and common-sense aid by some training in other intellectual exercise nerve by such precedent i proceed to put my plead before you and the first question with which i propose to deal be what be it to which sir w thomson refer when he speak of geological speculation and british popular geology i find three more or less contradictory system of geological thought each of which might fairly enough claim these appellation stand side by side in britain i shall call one of they catastrophism another uniformitarianism the third evolutionism and i shall try briefly to sketch the character of each that you may say whether the classification be or be not exhaustive by catastrophism i mean any form of geological speculation which in order to account for the phenomenon of geology suppose the operation of force different in they nature or immeasurably different in power from those which we at present see in action in the universe the mosaic cosmogony be in this sense catastrophic because it assume the operation of extra-natural power the doctrine of violent upheaval _ dbcles _ and cataclysm in general be catastrophic so far as it assume that these be bring about by cause which have now no parallel there be a time when catastrophism might pre-eminently have claim the title of british popular geology and assuredly it have yet many adherent and reckon among its supporter some of the most honor member of this society by uniformitarianism i mean especially the teaching of hutton and of lyell that great though incomplete work the theory of the earth seem to I to be one of the most remarkable contribution to geology which be record in the annals of the science so far as the not-living world be concerned uniformitarianism lie there not only in germ but in blossom and fruit if one ask how it be that hutton be lead to entertain view so far in advance of those prevalent in he time in some respects while in other they seem almost curiously limit the answer appear to I to be plain hutton be in advance of the geological speculation of he time because in the first place he have amass a vast store of knowledge of the fact of geology gather by personal observation in travels of considerable extent and because in the second place he be thoroughly train in the physical and chemical science of he day and thus possess as much as any one in he time could possess it the knowledge which be requisite for the just interpretation of geological phenomenon and the habit of thought which fit a man for scientific inquiry it be to this thorough scientific training that i ascribe hutton 's steady and persistent refusal to look to other cause than those now in operation for the explanation of geological phenomenon thus he write : -- i do not pretend as he -lrb- m de luc -rrb- do in he theory to describe the beginning of thing i take thing such as i find they at present and from these i reason with regard to that which must have be -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : _ the theory of the earth _ vol i p 173 note -rrb- and again : -- a theory of the earth which have for object truth can have no retrospect to that which have precede the present order of the world for this order alone be what we have to reason upon and to reason without datum be nothing but delusion a theory therefore which be limit to the actual constitution of this earth can not be allow to proceed one step beyond the present order of thing -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : _ ibid _ vol i p 281 -rrb- and so clear be he that no cause beside such as be now in operation be need to account for the character and disposition of the component of the crust of the earth that he say broadly and boldly : -- there be no part of the earth which have not have the same origin so far as this consist in that earth be collect at the bottom of the sea and afterwards produce as land along with mass of melted substance by the operation of mineral cause -lrb- 4 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 4 : _ ibid _ p 371 -rrb- but other influence be at work upon hutton beside those of a mind logical by nature and scientific by sound training and the peculiar turn which he speculation take seem to I to be unintelligible unless these be take into account the argument of the french astronomer and mathematician which at the end of the last century be hold to demonstrate the existence of a compensate arrangement among the celestial body whereby all perturbation eventually reduce themselves to oscillation on each side of a mean position and the stability of the solar system be secure have evidently take strong hold of hutton 's mind in those oddly construct period which seem to have prejudice many person against read he work but which be full of that peculiar if unattractive eloquence which flow from mastery of the subject hutton say : -- we have now get to the end of we reasoning we have no datum further to conclude immediately from that which actually be but we have get enough we have the satisfaction to find that in nature there be wisdom system and consistency for have in the natural history of this earth see a succession of world we may from this conclude that there be a system in nature in like manner as from see revolution of the planet it be conclude that there be a system by which they be intend to continue those revolution but if the succession of world be establish in the system of nature it be in vain to look for anything higher in the origin of the earth the result therefore of this physical inquiry be that we find no vestige of a beginning -- no prospect of a end -lrb- 5 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : _ ibid _ vol i p 200 -rrb- yet another influence work strongly upon hutton like most philosopher of he age he coquet with those final cause which have be name barren virgin but which might be more fitly term the _ hetairoe _ of philosophy so constantly have they lead man astray the final cause of the existence of the world be for hutton the production of life and intelligence we have now consider the globe of this earth as a machine construct upon chemical as well as mechanical principle by which its different part be all adapt in form in quality and in quantity to a certain end a end attain with certainty or success and a end from which we may perceive wisdom in contemplate the means employ but be this world to be consider thus merely as a machine to last no longer than its part retain they present position they proper form and quality or may it not be also consider as a organise body such as have a constitution in which the necessary decay of the machine be naturally repair in the exertion of those productive power by which it have be form this be the view in which we be now to examine the globe to see if there be in the constitution of this world a reproductive operation by which a ruin constitution may be again repair and a duration or stability thus procure to the machine consider as a world sustain plant and animal -lrb- 6 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 6 : _ ibid _ vol i pp 16 17 -rrb- kirwan and the other philistine of the day accuse hutton of declare that he theory imply that the world never have a beginning and never differ in condition from its present state nothing could be more grossly unjust as he expressly guard himself against any such conclusion in the follow term : -- but in thus trace back the natural operation which have succeed each other and mark to we the course of time past we come to a period in which we can not see any farther this however be not the beginning of the operation which proceed in time and accord to the wise economy of this world nor be it the establish of that which in the course of time have no begin it be only the limit of we retrospective view of those operation which have come to pass in time and have be conduct by supreme intelligence -lrb- 7 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 7 : _ ibid _ vol i p 223 -rrb- i have speak of uniformitarianism as the doctrine of hutton and of lyell if i have quote the older writer rather than the newer it be because he work be little known and he claim on we veneration too frequently forget not because i desire to dim the fame of he eminent successor few of the present generation of geologist have read playfair 's illustration fewer still the original theory of the earth the more be the pity but which of we have not thumb every page of the principle of geology i think that he who write fairly the history of he own progress in geological thought will not be able to separate he debt to hutton from he obligation to lyell and the history of the progress of individual geologist be the history of geology no one can doubt that the influence of uniformitarian view have be enormous and in the main most beneficial and favourable to the progress of sound geology nor can it be question that uniformitarianism have even a stronger title than catastrophism to call itself the geological speculation of britain or if you will british popular geology for it be eminently a british doctrine and have even now make comparatively little progress on the continent of europe nevertheless it seem to I to be open to serious criticism upon one of its aspect i have show how unjust be the insinuation that hutton deny a begin to the world but it would not be unjust to say that he persistently in practice shut he eye to the existence of that prior and different state of thing which in theory he admit and in this aversion to look beyond the veil of stratified rock lyell follow he hutton and lyell alike agree in they indisposition to carry they speculation a step beyond the period record in the most ancient stratum now open to observation in the crust of the earth this be for hutton the point in which we can not see any farther while lyell tell we -- the astronomer may find good reason for ascribe the earth 's form to the original fluidity of the mass in time long antecedent to the first introduction of live being into the planet but the geologist must be content to regard the earliest monument which it be he task to interpret as belong to a period when the crust have already acquire great solidity and thickness probably as great as it now possess and when volcanic rock not essentially differ from those now produce be form from time to time the intensity of volcanic heat be neither greater nor less than it be now -lrb- 8 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 8 : _ principle of geology _ vol ii p 211 -rrb- and again as geologist we learn that it be not only the present condition of the globe which have be suit to the accommodation of myriad of live creature but that many former state also have be adapt to the organization and habit of prior race of being the disposition of the sea continent and island and the climate have vary the species likewise have be change and yet they have all be so model on type analogous to those of exist plant and animal as to indicate throughout a perfect harmony of design and unity of purpose to assume that the evidence of the beginning or end of so vast a scheme lie within the reach of we philosophical inquiry or even of we speculation appear to be inconsistent with a just estimate of the relation which subsist between the finite power of man and the attribute of a infinite and eternal being -lrb- 9 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 9 : _ ibid _ vol ii p 613 -rrb- the limitation imply in these passage appear to I to constitute the weakness and the logical defect of uniformitarianism no one will impute blame to hutton that in face of the imperfect condition in he day of those physical science which furnish the key to the riddle of geology he should have think it practical wisdom to limit he theory to a attempt to account for the present order of thing but i be at a loss to comprehend why for all time the geologist must be content to regard the oldest fossiliferous rock as the _ ultima thule _ of he science or what there be inconsistent with the relation between the finite and the infinite mind in the assumption that we may discern somewhat of the beginning or of the end of this speck in space we call we earth the finite mind be certainly competent to trace out the development of the fowl within the egg and i know not on what ground it should find more difficulty in unravel the complexity of the development of the earth in fact as kant have well remark -lrb- 10 -rrb- the cosmical process be really simpler than the biological -lrb- footnote 10 : man darf es sich also nicht befremden lassen wenn ich mich unterstehe zu sagen dass eher die bildung aller himmelskrper die ursache ihrer bewegungen kurz der ursprung der gantzen gegenwrtigen verfassung des weltbaues werden knnen eingesehen werden ehe die erzeugung eine einzigen kraute oder einer raupe aus mechanischen grnden deutlich und vollstndig kund werden wird -- kant 's _ smmtliche werke _ bd i p 220 -rrb- this attempt to limit at a particular point the progress of inductive and deductive reasoning from the thing which be to those which be -- this faithlessness to its own logic seem to I to have cost uniformitarianism the place as the permanent form of geological speculation which it might otherwise have hold it remain that i should put before you what i understand to be the third phase of geological speculation -- namely evolutionism i shall not make what i have to say on this head clear unless i diverge or seem to diverge for a while from the direct path of my discourse so far as to explain what i take to be the scope of geology itself i conceive geology to be the history of the earth in precisely the same sense as biology be the history of live being and i trust you will not think that i be overpower by the influence of a dominant pursuit if i say that i trace a close analogy between these two history if i study a living be under what head do the knowledge i obtain fall i can learn its structure or what we call its anatomy and its development or the series of change which it pass through to acquire its complete structure then i find that the living being have certain power result from its own activity and the interaction of these with the activity of other thing -- the knowledge of which be physiology beyond this the living being have a position in space and time which be its distribution all these form the body of ascertainable fact which constitute the _ status quo _ of the living creature but these fact have they cause and the ascertainment of these cause be the doctrine of aetiology if we consider what be knowable about the earth we shall find that such earth-knowledge -- if i may so translate the word geology -- fall into the same category what be term stratigraphical geology be neither more nor less than the anatomy of the earth and the history of the succession of the formation be the history of a succession of such anatomy or correspond with development as distinct from generation the internal heat of the earth the elevation and depression of its crust its belching forth of vapor ash and lava be its activity in as strict a sense as be warmth and the movement and product of respiration the activity of a animal the phenomenon of the season of the trade wind of the gulf-stream be as much the result of the reaction between these inner activity and outward force as be the bud of the leaf in spring and they fall in autumn the effect of the interaction between the organization of a plant and the solar light and heat and as the study of the activity of the living be be call its physiology so be these phenomenon the subject-matter of a analogous telluric physiology to which we sometimes give the name of meteorology sometimes that of physical geography sometimes that of geology again the earth have a place in space and in time and relation to other body in both these respects which constitute its distribution this subject be usually leave to the astronomer but a knowledge of its broad outline seem to I to be a essential constituent of the stock of geological idea all that can be ascertain concern the structure succession of condition action and position in space of the earth be the matter of fact of its natural history but as in biology there remain the matter of reasoning from these fact to they cause which be just as much science as the other and indeed more and this constitute geological aetiology have regard to this general scheme of geological knowledge and think it be obvious that geological speculation may be so to speak anatomical and developmental speculation so far as it relate to point of stratigraphical arrangement which be out of reach of direct observation or it may be physiological speculation so far as it relate to undetermined problem relative to the activity of the earth or it may be distributional speculation if it deal with modification of the earth 's place in space or finally it will be aetiological speculation if it attempt to deduce the history of the world as a whole from the known property of the matter of the earth in the condition in which the earth have be place for the purpose of the present discourse i may take this last to be what be mean by geological speculation now uniformitarianism as we have see tend to ignore geological speculation in this sense altogether the one point the catastrophist and the uniformitarian agree upon when this society be found be to ignore it and you will find if you look back into we record that we revered father in geology plume themselves a good deal upon the practical sense and wisdom of this proceeding as a temporary measure i do not presume to challenge its wisdom but in all organised body temporary change be apt to produce permanent effect and as time have slip by alter all the condition which may have make such mortification of the scientific flesh desirable i think the effect of the stream of cold water which have steadily flow over geological speculation within these wall have be of doubtful beneficence the sort of geological speculation to which i be now refer -lrb- geological aetiology in short -rrb- be create as a science by that famous philosopher immanuel kant when in 1775 he write he general natural history and theory of the celestial body or a attempt to account for the constitutional and the mechanical origin of the universe upon newtonian principle -lrb- 11 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 11 : grant -lrb- _ history of physical astronomy _ p 574 -rrb- make but the briefest reference to kant -rrb- in this very remarkable but seemingly little-known treatise -lrb- 12 -rrb- kant expound a complete cosmogony in the shape of a theory of the cause which have lead to the development of the universe from diffused atom of matter endowed with simple attractive and repulsive force -lrb- footnote 12 : allgemeine naturgeschichte und theorie des himmels oder versuch von der verfassung und dem mechanischen ursprunge des ganzen weltgebudes nach newton ` schen grundsatzen abgehandelt -- kant 's _ smmtliche werke _ bd i p 207 -rrb- give I matter say kant and i will build the world and he proceed to deduce from the simple datum from which he start a doctrine in all essential respects similar to the well-known nebular hypothesis of laplace -lrb- 13 -rrb- he account for the relation of the mass and the density of the planet to they distance from the sun for the eccentricity of they orbit for they rotation for they satellite for the general agreement in the direction of rotation among the celestial body for saturn 's ring and for the zodiacal light he find in each system of world indication that the attractive force of the central mass will eventually destroy its organization by concentrate upon itself the matter of the whole system but as the result of this concentration he argue for the development of a amount of heat which will dissipate the mass once more into a molecular chaos such as that in which it begin -lrb- footnote 13 : _ systme du monde _ tome ii chap 6 -rrb- kant picture to himself the universe as once a infinite expansion of formless and diffused matter at one point of this he suppose a single center of attraction set up and by strict deduction from admit dynamical principle show how this must result in the development of a prodigious central body surround by system of solar and planetary world in all stage of development in vivid language he depict the great world-maelstrom widen the margin of its prodigious eddy in the slow progress of million of age gradually reclaim more and more of the molecular waste and convert chaos into cosmos but what be gain at the margin be lose in the center the attraction of the central system bring they constituent together which then by the heat evolve be convert once more into molecular chaos thus the world that be lie between the ruin of the world that have be and the chaotic material of the world that shall be and in spite of all waste and destruction cosmos be extend he border at the expense of chaos kant 's further application of he view to the earth itself be to be find in he treatise on physical geography -lrb- 14 -rrb- -lrb- a term under which the then unknown science of geology be include -rrb- a subject which he have study with very great care and on which he lecture for many year the fourth section of the first part of this treatise be call history of the great change which the earth have formerly undergo and be still undergo and be in fact a brief and pregnant essay upon the principle of geology kant give a account first of the gradual change which be now take place under the head of such as be cause by earthquake such as be bring about by rain and river such as be effect by the sea such as be produce by wind and frost and finally such as result from the operation of man -lrb- footnote 14 : kant 's _ smmtliche werke _ bd viii p 145 -rrb- the second part be devote to the memorial of the change which the earth have undergo in remote antiquity these be enumerate as : -- a proof that the sea formerly cover the whole earth b proof that the sea have often be change into dry land and then again into sea c a discussion of the various theory of the earth put forward by scheuchzer moro bonnet woodward white leibnitz linnaeus and buffon the third part contain a attempt to give a sound explanation of the ancient history of the earth i suppose that it would be very easy to pick hole in the detail of kant 's speculation whether cosmological or specially telluric in they application but for all that he seem to I to have be the first person to frame a complete system of geological speculation by found the doctrine of evolution with as much truth as hutton kant could say i take thing just as i find they at present and from these i reason with regard to that which must have be like hutton he be never tire of point out that in nature there be wisdom system and consistency and as in these great principle so in believe that the cosmos have a reproductive operation by which a ruin constitution may be repair he forestall hutton while on the other hand kant be true to science he know no bound to geological speculation but those of the intellect he reason back to a beginning of the present state of thing he admit the possibility of a end i have say that the three school of geological speculation which i have term catastrophism uniformitarianism and evolutionism be commonly suppose to be antagonistic to one another and i presume it will have become obvious that in my belief the last be destine to swallow up the other two but it be proper to remark that each of the latter have keep alive the tradition of precious truth catastrophism have insist upon the existence of a practically unlimited bank of force on which the theorist might draw and it have cherish the idea of the development of the earth from a state in which its form and the force which it exert be very different from those we now know that such difference of form and power once exist be a necessary part of the doctrine of evolution uniformitarianism on the other hand have with equal justice insist upon a practically unlimited bank of time ready to discount any quantity of hypothetical paper it have keep before we eye the power of the infinitely little time be grant and have compel we to exhaust known cause before fly to the unknown to my mind there appear to be no sort of necessary theoretical antagonism between catastrophism and uniformitarianism on the contrary it be very conceivable that catastrophe may be part and parcel of uniformity let I illustrate my case by analogy the working of a clock be a model of uniform action good time-keeping means uniformity of action but the striking of the clock be essentially a catastrophe the hammer might be make to blow up a barrel of gunpowder or turn on a deluge of water and by proper arrangement the clock instead of mark the hour might strike at all sort of irregular period never twice alike in the interval force or number of its blow nevertheless all these irregular and apparently lawless catastrophe would be the result of a absolutely uniformitarian action and we might have two school of clock-theorist one study the hammer and the other the pendulum still less be there any necessary antagonist between either of these doctrine and that of evolution which embrace all that be sound in both catastrophism and uniformitarianism while it reject the arbitrary assumption of the one and the as arbitrary limitation of the other nor be the value of the doctrine of evolution to the philosophic thinker diminish by the fact that it apply the same method to the living and the not-living world and embrace in one stupendous analogy the growth of a solar system from molecular chaos the shaping of the earth from the nebulous cub-hood of its youth through innumerable change and immeasurable age to its present form and the development of a living be from the shapeless mass of protoplasm we term a germ i do not know whether evolutionism can claim that amount of currency which would entitle it to be call british popular geology but more or less vaguely it be assuredly present in the mind of most geologist such be the three phase of geological speculation we be now in position to inquire which of these it be that sir william thomson call upon we to reform in the passage which i have cite it be obviously uniformitarianism which the distinguished physicist take to be the representative of geological speculation in general and thus a first issue be raise inasmuch as many person -lrb- and those not the least thoughtful among the younger geologist -rrb- do not accept strict uniformitarianism as the final form of geological speculation we should say if hutton and playfair declare the course of the world to have be always the same point out the fallacy by all means but in so do do not imagine that you be prove modern geology to be in opposition to natural philosophy i do not suppose that at the present day any geologist would be find to maintain absolute uniformitarianism to deny that the rapidity of the rotation of the earth _ may _ be diminish that the sun _ may _ be wax dim or that the earth itself _ may _ be cool most of we i suspect be gallio who care for none of these thing be of opinion that true or fictitious they have make no practical difference to the earth during the period of which a record be preserve in stratified deposit the accusation that we have be run counter to the _ principle _ of natural philosophy therefore be devoid of foundation the only question which can arise be whether we have or have not be tacitly make assumption which be in opposition to certain conclusion which may be draw from those principle and this question subdivide itself into two : -- the first be we really contravene such conclusion the second if we be be those conclusion so firmly base that we may not contravene they i reply in the negative to both these question and i will give you my reason for so do sir william thomson believe that he be able to prove by physical reasoning that the exist state of thing on the earth life on the earth -- all geological history show continuity of life -- must be limit within some such period of time as one hundred million year -lrb- _ loc cit _ p 25 -rrb- the first inquiry which arise plainly be have it ever be deny that this period _ may _ be enough for the purpose of geology the discussion of this question be greatly embarrass by the vagueness with which the assume limit be i will not say define but indicate -- some such period of past time as one hundred million year now do this mean that it may have be two or three or four hundred million year because this really make all the difference -lrb- 15 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 15 : sir william thomson imply -lrb- _ loc cit _ p 16 -rrb- that the precise time be of no consequence : the principle be the same but as the principle be admit the whole discussion turn on its practical result -rrb- i presume that 100000 foot may be take as a full allowance for the total thickness of stratified rock contain trace of life 100000 divide by 100000000 = 0001 consequently the deposit of 100000 foot of stratified rock in 100000000 year mean that the deposit have take place at the rate of 1\/1000 of a foot or say 1\/83 of a inch per annum well i do not know that any one be prepare to maintain that even make all needful allowance the stratified rock may not have be form on the average at the rate of 1\/83 of a inch per annum i suppose that if such could be show to be the limit of world-growth we could put up with the allowance without feel that we speculation have undergo any revolution and perhaps after all the qualify phrase some such period may not necessitate the assumption of more than 1\/166 or 1\/249 or 1\/332 of a inch of deposit per year which of course would give we still more ease and comfort but it may be say that it be biology and not geology which ask for so much time -- that the succession of life demand vast interval but this appear to I to be reasoning in a circle biology take she time from geology the only reason we have for believe in the slow rate of the change in live form be the fact that they persist through a series of deposit which geology inform we have take a long while to make if the geological clock be wrong all the naturalist will have to do be to modify he notion of the rapidity of change accordingly and i venture to point out that when we be tell that the limitation of the period during which living being have inhabit this planet to one two or three hundred million year require a complete revolution in geological speculation the _ onus probandus _ rest on the maker of the assertion who bring forward not a shadow of evidence in its support thus if we accept the limitation of time place before we by sir w thomson it be not obvious on the face of the matter that we shall have to alter or reform we way in any appreciable degree and we may therefore proceed with much calmness and indeed much indifference as to the result to inquire whether that limitation be justify by the argument employ in its support these argument be three in number -- i the first be base upon the undoubted fact that the tide tend to retard the rate of the earth 's rotation upon its axis that this must be so be obvious if one consider roughly that the tide result from the pull which the sun and the moon exert upon the sea cause it to act as a sort of break upon the rotate solid earth kant who be by no mean a mere abstract philosopher but a good mathematician and well verse in the physical science of he time not only prove this in a essay of exquisite clearness and intelligibility now more than a century old -lrb- 16 -rrb- but deduce from it some of its more important consequence such as the constant turning of one face of the moon towards the earth -lrb- footnote 16 : untersuchung der frage oh die erde in ihrer umdrehung um die achse wodurch sie die abwechselung des tage und der nacht hervorbringt einige vernderung seit den ersten zeiten ihre ursprunge erlitten habe & c -- kant 's _ smmntliche werke _ bd i p 178 -rrb- but there be a long step from the demonstration of a tendency to the estimation of the practical value of that tendency which be all with which we be at present concerned the fact bear on this point appear to stand as follow : -- it be a matter of observation that the moon 's mean motion be -lrb- and have for the last 3000 year be -rrb- undergo a acceleration relatively to the rotation of the earth of course this may result from one of two cause : the moon may really have be move more swiftly in its orbit or the earth may have be rotate more slowly on its axis laplace believe he have account for this phenomenon by the fact that the eccentricity of the earth 's orbit have be diminish throughout these 3000 year this would produce a diminution of the mean attraction of the sun on the moon or in other word a increase in the attraction of the earth on the moon and consequently a increase in the rapidity of the orbital motion of the latter body laplace therefore lay the responsibility of the acceleration upon the moon and if he view be correct the tidal retardation must either be insignificant in amount or be counteract by some other agency we great astronomer adam however appear to have find a flaw in laplace 's calculation and to have show that only half the observe retardation could be account for in the way he have suggest there remain therefore the other half to be account for and here in the absence of all positive knowledge three set of hypothesis have be suggest -lrb- _ a _ -rrb- m delaunay suggest that the earth be at fault in consequence of the tidal retardation messr adams thomson and tait work out this suggestion and on a certain assumption as to the proportion of retardation due to the sun and moon find the earth may lose twenty-two seconds of time in a century from this cause -lrb- 17 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 17 : sir w thomson _ loc cit _ p 14 -rrb- -lrb- _ b _ -rrb- but m dufor suggest that the retardation of the earth -lrb- which be hypothetically assume to exist -rrb- may be due in part or wholly to the increase of the moment of inertia of the earth by meteor fall upon its surface this suggestion also meet with the entire approval of sir w thomson who show that meteor-dust accumulate at the rate of one foot in 4000 year would account for the remainder of retardation -lrb- 18 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 18 : _ ibid _ p 27 -rrb- -lrb- _ c _ -rrb- thirdly sir w thomson bring forward a hypothesis of he own with respect to the cause of the hypothetical retardation of the earth 's rotation : -- let we suppose ice to melt from the polar region -lrb- 20  round each pole we may say -rrb- to the extent of something more than a foot thick enough to give 11 foot of water over those area or 0006 of a foot of water if spread over the whole globe which would in reality raise the sea-level by only some such undiscoverable difference as three-fourth of a inch or a inch this or the reverse which we believe might happen any year and could certainly not be detect without far more accurate observation and calculation for the mean sea-level than any hitherto make would slacken or quicken the earth 's rate as a timekeeper by one - tenth of a second per year -lrb- 19 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 19 : _ ibid _ -rrb- i do not presume to throw the slightest doubt upon the accuracy of any of the calculation make by such distinguished mathematician as those who have make the suggestion i have cite on the contrary it be necessary to my argument to assume that they be all correct but i desire to point out that this seem to be one of the many case in which the admit accuracy of mathematical process be allow to throw a wholly inadmissible appearance of authority over the result obtain by they mathematics may be compare to a mill of exquisite workmanship which grind you stuff of any degree of fineness but nevertheless what you get out depend upon what you put in and as the grandest mill in the world will not extract wheat-flour from peascod so page of formula will not get a definite result out of loose datum in the present instance it appear to be admit : -- 1 that it be not absolutely certain after all whether the moon 's mean motion be undergo acceleration or the earth 's rotation retardation -lrb- 20 -rrb- and yet this be the key of the whole position -lrb- footnote 20 : it will be understand that i do not wish to deny that the earth 's rotation _ may be _ undergo retardation -rrb- 2 if the rapidity of the earth 's rotation be diminish it be not certain how much of that retardation be due to tidal friction how much to meteor how much to possible excess of melting over accumulation of polar ice during the period cover by observation which amount at the outside to not more than 2600 year 3 the effect of a different distribution of land and water in modify the retardation cause by tidal friction and of reduce it under some circumstance to a minimum do not appear to be take into account 4 during the miocene epoch the polar ice be certainly many foot thinner than it have be during or since the glacial epoch sir w thomson tell we that the accumulation of something more than a foot of ice around the pole -lrb- which imply the withdrawal of say a inch of water from the general surface of the sea -rrb- will cause the earth to rotate quicker by one-tenth of a second per annum it would appear therefore that the earth may have be rotate throughout the whole period which have elapse from the commencement of the glacial epoch down to the present time one or more seconds per annum quicker than it rotate during the miocene epoch but accord to sir w thomson 's calculation tidal retardation will only account for a retardation of 22 in a century or 22\/100 -lrb- say 1\/5 -rrb- of a second per annum thus assume that the accumulation of polar ice since the miocene epoch have only be sufficient to produce ten time the effect of a coat of ice one foot thick we shall have a accelerate cause which cover all the loss from tidal action and leave a balance of 4\/5 of a second per annum in the way of acceleration if tidal retardation can be thus check and overthrow by other temporary condition what become of the confident assertion base upon the assume uniformity of tidal retardation that ten thousand million year ago the earth must have be rotate more than twice as fast as at present and therefore that we geologist be in direct opposition to the principle of natural philosophy if we spread geological history over that time ii the second argument be thus state by sir w thomson : -- a article by myself publish in ` macmillan 's magazine ' for march 1862 on the age of the sun 's heat explain result of investigation into various question as to possibility regard the amount of heat that the sun could have deal with it as you would with a stone or a piece of matter only take into account the sun 's dimension which show it to be possible that the sun may have already illuminate the earth for as many as one hundred million year but at the same time render it almost certain that he have not illuminate the earth for five hundred million of year the estimate here be necessarily very vague but yet vague as they be i do not know that it be possible upon any reasonable estimate found on known property of matter to say that we can believe the sun have really illuminate the earth for five hundred million year -lrb- 21 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 21 : _ loc cit _ p 20 -rrb- i do not wish to hansardise sir william thomson by lay much stress on the fact that only fifteen year ago he entertain a totally different view of the origin of the sun 's heat and believe that the energy radiate from year to year be supply from year to year -- a doctrine which would have suit hutton perfectly but the fact that so eminent a physical philosopher have thus recently hold view opposite to those which he now entertain and that he confess he own estimate to be very vague justly entitle we to disregard those estimate if any distinct fact on we side go against they however i be not aware that such fact exist as i have already say for anything i know one two or three hundred million of year may serve the need of geologist perfectly well iii the third line of argument be base upon the temperature of the interior of the earth sir w thomson refer to certain investigation which prove that the present thermal condition of the interior of the earth imply either a heating of the earth within the last 20000 year of as much as 100  f or a greater heating all over the surface at some time further back than 20000 year and then proceed thus : -- now be geologist prepare to admit that at some time within the last 20000 year there have be all over the earth so high a temperature as that i presume not no geologist -- no _ modern _ geologist -- would for a moment admit the hypothesis that the present state of underground heat be due to a heating of the surface at so late a period as 20000 year ago if that be not admit we be drive to a greater heat at some time more than 20000 year ago a greater heating all over the surface than 100  fahrenheit would kill nearly all exist plant and animal i may safely say be modern geologist prepare to say that all life be kill off the earth 50000 100000 or 200000 year ago for the uniformity theory the further back the time of high surface-temperature be put the better but the further back the time of heat the hotter it must have be the best for those who draw most largely on time be that which put it furthest back and that be the theory that the heating be enough to melt the whole but even if it be enough to melt the whole we must still admit some limit such as fifty million year one hundred million year or two or three hundred million year ago beyond that we can not go -lrb- 22 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 22 : _ loc cit _ p 24 -rrb- it will be observe that the limit be once again of the vaguest range from 50000000 year to 300000000 and the reply be once more that for anything that can be prove to the contrary one or two hundred million year might serve the purpose even of a thoroughgoing huttonian uniformitarian very well but if on the other hand the 100000000 or 200000000 year appear to be insufficient for geological purpose we must closely criticise the method by which the limit be reach the argument be simple enough _ assume _ the earth to be nothing but a cooling mass the quantity of heat lose per year _ suppose _ the rate of cool to have be uniform multiply by any give number of year will be give the minimum temperature that number of year ago but be the earth nothing but a cooling mass like a hot-water jar such as be use in carriage or a globe of sandstone and have its cooling be uniform a affirmative answer to both these question seem to be necessary to the validity of the calculation on which sir w thomson lay so much stress nevertheless it surely may be urge that such affirmative answer be purely hypothetical and that other supposition have a equal right to consideration for example be it not possible that at the prodigious temperature which would seem to exist at 100 mile below the surface all the metallic basis may behave as mercury do at a red heat when it refuse to combine with oxygen while nearer the surface and therefore at a lower temperature they may enter into combination -lrb- as mercury do with oxygen a few degree below its boiling-point -rrb- and so give rise to a heat totally distinct from that which they possess as cooling body and have it not also be prove by recent research that the quality of the atmosphere may immensely affect its permeability to heat and consequently profoundly modify the rate of cool the globe as a whole i do not think it can be deny that such condition may exist and may so greatly affect the supply and the loss of terrestrial heat as to destroy the value of any calculation which leave they out of sight my function as you advocate be at a end i speak with more than the sincerity of a mere advocate when i express the belief that the case against we have entirely break down the cry for reform which have be raise without be superfluous inasmuch as we have long be reform from within with all needful speed and the critical examination of the grounds upon which the very grave charge of opposition to the principle of natural philosophy have be bring against we rather show that we have exercise a wise discrimination in decline for the present to meddle with we foundation xi palaeontology and the doctrine of evolution -lrb- 1870 -rrb- it be now eight year since in the absence of the late mr leonard horner who then preside over we it fall to my lot as one of the secretary of this society to draw up the customary annual address i availed myself of the opportunity to endeavor to take stock of that portion of the science of biology which be commonly call palaeontology as it then exist and discuss one after another the doctrine hold by palaeontologist i put before you the result of my attempt to sift the well-established from the hypothetical or the doubtful permit I briefly to recall to you mind what those result be : -- 1 the live population of all part of the earth 's surface which have yet be examine have undergo a succession of change which upon the whole have be of a slow and gradual character 2 when the fossil remain which be the evidence of these successive change as they have occur in any two more or less distant part of the surface of the earth be compare they exhibit a certain broad and general parallelism in other word certain form of life in one locality occur in the same general order of succession as or be _ homotaxial _ with similar form in the other locality 3 homotaxi be not to be hold identical with synchronism without independent evidence it be possible that similar or even identical fauna and flora in two different locality may be of extremely different age if the term age be use in its proper chronological sense i state that geographical province or zone may have be as distinctly mark in the palaeozoic epoch as at present and those seemingly sudden appearance of new genus and species which we ascribe to new creation may be simple result of migration 4 the opinion that the oldest known fossil be the earliest form of life have no solid foundation 5 if we confine ourselves to positively ascertain fact the total amount of change in the form of animal and vegetable life since the existence of such form be record be small when compare with the lapse of time since the first appearance of these form the amount of change be wonderfully small moreover in each great group of the animal and vegetable kingdom there be certain form which i term persistent type which have remain with but very little apparent change from they first appearance to the present time 6 in answer to the question what then do a impartial survey of the positively ascertain truth of palaeontology testify in relation to the common doctrine of progressive modification which suppose that modification to have take place by a necessary progress from more to less embryonic form from more to less generalised type within the limit of the period represent by the fossiliferous rock i reply it negative these doctrine for it either show we no evidence of such modification or demonstrate such modification as have occur to have be very slight and as to the nature of that modification it yield no evidence whatsoever that the earlier member of any long-continued group be more generalise in structure than the later one i think that i can not employ my last opportunity of address you officially more properly -- i may say more dutifully -- than in revise these old judgment with such help as further knowledge and reflection and a extreme desire to get at the truth may afford I 1 with respect to the first proposition i may remark that whatever may be the case among the physical geologist catastrophic palaeontologist be practically extinct it be now no part of recognize geological doctrine that the species of one formation all die out and be replace by a brand-new set in the next formation on the contrary it be generally if not universally agree that the succession of life have be the result of a slow and gradual replacement of species by species and that all appearance of abruptness of change be due to break in the series of deposit or other change in physical condition the continuity of live form have be unbroken from the earliest time to the present day 2 3 the use of the word homotaxi instead of synchronism have not so far as i know find much favor in the eye of geologist i hope therefore that it be a love for scientific caution and not mere personal affection for a bantling of my own which lead I still to think that the change of phrase be of importance and that the sooner it be make the sooner shall we get rid of a number of pitfall which beset the reasoner upon the fact and theory of geology one of the latest piece of foreign intelligence which have reach we be the information that the austrian geologist have at last succumb to the weighty evidence which m barrande have accumulate and have admit the doctrine of colony but the admission of the doctrine of colony imply the further admission that even identity of organic remains be no proof of the synchronism of the deposit which contain they 4 the discussion touch the _ eozoon _ which commence in 1864 have abundantly justified the fourth proposition in 1862 the oldest record of life be in the cambrian rock but if the _ eozoon _ be as principal dawson and dr carpenter have show so much reason for believe the remains of a living be the discovery of its true nature carry life back to a period which as sir william logan have observe be as remote from that during which the cambrian rock be deposit as the cambrian epoch itself be from the tertiary in other word the ascertain duration of life upon the globe be nearly double at a stroke 5 the significance of persistent type and of the small amount of change which have take place even in those form which can be show to have be modify become greater and greater in my eye the longer i occupy myself with the biology of the past consider how long a time have elapse since the miocene epoch yet at that time there be reason to believe that every important group in every order of the _ mammalium _ be represent even the comparatively scanty eocene fauna yield example of the order _ cheiroptera insectivora rodentium _ and _ perissodactylum _ of _ artiodactylum _ under both the ruminant and the porcine modification of _ caranivora cetacea _ and _ marsupialium _ or if we go back to the older half of the mesozoic epoch how truly surprising it be to find every order of the _ reptilium _ except the _ ophidium _ represent while some group such as the _ ornithoseclida _ and the _ pterosaurium _ more specialised than any which now exist abound there be one division of the _ amphibium _ which offer especially important evidence upon this point inasmuch as it bridge over the gap between the mesozoic and the palaeozoic formation -lrb- often suppose to be of such prodigious magnitude -rrb- extend as it do from the bottom of the carboniferous series to the top of the tria if not into the lias i refer to the labyrinthodont as the address of 1862 be pass through the press i be able to mention in a note the discovery of a large labyrinthodont with well-ossified vertebra in the edinburgh coal-field since that time eight or ten distinct genus of labyrinthodont have be discover in the carboniferous rock of england scotland and ireland not to mention the american form describe by principal dawson and professor cope so that at the present time the labyrinthodont fauna of the carboniferous rock be more extensive and diversified than that of the tria while its chief type so far as osteology enable we to judge be quite as highly organised thus it be certain that a comparatively highly organised vertebrate type such as that of the labyrinthodont be capable of persist with no considerable change through the period represent by the vast deposit which constitute the carboniferous the permian and the triassic formation the very remarkable result which have be bring to light by the sound and dredge operation which have be carry on with such remarkable success by the expedition send out by we own the american and the swedish government under the supervision of able naturalist have a bearing in the same direction these investigation have demonstrate the existence at great depths in the ocean of live animal in some case identical with in other very similar to those which be find fossilised in the white chalk the _ globigerinoe _ cyatholith coccosphere discolith in the one be absolutely identical with those in the other there be identical or closely analogous species of sponge echinoderm and brachiopod off the coast of portugal there now live a species of _ beryx _ which doubtless leave its bone and scale here and there in the atlantic ooze as its predecessor leave its spoil in the mud of the sea of the cretaceous epoch many year ago -lrb- 1 -rrb- i venture to speak of the atlantic mud as modern chalk and i know of no fact inconsistent with the view which professor wyville thomson have advocate that the modern chalk be not only the lineal descendant of the ancient chalk but that it remain so to speak in the possession of the ancestral estate and that from the cretaceous period -lrb- if not much earlier -rrb- to the present day the deep sea have cover a large part of what be now the area of the atlantic but if _ globigerina _ and _ terebratulum caput-serpenti _ and _ beryx _ not to mention other form of animal and of plant thus bridge over the interval between the present and the mesozoic period be it possible that the majority of other live thing undergo a sea-change into something new and strange all at once -lrb- footnote 1 : see a article in the _ Saturday review _ for 1858 on chalk ancient and modern -rrb- 6 thus far i have endeavor to expand and to enforce by fresh argument but not to modify in any important respect the idea submit to you on a former occasion but when i come to the proposition touch progressive modification it appear to I with the help of the new light which have break from various quarter that there be much ground for soften the somewhat brutus-like severity with which in 1862 i deal with a doctrine for the truth of which i should have be glad enough to be able to find a good foundation so far indeed as the _ invertebra _ and the lower _ vertebra _ be concern the fact and the conclusion which be to be draw from they appear to I to remain what they be for anything that as yet appear to the contrary the earliest known marsupial may have be as highly organise as they living congener the permian lizard show no sign of inferiority to those of the present day the labyrinthodont can not be place below the living salamander and triton the devonian ganoid be closely related to _ polypterus _ and to _ lepidosiren _ but when we turn to the higher _ vertebra _ the result of recent investigation however we may sift and criticise they seem to I to leave a clear balance in favor of the doctrine of the evolution of live form one from another nevertheless in discuss this question it be very necessary to discriminate carefully between the different kind of evidence from fossil remains which be bring forward in favor of evolution every fossil which take a intermediate place between form of life already know may be say so far as it be intermediate to be evidence in favor of evolution inasmuch as it show a possible road by which evolution may have take place but the mere discovery of such a form do not in itself prove that evolution take place by and through it nor do it constitute more than presumptive evidence in favor of evolution in general suppose a b c to be three form while b be intermediate in structure between a and c then the doctrine of evolution offer four possible alternative a may have become c by way of b or c may have become a by way of b or a and c may be independent modification of b or a b and c may be independent modification of some unknown d take the case of the pig the _ anoplothcridoe _ and the ruminant the _ anoplothcridoe _ be intermediate between the first and the last but this do not tell we whether the ruminant have come from the pig or the pig from ruminant or both from _ anoplothcridoe _ or whether pig ruminant and _ anoplotlicridoe _ alike may not have diverge from some common stock but if it can be show that a b and c exhibit successive stage in the degree of modification or specialisation of the same type and if further it can be prove that they occur in successively newer deposit a being in the oldest and c in the newest then the intermediate character of b have quite another importance and i should accept it without hesitation as a link in the genealogy of c i should consider the burden of proof to be throw upon any one who deny c to have be derive from a by way of b or in some closely analogous fashion for it be always probable that one may not hit upon the exact line of filiation and in deal with fossil may mistake uncle and nephew for father and son i think it necessary to distinguish between the former and the latter class of intermediate form as _ intercalary type _ and _ linear type _ when i apply the former term i merely mean to say that as a matter of fact the form b so name be intermediate between the other in the sense in which the _ anoplotherium _ be intermediate between the pig and the ruminant -- without either affirm or deny any direct genetic relation between the three form involve when i apply the latter term on the other hand i mean to express the opinion that the form a b and c constitute a line of descent and that b be thus part of the lineage of c from the time when cuvier 's wonderful research upon the extinct mammal of the paris gypsum first make intercalary type know and cause they to be recognize as such the number of such form have steadily increase among the higher _ mammalia _ not only do we now know numerous intercalary forin of _ ungulata _ but m gaudry 's great monograph upon the fossil of pikermus -lrb- which strike I as one of the most perfect piece of palaeontological work i have see for a long time -rrb- show we among the primate _ mesopithecus _ as a intercalary form between the _ semnopithecus _ and the _ macaci _ and among the _ carnivora _ _ hyoenictis _ and _ ictitherium _ as intercalary or perhaps linear type between the _ viverridoe _ and the _ hyoenidoe _ hardly any order of the higher _ mammalium _ stand so apparently separate and isolate from the rest as that of the _ cetacea _ though a careful consideration of the structure of the pinnipede _ carnivora _ or seal show in they many a approximation towards the still more completely marine mammal the extinct _ zeuglodon _ however present we with a intercalary form between the type of the seal and that of the whale the skull of this great eocene sea-monster in fact show by the narrow and prolonged interorbital region the extensive union of the parietal bone in a sagittal suture the well-developed nasal bone the distinct and large incisor implant in premaxillary bone which take a full share in bound the fore part of the gape the two-fanged molar tooth with triangular and serrated crown not exceed five on each side in each jaw and the existence of a deciduous dentition -- its close relation with the seal while on the other hand the produce rostral form of the snout the long symphysis and the low coronary process of the mandible be approximation to the cetacean form of those part the scapula resemble that of the cetacean _ hyperoodon _ but the supra - spinous fossa be larger and more seal-like as be the humerus which differ from that of the _ cetacea _ in present true articular surface for the free jointing of the bone of the fore-arm in the apparently complete absence of hinder limb and in the character of the vertebral column the _ zeuglodon _ lie on the cetacean side of the boundary line so that upon the whole the zeuglodont transitional as they be be conveniently retain in the cetacean order and the publication in 1864 of m van beneden 's memoir on the miocene and pliocene _ squalodon _ furnish much better means than anatomist previously possess of fitting in another link of the chain which connect the exist _ cetacea _ with _ zeuglodon _ the tooth be much more numerous although the molar exhibit the zeuglodont double fang the nasal bone be very short and the upper surface of the rostrum present the groove fill up during life by the prolongation of the ethmoidal cartilage which be so characteristic of the majority of the _ cetacea _ it appear to I that just as among the exist _ carnivora _ the walrus and the eared seal be intercalary form between the fissipede carnivora and the ordinary seal so the zeuglodont be intercalary between the _ carnivora _ as a whole and the _ cetacea _ whether the zeuglodont be also linear type in they relation to these two group can not be ascertain until we have more definite knowledge than we possess at present respect the relation in time of the _ carnivora _ and _ cetacea _ thus far we have be concern with the intercalary type which occupy the interval between family or order of the same class but the investigation which have be carry on by professor gegenbaur professor cope and myself into the structure and relation of the extinct reptilian form of the _ ornithoscelida _ -lrb- or _ dinosaurium _ and _ compsognatha _ -rrb- have bring to light the existence of intercalary form between what have hitherto be always regard as very distinct class of the vertebrate sub-kingdom namely _ reptilium _ and _ ave _ whatever inference may or may not be draw from the fact it be now a established truth that in many of these _ ornithoscelida _ the hind limb and the pelvis be much more similar to those of bird than they be to those of reptile and that these bird-reptile or reptile-bird be more or less completely bipedal when i address you in 1862 i should have be bold indeed have i suggest that palaeontology would before long show we the possibility of a direct transition from the type of the lizard to that of the ostrich at the present moment we have in the _ ornithoscelida _ the intercalary type which prove that transition to be something more than a possibility but it be very doubtful whether any of the genus of _ ornithoscelida _ with which we be at present acquaint be the actual linear type by which the transition from the lizard to the bird be effect these very probably be still hide from we in the older formation let we now endeavor to find some case of true linear type or form which be intermediate between other because they stand in a direct genetic relation to they it be no easy matter to find clear and unmistakable evidence of filiation among fossil animal for in order that such evidence should be quite satisfactory it be necessary that we should be acquaint with all the most important feature of the organization of the animal which be suppose to be thus related and not merely with the fragment upon which the genus and species of the palaeontologist be so often base m gaudry have arrange the species of _ hyoenidoe proboscidea rhinocerotidoe _ and _ equidoe _ in they order of filiation from they earliest appearance in the miocene epoch to the present time and professor rtimeyer have draw up similar scheme for the ox and other _ ungulata _ -- with what i be dispose to think be a fair and probable approximation to the order of nature but as no one be better aware than these two learn acute and philosophical biologist all such arrangement must be regard as provisional except in those case in which by a fortunate accident large series of remains be obtainable from a thick and widespread series of deposit it be easy to accumulate probability -- hard to make out some particular case in such a way that it will stand rigorous criticism after much search however i think that such a case be to be make out in favor of the pedigree of the horse the genus _ equus _ be represent as far back as the latter part of the miocene epoch but in deposit belong to the middle of that epoch its place be take by two other genus _ hipparion _ and _ anchitherium _ -lrb- 2 -rrb- and in the lowest miocene and upper eocene only the last genus occur a species of _ anchitherium _ be refer by cuvier to the _ paloeotherium _ under the name of _ p aurelianense _ the grinding-tooth be in fact very similar in shape and in pattern and in the absence of any thick layer of cement to those of some species of _ paloeotherium _ especially cuvier 's _ paloeotherium minus _ which have be form into a separate genus _ plagiolophus _ by pomel but in the fact that there be only six full - size grinder in the lower jaw the first premolar be very small that the anterior grinder be as large as or rather larger than the posterior one that the second premolar have a anterior prolongation and that the posterior molar of the lower jaw have as cuvier point out a posterior lobe of much smaller size and different form the dentition of _ anchitherium _ depart from the type of the _ paloeotherium _ and approach that of the horse -lrb- footnote 2 : hermann von meyer give the name of _ anchitherium _ to _ a ezquerroe _ and in he paper on the subject he take great pain to distinguish the latter as the type of a new genus from cuvier 's _ paloeotherium d'orlans _ but it be precisely the _ paloeotherium d'orlans _ which be the type of christol 's genus _ hipparitherium _ and thus though _ hipparitherium _ be of later date than _ anchitherium _ it seem to I to have a sort of equitable right to recognition when this address be write on the whole however it seem most convenient to adopt _ anchitherium _ -rrb- again the skeleton of _ anchitherium _ be extremely equine m christol go so far as to say that the description of the bone of the horse or the ass current in veterinary work would fit those of _ anchitherium _ and in a general way this may be true enough but there be some most important difference which indeed be justly indicate by the same careful observer thus the ulna be complete throughout and its shaft be not a mere rudiment fuse into one bone with the radius there be three toe one large in the middle and one small on each side the femur be quite like that of a horse and have the characteristic fossa above the external condyle in the british museum there be a most instructive specimen of the leg-bone show that the fibula be represent by the external malleolus and by a flat tongue of bone which extend up from it on the outer side of the tibia and be closely ankylose with the latter bone -lrb- 3 -rrb- the hind toe be three like those of the fore leg and the middle metatarsal bone be much less compress from side to side than that of the horse -lrb- footnote 3 : i be indebted to m gervai for a specimen which indicate that the fibula be complete at any rate in some case and for a very interesting ramp of a mandible which show that as in the _ paloeotherium _ the hindermost milk-molar of the lower jaw be devoid of the posterior lobe which exist in the hindermost true molar -rrb- in the _ hipparion _ the tooth nearly resemble those of the horse though the crown of the grinder be not so long like those of the horse they be abundantly coat with cement the shaft of the ulna be reduce to a mere style ankylose throughout nearly its whole length with the radius and appear to be little more than a ridge on the surface of the latter bone until it be carefully examine the front toe be still three but the outer one be more slender than in _ anchitherium _ and they hoof smaller in proportion to that of the middle toe they be in fact reduce to mere dew-claw and do not touch the ground in the leg the distal end of the fibula be so completely unite with the tibia that it appear to be a mere process of the latter bone as in the horse in _ equus _ finally the crown of the grinding-teeth become longer and they pattern be slightly modify the middle of the shaft of the ulna usually vanish and its proximal and distal end ankylose with the radius the phalanx of the two outer toe in each foot disappear they metacarpal and metatarsal bone be leave as the splint the _ hipparion _ have large depression on the face in front of the orbit like those for the larmier of many ruminant but trace of these be to be see in some of the fossil horse from the sewalik hill and as leidy 's recent research show they be preserve in _ anchitherium _ when we consider these fact and the further circumstance that the hipparion the remains of which have be collect in immense number be subject as m gaudry and other have point out to a great range of variation it appear to I impossible to resist the conclusion that the type of the _ anchitherium _ of the _ hipparion _ and of the ancient horse constitute the lineage of the modern horse the _ hipparion _ be the intermediate stage between the other two and answer to b in my former illustration the process by which the _ anchitherium _ have be convert into _ equus _ be one of specialisation or of more and more complete deviation from what might be call the average form of a ungulate mammal in the horse the reduction of some part of the limb together with the special modification of those which be leave be carry to a greater extent than in any other hoofed mammal the reduction be less and the specialisation be less in the _ hipparion _ and still less in the _ anchitherium _ but yet as compare with other mammal the reduction and specialisation of part in the _ anchitherium _ remain great be it not probable then that just as in the miocene epoch we find a ancestral equine form less modify than _ equus _ so if we go back to the eocene epoch we shall find some quadruped related to the _ anchitherium _ as _ hipparion _ be relate to _ equus _ and consequently depart less from the average form i think that this desideratum be very nearly if not quite supply by _ plagiolophus _ remain of which occur abundantly in some part of the upper and middle eocene formation the pattern of the grinding-tooth of _ plagiolophus _ be similar to those of _ anchitherium _ and they crown be as thinly cover with cement but the grinder diminish in size forwards and the last lower molar have a large hind lobe convex outwards and concave inwards as in _ palueotherium _ the ulna be complete and much larger than in any of the _ equidoe _ while it be more slender than in most of the true _ paloeotherium _ it be fixedly unite but not ankylose with the radius there be three toe in the fore limb the outer one be slender but less attenuate than in the _ equidoe _ the femur be more like that of the _ paloeotherium _ than that of the horse and have only a small depression above its outer condyle in the place of the great fossa which be so obvious in the _ equidoe _ the fibula be distinct but very slender and its distal end be ankylose with the tibia there be three toe on the hind foot have similar proportion to those on the fore foot the principal metacarpal and metatarsal bone be flatter than they be in any of the _ equidoe _ and the metacarpal bone be longer than the metatarsal as in the _ paloeotherium _ in its general form _ plagiolophus _ resemble a very small and slender horse -lrb- 4 -rrb- and be totally unlike the reluctant pig-like creature depict in cuvier 's restoration of he _ paloeotherium minus _ in the ossemen fossile -lrb- footnote 4 : such at least be the conclusion suggest by the proportion of the skeleton figure by cuvier and de blainville but perhaps something between a horse and a agoutus would be nearest the mark -rrb- it would be hazardous to say that _ plagiolophus _ be the exact radical form of the equine quadruped but i do not think there can be any reasonable doubt that the latter animal have result from the modification of some quadruped similar to _ plagiolophus _ we have thus arrive at the middle eocene formation and yet have trace back the horse only to a three-toed stock but these three-toed form no less than the equine quadruped themselves present rudiment of the two other toe which appertain to what i have term the average quadruped if the expectation raise by the splint of the horse that in some ancestor of the horse these splint would be find to be complete digit have be verify we be furnish with very strong reason for look for a no less complete verification of the expectation that the three-toed _ plagiolophus _ - like avus of the horse must have have a five-toed atavus at some earlier period no such five-toed atavus however have yet make its appearance among the few middle and older eocene _ mammalium _ which be know another series of closely affiliated form though the evidence they afford be perhaps less complete than that of the equine series be present to we by the _ dichobune _ of the eocene epoch the _ cainotherium _ of the miocene and the _ tragulidoe _ or so-called musk - deer of the present day the _ tragulidoe _ have no incisor in the upper jaw and only six grinding-tooth on each side of each jaw while the canine be move up to the outer incisor and there be a diastema in the lower jaw there be four complete toe on the hind foot but the middle metatarsal usually become sooner or later ankylose into a cannon bone the navicular and the cuboid unite and the distal end of the fibula be ankylose with the tibia in _ cainotherium _ and _ dichobune _ the upper incisor be fully develop there be seven grinder the tooth form a continuous series without a diastema the metatarsal the navicular and cuboid and the distal end of the fibula remain free in the _ cainotherium _ also the second metacarpal be develop but be much shorter than the third while the fifth be absent or rudimentary in this respect it resemble _ anoplotherium secundarium _ this circumstance and the peculiar pattern of the upper molar in _ cainotherium _ lead I to hesitate in consider it as the actual ancestor of the modern _ tragulidoe _ if _ dichobune _ have a fore-toed fore foot -lrb- though i be incline to suspect that it resemble _ cainotherium _ -rrb- it will be a better representative of the oldest form of the traguline series but _ dichobune _ occur in the middle eocene and be in fact the oldest known artiodactyle mammal where then must we look for its five-toed ancestor if we follow down other line of recent and tertiary _ ungulata _ the same question present itself the pig be traceable back through the miocene epoch to the upper eocene where they appear in the two well-marked form of _ hyopopotamus _ and _ choeropotamus _ but _ hyopotamus _ appear to have have only two toe again all the great group of the ruminant the _ bovidoe antilopidoe camelopardalidoe _ and _ cervidoe _ be represent in the miocene epoch and so be the camel the upper eocene _ anoplotherium _ which be intercalary between the pig and the _ tragulidoe _ have only two or at most three toe among the scanty mammal of the lower eocene formation we have the perissodactyle _ ungulata _ represent by _ coryphodon hyracotherium _ and _ pliolophus _ suppose for a moment for the sake of follow out the argument that _ pliolophus _ represent the primary stock of the perissodactyle and _ dichobune _ that of the artiodactyle -lrb- though i be far from say that such be the case -rrb- then we find in the earliest fauna of the eocene epoch to which we investigation carry we the two division of the _ ungulata _ completely differentiate and no trace of any common stock of both or of five-toed predecessor to either with the case of the horse before we justify a belief in the production of new animal form by modification of old one i see no escape from the necessity of seek for these ancestor of the _ ungulata _ beyond the limit of the tertiary formation i could as soon admit special creation at once as suppose that the perissodactyle and artiodactyle have no five-toed ancestor and when we consider how large a portion of the tertiary period elapse before _ anchitherium _ be convert into _ equus _ it be difficult to escape the conclusion that a large proportion of time anterior to the tertiary period must have be expend in convert the common stock of the _ ungulata _ into perissodactyle and artiodactyle the same moral be inculcate by the study of every other order of tertiary monodelphous _ mammalium _ each of these order be represent in the miocene epoch : the eocene formation as i have already say contain _ cheiroptera insectivora rodentium ungulata carnivora _ and _ cetacea _ but the _ cheiroptera _ be extreme modification of the _ insectivora _ just as the _ cetacea _ be extreme modification of the carnivorous type and therefore it be to my mind incredible that monodelphous _ insectivora _ and _ carnivora _ should not have be abundantly develop along with _ ungulata _ in the mesozoic epoch but if this be the case how much further back must we go to find the common stock of the monodelphous _ mammalium _ as to the _ didelphium _ if we may trust the evidence which seem to be afford by they very scanty remain a hypsiprymnoid form exist at the epoch of the tria contemporaneously with a carnivorous form at the epoch of the tria therefore the _ marsupialium _ must have already exist long enough to have become differentiate into carnivorous and herbivorous form but the _ monotremata _ be lower form than the _ didelphium _ which last be intercalary between the _ ornithodelphium _ and the _ monodelphium _ to what point of the palaeozoic epoch then must we upon any rational estimate relegate the origin of the _ monotremata _ the investigation of the occurrence of the class and of the order of the _ sauropsida _ in time point in exactly the same direction if as there be great reason to believe true bird exist in the triassic epoch the ornithoscelidous form by which reptile pass into bird must have precede they in fact there be even at present considerable ground for suspect the existence of _ dinosaurium _ in the permian formation but in that case lizard must be of still earlier date and if the very small difference which be observable between the _ crocodilium _ of the older mesozoic formation and those of the present day furnish any sort of approximation towards a estimate of the average rate of change among the _ sauropsida _ it be almost appalling to reflect how far back in palaeozoic time we must go before we can hope to arrive at that common stock from which the _ crocodilium lacertilium ornithoscelida _ and _ plesiosaurium _ which have attain so great a development in the triassic epoch must have be derive the _ amphibium _ and _ pisces _ tell the same story there be not a single class of vertebrated animal which when it first appear be represent by analog of the lowest known member of the same class therefore if there be any truth in the doctrine of evolution every class must be vastly older than the first record of its appearance upon the surface of the globe but if consideration of this kind compel we to place the origin of vertebrated animal at a period sufficiently distant from the upper silurian in which the first elasmobranch and ganoid occur to allow of the evolution of such fish as these from a vertebrate as simple as the _ amphioxus _ i can only repeat that it be appalling to speculate upon the extent to which that origin must have precede the epoch of the first recorded appearance of vertebrate life such be the further commentary which i have to offer upon the statement of the chief result of palaeontology which i formerly venture to lay before you but the growth of knowledge in the interval make I conscious of a omission of considerable moment in that statement inasmuch as it contain no reference to the bearing of palaeontology upon the theory of the distribution of life nor take note of the remarkable manner in which the fact of distribution in present and past time accord with the doctrine of evolution especially in regard to land animal that connection between palaeontology and geology and the present distribution of terrestrial animal which so strikingly impressed mr darwin thirty year ago as to lead he to speak of a law of succession of type and of the wonderful relationship on the same continent between the dead and the living have recently receive much elucidation from the research of gaudry of rutimeyer of leidy and of alphonse milne-edwards take in connection with the earlier labor of we lament colleague falconer and it have be instructively discuss in the thoughtful and ingenious work of mr andrew murray on the geographical distribution of mammal -lrb- 5 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 5 : the paper on the form and distribution of the landtract during the secondary and tertiary period respectively and on the effect upon animal life which great change in geographical configuration have probably produce by mr searle v wood jun which be publish in the _ philosophical magazine _ in 1862 be unknown to I when this address be write it be well worthy of the most careful study -rrb- i propose to lay before you as briefly as i can the idea to which a long consideration of the subject have give rise in my mind if the doctrine of evolution be sound one of its immediate consequence clearly be that the present distribution of life upon the globe be the product of two factor the one be the distribution which obtain in the immediately precede epoch and the other the character and the extent of the change which have take place in physical geography between the one epoch and the other or to put the matter in another way the fauna and flora of any give area in any give epoch can consist only of such form of life as be directly descend from those which constitute the fauna and flora of the same area in the immediately precede epoch unless the physical geography -lrb- under which i include climatal condition -rrb- of the area have be so altered as to give rise to immigration of live form from some other area the evolutionist therefore be bind to grapple with the follow problem whenever it be clearly put before he : -- here be the fauna of the same area during successive epoch show good cause for believe either that these fauna have be derive from one another by gradual modification or that the fauna have reach the area in question by migration from some area in which they have undergo they development i propose to attempt to deal with this problem so far as it be exemplify by the distribution of the terrestrial _ vertebra _ and i shall endeavor to show you that it be capable of solution in a sense entirely favourable to the doctrine of evolution i have elsewhere -lrb- 6 -rrb- state at length the reason which lead I to recognize four primary distributional province for the terrestrial _ vertebra _ in the present world namely -- first the _ novozelanian _ or new-zealand province secondly the _ australian _ province include australium tasmanium and the negrito island thirdly _ austro-columbia _ or south america _ plus _ north america as far as mexico and fourthly the rest of the world or _ arctogoea _ in which province america north of mexico constitute one sub-province africa south of the sahara a second hindostan a third and the remainder of the old world a fourth -lrb- footnote 6 : on the classification and distribution of the alectoromorphoe _ proceedings of the zoological society _ 1868 -rrb- now the truth which mr darwin perceive and promulgate as the law of the succession of type be that in all these province the animal find in pliocene or later deposit be closely affine to those which now inhabit the same province and that conversely the form characteristic of other province be absent north and south america perhaps present one or two exception to the last rule but they be readily susceptible of explanation thus in australium the later tertiary mammal be marsupial -lrb- possibly with the exception of the dog and a rodent or two as at present -rrb- in austro-columbium the later tertiary fauna exhibit numerous and varied form of platyrrhine ape rodent cat dog stag _ edentata _ and opossum but as at present no catarrhine ape no lemurs no _ insectivora _ ox antelope rhinoceros nor _ didelphium _ other than opossum and in the widespread arctogaeal province the pliocene and later mammal belong to the same group as those which now exist in the province the law of succession of type therefore hold good for the present epoch as compare with its predecessor do it equally well apply to the pliocene fauna when we compare it with that of the miocene epoch by great good fortune a extensive mammalian fauna of the latter epoch have now become know in four very distant portion of the arctogaeal province which do not differ greatly in latitude thus falconer and cautley have make know the fauna of the sub-himalaya and the perim island gaudry that of attica many observer that of central europe and france and leidy that of nebraska on the eastern flank of the rocky mountain the result be very striking the total miocene fauna comprise many genus and species of catarrhine ape of bat of _ insectivora _ of arctogaeal type of _ rodentium _ of _ proboscidea _ of equine rhinocerotic and tapirine quadruped of cameline bovine antilopine cervine and traguline ruminant of pig and hippopotamus of _ viverridoe _ and _ hyoenidoe _ among other _ carnivora _ with _ edentata _ ally to the aretogaeal _ oryeteropus _ and _ mani _ and not to the austro-columbian edentate the only type present in the miocene but absent in the exist fauna of eastern arctogaea be that of the _ didelphidoe _ which however remain in north america but it be very remarkable that while the miocene fauna of the arctogaeal province as a whole be of the same character as the exist fauna of the same province as a whole the component element of the fauna be differently associate in the miocene epoch north america possess elephant horse rhinoceros and a great number and variety of ruminant and pig which be absent in the present indigenous fauna europe have its ape elephant rhinoceros tapir musk-deer giraffe hyaenas great cat edentate and opossum-like marsupial which have equally vanish from its present fauna and in northern indium the african type of hippopotamus giraffe and elephant be mix up with what be now the asiatic type of the latter and with camel and semnopithecine and pithecine ape of no less distinctly asiatic form in fact the miocene mammalian fauna of europe and the himalayan region contain associate together the type which be at present separately located in the south-african and indian sub-province of arctogaea now there be every reason to believe on other grounds that both hindostan south of the gange and africa south of the sahara be separate by a wide sea from europe and north asia during the middle and upper eocene epoch hence it become highly probable that the well-known similarity and no less remarkable difference between the present fauna of indium and south africa have arise in some such fashion as the follow some time during the miocene epoch possibly when the himalayan chain be elevated the bottom of the nummulitic sea be upheaved and convert into dry land in the direction of a line extend from abyssinium to the mouth of the gange by this mean the dekhan on the one hand and south africa on the other become connect with the miocene dry land and with one another the miocene mammal spread gradually over this intermediate dry land and if the condition of its eastern and western end offer as wide contrast as the valley of the gange and arabium do now many form which make they way into africa must have be different from those which reach the dekhan while other might pass into both these sub-province that there be a continuity of dry land between europe and north america during the miocene epoch appear to I to be a necessary consequence of the fact that many genus of terrestrial mammal such as _ castor hystrix elepha mastodon equus hipparion anchitherium rhinoceros cervus amphicyon hyoenarcto _ and _ machairodus _ be common to the miocene formation of the two area and have as yet be find -lrb- except perhaps _ anchitherium _ -rrb- in no deposit of earlier age whether this connection take place by the east or by the west or by both side of the old world there be at present no certain evidence and the question be immaterial to the present argument but as there be good grounds for the belief that the australian province and the indian and south-african sub-province be separate by sea from the rest of arctogaea before the miocene epoch so it have be render no less probable by the investigation of mr carrick moore and professor duncan that austro - columbium be separate by sea from north america during a large part of the miocene epoch it be unfortunate that we have no knowledge of the miocene mammalian fauna of the australian and austro-columbian province but see that not a trace of a platyrrhine ape of a procyonine carnivore of a characteristically south-american rodent of a sloth a armadillo or a ant-eater have yet be find in miocene deposit of arctogaea i can not doubt that they already exist in the miocene austro-columbian province nor be it less probable that the characteristic type of australian mammalium be already develop in that region in miocene time but austro-columbium present difficulty from which australium be free _ cantelidoe _ and _ tapirdoe _ be now indigenous in south america as they be in arctogaea and among the pliocene austro-columbian mammal the arctogaeal genus _ equus mastodon _ and _ machairodus _ be number be these postmiocene immigrant or praemiocene native still more perplexing be the strange and interesting form _ toxodon macrauchenia typotherium _ and a new anoplotherioid mammal -lrb- _ homalodotherhon _ -rrb- which dr cunningham send over to I some time ago from patagonium i confess i be strongly incline to surmise that these last at any rate be remnant of the population of austro-columbium before the miocene epoch and be not derive from arctogaea by way of the north and east the fact that this immense fauna of miocene arctogaea be now fully and richly represent only in indium and in south africa while it be shrink and depauperise in north asia europe and north america become at once intelligible if we suppose that indium and south africa have but a scanty mammalian population before the miocene immigration while the condition be highly favourable to the new comer it be to be suppose that these new region offer themselves to the miocene ungulate as south america and australia offer themselves to the cattle sheep and horse of modern colonist but after these great area be thus people come the glacial epoch during which the excessive cold to say nothing of depression and ice-covering must have almost depopulate all the northern part of arctogaea destroy all the higher mammalian form except those which like the elephant and rhinoceros could adjust they coat to the altered condition even these must have be drive away from the greater part of the area only those miocene mammal which have pass into hindostan and into south africa would escape decimation by such change in the physical geography of arctogaea and when the northern hemisphere pass into its present condition these lose tribe of the miocene fauna be hem by the himalaya the sahara the red sea and the arabian desert within they present boundary now on the hypothesis of evolution there be no sort of difficulty in admit that the difference between the miocene form of the mammalian fauna and those which exist at present be the result of gradual modification and since such difference in distribution as obtain be readily explain by the change which have take place in the physical geography of the world since the miocene epoch it be clear that the result of the comparison of the miocene and present fauna be distinctly in favor of evolution indeed i may go further i may say that the hypothesis of evolution explain the fact of miocene pliocene and recent distribution and that no other supposition even pretend to account for they it be indeed a conceivable supposition that every species of rhinoceros and every species of hyaena in the long succession of form between the miocene and the present species be separately construct out of dust or out of nothing by supernatural power but until i receive distinct evidence of the fact i refuse to run the risk of insulting any sane man by suppose that he seriously hold such a notion let we now take a step further back in time and inquire into the relation between the miocene fauna and its predecessor of the upper eocene formation here it be to be regret that we material for form a judgment be nothing to be compare in point of extent or variety with those which be yield by the miocene stratum however what we do know of this upper eocene fauna of europe give sufficient positive information to enable we to draw some tolerably safe inference it have yield representative of _ insectivora _ of _ cheiroptera _ of _ rodentium _ of _ carnivora _ of artiodactyle and perissodactyle _ ungulata _ and of opossum-like marsupial no australian type of marsupial have be discover in the upper eocene stratum nor any edentate mammal the genus -lrb- except perhaps in the case of some of the _ insectivora cheiroptera _ and _ rodentium _ -rrb- be different from those of the miocene epoch but present a remarkable general similarity to the miocene and recent genus in several case as i have already show it have now be clearly make out that the relation between the eocene and miocene form be such that the eocene form be the less specialise while its miocene ally be more so and the specialisation reach its maximum in the recent form of the same type so far as the upper eocene and the miocene mammalian fauna be comparable they relation be such as in no way to oppose the hypothesis that the older be the progenitor of the more recent form while in some case they distinctly favor that hypothesis the period in tine and the change in physical geography represent by the nummulitic deposit be undoubtedly very great while the remains of middle eocene and older eocene mammal be comparatively few the general facy of the middle eocene fauna however be quite that of the upper the older eocene pre-nummulitic mammalian fauna contain bat two genus of _ carivora _ three genus of _ ungulata _ -lrb- probably all perissodactyle -rrb- and a didelphid marsupial all these form except perhaps the bat and the opossum belong to genus which be not know to occur out of the lower eocene formation the _ coryphodon _ appear to have be ally to the miocene and later tapir while _ pliolophus _ in its skull and dentition curiously partake of both artiodactyle and perissodactyle character the third trochanter upon its femur and its three-toed hind foot however appear definitely to fix its position in the latter division there be nothing then in what be know of the older eocene mammal of the arctogaeal province to forbid the supposition that they stand in a ancestral relation to those of the calcaire grossier and the gypsum of the pari basin and that we present fauna therefore be directly derive from that which already exist in arctogaea at the commencement of the tertiary period but if we now cross the frontier between the cainozoic and the mesozoic fauna as they be preserve within the arctogaeal area we meet with a astounding change and what appear to be a complete and unmistakable break in the line of biological continuity among the twelve or fourteen species of _ mammalium _ which be say to have be find in the purbeck not one be a member of the order _ cheiroptera rodentium ungulata _ or _ carnivora _ which be so well represent in the tertiary no _ insectivora _ be certainly know nor any opossum-like marsupial thus there be a vast negative difference between the cainozoic and the mesozoic mammalian fauna of europe but there be a still more important positive difference inasmuch as all these mammalium appear to be marsupial belong to australian group and thus appertain to a different distributional province from the eocene and miocene marsupial which be austro-columbian so far as the imperfect material which exist enable a judgment to be form the same law appear to have hold good for all the earlier mesozoic _ mammalium _ of the stonesfield slate mammal one _ amphitherium _ have a definitely australian character one _ phascolotherium _ may be either dasyurid or didelphine of a third _ stereognathus _ nothing can at present be say the two mammal of the tria also appear to belong to australian group every one be aware of the many curious point of resemblance between the marine fauna of the european mesozoic rock and that which now exist in australium but if there be this australian facy about both the terrestrial and the marine fauna of mesozoic europe and if there be this unaccountable and immense break between the fauna of mesozoic and that of tertiary europe be it not a very obvious suggestion that in the mesozoic epoch the australian province include europe and that the arctogaeal province be contain within other limit the arctogaeal province be at present enormous while the australian be relatively small why should not these proportion have be different during the mesozoic epoch thus i be lead to think that by far the simplest and most rational mode of accounting for the great change which take place in the living inhabitant of the european area at the end of the mesozoic epoch be the supposition that it arise from a vast alteration of the physical geography of the globe whereby a area long tenant by cainozoic form be bring into such relation with the european area that migration from the one to the other become possible and take place on a great scale this supposition relieve we at once from the difficulty in which we be leave some time ago by the argument which i use to demonstrate the necessity of the existence of all the great type of the eocene epoch in some antecedent period it be this mesozoic continent -lrb- which may well have lie in the neighborhood of what be now the shore of the north pacific ocean -rrb- which i suppose to have be occupy by the mesozoic _ monodelphium _ and it be in this region that i conceive they must have go through the long series of change by which they be specialise into the form which we refer to different order i think it very probable that what be now south america may have receive the characteristic element of its mammalian fauna during the mesozoic epoch and there can be little doubt that the general nature of the change which take place at the end of the mesozoic epoch in europe be the upheaval of the eastern and northern region of the mesozoic sea-bottom into a westward extension of the mesozoic continent over which the mammalian fauna by which it be already people gradually spread this invasion of the land be preface by a previous invasion of the cretaceous sea by modern form of mollusca and fish it be easy to imagine how a analogous change might come about in the existing world there be at present a great difference between the fauna of the polynesian island and that of the west coast of america the animal which be leave they spoil in the deposit now form in these locality be widely different hence if a gradual shift of the deep sea which at present bar migration between the easternmost of these island and america take place to the westward while the american side of the sea-bottom be gradually upheave the palaeontologist of the future would find over the pacific area exactly such a change as i be suppose to have occur in the north-atlantic area at the close of the mesozoic period a australian fauna would be find underlie a american fauna and the transition from the one to the other would be as abrupt as that between the chalk and lower tertiary and as the drainage-area of the newly form extension of the american continent give rise to river and lake the mammal mire in they mud would differ from those of like deposit on the australian side just as the eocene mammal differ from those of the purbeck how do similar reasoning apply to the other great change of life -- that which take place at the end of the palaeozoic period in the triassic epoch the distribution of the dry land and of terrestrial vertebrate life appear to have be generally similar to that which exist in the mesozoic epoch so that the triassic continent and they faunae seem to be relate to the mesozoic land and they faunae just as those of the miocene epoch be related to those of the present day in fact as i have recently endeavor to prove to the society there be a arctogaeal continent and a arctogaeal province of distribution in triassic time as there be now and the _ sauropsida _ and _ marsupialium _ which constitute that fauna be i doubt not the progenitor of the _ sauropsida _ and _ marsupialium _ of the whole mesozoic epoch look at the present terrestrial fauna of australium it appear to I to be very probable that it be essentially a remnant of the fauna of the triassic or even of a earlier age -lrb- 7 -rrb- in which case australium must at that time have be in continuity with the arctogaeal continent -lrb- footnote 7 : since this address be read mr krefft have send we news of the discovery in australium of a freshwater fish of strangely palaeozoic aspect and apparently a ganoid intermediate between _ dipterus _ and _ lepidosiren _ -lrb- the now well-known _ ceratodus _ 1894 -rrb- -rrb- but now come the further inquiry where be the highly differentiate sauropsidan fauna of the tria in palaeozoic time the supposition that the dinosaurian crocodilian dicynodontian and to plesiosaurian type be suddenly create at the end of the permian epoch may be dismiss without further consideration as a monstrous and unwarranted assumption the supposition that all these type be rapidly differentiate out of _ lacertilium _ in the time represent by the passage from the palaeozoic to the mesozoic formation appear to I to be hardly more credible to say nothing of the indication of the existence of dinosaurian form in the permian rock which have already be obtain for my part i entertain no sort of doubt that the reptile bird and mammal of the tria be the direct descendant of reptile bird and mammal which exist in the latter part of the palaeozoic epoch but not in any area of the present dry land which have yet be explore by the geologist this may seem a bold assumption but it will not appear unwarrantable to those who reflect upon the very small extent of the earth 's surface which have hitherto exhibit the remains of the great mammalian fauna of the eocene time in this respect the permian land vertebrate fauna appear to I to be relate to the triassic much as the eocene be to the miocene terrestrial reptile have be find in permian rock only in three locality in some spot of france and recently of england and over a more extensive area in germany who can suppose that the few fossil yet find in these region give any sufficient representation of the permian fauna it may be say that the carboniferous formation demonstrate the existence of a vast extent of dry land in the present dry-land area and that the suppose terrestrial palaeozoic vertebrate fauna ought to have leave its remains in the coal-measure especially as there be now reason to believe that much of the coal be form by the accumulation of spore and sporangium on dry land but if we consider the matter more closely i think that this apparent objection lose its force it be clear that during the carboniferous epoch the vast area of land which be now cover by coal-measure must have be undergo a gradual depression the dry land thus depress must therefore have exist as such before the carboniferous epoch -- in other word in devonian time -- and its terrestrial population may never have be other than such as exist during the devonian or some previous epoch although much higher form may have be develop elsewhere again let I say that i be make no gratuitous assumption of inconceivable change it be clear that the enormous area of polynesium be on the whole a area over which depression have take place to a immense extent consequently a great continent or assemblage of subcontinental mass of land must have exist at some former time and that at a recent period geologically speak in the area of the pacific but if that continent have contain mammal some of they must have remain to tell the tale and as it be well know that these island have no indigenous _ mammalium _ it be safe to assume that none exist thus midway between australium and south america each of which possess a abundant and diversified mammalian fauna a mass of land which may have be as large as both put together must have exist without a mammalian inhabitant suppose that the shore of this great land be fringe as those of tropical australium be now with belt of mangrove which would extend landward on the one side and be bury beneath littoral deposit on the other side as depression go on and great bed of mangrove lignite might accumulate over the sink land let upheaval of the whole now take place in such a manner as to bring the emerge land into continuity with the south-american or australian continent and in course of time it would be people by a extension of the fauna of one of these two region -- just as i imagine the european permian dry land to have be people i see nothing whatever against the supposition that distributional province of terrestrial life exist in the devonian epoch inasmuch as m barrande have prove that they exist much earlier i be aware of no reason for doubt that as regard the grade of terrestrial life contain in they one of these may have be relate to another as new zealand be to australia or as australium be to indium at the present day analogy seem to I to be rather in favor of than against the supposition that while only ganoid fish inhabit the fresh water of we devonian land _ amphibium _ and _ reptilium _ or even higher form may have exist though we have not yet find they the earliest carboniferous _ amphibium _ now know such as _ anthracosaurus _ be so highly specialise that i can by no means conceive that they have be develop out of piscine form in the interval between the devonian and the carboniferous period considerable as that be and i take refuge in one of two alternative : either they exist in we own area during the devonian epoch and we have simply not yet find they or they form part of the population of some other distributional province of that day and only enter we area by migration at the end of the devonian epoch whether _ reptilium _ and _ mammalium _ exist along with they be to I at present a perfectly open question which be just as likely to receive a affirmative as a negative answer from future inquirer let I now gather together the thread of my argumentation into the form of a connected hypothetical view of the manner in which the distribution of living and extinct animal have be bring about i conceive that distinct province of the distribution of terrestrial life have exist since the earliest period at which that life be record and possibly much earlier and i suppose with mr darwin that the progress of modification of terrestrial form be more rapid in area of elevation than in area of depression i take it to be certain that labyrinthodont _ amphibium _ exist in the distributional province which include the dry land depress during the carboniferous epoch and i conceive that in some other distributional province of that day which remain in the condition of stationary or of increase dry land the various type of the terrestrial _ sauropsida _ and of the _ mammalium _ be gradually develop the permian epoch mark the commencement of a new movement of upheaval in we area which dry land exist in north america europe asia and africa as it do now into this great new continental area the mammal bird and reptile develop during the palaeozoic epoch spread and form the great triassic arctogaeal province but at the end of the triassic period the movement of depression recommence in we area though it be doubtless balance by elevation elsewhere modification and development check in the one province go on in that elsewhere and the chief form of mammal bird and reptile as we know they be evolve and people the mesozoic continent i conceive australium to have become separate from the continent as early as the end of the triassic epoch or not much later the mesozoic continent must i conceive have lie to the east about the shore of the north pacific and indian ocean and i be incline to believe that it continue along the eastern side of the pacific area to what be now the province of austro-columbium the characteristic fauna of which be probably a remnant of the population of the latter part of this period towards the latter part of the mesozoic period the movement of upheaval around the shore of the atlantic once more recommence and be very probably accompany by a depression around those of the pacific the vertebrate fauna elaborate in the mesozoic continent move westward and take possession of the new land which gradually increase in extent up to and in some direction after the miocene epoch it be in favor of this hypothesis i think that it be consistent with the persistence of a general uniformity in the position of the great mass of land and water from the devonian period or earlier to the present day the four great ocean atlantic pacific arctic and antarctic may have occupy they present position and only they coast and channel of communication have undergo a incessant alteration and finally the hypothesis i have put before you require no supposition that the rate of change in organic life have be either greater or less in ancient time than it be now nor any assumption either physical or biological which have not its justification in analogous phenomenon of exist nature i have now only to discharge the last duty of my office which be to thank you not only for the patient attention with which you have listen to I so long to-day but also for the uniform kindness with which for the past two year you have render my endeavor to perform the important and often laborious function of you president a pleasure instead of a burden end of the project gutenberg ebook of
