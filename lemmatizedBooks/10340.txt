beyond the bay be a sandbar and beyond that the atlantic ocean for all this be on the southerly shore of long island the kinzer farm have lie right there -- acre for acre no more no less -- on the day when hendrik hudson long ago sail the good ship half moon into new-york bay but it be not then know to any one as the kinzer farm neither be there then as now any bright and grow village crowd up on one side of it with a railway-station and a post-office nor be there at that time any great and busy city of new york only a few hour ' ride away over on the island of manhattan the kinzer themselves be not there then but the bay and the inlet with the fish and the crab and the ebb and flow tide be there very much the same before hendrik hudson and he brave dutchman know any thing whatever about that corner of the world the kinzer farm have always be a reasonably fat one both as to size and quality and the good people who live on it have generally be of a somewhat similar description it be therefore every way correct and become for dabney kinzer 's widow mother and he sister to be the plump and hearty being they be and all the more discouraging to poor dabney that no amount of regular and faithful eating seem to make he resemble they at all in that respect mr kinzer excuse he thinness to she neighbor to be sure on the ground that he be such a grow boy but for all that he catch himself wonder now and then if he would never be do with that part of he trial for rapid growth have its trial the fact be he say to himself one day as he lean over the north fence i be more like ham morri 's farm than i be like ours he farm be bigger than ours all round but it be too big for its fence just as i be too big for my clothes ham 's house be three time as large as ours but it look as if it have grow too fast it have not any paint to speak of nor any blind it look as if somebody would just build it there and then forget it and go oft and leave it out of door dabney 's four sister have all come into the world before he but he be as tall as any of they and be frequently take by stranger for a good two year older than he be it be sometimes very hard for he a boy of fifteen to live up to what be expect of those extra two year mr kinzer still keep he in roundabout but they do not seem to hinder he growth at all if that be she object in so do there be no such thing however as keep the four girl in roundabout of any kind and what between they and they mother the pleasant and tidy little kinzer homestead with its snug parlor and its cosey bit of room and chamber seem to nestle away under the shadowy elm and sycamore smaller and smaller with every year that come it be a terribly tight fit for such a family anyway and now that dabney be grow at such a rate there be no tell what they would all come to but mr kinzer come at last to the rescue and she summon she eldest daughter miranda to she aid a very notable woman be the widow when the new railway cut off part of the old farm she have split up the slice of land between the iron track and the village into town lot and have sell they all off by the time the railway company pay she for the damage it have do the property the whole kinzer family gain visibly in plumpness that year except perhaps dabney of course the condition and requirement of ham morri and he big farm just over the north fence have not escape such a pair of eye as those of the widow and the very size of he great barn of a house finally settle he fate for he a large quiet unambitious but well-brought-up and industrious young man be hamilton morri and he have not the least idea of the good in store for he for several month after mr kinzer decide to marry he to she daughter miranda but all be soon settle dab of course have nothing to do with the wedding arrangement and ham 's share be somewhat contract not but what he be at the kinzer house a good deal nor do any of the other girl tell miranda how very much he be in the way he could talk however and one morning about a fortnight before the day appoint he say to miranda and she mother -- we can not have so very much of a wedding : you house be so small and you have chock it so full of furniture right down nice furniture it be too but there be so much of it i be afraid the minister 'll have to stand out in the front yard the house 'll do for this time reply mr kinzer there 'll be room enough for everybody what puzzle I be dab what about dab ask ham can not find a thing to fit he say dab 's mother seem as if he be all odd size from head to foot fit he exclaim ham oh you mean ready-made goods of course you can not he 'll have to be measure by a tailor and have he new suit build for he such extravagance emphatically remark mr kinzer not for rich people like you and for a wedding reply ham and dab 's a grow boy where be he now i be go to the village and i 'll take he right along with I there seem to be no help for it but that be the first point relate to the wedding concern which ham morri be permit to have exactly he own way he success make dab kinzer a fast friend of he for life and that be something there be also something new and wonderful to dabney himself in walk into a tailor 's shop pick out cloth to please himself and be so carefully measure all over he stretch and stretch himself in all direction to make sure nothing should turn out too small at the end of it all ham say to he -- now dab my boy this suit be to be a present from I to you on miranda 's account dab color and hesitate for a moment : but it seem all right he think and so he come frankly out with -- thank you ham you always be a prime good fellow i 'll do as much for you some day tell you what i 'll do then : i 'll have another suit make right away of this other cloth and have the bill for that one send to we folk do it exclaim ham do it you have you mother 's order for that she be nothing to do with my gift splendid almost shout dab oh but do not i hope they 'll fit vit say the tailor : vill zay vit i dell you zay vit you like a knife you vait und zee dab fail to get a very clear idea of what the fit would be but it make he almost hold he breath to think of it after the triumphant visit to the tailor there be still a necessity for a call upon the shoemaker and that be a matter of no small importance dab 's foot have always be a mystery and a trial to he if he memory contain one record darker than another it be the endless history of he misadventure with boot and shoe he and leather have be at war from the day he leave he creeping-clothes until now but now he be promise a pair of shoe that would be sure to fit so the question of dab 's personal appearance at the wedding be all arrange between he and ham and miranda smile more sweetly than ever before upon the latter after she have hear she usually silent brother break out so enthusiastically about he as he do that evening it be a good thing for that wedding that it take place in fine summer weather for neither kith kin nor acquaintance have be slight in the invitation and the kinzer be one of the oldest family to have gather they all under the roof of that house without either stretch it out wider or boil the guest down would have be out of the question and so the majority with dabney in he new clothes to keep they countenance stand out in the cool shade of the grand old tree during the ceremony which be perform near the open door and be afterwards serve with the refreshment in a style which speak volume for mr kinzer 's good management as well as for she hospitality the only drawback to dab 's happiness that day be that he acquaintance hardly seem to know he he have have almost the same trouble with himself when he look in the glass that morning ordinarily he wrist be several inch through he coat-sleeve and he ankle make a perpetual show of he stocking he neck too seem to be hold he head as far as possible from he coat-collar and he button have no favor to ask of he button-hole now even as the tailor have promise he have receive he first fit he seem to himself to tell the truth to be cover up in a prodigal waste of new cloth would he ever ever grow too big for such a suit of clothes as that it be a very painful thought and he do he best to put it away from he still it be a little hard to have a young lady whom he have know since before she begin to walk remark to he -- excuse I sir but can you tell I if mr dabney kinzer be here no jenny walter sharply respond dab he be not here why dabney exclaim the pretty jenny be that you i declare you have scare I out of a year 's growth i wish you would scare I then say dab then my clothes would stay fitted every thing have be so well arrange beforehand thanks to mr kinzer that the wedding have no chance at all except to go off well ham morri be rejoice to find how entirely he be relieve of every responsibility do not worry about you house the widow say to he the night before the wedding we 'll go over there as soon as you and miranda get away and it 'll be all ready for you by the time you get back all right say ham i 'll be glad to have you take the old place in hand i have only try to live in a corner of it you do not know how much room there be i do not i must say dabney have long to ask she if she mean to have it move over to the kinzer side of the north fence but he have doubt as to the propriety of it and just then the boy come in from the tailor 's with he bundle of new clothes chapter ii dab 's old clothes get a new boy to fit hamilton morri be a very promising young man of some thirty summer he have be a orphan for a dozen year and the wonder be that he should so long have live alone in the big square-built house he father leave he at all event miranda kinzer be just the wife for he miranda 's mother have see that at a glance the moment she mind be settle about the house as to that and he great spreading half-cultivated farm all either of they need be ready money and management these be blessing ham be now make reasonably sure of on he return from he wedding-trip and he be likely to appreciate they as for dabney kinzer he be in no respect overcome by the novelty and excitement of the wedding-day all the rest of it after the departure of ham morri and the bride he devote himself to such duty as be assign he with a new and grand idea steadily take shape in he mind he feel as if he brain too like he body be grow some of he mother 's older and more intimate friend remain with she all day probably to comfort she for the loss of miranda and two or three of they dab know would stay to tea so that he service would be in demand to see they safely home all day long moreover samantha and keziah and pamelum seem to find themselves wonderfully busy one way and another so that they pay even less attention than usual to any of the in and out of they brother dabney be therefore able with little difficulty to take for himself whatever of odd time he might require for put he new idea into execution mr kinzer herself notice the rare good sense with which she son hurry through with he dinner and slip away leave she in undisturbed possession of the table and she lady guest and neither she nor either of the girl have a thought of follow he if they have do so they might have see he draw a good-sized bundle out from under the lilac-thicket in the back yard and hurry down through the garden a few moment more and dabney have appear on the fence of the old cross-road lead down to the shore there he sit eye one passer-by after another till he suddenly spring from he perch exclaim -- that be just the chap why they 'll fit he and that be more 'n they ever do for I dab would probably have have to search along the coast for mile before he could have find a human be better suit to he present charitable purpose than the boy who now come so lazily down the road there be no doubt about he color or that he be all over of about the same shade of black he old tow trowser and calico shirt reveal the shine fact in too many place to leave room for a question and shoe he have none dick say dabney be you ever marry married exclaimed dick with a peal of very musical laughter be i marry no be you no reply dabney but i be very near it this morning dat so ask dick with another show of he white tooth do ye good den nebber see ye i look so nice afore you would look nicer 'n i do if you be only dress up say dab just you put on these golly exclaim the black boy but he seize the bundle dab throw he and he have it open in a twinkle any t ` ing in de pocket he ask guess not say dab but there be lot of room say dar be exclaim dick but will not dese t ` ing be warm it be quite likely for the day be not a cool one and dick never seem to think of get off what he have on before get into he unexpected present coat vest and trousers they be all pull on with more quickness than dab have ever see the young african display before i 's much obleege to ye mr kinzer say dick very proudly as he strut across the road on ' y i das not go back fru de village what 'll you do then ask dab s ` pose i would better go a-fishin ' say dick will de fish bite oh the clothes will not make any odds to they say dabney i must go back to the house and so he do : while dick on whom the cast-off garment of he white friend be really a pretty good fit march on down the road feeling grander than he ever have before in all he life that 'll be a good thing to tell ham morri when he and miranda get home again mutter dab as he re-enter the house late that evening when dabney return from he final duty as escort to he mother 's guest she reward he with more than he could remember ever receive of motherly commendation i have be really quite proud of you dabney she say as she lay she plump hand on the collar of he new coat and kiss he you have behave like a perfect little gentleman only mother exclaim keziah he spend too much of he time with that sharp-tongued little jenny walter never mind kezus say dab : she do not know who i be till i tell she i be go to wear a label with my name on it when i go over to the village to-morrow and then you 'll put on you other suit in the morning say mr kinzer you must keep this for sunday and great occasion any more wedding come right away say dab with a sharp glance around upon what remain of the family but the girl be all very busy just then with they book and they sewing and he do not get any direct reply even he mother walk away after something she have leave in the dining-room when the next morning come dabney kinzer be a more than usually early riser for he feel that he have wake up to a very important day dabney exclaim he mother when he come in to breakfast do i not tell you to put on you other suit so i have mother reply dab : this be my other suit that exclaim mr kinzer so it be cry keziah so it be not add samantha mother that be not what he have on yesterday he be be trade again mildly suggest pamelum dabney say mr kinzer what do this mean mean reply dabney why these be the clothes you tell I to buy the lot i wear yesterday be a present from ham morri he be a splendid fellow i be glad he get the best of the girl that be a bad thing for dabney to say just then for it be vigorously resent by the remain three as soon as quiet be restore however mr kinzer remark -- i think hamilton should have consult I about it but it be too late now anyhow you may go and put on you other clothes my wedding suit ask dab no indeed i mean you old one -- those you take off night before last dunno where they be slowly respond dab do not know where they be respond a chorus of four voice no say dab bill lee 's black boy have em on all yesterday afternoon and i reckon he be go a-fishing again to-day they fit he a good sight better 'n they ever do I if dabney have expect a storm to come from he mother 's end of the table he be pleasantly mistaken and he sister have it all to themselves for a moment then with a admiring glance at she son the thoughtful matron remark -- just like he father for all the world it be no use girl : dabney 's a grow boy in more way than one dabney i shall want you to go over to the morri house with I after breakfast then you may hitch up the pony and we 'll do some errand around the village dab kinzer 's sister look at one another in blank astonishment and samantha would have leave the table if she have only finish she breakfast pamelum as be nearest to dab in age and sympathy give a very admiring look at she brother 's second good fit and say nothing even keziah finally admit in she own mind that such a change in dabney 's appearance might have its advantage but samantha inwardly declare war the young hero himself be hardly use to that second suit as yet and feel any thing but easy in it i wonder he say to himself what jenny walter would say to I now wonder if she would know I not a doubt of it but after he have finish he breakfast and go out he mother remark -- it be really all right girl i almost fear i have be neglect dabney he be not a little boy any more he be not a man yet exclaim samantha and he talk slang dreadfully but then he do grow so remark keziah mother say pamelum could not you get dab to give dick lee the slang along with the old clothes we 'll see about it reply mr kinzer it be very clear that dabney 's mother have begin to take in a new idea about she son it be not the least bit in the world unpleasant to find out that he be grow in more way than one and it be quite likely that she have indeed keep he too long in roundabout at all event he great idea have be work out into a triumphant success and before the evening be over pamelum reply to a remark of samantha 's -- i do not care he be taller than i be and i would ever so much rather have a frock-coat walk beside I to meet chapter iii a member of one of the oldest family meet a young gentleman from the city dick lee have be more than half right about the village be a dangerous place for he with such a unusual amount of clothing over he ordinary uniform the very dog every one of whom be a old acquaintance bark at he on he way home that night and proud as be he ebony father and mother of the improvement in they son 's appearance they yield to he earnest entreaty first that he might wear he present all the next day and second that he might betake himself to the bay early in the morning and so keep out of sight till he get use to it on ' y you jist mind wot yer about say he mother and see ' t you keep dem clo'e from gettin ' wet i jist can not ` foard to hab dem spiled right away the fault with dab kinzer 's old suit after all have lie mainly in its size rather than its material for mr kinzer be too good a manager to be really stingy dick succeed in reach the boat-landing without fall in with any one who seem disposed to laugh at he but there right on the wharf be a white boy of about he own age and he feel a good deal like back out nebber see he afore either say dick to himself den i guess i be not afeard ob he the stranger be a somewhat short and thick-set but bright and active-looking boy with a pair of very keen greenish-gray eye but after all the first word he speak to poor dick be -- hullo clothes where be you go with all that boy i know it i know it groan dick but he answer as sharply as he know how -- i 's goin ' a-fishin ' any ob youah business -- where would you learn how to fish the stranger ask down south do not know they have any there nebbah be down souf be the somewhat surly reply father run away do he he nebber be down dar nudder nor he father ` tai not no business ob yourn say dick but we 's aller live right heah on di bay guess not say the white boy knowingly dick be right nevertheless for he people have be slave among the very earliest dutch settler and have never live south at all he be now busily get one of the boat ready to shove off but he white tormentor go at he again with -- well then if you have live round here as long as that you must know everybody reckon i do be there any nice fellow around here any like I de nicest young gen ` lman round di bay reply dick be mr dab kinzer but he be not like you not nuff to hurt he dab kinzer exclaim the stranger where would he get he name in de bay i ` spect say dick as he shove he boat off catch ` im wid a hook anyhow say the strange boy to himself that be probably the kind of fellow my father would wish I to associate with only it be likely he be very ignorant and he walk away towards the village with the air of a man who have forget more than the rest of he race be ever likely to find out at all event dick lee have manage to say a good word for he benefactor little as he could guess what might be the consequence meantime dab kinzer when he go out from breakfast have stroll away to the north fence for a good look at the house which be thenceforth to be the home of he favorite sister he have see it before every day since he could remember but it seem to have a fresh and almost mournful interest for he just now hullo he exclaim as he lean against the fence put up ladder oh yes i see that be old tommy mcgrew the house-painter well ham 's house need a new coat as badly as i do sure it 'll fit too only it be not use to it any more 'n i be dabney it be he mother 's voice and dab feel like mind very promptly that morning dabney my boy come here to the gate ham morri be have he house paint he remark as he walk towards he mother be he she say we 'll go and see about it the gate between the two side-yard have be there from time immemorial and-they walk right through as they draw nearer the morri house however dabney discover that carpenter as well as painter be ply they trade in and about the old homestead there be window-sash pile here and blind there a new door or so ready for use a great stack of bundle of shingle some barrel of lime and a heap of sand whichever way dab look there be visible sign of a approach renovation go to fix it all over he remark yes reply he mother : it 'll be as good as new it be well build and will bear mend i could not say that of some of the shackle thing they have be put up around the village when they enter the house it become more and more evident that the shabby day of the morris mansion be number there be man at work in almost every room ham 's wedding-trip would surely give plenty of time at that rate for a immense amount of mending and he house would be as the widow have promise all ready for he on he return there be nothing wonderful to dabney in the idea of he mother go about and inspect work and finding fault and give direction he have never see she do any thing else and he have the greatest confidence in she knowledge and ability he notice too before they leave the place that the customary farm-work be go ahead with even more regularity and energy than if the owner himself have be present ham 's farm 'll look something like ours one of these day he say if thing go on at this rate i mean it shall reply he mother a little sharply now go and get out the pony and we 'll do the rest of we errand dab start for the barn at a half trot for if there be one thing he like better than another it be to have the rein in he hand and that pair of pony before he time have be when mr kinzer do she own driving and only permit dab to hold the horse while she make she call business or otherwise but that day have be safely put away among dab 's unpleasant memory for a good while it be but a few minute before the neat buggy hold the widow and she son and the pony be take they briskly down the road towards the village it they have only know it at that very moment ham morri and he bloom bride be set out for a drive at the fashionable watering-place where they have make they first stop in they wedding-tour ham say miranda it seem to I as if we be a thousand mile from home we shall be a good deal farther before we get any nearer say ham but i wonder what they be do there this morning -- mother and the girl and dear little dabney little dabney exclaim ham with a queer sort of laugh on he face why miranda do you think dab be a baby yet no not a baby but -- well he be a boy that be a fact but he 'll be as tall as i be in three year will he do you think so but will he ever get fat not till after he get he full length say ham we must have he at we house a good deal after we get home and feed he up i have take a liking to dab feed he up say miranda do you think we starve he no i suppose not but how many meal a day do he get three of course like the rest of we and he never miss one of they exactly say ham : i should not suppose he would i never miss a meal myself if i can help it but do not you think three meal a day be rather short allowance for a boy like dab miranda think a moment but then she answer positively -- no i do not not if he do as well at each one of they as dabney be sure to well say ham that be in he old clothes that be too tight for he now he be get a good loose fit with plenty of room you do not know how much more he may need no miranda i be go to have a eye on dab you be a dear good fellow anyway say miranda with one of she very best smile and i hope mother 'll have the house all ready for we when we get back she will reply ham after a moment spend in somewhat thoughtful silence do you know miranda i shall hardly be easy about that till i see what she be do with it it be in a dreadfully baggy condition chapter iv two boy one pig and a unfortunate railway-train that be he dab be stand by he pony in front of a store in the village he mother be make some purchase in the store and dab be think how the morri house would look when it be finish and it be at he the old farmer be point in answer to a question which have just be ask he the questioner be the sharp-eyed boy who have bother poor dick lee that morning and he be now evidently make a sort of study of dab kinzer at that moment however a young lady -- quite young -- come trip along the sidewalk and be stop by dabney with -- there jenny walter if i do not forget my label why dabney be that you how you startle I forget you label yes say dab i be in another new suit today and i mean to have a label on the collar with my name on it you would have know I then but i know you now exclaim jenny why i see you yesterday yes and i tell you it be I can you read jenny why what a question because if you can not it will not do I any good to wear a label dabney kinzer exclaim jenny there be a other thing you ought to get what be that some good manners say the little lady snappishly think of you stop I in the street to tell I i can not read then you must not forget I so quick say dab if you meet my old clothes anywhere you must call they dick lee they have have a change of name so he be in they be he i do not doubt they look better than they ever do before jenny walk away at once at the end of that remark hold she head pretty high and leave she old playmate feeling as if he have have a little the worst of it that be often the way with people who stop to talk with jenny walter and she be not as much of a favorite as she otherwise might have be dabney look after she with he mouth pucker into shape for a whistle but she have hardly disappear before he find himself confront by the strange young gentleman be you name dabney kinzer yes i believe so well i be mr ford foster from new york come over here to buy goods suggest dabney or to get something to eat ford foster be apparently of about dab 's age but a full head less in height so that there be more point in the question than there seem to be but he treat it as not worthy of notice and ask -- do you know of a house to let anywhere about here house to let suddenly exclaim the voice of mr kinzer behind he much to dab 's surprise be you ask about a house whom for ford foster have be quite ready to chaff dick lee and he would not have hesitate about try a like experiment upon mr dabney kinzer but he know enough to speak respectfully to the portly and business-like lady before he now yes madam he say with a ceremonious bow : i wish to report to my father that i have find a acceptable house in this vicinity you do mr kinzer be read the young gentleman through and through as she speak but she follow she exclamation with a dozen question all of which he answer with a good deal of clearness and intelligence she wind up at last with -- go right home then and tell you father the only good house to let in this neighborhood will be ready for he next week i 'll show it to he when he come but he would better see I at once dabney jump into the buggy i be in a hurry the pony be in motion up the street before ford foster quite recover from the shock of be tell to go right home a very remarkable woman he mutter as he turn away and she do not tell I a word about the house after all i must make some more inquiry the boy be actually well dress for a place like this mother say dabney as they drive along you would not let 'em have ham 's house would you no indeed but i do not mean to have we own stand empty with that reply a great deal of light break in upon dab 's mind that be it be it he say to himself as he touch up the pony well there 'll be room enough for all of we there and no mistake but what 'll ham say that be a question which he could safely leave to the very responsible lady beside he and she find errand enough for he during the remainder of that forenoon to keep he from worry he mind about any thing else as for ford foster it be not until late on the follow day that he complete all he inquiry to he satisfaction he take the afternoon train for the city almost convinced that much as he undoubtedly know before he come he have actually acquire a good deal more knowledge which might be of some value ford be almost the only passenger in the car he have select train go towards the city be apt to be thinly people at that time of day but the empty car have to be take along all the same for the benefit of the crowd who would be come out later in the afternoon and in the evening the railway-company would have make more money with full load both way but it be well they do not have a full load on that precise train ford have turn over the seat in front of he and stretch himself out with he foot on it it be almost like lie down for a boy of he length and it be the very best position he could possibly have take if he have know what be come know what be come yes : there be a pig come that be all but it be quite enough consider what that pig be about to do he be go where he choose just then and not only have he choose to walk upon the railroad-track but he have also make up he mind not to turn out for that locomotive and its train of car he see it of course for he be look straight at it and the engineer see he but it would have be well for the pig if he have be discover a few seconds earlier what a whistle exclaimed ford foster at that moment it sound more like the squeal of a iron pig than any thing else i -- but at that instant there come to he a great jolt and a shock and ford find himself tumble all in a heap on the seat where he foot have be then come bounce after bounce and the sound of break glass and then a crash off the track shout ford as he spring to he foot i would not have miss it for any thing i do hope though there have not anybody be kill in the tremendous excitement of the moment he could hardly have tell how he get out of that car but it do not seem ten seconds before he be stand beside the engineer and conductor of the train look at the battered engine as it lay upon its side in a deep ditch the baggage-car just behind it be break all to piece but the passenger-car do not seem to have suffer very much and nobody be badly hurt as the engineer and fireman have jump off in time there have be very little left of the pig but the conductor and the rest seem much disposed to say unkind thing about he and about he owner and about all the other pig they could think of this train 'll never get in on time say ford to the conductor a little later how 'll i get to the city the railway man be not in the best of humor and he answer a little groutily well young man i do not suppose the city could get along without you over night the junction with the main road be only two mile ahead and if you be a good walker you may catch a train there some of the other passenger none of whom be much more than badly shake up or down have make the same discovery and in a few minute more there be a long straggling procession of uncomfortable people march by the side of the railway-track in the hot sun they be nearly all of they make unkind remark about pig and the faculty they have of not get out of the way the conductor be right however and nearly all of they manage to walk the two mile to the junction in time to go in on the other train ford foster be among the first to arrive and he be likely to reach home in season in spite of the pig and he outrageous conduct as for he danger he have hardly think of that and he again and again declare to himself that he would not have miss so important a adventure for any thing he could think of it almost sound once or twice as if he take to himself no small amount of personal credit not to say glory for have be in so remarkable a accident and come out of it so well ford 's return when he should make it be to take he to a great pompous stylish crowded up-town boarding-house in one of the fashionable street of the great city there be no wonder at all that wise people should wish to get out of such a place in such hot weather still it be the sort of home ford foster have be acquaint with all he life and it be partly owe to that that he have become so prematurely know he know too much in fact and be only too well aware of it he have fill he head with a unlimited stock of boarding-house information as well as with a firm persuasion that there be little more to be have -- unless indeed it might be scrap of such outside knowledge as he have now be pick up over on long island in one of the large parlor-chamber of the boarding-house at about eight o'clock that evening a middle-aged gentleman and lady with a fair sweet-faced girl of about nineteen be sit near a open window very much as if they be wait for somebody such a kind motherly lady she be one of those whom no one can help liking after see she smile once or hear she speak ford foster himself could not have put in word what he think about he mother and yet he have no difficulty whatever in express he respect for he father or he unbounded admiration for he pretty sister annie o husband exclaim mr foster be you sure none of they be injure so the telegraphic report say not a bone break of anybody but the pig that get in the way how i wish he would come groan annie have you any idea father how ford could get to the city not clearly my dear say she father but you can trust ford not to miss any opportunity he be just the boy to look out for himself in a emergency ford foster 's father take very strongly after the son in whose presence of mind and ability he express so much confidence he have just such a square active bustling sort of body several size larger with just such keen penetrate greenish-gray eye anybody would have pick he out at a glance for a lawyer and a good one that be exactly what he be and if anybody have become acquaint with either son or father there would have be no difficulty afterward in identify the other it require a good deal more than the telegraphic report of the accident or even she husband 's assurance to relieve the motherly anxiety of good mr foster or even to drive away the shadow from the face of annie no doubt if ford himself have know the state of affair in he family circle they would have be relieve earlier for even while they be talk about he he have reach the end of he adventure and be already in the house it have not so much as occur to he that he mother would hear of the disaster to the pig and the railway-train until he himself should tell she and so he have make sure of he supper down stair before report he arrival he might not have do it perhaps but he have enter the house by the lower way through the area door and that of the dining-room have stand temptingly open with some very eatable thing spread out upon the table that have be too much for ford after he car-ride and he smash-up and he long walk now at last up he come three stair at a time brimful of new and wonderful experience to be more than a little astonished by the manner and enthusiasm of he welcome why mother he exclaim when he get a chance for a word you and annie could not have say much more if i would be the pig himself the pig say annie yes the pig that stop we he and the engine will not go home to they family to-night do not make fun of it ford say he mother gently it be too serious a matter just then he father break in almost impatiently with -- well ford my boy have you do you errand or shall i have to see about it myself you have be go two day thirty-seven hour and a half father reply ford take out he watch i have keep a exact account of my expense we have save the cost of advertising and spend it on railroading say he father with a laugh but ford ask annie do you find a house -- a good one yes add mr foster : now i be sure you be safe i do want to hear about the house it be all right mother say ford confidently the very house you tell I to hunt for neither too large nor too small i have only see the outside of it but every thing about it be in apple-pie order there be plenty of question to answer now but ford be every way equal to the occasion some of he answer might have make mr kinzer herself open she eye for the material for they have be obtain from she own neighbor ford 's report in fact compel he father to look at he with a expression of face which very plainly mean -- that be my boy he resemble I i be just like he at he age he 'll be just like I at mine there be excellent reason beyond question to approve of the manner in which the young gentleman have perform he errand in the country and mr foster promptly decide to go over in a day or two and see what sort of a arrangement could be make with mr kinzer chapter v new neighbor and get settle the week which follow the wedding-day be a important one the improvement on the morri house be push along in a way that astonished everybody every day that pass and with every dollar 's worth of work that be do the good point of the long-neglected old mansion come out stronger and stronger the plan of mr kinzer have be a good while in get ready and she know exactly what be best to be do at every hole and corner within a few day after ford 's trip of investigation he and he father come over from the city and mr foster speedily come to a perfect understanding with dabney 's mother a very business-like common-sense sort of a woman the lawyer remark to he son but what a great dangling overgrown piece of a boy that be still he seem intelligent and you may find he good company no doubt of it say ford i may be useful to he too he look as if he could learn if he only have a fair chance i should say so respond mr foster we must not expect too much of fellow bring up away out here as he have be ford gravely assent and they go back to report they success to mr foster and annie there be a great surprise in store consequently for the people of the village early in the follow week it be rumor from house to house -- the kinzer be all a-movin ' over to ham morri 's and then before the public mind have become sufficiently settle to inquire into the matter the rumor change itself into a piece of positive news : -- the widder kinzer 's move over into ham 's house bag and baggage so it be although the carpenter and painter and glazier be still at work and the pile of kinzer furniture have to be store around as best could be some part of they have even to be lock up over night in one of the barn the kinzer for generation have be a trifle weak about furniture and that be one of the reason why there have be so little room for human being in they house the little parlor indeed have be fill until it put one in mind of a small furniture-store with not room enough to show the stock on hand and some of the other part of the house require knowledge and care to walk about in they it be bad for a small house truly but not so much so when the same article be give a fair chance to spread themselves it be a treat to dab to watch while the new carpet be put down and see how much more at home and comfortable all that furniture look after it be move into its new quarter he remark to keziah -- it will not be of any use for anybody to try to sit on that sofa and play the piano they 'll have to get up and come over mr kinzer take good care that the house she leave should speak well of she to the eye of mr foster when that lady come to superintend the arrival of she own household goods the character of these by the way at once convince the village gossip that lawyer foster must be a good deal forehand in money matter and so he be even more so than he furniture indicate ford have a wonderful deal to do with the settlement of he family in they new home and it be not until nearly the close of the week that he find time for more than a occasional glance over the north fence although he and dab have several time exchange a word or two when they meet each other on the road take the two farm together he father have say to he and they make a really fine estate i learn too that the kinzer have other property you young acquaintance be likely to have a very good start in the world ford have find out very nearly as much as that on he own account but he have long since learn the uselessness of try to teach he father any thing however well he might succeed with ordinary people and so he say nothing dabney say mr kinzer that Friday evening you have be a great help all the week suppose you take the pony to-morrow morning and ask young foster out for a drive mother exclaim samantha i shall want the pony myself i have some call to make and some shopping dabney will have to drive no sam say dabney : if you go out with the pony to-morrow you 'll have my old clothes to drive you i 'll go and speak to they about it what do you mean asked samantha i mean with dick lee in they that would be just as well say mr kinzer the pony be gentle enough and dick drive well he 'll be glad enough to go dick lee indeed begin samantha a fine boy interrupted dab and he be begin to dress well he new clothes fit he beautifully all he really need be a shirt and i 'll give he one mine be get too small samantha 's finger fidget a little with the tidy they be hold but mr kinzer say composedly -- well dabney i have be think about it you ought not to be tie down all the while suppose you take next week pretty much to yourself : samantha will not want the pony every day the other horse have all get to work or i would let you have one of they dabney get up for want of a better answer and walk over to where he mother be sit and give the thoughtful matron a good sound kiss at the same time he could not help thinking -- this come of ham morri and my new rig there dabney that 'll do say he mother but how 'll you spend Saturday guess i 'll take ford foster out in the bay a-crabbing if he 'll go reply dabney i 'll run over and ask he it be not too late and he be out of the house before there be any chance for further remark from the girl now he mutter as he walk along i 'll have to see old lawyer foster and mr foster and i do not know who all besides i do not like that just as he come to the north fence however he be hail by a clear wide-awake voice -- dab kinzer be that you guess so say dab : be that you ford i be just go over to you house say ford well so be i just come over to see you i have be too busy all the week but they have let up on I at last i have get we family nearly settle reply ford and i think i would ask if you would not like to go out on the bay with I to-morrow teach you to catch crab dabney draw a long astonished sort of whistle but he finish it with -- that be about what i be think of there be plenty of crab and i have get a tip-top boat we will not want a heavy one for just we two all right then we 'll begin on crab but some other day we 'll go for bigger fish what be you go to do next week get it all to myself say dab we can have all sort of a good time we can have the pony too when we want they that be about as good as it know how to be respond the young gentleman from the city i would like to explore the country you be go to have a nice place of it over there before you get through only if i would have the planning of that house i would have set it back farther too much room all round it not enough tree either dab come stoutly to the defense of not only that house but of long-island architecture generally and be fairly overwhelmed for the first time in he life by a flood of big word from a boy of he own age he could have eat up ford foster if properly cook he feel sure of that but he be no match for he on the building question on he way back to he new home however after the discussion have last long enough he find himself inquire -- that be all very nice but what can he teach I about crab we 'll see about that to-morrow beyond a doubt the crab question be of special importance but one of far greater consequence to dab kinzer 's future be undergo discussion at that very hour hundred of mile away quite a little knot of people there be in a hotel parlor and while the bloom miranda now mr morri be take she share of talk very well with the lady ham be every bit as busy with a couple of elderly gentleman it be just as i say mr morri say one of the latter with a superfluous show of energy : there be no better institution of its kind in the country than grantley academy i send my own boy there and i have just write about it to my brother-in-law foster the new-york lawyer he 'll have he boy there this fall no better place in the country sir but how about the expense mr hart ask ham fee be just what i tell you sir a mere nothing as for board all i pay for my boy be three dollar a week all they want to eat sir and good accommodation happy as lark sir all the time cheap sir cheap if ham morri have the slightest idea of go to school at a new-england academy miranda 's place in the improve house be likely to wait for she for he have a look on he face of be very nearly convinced she do not seem at all disturbed however and probably she know that she husband be not take up the school question on he own account nevertheless that be the reason why it might have be interesting for dab kinzer and even for he know neighbor to have add themselves to the company ham and miranda have fall in with on they wedding-tour both of the boy have a different kind of think on hand and that night dab dream that a gigantic crab be try to pull ford foster out of the boat while the latter calmly remark to he -- there my young friend do you ever see anything just like that before chapter vi crab boy and a boat-wreck that Saturday morning be a sad one for poor dick lee he mother the previous night carefully lock up he elegant apparel the gift of mr dabney kinzer it be do after dick be in bed and when daylight come again he find only he old clothes by the bedside it be a hard thing to bear no doubt but dick have be a bad boy on Friday he have sell he fish instead of bring they home and then have go and squander the money on a brilliant new red necktie dat 's good ` nuff for I to wear to meetin ' say mrs lee when she eye fall upon the gorgeous bit of cheap silk reckon it will not be waste on any good-for-nuffin boy i 'll show ye wot to do wid yer fish you ' a-gettin ' too mighty fine anyhow dick be disconsolate for a while but he humility take the form of a determination to go for crab that day mainly because he mother have long since set she face against that tribe of animal dey 's a wasteful ` stravagant sort ob fish remark mr lee in frequent explanation of she dislike dey 's all clo'e and no body like some w ` ite folk i know on i do not mean de kinzers dey 's all get body nuff and yet that inlet have a name and reputation of its own for crab there be a wide reach of shallow water inside the southerly point at the mouth where over several hundred acre of muddy flat the depth vary from three and a half to eight foot with the ebb and flow of the tide that be a sort of perpetual crab-pasture and there it be that dick lee determine to expend he energy that Saturday very likely there would be other crabber on the flat but dick be not the boy to object to that provide none of they should notice the change in he raiment at a early hour therefore dab and ford be precede by they young color friend they themselves wait for later breakfast than mr lee be in the habit of prepare dick 's ill fortune do not leave he when he get out of sight of he mother it follow he down to the shore of the inlet and compel he to give up for that day all idea of borrow a respectable boat there be several belong to the neighbor from among which dick be accustom to take he pick in return for errand run and other service render to they owner but on this particular morning not one of they all be available some be fasten with ugly chain and padlock two be haul away above even high-water mark and so dick could not have get either of they into the water even if he have dare to try and as for the rest as dick say -- guess dar owner must hab come and borrer 'em the consequence be that the dark-skinned young fisherman be for once compel to put up with he own boat or rather he father 's the three wise man of gotham be not much worse off when they go to sea in a bowl than be dick lee in that rickety little old flat-bottomed punt do it leak well not so very much with no heavier weight than dick 's but there be reason in he remark that -- dis yer 's a mean boat to frow down a fish in when you cotch ` im he be do suah to git drownded yes and the crab would get they foot wet and so would dick but he resign himself to he circumstance and push away to tell the truth he have not be able to free himself from a linger fear lest he mother might come after he before he could get afloat with order for some duty or other on shore and that would have be worse than go to sea in the little old scow a good deal reckon it be all right say dick as he shove off it would be a awful risk to trus ' dem nice clo'e in de ole boat suah nice clothes nice boat a good many other nice thing be as yet beyond the reach of dick lee but he be quite likely to catch as many crab as he more aristocratic neighbor as for dabney kinzer and he friend from the city they be on they way to the water-side after all at a hour which indicate either smaller appetite than usual or greater speed at the breakfast-table plenty of boat i should say remark ford as he survey the little landing and its vicinity with the air of a man who have a few fleet of he own all sort any of 'em fast not many say dab the row-boat big and little have to be build so they will stand pretty rough water how be the sail-boat same thing there be ham morri 's yacht that why she be as big as any in the lot bigger but she do not show it can not we take a cruise in she asked ford any time ham let I use she whenever i like she be fast enough but she be build so she 'll stand ` most any thing safe as a house if she be handle right handle ford foster 's expression of face would have do honor to the secretary of the navy or the chairman of the naval affair committee in congress or any other perfect seaman noah include it seem to say -- as if any boat could be otherwise than well sail with I on board dabney however even while he be talk have be haul in from its float and grapnel about ten yard out at low water the very stanch-looking little yawl-boat that call he owner she be just such a boat as mr kinzer would naturally have provide for she boy -- stout well-made and sensible -- without any bad habit of upset or the like not too large for dabney to manage all alone the jenny as he call she and as she name be paint on the stern be all the better for have two on board and have room in she then for more the inlet 's pretty narrow for a long reach through the marsh say dabney and as crooked as a ram 's horn i 'll steer and you pull till we be out o ' that and then i 'll take the oar i might as well row out to the crab-grounds say ford as he pitch he coat forward and take he seat at the oar all ready ready say dab and the jenny glide gracefully away from the landing with the starting-push he give she ford foster have have oar in he hand before but he experience have be limit to a class of vessel different in some respects from the one he be in now he be short of something at all event it may have be skill or it may have be leg or discretion but whatever be lack at the third or fourth stroke the oar-blade go a little too deeply below the smooth surface of the water there be a vain tug a little out of time and then there be a boy on the bottom of the boat and a pair of well-polished shoe lift high in the air you have get it shout dabney get what exclaim a all-but angry voice from down there between the seat catch the first ` crab ' reply dabney : that be what we call it can you steer guess i would better row no you will not be the very resolute reply as ford regain he seat and he oar i sha 'n' t catch any more crab of that sort i be a little out of practice that be all i should say you be a little well it will not hurt you ` tis not much of a pull ford would have pull it now if he have blister all the skin off he hand in do so and he do very creditable work for some minute among the turn and winding of the narrow inlet here we be shout dabney at last we be in the inlet yet but it widen out into the bay that be the bay out yonder yes and the island between that and the ocean 's no better 'n a mere bar of sand how d'you get past it right across there almost in a straight line we 'll run it next week in ham 's yacht splendid weak-fishing right in the mouth of that inlet on the ocean side hurrah exclaimed ford i be in for that be the bay deep not very reply dabney but it get pretty rough sometimes ford be get pretty red in the face just then with he unaccustomed exercise and he friend add -- you need not pull so hard : we be almost there hullo if there be not dick lee in he dry-goods box that boat 'll drown he some day and he dad too but just see he pull in crab ford come near catch one more as he try to turn around for the look propose exclaim -- dab let 's get to work as quick as we can they might go away might fly no but do not they go and come well you go and drop the grapnel over the bow and we 'll see 'em come in pretty quick the grapnel or little anchor be throw over quickly enough and the two boy be in such a eager haste that they have hardly a word to say to dick though he be now but a few rod away now it happen that when ford and dab come down to the water that morning each of they have bring a load the former have only a neat little japanned tin box about as big as he head and the latter besides he oar carry a seemingly pretty heavy basket lot of lunch i should say have be ford 's mental comment but he have not think it wise to ask question plenty of lunch in that box think dab at the same moment but only as a matter of course and they be both wrong lunch be the one thing they have both forget but the box and the basket ford foster come out of he own accord with the secret of the box for he now take a little key out of he pocket and unlock it with a air of -- look at this will you dab kinzer look and be very sure he have never before see quite such a assortment of brand-new fish-hook of many sort and size and of fish-line which look as if they have thus far spend they life on dry land tip-top he remark i see a lot of thing we can use one of these day but there be not time to go over 'em now let 's go for the crab what make you bring you box along oh reply ford i leave my rod at home both of 'em you do not s ` pose i would go for crab with a rod do you but you can take you pick of hook and line crab hook and line why yes you do not mean to scoop 'em up in that landing-net do you dab look at he friend for a moment in blank amazement and then the truth break upon he for the first time oh i see you never catch any crab well just you lock up you jewellery-box and i 'll show you it be not easy for dab to keep from laugh in ford foster 's face but he mother have not give he so many lesson in good-breeding for nothing and ford be permit to close he ambitious casket without any worse annoyance than he own wounded pride give he but now come out the secret of the basket the cover be jerk off and nothing be reveal but a varied assortment of clam large and small but mostly of good size -- tough old customer that no amount of roasting or boil would ever have prepare for human eating what be they for -- bait yes bait weight and all how 's that dabney 's reply be to draw from he pocket a couple of long strong cord bit of old fishing-line he crack a couple of clam one against the other tie the fleshy part of one to each of the cord tie bit of shell on a foot or so from the end for sinker hand one cord to ford take the other himself and lay the long-handled scoop-net he have bring with he down between they say -- now we be ready drop you clam down to the bottom and it will not be half a minute before you feel something pull on it then you draw it up gently -- steady as you know how you must not jerk the crab loose you 'll get the knack of it in five minute it be all knack there be not any thing else so stupid as a crab ford watch carefully and obey in silence the direction he have receive in a minute or so more the operation of the scoop-net be call for and the fun begin you get he exclaim ford in a loud whisper as he see dab quickly plunge the net into the water and then shake out of it into the bottom of the boat a great sprawling blue-legged crab he be a whopper he 'll do for one there be one on mine i declare he be let go you jerk the clam away from he sink it again he be mad about it he 'll take right hold again he be pull now or it be another one let he pull lift he easy long as he think he be steal something he 'll hold on there he come -- see he ford see the white flesh of the clam come slowly up through the water and he hold he breath for just behind and below it be a sprawling shadowy something that be tug with all its might at that tough shell-fish it be a awful big one shall i scoop he no indeed : i want to scoop he myself i see how you do it splash go the net as the prize come nearer the surface and ford begin somewhat excitedly to shake it all over the bottom of the boat why where 's that crab you do not mean to say he be quick enough to dodge away quick well no that be not just the trouble i forget to tell you to scoop way under he you hit he square and knock he ever so far the water deceive you eye drive the net under he quick and then lift i have get one -- now just you see how i scoop ford feel dreadfully disappoint over the loss of he first crab but the rapidity with which he catch the knack of it after that be a great credit to he he do not miss the next one he pull up it be great fun but it have its slack moment and in one of these dab suddenly exclaim -- the young black rascal if he have not go and get a sheep 's - head a sheep 's - head they be both stare at the old punt where dick lee be apparently enjoy the most extraordinary good fortune yes that be it that be why he beat we so badly they be a sight better 'n clam only you can not always get one i wonder where he pick up that one but how he do pull 'em in we be do well enough begin dabney when suddenly there come a shrill cry of pain from the black boy 's punt he be barefooted shout dab with it must be confess something like a grin and one of the little pirate have pin he with he nipper that be the difficulty exactly and there need not have be any very serious result of such a expression of a crab 's bad temper but dick lee be more than ordinarily averse to any thing like physical pain and the crab which now have he by the toe be a very muscular and vicious specimen of he quarrelsome race the first consequence of that vigorous nip be a momentary dance up and down in the punt accompany by exclamatory howl from dick but not by a word of any sort from the crab the next consequence be that the crab let go but so at the same instant do the rotten board in the boat-bottom upon which dick lee have so rashly dance it let go of the rest of the boat so suddenly that poor dick have only time for one tremendous yell as it let he right down through to he armpit the water be perfectly smooth but the boat be full in a instant and nearly a bushel of freshly-caught and ill-tempered crab be manoeuvre in all direction around the woolly head which be all they late captor could now keep in sight up with the grapnel ford shout dab take a oar : we 'll both row he can swim like a duck but he might split he throat or get scare to death or those crab might go for he and eat he up how he do yell chapter vii a very accidental call at the very moment when the angry crab close he nipper on the bare big toe of dick lee and he shrill note of discomfort ring across the inlet the shriller whistle of the engine announce the arrival of the morning train from the city at the little station in the village a moment or so later a very pretty young lady be stand beside a trunk on the platform try to get some information from the flagman can you tell I where mr foster life that be the gimlet-eyed lawyer from new yark yes he be from new york say the young lady smile in he face where do he live he be get the sassiest boy thin be it he as take the kinzer house i think likely it be can you tell I how to get there thim kinzer be foine people the widdy marry one of the gurrel to misther morri but how can i get to the house be it there ye be afther goin ' -- hey michael I boy bring up yer owld rattlethrap and take the leddy 's thrunk she 'll be goin ' to the kinzer place sharp now i should say it be mutter the young lady as the remains of what have be a carryall be pull up beside the platform by the skinny skeleton of what might once have be a horse it be a rattletrap there be no choice however for that be the only public conveyance at the station and the trunk be already whisk in behind the dashboard and the driver be wait for she he could afford to wait as it would be some hour before another train would be in there be no door to open in that carriage it be all door except the top and bottom and the pretty passenger be neither help nor hinder in find she place on the back seat if the flagman be more disposed to ask question than to answer they michael say few word of any kind except to he horse to he indeed he keep up a constant stream of encouraging remark the greatest part of which would have be difficult for a ordinary hearer to understand very likely the horse know what they mean for he come very near breaking from a limp into a trot several time under the stimulus of all that cluck and g ` lang now the distance be by no means great and michael seem to know the way perfectly at least he answer yes be indade to several inquiry from he passenger and she be compel to be satisfy with that what a big house it be and painter at work on it too she exclaim just as michael add a vigorous jerk of the rein to the whoa with which he stop he nag in front of a open gate be you sure this be the place yes be fifty cint mum by the time the trunk be out of the carriage and swing inside of the gate the young lady have follow but for some reason michael at once spring back to he place and whip up he limp steed it may have be from the fear of be ask to take that trunk into the house for it be not a small one the young lady stand for a moment irresolute and then leave it where it be and walk on up to the house no bell no knocker the workman have not reach that part of they improvement yet but the door be open and a very neatly furnished parlor at the left of the hall seem to say come right in please and in she go such a arrival could not possibly have escape the notice of the inmate of the house and as the young lady from the railway come in at the front another and a very different-looking lady march through to the parlor from the rear each one would have be a puzzle to the other if the elder of the two have not be mr kinzer and the widow have never be very much puzzle in all she life at all event she put out she hand with a cordial smile say -- miss foster be it not i be mr kinzer how could he have make such a mistake yes miss annie foster but do please explain where be i and how do you know I the widow laugh cheerily how do i know you my dear why you resemble you mother almost as much as you brother ford resemble he father you be only one door from home here and i 'll have you trunk take right over to the house please sit down a moment ah my daughter samantha miss foster excuse I a moment while i call one of the man by the time they mother be fairly out of the room however keziah and pamelum be also in it and annie think she have rarely see three girl whose appearance testify so strongly to the healthiness of the place they live in the flagman 's question and annie 's answer be related quickly enough and the cause of michael 's blunder be plain at once the parlor ring again with peal of laughter for dab kinzer 's sister be ready at any time to look at the funny side of thing and they accidental guest see no reason for not join they you brother ford be on the bay crab with we dabney remark samantha as the widow return but annie 's eye have be furtively watch she baggage through the window and see it swing upon a broad red-shirted pair of shoulder just then and before she could bring she mind to bear upon the crab question keziah kinzer exclaim -- if there be not mrs foster come through the garden gate my mother and annie be up and out of the parlor in a twinkling follow by all the lady of the kinzer family it be really quite a procession now if mr foster be in any degree surprise by she daughter 's sudden appearance or by she get to the kinzer house first instead of to she own it be a curious fact that she do not say so by a word or a look not a breath of it but for all the thorough-bred self-control of the city lady mr kinzer know perfectly well there be something odd and unexpected about it all if samantha have notice this fact there might have be some question ask possibly but one of the widow 's most rigid rule in life be to mind she own business the girl indeed be quite jubilant over a occurrence which make they at once so well acquaint with they very attractive new neighbor and they might have follow she even beyond the gate in the north fence if it have not be for they mother all they be allow to do be to go back to they own parlor and hold a council of war in the course of which annie foster be discuss from she bonnet to she shoe mr foster have be abundantly affectionate in greet she daughter but when once they be alone in the wee sitting-room of the old kinzer homestead she put she arm around she saying -- now my darling tell I what it all means why mother it be partly my mistake and partly the flagman 's and the driver 's and i be sure mr kinzer be kind she know I before i say a word by my resemblance to you oh i do not mean that how be it you be here so soon i think you mean to make a long visit at you uncle hart 's so i would mother if it have not be for those boy you cousin annie cousin mother you never see such young bear in all you life they torment I from morning till night but annie i hope you have not offend -- offended mother aunt marium think they be perfect and so do uncle joe they would let they pull the house down over they head you would think but annie what do they do and what do you say do mother i could not tell you in all day but when they pour ink over my cuff and collar i say i would come home i have just one pair leave white to wear home and i travel all night poor mr foster a cold shudder go over she at the idea of that ink among the spotless contents of she own collar-box what boy they must be but annie what do you aunt say uncle joe laugh till he cry and aunt marium say ` boy will be boy ' and i half believe they be sorry but that be only a sort of a winding-up i would not stay there another day annie have other thing to tell and long before she have finish she story there be no further fault to be find with she for lose she temper still she mother say mildly -- i must write to marium at once for it will not do to let those boy make trouble between we annie look at she with a expression of face which very plainly say -- nobody in the wide world could have the heart to quarrel with you chapter viii a rescue and a grand good time dab kinzer and he friend be prompt enough come to the rescue of they unfortunate fellow-lubber but to get he out of the queer wreck he have make of that punt look like a tough task to both of they and they say as much i be not drownin ' exclaim dick heroically as the other boat be pull alongside of he jest you take you scoop-net and save dem crab they will not drown say ford but they 'll get away say dab as he snatch up the scoop dick 's head be perfectly level on that point the side-board of the old punt be under water half the time but the crab be pretty well pen in even a couple of they that have mistake dick 's wool for another sheep 's - head be secure without difficulty in spite of the firmness with which they cling to they prize what luck he have be have say ford he always do say dab i say dick how 'll i scoop you in have you do get all de crab every pinner of 'em den you jest wait a minute wait be all that be leave they to do for the shine black face and woolly head disappear almost instantly he be sink exclaimed ford there he come reply dab : he would swim ashore from here and not half try why i could swim twice as far as that myself and he can beat I could you i could not that be the first time dab have hear he city acquaintance make a confession of inability and he could see a more than usually thoughtful expression on he face the coolness and skill of dick lee in he hour of disaster have not be throw away upon he if i have my clothes off say ford i believe i would try that on dab kinzer you be de be ' feller dar be but wot 'll we do wid de old boat burst out dick on come to the surface let the tide carry she in while we be crab she be not worth mend but we 'll tow she home all right say dick as he grasp the gunwale of dab 's boat and begin to climb over hold on dick i be a-holdin ' on i mean wait a bit be not you wet of course i 's wet well then you stay in there till you get dry it be well you do not have you new clothes on be not i glad ` bout dem enthusiastically ex-claimed the young african nebber mind dese clo'e de water on 'em be all good dry water like de res ' ob de bay and so say dick tumble over in with a spatter which make ford foster tread on two of three crab in get away from it it be not the first time by many that dick lee have find himself bathing in that bay without any time give he to undress and now it be discover that the shipwrecked crabber have never for one instant lose he hold of the line to the other end of which be fasten he precious sheep 's - head they make a regular crabbing crew now -- two to pull up and one to scoop in and never have the sprawling game be more plentiful on that pasture or more apparently in a greedy hurry to be capture what on earth shall we do with they all ask ford soon 's we have get enough for a mess for both we folk say dab we 'll quit this and go for some fish the clam be good bait and we can try some of you tackle ford 's face brighten a good deal at that suggestion for he have more than once cast a crest fall look at he pretentious box but he reply -- a mess how many crab can one man eat i do not know say dab it depend a good deal on who he be then if he eat the shell he can not take in so many eat de shell yah yah yah dat beat my mudder she be aller a-sayin ' wot a waste de shell make laugh dick i jest wish we might ketch some fish i das not kerry home no crab it do look as if we would get as many as we 'll know what to do with remark dab as he look down on the sprawl multitude in the bottom of the boat we 'll turn the clam out of the basket and fill that but we must not put any crab in the fish-car we 'll stow 'em all forward the basket hold more than half a bushel but there be still a heap of what ford foster call the crusty to pen up in the bow of the boat that duty attend to the grapnel be pull up and dick be set at the oar while dab select from ford 's box just the hook and line they owner have make least account of what 'll we catch dab ` most anything nobody know till he be do it perch porgy cunner black-fish weak-fish maybe a bass or a sheep 's - head but more cunner than any thing else unless we strike some flounder at the turn of the tide that be a big enough assortment to set up a fish-market on if we catch 'em we have get a good enough day anyhow and the tide 'll be about right by the time we get to work why not try here 'cause there be no fish to speak of and because the crab 'll clean you hook for you as fast as you can put the bait on we must go out to deeper water and better bottom dick know just where to go you might hang you line out all day and not get a bite if you do not strike the right spot ford make no answer but look on very seriously while dab skilfully slit up a tough old dutch clam into bait it be begin to dawn upon he that he could teach the ` long-shore boy whether black or white very little about fishing he even allow dab to pick out a line for he and to put on the hook and sinker and dick lee show he how to fix he bait so de fust cunner dat rub agin it will not knock it off dem 's awful mean fish good for nuffin but ` teal bait a merry party they be and the salt water be rapidly dry from the garment of the color oars-man as he pull strongly and skilfully out into the bay and around toward a deep cove at the north of the inlet mouth then indeed for the first time in he life ford foster learn what it be to catch fish not but what he have spend many a hour and even day on and about other water with a rod or a line in he hand but he have never before have two such bear fisherman at he elbow to take he to the right place precisely and at the right time and then to show he what to do when he get there it be fun enough for the fish bit remarkably well and some of those which come into the boat be of a very encouraging size and weight there be one curious thing about those heavier fish ford would have give half the hook and line in he box if he could have catch from dick or dab the mysterious knack they seem to have of coax the biggest of the finny folk to they bait and then over the side of the boat there be some kind of favoritism about it he remark never mind ford reply dab dick and i be better acquaint with they they be always a little shy with stranger at first they do not really mean to be impolite favoritism it be nevertheless and there be now no danger but what dick would be able to appease the mind of he mother without make any mention of the crab at last almost suddenly and as if by common consent the fish stop bite and the two ` long shore boy begin to put away they line go to quit asked ford time 's up and the tide 's turn reply dab not another bite most likely till late this evening we might as well pull up and start for home that be a curious kind of a habit for fish to have they have all get it though ` round this bay mu ' look out for wot 's lef ' ob de ole scow on de way home remark dick a little solemnly i 's boun ' to ketch it for dat good-for-noting ole board we 'll find it and tow it in say dab and perhaps we can get it mend anyhow you can go with we next week we be go to make a cruise in ham morri 's yacht will you go will i go yoop almost yell the excited boy dat 's jest de one t ` ing i would like to jine will not we hab fun she be jest de be ' boat on dis hull bay you be not foolin ' I be yer he be strongly assure that he young white associate be in sober earnest about both they purpose and they promise and after that he insist on rowing all the distance home on the way the old punt be take in tow but the tide have already sweep it so far inside the mouth of the inlet that there be less trouble in pull it the rest of the way it be hardly worth the labor but dab know what a tempest the loss of it might bring around the ear of poor dick when they reach the landing and begin to over-haul they very brilliant catch dabney say -- now dick take you string home leave that basket of crab at mr foster 's and then come back with the basket and carry the rest of 'em to we house ford and i 'll see to the rest of the fish i have not catch half as many as you have either of you say ford when he see with what even-handed justice the fish be divide in three pile as they be scoop out of the fish-car what of that reply dab we follow fisherman 's rule down this way share and share alike you know all the luck be outside the boat they say once the fish be land you luck 's as good as mine do they always follow that rule the man that break it would not find company very easily hereabouts next time he want to go a-fishing no nor for any thing else nobody would boat with he well if it be the regular thing say ford hesitatingly but i 'll tell who really catch 'em oh some of yours be right good one you string would look big enough some day just as you catch 'em would it yes it would do not you imagine we can pull 'em in every time like we do this morning -- crab nor fish no i s ` pose not anyhow i have learn some thing i guess likely we 'll go for some more next week now for a tug be not they heavy though the boat have already be make fast and the two boy pick up they string of fish two for each after dick lee have start for home and heavy thing they be to carry under that hot sun come and show the whole lot to my mother say ford before you take yours into the house i would like to have she see they all all right reply dab but he little dream what be come for when he and ford march proudly into the sitting-room with they finny prize dabney find himself face to face with not good sweet-voiced mr foster but as he think the most beautiful young lady he have ever see ford foster shout annie you here well i never but dab kinzer wish all those fish safely back again swim in the bay chapter ix there be different kind of boy ham morri be a thoughtful and kind-hearted fellow beyond a doubt and he be likely to be a valuable friend for a grow boy like dab kinzer it be not everybody be brother-in-law who would find time during he wedding-trip to hunt up even so pretty a new-england village as grantley and inquire into question of board and lodging and schooling that be precisely what ham do however and miranda go with he of course mr myer to the hospitality of whose cool and roomy-looking house he have be commend by mr hart be so crowded full with summer boarder liberally advertise for in the great city that she have hardly a corner leave in which to stow away ham and he bride for even one night she be glad enough however that she have make the effort and find one after she discover the nature of the stranger 's errand in grantley and that it include winter board for a whole boy there be a look of undisguised astonishment on the face of the regular guest when they gather for the next meal it happen to be supper but they all look at the table and then at one another it be a pity ham and miranda do not understand the meaning of those glance or else that they do not make a longer stay with mr myer they might have learn more about she and she boarding-house if not about the academy as it be they only gather a very high opinion of she cookery and hospitality as well as a increase of respect for the institution of learning and for that excellent gentleman mr hart with a dim hope that dabney kinzer might be permit to enjoy the inestimable advantage offer by grantley and mr myer and the society of mr hart 's two wonderful boy miranda be incline to stand up for she brother somewhat but finally agree with ham that -- what dabney need be schooling and polish my dear it 'll be good for he to board in the same house with two such complete young gentleman as the hart boy of course ham and then too we 'll feel sure of he have plenty to eat there be almost too much on the table not if the boarder have all be boy of dab 's age and with he appetite mr myer be evidently accustom to provide for they i should say so she be and ham and miranda leave grantley next morning after a very early breakfast and when the regular boarder come to theirs they might have guess at once that the transient guest have go they even guess it out loud at dinner and at supper mr myer have give ham and he bride a world of interesting information about grantley and the thing and people in it but there be one thing she have forget or neglect to mention she have fail to tell they that the house she live in and the outlying farm belong to it and nearly all the house-hold effect it contain be the property of mr joseph hart have cost that gentleman very little more than a sharp lawsuit neither do she say a word about how long a time he have give she to pay he he price for it all that be she own private affair and none of ham 's business or miranda 's still it might have have its importance in they mind if they have be inform of it perhaps too some of they rosy impression might have be a little modified if they could have be at the breakfast-table of the hart homestead the morning after annie foster 's sudden departure the table truly be there as usual with the breakfast-thing on it and there be husband and wife at either end but the two side seat be vacant where be joe and foster marium ask mr hart i be sure they be up father i hear they come down stair a hour ago i can not wait for they -- you come home late last night and they have not see you since annie go away there have be a suppress sound of whisper in the entry and the door have be hold open about half a inch by some hand on the other side it be possible therefore that mr hart 's reply be hear outside oh i see it be about annie look here marium : they may have go a little too far but if annie can not take a joke -- so i try to say to she begin he wife but at that instant the whisper in the entry swell suddenly to loud voice and two boy come noisily in and fill the side chair at the table sit down my dear say mr hart with a admiring glance from one to the other i have tell you father about the sad trick you play upon you cousin yes you young rogue add mr hart with affected sternness : you have drive she out of the house joe say the boy on the leave to he brother across the table be not you glad she be go you bet i be she be too stiff and steep for I spoil all the fun we have and so you spoil she cuff and collar for she it be too bad altogether i be afraid there will not be much comfort for anybody in this house till you two get back to grantley fuz say joe do you hear that they be go to give we another term at grantley i do not care how soon we go so we have not get to board at old mother myer 's i can not say about that say mr hart i half make she a promise -- that we would board there exclaim fuz rebelliously now boy say they mother in a gentle voice that sound a little like good mr foster 's but joe sustain he brother with -- prison-fare and not half enough of it i just will not stand it another winter i be not so sure it will be necessary after all say they father who seem to have dismiss annie 's grievance from he mind for the present you cousin ford be sure to go and i be almost certain of another boy besides the missionary 's son if she get a few other herself she house 'll be full enough and you can board somewhere else hurrah for that shout fuz and if the new house do not feed we well we 'll tear it down if you do not tear ours down before you go i 'll be satisfied marium you must write to you sister and smooth the matter over boy will be boy and i would not like to have any coolness spring up mr foster 'll understand it that be very nearly all that be say about it and the two boy evidently have have no need for any hesitation in come in to breakfast they be not so bad-looking a pair as boy go although it may be few other people would have see so much to admire in they as they mother do joe the elder be a loud hoarse-voiced black-eyed boy of seventeen or thereabout with a perpetual grin on he face as if he have discover in this world nothing but a long procession of thing to be laugh at foster so name after he lawyer relative be a year and a half younger but nearly as tall as joe he be paler but with hair and eye as dark and he wear a sort of habitual side-look as if he mind be all the while inquire if anybody within sight happen to have any thing he want they both bear a strong likeness to they father only they miss something bluff and hearty in he accustomed manner and they each have also a little suggestion of they mother that do not however go so far as to put anybody in mind of they aunt foster nobody need have fail to see at all event after watch one or two of they glance at each other that they be the very boy to play the meanest kind of practical joke when they could do it safely there be really no accounting for boy and joe and fuz therefore might fairly be set down among the unaccountable there be no sort of wonder that they easy-going mother and they joke-admiring father should be quite willing to have they spend three-quarter of the year at boarding-school and as much as possible of the remainder somewhere else than at home after mr hart go out to he business that morning and mr hart set herself about she usual duty joe and fuz take with they into the street the whole grantley question we 'll have to go fuz of course but we must have more to eat and more fun than we have last time ford 's come be he the little prig we 'll roast he so we will that young missionary look out about he joe while he be at we house he be come right here you know do not you be afraid he folk be old friend of mother 's we 'll let up on he till we get he safe to grantley then we 'll fix he they have plot and plan enough to talk about but neither they nor any of the boy they name nor any of the other boy they do not name have the least idea of what the future really have in store for they dab kinzer and ford foster in particular have no idea that the world contain such a place as grantley or such a landlady as mr myer they have as little suspicion of they as they have have of find annie foster in the sitting-room that day when they walk in with they famous string of fish ford kiss he sister but that operation hardly check he for a instant in he voluble narrative of the stir event of he first morning on the bay there be really little for anybody else to do but to listen and it be worth hearing there be no sort of interruption on the part of the audience but the moment ford pause for breath he mother say -- be you sure the black boy be not hurt ford hurt mother why he seem to be a kind of black-fish the rest all know he and they go right past my hook to he all the while dear I exclaim mr foster : i forget annie this be ford 's friend dabney kinzer we neighbor will not you shake hand with I mr kinzer say annie with a malicious twinkle of fun in she merry blue eye poor dabney he have be in quite a state of mind for at least three minute but he would hardly have be he own mother 's son if he have let himself be entirely pose up rise he long right arm with the heavy string of fish at the end of it and annie 's fun break out into a musical laugh just as she brother exclaim -- there now i would like to see the other boy of you size can do that look here dab where would you get you training i must not drop the fish you see begin dab but ford interrupt he with -- ` no indeed you have give I half i have get as it be annie have you look at the crab you ought to have see dick lee with a lot of 'em grip in he hair in he hair when he be down through the bottom of he boat they would have eat he up if they would have a chance you see he be no shell on he exactly say annie as dab lower he fish well dabney i wish you would thank you mother for I for send my trunk over you sister too i have no doubt we shall be very neighborly it be wonderfully pleasant to be call by he first name by so very pretty a young lady and yet it seem to bring up something curious into dabney kinzer 's throat she consider I a mere boy and she mean i would better take my fish right home be the next thought that come to he and he be right to a fraction so the great lump in he throat take a very wayward and boyish form and come out as a reply accompany by a low bow -- i will thank you good-afternoon mr foster i 'll see you to-night ford about Monday and the yacht good-afternoon annie and then he march out with he fish mother do you hear he call I ` annie ' yes and i hear you call he ` dabney ' but he be only a boy -- i do not care exclaimed ford he be a odd fellow but he be a good one do you see how wonderfully strong he be in he arm i could not lift these fish at arm 's - length to save my life he know for he have be try he best with he own it be quite likely that dab kinzer 's rowing and all that sort of thing have develop in he greater strength of muscle than even he himself be aware of but for all that he go home with he very ear tingle could she have think I ill-bred or impertinent he mutter to himself think about he poor dab kinzer annie foster have so much else to think of just then for she be compel to go over for ford 's benefit the whole story of she tribulation at she uncle 's and the many rudeness of joe hart and he brother fuz they ought to be drown say ford indignantly in ink add annie just as they drown my poor cuff and collar chapter x a cruise in the swallow look at dabney kinzer say jenny walter to she mother in church the next morning do you ever see anybody 's hair as smooth as that smooth it be certainly and he look all over as if he have give all the care in the world to he personal appearance how be annie foster to guess that he have get himself up so unusually on she account she do not guess it but when she meet he at the church-door after service she be careful to address he as mr kinzer and that make poor dabney blush to he very eye there he exclaim : i know it know what ask annie know what you be think do you indeed yes : you think i be like the crab what _ do _ you mean you think i be green enough till you speak to I and now i be boil red in the face annie could not help laughing -- a little quiet sunday-morning sort of a laugh but she be begin to think she brother 's friend be not a bad specimen of a long island country boy she briskly turn away the small remains of that conversation from crab and they color but she tell she mother on they way home she be sure dabney would be a capital associate for ford that young gentleman be tremendously of the same opinion he have come home the previous evening from a long conference with dab brimful of the propose yachting cruise and he father have freely give he consent much against the inclination of mr foster my dear say the lawyer i feel sure a woman of mr kinzer 's unusual good sense would not permit she son to go out in that way if she do not feel safe about he he have be bring up to it you know and so have the color boy who be to go with they yes mother argue ford : there be not half the danger there be in drive around new york in a carriage there might be a storm she timidly suggest the horse might run away or you might get upset so might a carriage the end of it all be however that ford be to go and annie be more than half sorry she could not go with they in fact she say so to dabney himself as soon as she little laugh be end that Sunday morning some time or other i would be glad to have you reply dab very politely but not this trip why not we mean to go right across the bay and try some fishing could not i fish well no i do not think you could why could not i because -- well because most likely you would be too sea-sick by the time we get there just then a low clear voice behind dabney quietly remark how smooth he hair be dab 's face turn red again annie foster have hear it as distinctly as he have and she walk right away with she mother for fear she should laugh again it be my own hair jenny walter say dab almost savagely as he turn around i should hope it be i should like to know what you go to church for anyhow to hear people talk about sailing and fishing how much do you s ` pose a young lady like miss foster care about small boy or little girl either not much but annie and i mean to have a good sail before long annie and i jenny 's pert little nose seem to turn up more than ever as she walk away for she have not beat she old playfellow quite as badly as usual there be several sharp thing on the very tip or she tongue but she be too much put out and vex to try to say they just then dab make the rest of he way home without any further hap or mishap a sail on the bay be nothing so new or wonderful for he to look forward to and so that Sunday go by a good deal like all he other sunday as for ford foster on the contrary he mind be in a stew and turmoil all day in fact just after tea that evening he father ask he -- what book be that you be read ford captain cook 's voyage and the other in you lap robinson crusoe well you might have worse book than they be that be a fact even for Sunday though you ought to have better but which of they do you and dabney kinzer mean to imitate to-morrow crusoe promptly respond ford i see and so you have get dick lee to go along as you man Friday he be dab 's man not mine oh and you mean to be crusoe number two well do not get cast away on any desolate island that be all ford slip into the library and put the book away it have be samantha kinzer 's room and have plenty of book-shelf in addition to the elegant case mr foster have bring from the city with he for samantha be incline to be of a literary turn of mind all the case and shelf be full too but not on any one of they be ford foster able to discover a volume he care to take out with he in place of cook or crusoe the next morning within half a hour after breakfast every member of the two family be down at the landing to see they young sailor make they start and they be all compel to admit that dab and dick seem to know precisely what they be about as for ford that young gentleman be wise enough with all those eye watch he not to try any thing that he be not sure of though he carefully explain to annie dab be captain you know i be under he order to-day dick lee be hardly the wisest fellow in the world for he add encouragingly -- and you be doin ' tip-top for a green hand you be the wind be blow right off shore and do not seem to promise any thing more than a smart breeze it be easy enough to handle the little craft in the inlet and in a marvellously short time she be dance out upon the blue wave of the spreading bay it be a good deal more like a land-locked sound than any sort of a bay with that long low narrow sand-island cut it off from the ocean i do not wonder ham morri call she the ` swallow ' say ford how she skim can you get in under the deck there forward that be the cabin yes that be the cabin reply dab but ham have the door put in with a slide water-tight it be fit with rubber we can put we thing in there but it be too small for any thing else what be it make so tight for oh ham say he be make he yacht a life-boat those place at the side and under the seat be all water-tight she might capsize but she would never sink do not you see i see how it blow it be a little fresh now we be get away from under the land how would you like to be wreck good fun say ford i get wreck on the car the first time i come over here on the car why yes i forget to tell you about that then follow a very vivid and graphic account of the sad fate of the pig and the locomotive the wonder be how ford should have fail to give dab that story before no such failure would have be possible if he head and tongue have not be so wonderfully busy about so many other thing ever since he arrival i be glad it be i instead of annie he say at length of course do not you tell I she come through all alone yes and she do not like it much either travel all night she run away from those cousin of mine oh but will not i pay they off when i get to grantley where 's that what do they do the swallow be fly along nicely now with dab at the tiller and dick lee tend sail and dab could listen with all he ear to ford 's account of he sister 's tribulation and the merciless practical joke of the hart boy be not they older and bigger than you ask dabney as ford close he recital what can you do with two of they they can not box worth a cent and i can anyhow i mean to teach they better manners you can box have a splendid teacher put I up to all sort of thing will you show I how when we get back we can practice all we choose i have two pair of glove hurrah for that ease she dick it be blow pretty fresh we 'll have a tough time tack home against such a breeze as this maybe it 'll change before night capt ` in dab calmly remark dick we be on ' y a mile to run well what of it be you goin ' fo ' de inlet of course what else can we do that be what we start for look kind o ' dirty dat 's all so far as ford could see both the sky and the water look clean enough but dick be entirely right about the weather in fact if captain dabney kinzer have be a more experienced and prudent seaman he would have keep the swallow inside the bar that day at any risk of ford foster 's good opinion as it be even dick lee 's keen eye hardly comprehend how threatening be the foggy haze that be lie low on the water mile and mile away to seaward it be magnificently exciting fun at all event and the swallow fully merit all that have be say in she favor the mile to run be a very short one and it seem to ford foster that the end of it would bring they up high and dry on the sandy beach of the island the narrow strait of the inlet between the bay and the ocean be hardly visible at any considerable distance it open to view however as they draw near and dab kinzer rise higher than ever in he friend 's good opinion as the swift little vessel he be steer shot unerringly into the contract channel be not we pretty near where you say we be to try for some fish he ask just outside there get the grapnel ready dick sharp now sharp it be and ford himself lend a hand and in another moment the white sail go down jib and main the swallow be drift along under bare pole and dick lee and ford be wait the captain 's order to let go the neat little anchor heave over go the iron the hawser follow briskly that 'll do dick : hold she dick give the rope a skilful turn around its pin and dab shout -- now for some weak-fish it be about three fathom and the tide 's near the turn alas for the uncertainty of human calculation the grapnel catch on the bottom surely and firmly but the moment there come any strain on the seemingly stout hawser that hold it the latter part like a thread and the swallow be all adrift somebody 's do go cut dat rope shout dick as he frantically pull in the treacherous bit of hemp there be a anxious look on dab kinzer 's face for a moment then he shout -- sharp now boy or we 'll be roll in the surf in three minute haul away dick haul with he ford up with she there that 'll give we headway ford foster look out to seaward even while he be haul he best upon the sail halyard all along the line of the coast at distance vary from a hundred yard or so to nearly a mile there be a irregular line of foam breaker -- a awful thing for a boat like the swallow to run into perhaps but ten time worse for a larger craft for the latter would be shatter on the shoal where the bit of a yacht would find plenty of water under she that be if she do not at the same time find too much water _ over _ she can not we go back through the inlet in the bar ask ford not with this wind in we tooth and it be get worse every minute no more will it do to try to keep inside the surf what can we do then take the smoothest place we can find and run 'em the sea be not very rough outside it be we only chance poor ford foster 's heart sink within he as he listen and as he gaze ahead upon the long white line of foam surf and toss breaker he see however a look of heroic resolution rise in captain kinzer 's face and it give he courage to turn he eye again towards the surf the swallow be now once more move in a way to justify she name and although ford be no sailor he could see that she only chance to penetrate that perilous barrier of broken water be to take it nose on as dick lee express it that be clearly the thing dab kinzer intend to do there be place of comparative smoothness here and there in the toss and plunge line but they be bad enough at the best and they would have be a good deal worse but for that stiff breeze blow off shore now for it shout dab as the swallow bound on dar dey come say dick ford thought of he mother and sister and father but he have not a word to say and hardly feel like breathing bow foremost full sail rise like a cork on the long strong billow which would have roll she over and over if she have not be handle so skilfully as she really be once or twice pitch dangerously in short chop sea and shipping water enough to wet she brave young mariner to the skin and call for vigorous baling afterwards -- the swallow battle gallantly with she danger for a few moment and then dab kinzer swing he hat and shout -- hurrah boy we be out at sea dat 's so say dick so it be remark ford a little gloomily but how on earth will we ever get ashore again we can not go back through that surf well reply dab if it do not come on to blow too hard we 'll run right on down the coast if the wind lull or whop around a little we would find we way in easy enough long before night we might have a tough time beat home across the bay even if we be inside the bar now anyhow we be safe enough out here ford could hardly feel that very strongly but he be determine not to let dab see it and he make a effort at the calmness of a mohawk as he say how about fishing guess we will not bother 'em much but you might go for a bluefish sometimes they have great luck with they right along here chapter xi splendid fishing and a big fog there be no tell how many anxious people there may have be in that region that night a little after supper but there be no doubt of the state of mind in at least three family circle good mr foster could not endure to stay at home and talk about the matter and she husband and annie be very willing to go over to the kinzer ' with she and listen to the encouraging view of dabney 's stout-hearted and sensible mother they be welcome heartily and the conversation begin so to speak right in the middle oh mrs kinzer do you think they be in any danger i hope not i do not see why there need be unless they try to return across the bay against this wind but do not you think they 'll try do you mean they will not be home to-night exclaim mr foster himself i sincerely hope not say the widow calmly i should hardly feel like trust dabney out in the boat again if he should do so foolish a thing but where can he stay at anchor somewhere or on the island almost anywhere but tack all night on the bay he would be really safer out at sea than try to get home out at sea there be something really dreadful in the very idea of it and annie foster turn pale enough when she think of the gay little yacht and she brother out on the broad atlantic in it with no better crew than dab kinzer and dick lee samantha and she sister be hardly as steady about it as they mother but they be careful to conceal they misgiving from they neighbor which be very kindly indeed in the circumstance there be little use in try to think or talk of any thing else beside the boy however with the sound of the high wind in the tree out by the roadside and a very anxious circle be that up to the late hour at which the member of it separate for the night but there be other troubled heart in that vicinity old bill lee himself have be out fishing all day with very poor luck but he forget all about that when he learn on reach the shore that dick and he white friend have not return he even pull back to the mouth of the inlet to see if the gathering darkness would give he any sign of he boy he do not know it but while he be go dick 's mother after discuss she anxiety with some of she dark-skinned neighbor half weepingly unlock she one clothes-press and take out the suit which have be the pride of she absent son she have never admire they half so much before but they seem now to need a red necktie to set they off and so the gorgeous result of dick 's fishing and trading come out of its hiding-place and be arrange on the white coverlet of she own bed with the rest of he best garment jus ' de t ` ing for a handsome young feller like dick she mutter to herself wot for would a ole woman like I want to put on any sech fool finery he be de bestest boy in de worl ' he be dat be onless dar be not not ` in ' happen to ` im she husband bring she home no news when he come and dick 's good quality be likely to be see in a strong light for a while longer but if the folk on shore be uneasy about the swallow and she crew how be it with the latter themselves as the darkness close around they out there upon the toss water very cool and self-possessed indeed have be captain dab kinzer and he have encourage the other to go on with they blue-fishing even when it be pretty tough work to keep the swallow from scud at once before the wind he be anxious also not to get too far from shore for there be no tell what sort of weather might be come it be curious moreover what very remarkable luck they have or rather ford and dick for dab would not leave the tiller for a moment splendid fellow be those blue-fish and hard work it be to pull in the heaviest of they that be just the sort of weather they bite best in but it be not often that such young fisherman venture to take advantage of it no nor the old one either for only the stanchest old salt of montauk or new london would have feel altogether at home in the swallow that afternoon i guess i would not fish any more say dab at last you have catch ten time as many now as we ever think of catch some of they be whopper too biggest fishing ever i do say ford as if that mean a great deal or mo ' anybody else out dis yer way add dick i be not ` shame to show dem fish anywhar no more i be not say dab but you be get too tired and so be i we must have a good hearty lunch and put ` the swallow ' before the wind for a while i dare not risk any more of these cross sea we might get pitch over any minute they be rise dat 's so say dick and i 's awful hungry i be the swallow be well enough provision for a short cruise not to mention the bluefish and there be water enough on board for several day if they should happen to need it but there be little danger of that unless the wind should continue to be altogether against they it be blow hard when the boy finish they dinner but no harder than it have already blow several time that day and the swallow seem to be put forth she very best quality as a sea-boat there be no immediate danger apparently but there be one symptom which dab discern as he glance around the horizon which give he more anxiety than either the stiff breeze or the rough sea the come darkness no for star and lighthouse can be see at night and steering by they be easy enough night be pretty dark thing sometimes as most people know but the darkest thing to be meet with at sea whether by night or by day be a _ fog _ and dabney see sign of one coming rain too might come with it but that would be of small account boy he say do you know we be out of sight of land oh no we be not reply ford confidently look yonder that be not land ford that be only a fog-bank and we shall be all in the dark in ten minute the wind be change too and i hardly know where we be look at you compass that tell I the wind be change a little and it be go down but i would not dare to run towards the shore in a fog and at night why not why do not you remember those breaker would you like to be blow through they and not see where you be go well no say ford : i rather guess i would not je ' you let capt ` in kinzer handle di yer boat almost crustily interpose dick lee he be de on ' y feller on board dat un ` erstands nagivation should not wonder if you be right say ford good-humoredly at all event i sha 'n' t interfere but dab what do you mean to do about it swing a lantern at the mast-head and sail right along you and dick get a nap by and by if you can i will not try to sleep till daylight sleep catch I sleep you must and so must dick when the time come it will not do for we to all get wear out together if we do who would handle the boat ford 's respect for dabney kinzer be grow hourly here be this overgrown gawk of a green country boy just out of he roundabout who have never spend more than a day at a time in the great city and never live in any kind of a boarding-house in fact here be a fellow who have have no advantage whatever -- come out as a sort of hero ford look at he hard as he stand there with the tiller in he hand but he could not quite understand it dab be so quiet and matter-of-course about it all and as for that youngster himself he have no idea that he be behave any better than any other boy could should and would have behave in those very peculiar circumstance however that might be the gay and buoyant little swallow with she signal lantern swing at she mast-head be soon dance away through the deepen darkness and the fog and she steady-nerved young commander be congratulating himself that there seem to be a good deal less of wind and sea even if there be more of mist i could not expect to have every thing to suit I he say to himself and now i hope we sha 'n' t run down anybody hullo be not that a red light through the fog yonder chapter xii how the game of follow my leader can be play at sea there be yet another gathering of human being on the wind-swept surface of the atlantic that evening to whose mind the minute and hour be go by with no small burden of anxiety to carry not a anxiety perhaps as great as that of the three family over there on the shore of the bay or even of the three boy toss along through the fog in they bubble of a yacht but the officer and not a few of the passenger and crew of the great iron-builded ocean-steamer be any thing but easy about the way they affair be look it would have be so much more agreeable if they could have look at they at all have they no pilot on board to be sure they have for he have come on board in the usual way as they draw near they intended port but they have somehow seem to bring that fog along with they and the captain have a half-defined suspicion that neither the pilot nor he himself know exactly where they now be that be a bad condition for a great ship to be in at any time and especially when it be draw so near a coast which call for good seamanship and skilful pilotage in the best of weather the captain would not for any thing have confess he doubt to the pilot nor the pilot he to the captain and that be where the real danger lay after all if they could only have choke down they pride and permit themselves to talk of they possible peril it would very likely have disappear that be they could at least have decide to stop the vessel till they be rid of they doubt the steamer be french and she captain a french naval officer and it be possible he and the pilot do not understand each other any too well it be a matter of course that the speed of the ship should be somewhat lessen under such circumstance but it would have be a good deal wiser not to have go on at all not to speak of the shore they be near they might be sure they be not the only craft steam or sail over those busy water and vessel have sometimes be know to run against one another in a fog as thick as that something could be do by way of precaution in that direction and lantern with bright color be freely swing out but the fog be likely to diminish they usefulness somewhat they take away a little of the gloom but none of the passenger be in a mood to go to bed with the end of they voyage so near and they all seem disposed to discuss the fog if not the general question of mist and they discomfort all of they but one and he a boy a boy of about dab kinzer 's age slender and delicate-looking with curly light-brown hair blue eye and a complexion which would have be fair but for the trace it bear of a hotter climate than that of either france or america he seem to be all alone and to be feel very lonely that night and he be lean over the rail peer out into the mist hum to himself a sweet wild air in a strange but exceedingly musical tongue very strange very musical perhaps no such word have ever before go out over that part of the atlantic for frank harley be a missionary 's son go home to be educate and the sweet low-voiced song be a hindustanee hymn which he mother have teach he in far-away indium suddenly the hymn be cut short by the hoarse voice of the lookout as it announce -- a white light close aboard on the windward bow that be rapidly follow by even hoarser hail reply to by a voice which be clear and strong enough but not hoarse at all the next moment something which be either a white sail or a ghost come slip along through the fog and then the conversation do not require to be shout any longer frank could even hear one person say to another out there in the mist be not it a big thing ford that you know french i mean to study it when we get home it be as easy as eat dab shall i tell 'em we have get some fish of course we 'll sell 'em the whole cargo sell they why not make they a present we may need the money to get home with they be a splendid lot enough for the whole cabin-full dat 's a fack cap ` in dab kinzer 's de sort ob capt ` in fo ' I he be how much then twenty-five dollar for the lot they be worth it -- specially if we lose ham 's boat dab 's philosophy be a little out of gear but a perfect rattle of question and answer follow in french and somewhat to frank harley 's astonishment the bargain be promptly conclude fresh fish just out of the water be a particularly pleasant arrival to people who have be ten day out at sea how be they to get they on board nothing easier since the little swallow could run along so nicely under the stern of the great steamer after a line be throw she and a large basket be swing out at the end of a long slender spar with a pulley to lower and raise it there be fun in the loading of that basket : but even the boy from long island be astonish at the number and size of the fine freshly-caught blue-fish to which they be treat the hungry passenger of the prudhomme and the basket have to go and come again and again the steamer 's steward on he part avow that he have never before meet so honest a lot of yankee fisherman perhaps not for high price and short weight be apt to go together where luxury be sell the pay itself be hand out in the same basket which go for the fish and then the swallow be again cast loose the wind be not nearly so high as it have be and the sea have for some time be go down twenty minute later frank harley hear -- for he understand french very well -- hullo the boat what be you follow we for oh we will not run you down do not be alarm we have lose we way out here and we be go to follow you in hope you know where you be there be a cackle of surprise and laughter among the steamer 's officer in which frank and some of the passenger join and the saucy little fishing-boat come steadily on in the wake of she gigantic tide this be grand for we remark dab kinzer to ford as he keep he eye on the after-lantern of the prudhomme they pay all we pilot-fee but they be go to new york so be we if to-morrow do not come out clear and with a good wind to go home by it be better than cross the atlantic in the dark anyhow but what a steep price we get for those fish they be always ready to pay well for such thing at the end of a voyage say dab i expect though they would try and beat we down a peg they generally do we do not get much more than the fair market price after all only we get rid of we whole catch at one sale that be a good deal better than fisherman be apt to do hour follow hour and the swallow follow the steamer and the fog follow they both so closely that sometimes even dick lee 's keen eye could with difficulty make out the prudhomme 's light and now ford foster venture to take a bit of a nap so sure do he feel that all the danger be over and that captain kinzer be equal to what dick lee call the nagivation of that yacht how long he have sleep he could not have guess but he be awaken by a great cry from out the mist beyond they and by the loud exclamation of captain kinzer still at the tiller -- i believe she be run ashore it be a loud cry indeed and there be good reason for it well be it for all on board the great steamer that she be run no faster at the time and that there be no hurricane of a gale to make thing worse for she pilot and captain have both together miss they reckoning -- neither of they could ever afterward tell how -- and there they be stick fast in the sand with the noise of breaker ahead of they and the dense fog all around frank harley peer anxiously over the rail again but he could not have complain that he be wreck in sight of shore for the steamer be any thing but a wreck as yet and there be no shore in sight it be a hour to sunrise say dab to ford after the latter have manage to comprehend the situation we may as well run farther in and see what we can see it must have be aggravate to the people on board the steamer to see that little cockle-shell of a yacht dancing safely along over the shoal on which they leviathan have strike and to hear ford foster sing out if we would know you mean to run in here we would have follow some other pilot they be in no danger at all say dab if they own boat do not take 'em all ashore the coast-wrecker will the government life-saver i s ` pose you mean yes : they be all alongshore here everywhere hark there go the distress-gun bang away it sound a good deal more mad than scare so it do and so they be -- captain pilot passenger and all captain kinzer find that he could safely run in for a couple of hundred yard or so but there be sign of surf beyond and he have no anchor to hold on by he only course be to tack back and forth as carefully as possible and wait for daylight -- as the french sailor be do with what patience they could command in less than half a hour however a pair of long graceful buoyant-looking life-boat man each with a officer and eight rower come shooting through the mist in response to the repeat summons of the steamer 's cannon it be all right now say dab i know they would not be long in come let 's find out where we be that be easy enough the steamer have go ashore on a sand-bar a quarter of a mile from the beach and a short distance from seabright on the new jersey coast and there be no probability of any worse harm come to she than the delay in she voyage and the cost of pull she out from the sandy bed into which she have so blindly thrust herself the passenger would most likely be take ashore with they baggage and send on to the city overland in fact say ford foster a sand-bar be not as bad for a steamer as a pig be for a locomotive the train you be wreck in say dab be run fast perhaps the pig be now the sandbar be stand still and the steamer be go slow my what a crash there would have be if she have be run ten or twelve knot a hour with a heavy sea on by daylight there be plenty of other craft around include yacht and sail-boat from long branch and all along shore and the long island boy treat the occupant of these as if they have send for they and be glad to see they seem to I you be incline to be a little inquisitive dab say ford as he friend peer sharply into and around one craft after another but just then dabney sing out -- hullo jersey what be you do with two grapnel be that boat of yours balky mind yer eye youngster they be both mine i reckon you might sell I one cheap continued dab consider how you get 'em give you ten cent for the big one ford think he understand the matter now and he say nothing but the jersey wrecker have pick up both of those anchor one time and another and have no sort of objection to talk trade ten cent let you have it for fifty dollar be it gold or only silver gilt pure gold my boy but seem ' it be you i 'll let you have it for ten dollar take you pay in clam oh hush i hai not no time to gabble mebbe i 'll git a job here ` round this yer wreck if you reelly want that there grapn ' i wot 'll you gimme five dollar gold take it or leave it say dab pull out a coin from the money he have receive for he bluefish in three minute more the swallow be furnish with a much larger and better anchor than the one she have lose the day before and dick lee exclaim it je ' take cap'n kinzer for some minute before this as the light grow clearer and the fog lift a little frank harley have be watch they from the rail of the prudhomme and wonder if all the fisher-boy in america dress as well as these two hullo you be the greet which now come to he ear go ashore in my boat not till i have eat some of you fish for breakfast say frank what be you name captain dabney kinzer of ` most anywhere on long island what be yours frank harley of rangoon i declare almost shout ford foster if you be not the chap my sister annie tell I of you be go to albany to my uncle joe hart 's be not you yes to mr hart 's and then to grantley to school that be it well then you can just come along with we get you kit out of you state-room we can send over to the city after the rest of you baggage after it get in along with you where to my father 's house instead of ashore among those hotel people and other wrecker the captain 'll tell you it be all right frank have further question to ask before he be satisfy as to whose hand he be about to fall into and the whole arrangement be no doubt a little irregular so be the present position of the prudhomme herself however and all landing rule be a trifle out of joint by reason of that circumstance so the steamer authority listen to frank 's request when he make it and gruffly grant it the swallow lay quietly at she new anchor while she passenger to be be complete he preparation to board she part of they consist of a hearty breakfast -- fresh bluefish broil and while he be eat it the crew of the yacht make a deep hole in what remain of they own supplies nobody who have see they eat would have suspect that they long night at sea have interfere with they appetite in fact each of they remark to the other that it have not so far as he be concern we 'll make a good run say dab it 'll be great what say ford in some astonishment be not you go to new york at all what for i think that be what you mean to do shall you sail right straight home why not if we could do that distance at night and in a storm i guess we can in a day of such splendid weather as this with the wind just right too chapter xiii home again here we be the wind be indeed just right but even dab forget for the moment that the swallow would go faster and farther before a gale than she be likely to with the comparatively mild southerly breeze now blow he be by no means likely to get home by dinner-time as for danger there would be absolutely none unless the weather should again become stormy and there be no probability of any such thing at that season and so after he have eat he breakfast and with a genuine boy 's confidence in boy frank harley come on board the swallow as a passenger the anchor be lift and the gay little craft spread she white sail and slip lightly away from the neighborhood of the forlorn-looking stranded steamer they 'll have she out of that in less 'n a week say ford to frank my father 'll know just what to do about you baggage and so forth there be endless question to be ask and answer on both side but at last dab yawn a very sleepy yawn and say ford you have have you nap wake up dick there and let he take he turn at the tiller the sea 's as smooth as a lake and i believe i 'll go to sleep for a hour or so you and frank can keep watch while dick steer : he be a good steerer whatever dab say be order now on board the swallow and ford 's only reply be -- if you have not earn a good nap then nobody have dick too respond promptly and cheerfully and in five minute more the patient and skilful young captain be sleep like a top look at he say ford foster to frank harley i do not know what he be make of he be be at that tiller for twenty-three hour by the watch in all sort of weather and never budge they do not make that kind of boy in indium reply frank he be de be ' feller you ebber see add dick lee i 's je ' proud ob he i be smoothly and swiftly and safely the swallow be bear she precious cargo across the summer sea but the morning have bring no comfort to the two home at the head of the inlet or the humble cabin in the village old bill lee be out in the best boat he could borrow by early daylight and more than one of he sympathizing neighbor follow he a little later there be no doubt at all that a thorough search would be make of the bay and the island and so mr foster wisely remain at home to comfort he wife and daughter that sort of boy mourn annie be always get into some kind of mischief annie exclaim she mother indignantly ford be a good boy and he do not run into mischief i do not mean ford : i mean that dabney kinzer i wish we have never see he or he sailboat either annie remark she father a little reprovingly if we live by the water ford _ will _ go out on it and he have better do so in good company wait a while annie be silence but it be only too clear that she be not entirely convinced she brother 's absence and all they anxiety be positively due to dab kinzer and he wicked dangerous little yacht and he must be to blame somehow she could not help wait a while as she father bid she but she eye already tell that she have be do more than wait summer day be long but some of they be a good deal longer than other and that be one of the longest any of those people have ever know for once even dinner be more than half neglect in the kinzer family circle at the foster ' it be forget almost altogether long as the day be and so dreary in spite of all the bright warm sunshine there be no help for it : the hour would not hurry and the wanderer would not return tea-time come at last and with it the foster all come over to mr kinzer 's again to take tea and tell she of several fisherman who have return from the bay without have discover a sign of the swallow or its crew stout-hearted mr kinzer talk bravely and encouragingly nevertheless and do not seem to abate a ounce of she confidence in she son it seem as if in leave off he roundabout particularly consider the way in which he have leave they off dabney must have suddenly grow a great many size in he mother 's estimation perhaps too that be because he have not leave they off any too soon there they sit around the tea-table the two mother and all the rest of they look gloomy enough while over there in she bit of a brown house in the village sit mr lee in very much the same frame of mind try to relieve she feeling by smooth imaginary wrinkle out of she boy 's best clothes and plan for he any number of bright red necktie if he would only come back to wear they the neighbor be become more than a little interested and even excite about the matter but what be there to be do telegram have be send to other point on the coast and all the fisherman notify it be really one of those puzzling case where even the most neighborly can do no better than wait a while still there be more than a dozen people of all sort include bill lee linger around the landing as late as eight o'clock that evening suddenly one of they exclaim -- there be a light come in other follow with -- there be a boat under it ham 's boat carry a light i 'll bet it be she no it be not -- hold on and see there be not long to hold on for in three minute more the swallow sweep gracefully in with the tide and the voice of dab kinzer shout merrily -- home again here we be such a ringing volley of cheer answer he it be hear and understand away there in the parlor of the morri house and bring every soul of that anxious circle right up standing must be it be dab exclaimed mr kinzer o mother say annie be ford safe they would not cheer like that my dear if any thing have happen remark mr foster but in spite of he coolness the city lawyer forget to put he hat on as he dash out of the front gate and down the road towards the landing then come one of those time that it take a whole orchestra and a gallery of painting to tell any thing about : for mr lee as well as she husband be on the beach and within a minute after captain kinzer and he crew have land poor dick be be hug and scold within a inch of he life and the two other boy find themselves in the midst of a perfect tumult of embrace and cheer frank harley 's turn come soon moreover for ford foster find he balance and introduce the passenger from indium to he father frank harley exclaim mr foster i have hear of you certainly but how do you -- boy i do not understand -- oh father it be all right we take frank off the french steamer after she run ashore run ashore yes down the jersey coast we get in company with she in the fog after the storm that be yesterday evening down the jersey coast do you mean you have be out at sea yes father and i would go again with dab kinzer for captain do you know father he never leave the rudder of ` the swallow ' from the moment we start until seven o'clock this morning you owe he you life almost shout mr foster and ford add emphatically indeed we do it be dab 's own mother 's arm that have be around he from the instant he have step ashore and samantha and keziah and pamelum have have to content themselves with a kiss or so apiece but dear good mr foster stop smooth ford 's hair and forehead just then and come and give dab a right motherly hug as if she could not express she feeling in any other way as for annie foster she face be suspiciously red at the moment but she walk right up to dab after she mother release he and say -- captain kinzer i have be say dreadful thing about you but i beg pardon i 'll be entirely satisfied miss foster say dabney if you 'll only ask somebody to get we something to eat eat exclaim mr kinzer why the poor fellow of course they be hungry cap'n kinzer aller do know je ' de right t ` ing to do mumble dick in a half-smothered voice and he mother let go of he with -- law suz so dey be hungry enough they all be indeed and the supper-table moreover be the best place in the world for the further particulars of they wonderful cruise to be tell and hear dick lee be lead home in triumph to a capital supper of he own and as soon as that be over he be rig out in he Sunday clothes -- red silk necktie and all -- and invite to tell the story of he adventure to a roomful of admire neighbor he tell it well modestly ascribe every thing to dab kinzer but there be no good reason in any thing he say for one of he father 's friend to inquire next morning -- bill lee do you mean for to say as dem boy run down de french steamah in dat ar ' boat not dat not zackly 'cause ef you do i jes ' want to say i 's be down a-lookin ' at she and she be not even snub she bowsprit chapter xiv a great many thing get ready to come the newspaper from the city bring full account of the strand of the prudhomme and of the safety of she passenger and cargo the several editor seem to differ widely in they opinion relate to the whole affair but there must have be some twist in the mind of the one who excuse everybody on the ground that no pilot however skilful could work he compass correctly in so dense a fog as that none of they have any thing whatever to say of the performance of the swallow the yacht have be every bit as well handle as the great steamship but then she have reach she port in safety and she be such a little thing after all whatever excitement there have be in the village die out as soon as it be know that the boy be safe and a good many people begin to wonder why they have be so much upset about it anyhow mr lee herself the very next morning so far recover she peace of mind as to wonder wot dab kinzer 's goin ' to do wid all de money he get for dem bluefish i be not goin ' to ask he say dick he be capt ` in as for dab himself he do a immense amount of useful sleep that first night but when he awake in the morning he shortly make a discovery and the other boy soon make another dab 's be that all the long hour of daylight and darkness while he hold the tiller of the swallow he have be think as well as steering he have therefore be grow very fast and would be sure to show it sooner or later ford and frank find that dab have forget nothing he have say about learn how to box and how to talk french but he do not say a word to they about another important thing he talk enough to be sure but a great original idea be begin to take form in he mind and he be not quite ready yet to mention it to any one i guess he mutter more than once i would better wait till ham come home and talk to he about it as for frank harley mr foster have readily volunteer to visit the steamship-office in the city with he that next day and see that every thing necessary be do with reference to the safe delivery of he baggage at the same time of course mr foster write to she sister mr hart give a full account of all that have happen but say that she mean to keep frank as she own guest for a while if mr hart do not seriously object that letter make something of a sensation in the hart family neither mr hart nor she husband thought of make any objection for to tell the truth it come to they as a welcome relief it be just the best arrangement that could have be make marium all around say he write at once and tell she she may keep he as long as she please that be very well for they but the boy hardly feel the same way about it they have be plan to have all sort of fun with that young missionary in they own house he be as fuz express it to be put through a regular course of sprout and take the hindu all out of he never mind though say joe after the letter come and the decision of they parent be declare : we 'll serve he out after we get to grantley there will not be anybody to interfere with the fun well yes reply fuz and i would just as lief not see too much of he before that he will not have any special claim on we neither if he do not go there from we house that be a queer sort of calculation but it be only a begin they have other talk on the same subject and the tone of they all have in it a promise of lively time at grantley for the friendless young stranger from indium other however be think of the future as well as themselves and joe and fuz furnish the subject for more than one animated discussion among the boy down there by the long island shore ford foster give he two friend the full benefit of all he know concern he cousin it be a good thing for you he say to frank that the steamer do not go ashore anywhere near they house they be a pair of bear young wrecker just think of the trick they play on my sister annie they be all related in ford 's most graphic style with comment to suit from he audience after that conversation however it be remarkable what good attention dab kinzer and frank harley pay to they sparring-lesson it even exceed the pluck and perseverance with which dab work at he french and ford be compel to admit to he in particular you ought to have a grown-up teacher -- somebody you will not kill if you make out to get in a hit on he you be too long in the reach for I and you arm be too hard what between the boxing-glove and the boat there could be no question but what frank harley have land at the right place to get strong in there be plenty of fishing bathing ride boat boxing : if they have work day and night they could not have use it all up three boy together can find so much more to do than one can all alone and they make it four as often as they could for dick lee have prove himself the best kind of company frank harley 's east-indian experience have make he indifferent to the mere question of color and ford foster be too much of a man to forget that long night of gale and fog and danger on board the swallow it be only a day or two after that perilous cruise that dab kinzer meet he old playmate jenny walter just in the edge of the village how well you look dabney remark the sharp-tongued little lady drown must agree with you yes say dab i like it do you know what a fuss they make over you when you be go i s ` pose they would nothing else to do jenny say dab suddenly hold out he hand you must not quarrel with I any more bill lee tell I about you come down to the landing you may say any thing to I you want to jenny color and bite she lip and she would have give she bonnet to know if bill lee have tell dab how very red she eye be as she look down the inlet for some sign of the swallow something have to be say however and she say it almost spitefully i do not care dabney kinzer : it do seem dreadful to think of you three boy be drown and you too with you new clothes on good-morning dab she be a right good-hearted girl if she would only show it mutter dab as jenny trip away but she be not a bit like annie foster he thought must have be on something else than he young-lady acquaintance nevertheless for he next word be how i do wish ham morri would come home there be time enough for that and ham be hardly likely to be in a hurry the day be well employ in he absence and as they go by the morris homestead go steadily on look less and less like its old self and more and more like a house make for people to live and be happy in mr kinzer and she daughter have now settle down in they new quarter as completely as if they have never know any other and it seem to dab now and then as if they have take almost too complete possession he mother have she room of course and a big one it be there could be no objection to that then another big one of the very best have to be set apart and fit up for ham and miranda on they return home and dab have take great delight in do all in he power to make that room all it could be make but then samantha have insist upon have a separate domain and keziah and pamelum have imitate they elder sister to a fraction the guest-chamber have to be provide as well or what would become of the good old long island notion of hospitality dab say nothing while the partition be under discussion nor for a while afterwards but one day at dinner just after the come of a letter from miranda announce the speedy arrival of herself and she husband he quietly remark -- now i can not sleep in ham 's room any longer i suppose i 'll have to go out on the roof i will not sleep in the garret or in the cellar that will be a good deal as mr morri say when she come calmly respond he mother as miranda say say dab with a long breath miranda gasp samantha and she sister in chorus yes my dear certainly say they mother this be mrs morri 's house -- or she husband 's -- not mine all the arrangement i have make be only temporary she and ham both have idea and will of they own i have only do the best i could for the time be the girl look at one another in blank amazement over the idea of mr kinzer be any thing less than the mistress of any house she might happen to be in but dabney lay down he knife and fork with -- it be all right then if ham and miranda be to settle it i think i 'll take the room sam have now you need not take away you book sam : i may want to read some of they or lend they to annie you and kezus and mele have better take that upper room back the smell of the paint 's all go now and there be three kind of carpet on the floor dabney exclaim samantha reproachfully and with a appealing look at she mother who however say nothing on either side and be a woman of too much good sense to take any other view of the matter than that she have announce thing be again all run on smoothly and pleasantly before dinner be over but dab 's idea of how the house should be divide be likely to result in some change -- perhaps not precisely the one he indicate but such as would give he something better than a choice between the garret the cellar and the roof at all event only three day would now intervene before the arrival of the two traveller and any thing in the way of further discussion of the room question be manifestly out of order every thing require for the come reception be push forward by mr kinzer with all the energy she could bring to bear and dab feel call upon to remark to pamela -- be not it wonderful mele how many thing she find to do after every thing 's do the widow have promise she son-in-law that he house should be ready for he and it be likely to be a good deal more ready than either he or he wife have expect chapter xv dabney kinzer to the rescue one of the most troublesome of the annoyance which come nowadays to dweller in the country within easy reach of any great city be the bad kind of stroll beggar know as the tramp he be of all sort and size and he go everywhere ask for any thing he want very much as if it belong to he and he have come for he own -- so long as he can do he asking of a woman or a sickly-looking man there have be very few of these gentry see in that vicinity that summer for a wonder and those who have make they appearance have be reasonably well behave probably because there have be so many healthy-looking man around as a general thing but it come to pass on the very day in which ham and miranda be expect to arrive by the last of the evening train just as dab kinzer be turn away from the landing where he have be for a look at the swallow and to make sure she be all right for she owner 's eye that a very disreputable specimen of a worthless man stop at mr kinzer 's to beg something to eat and then saunter away down the road it be a little past the middle of the afternoon and even so mean-looking dirty a tramp as that have a perfect right to be walk along then and there the sunshine and the fresh salt air from the bay be as much he as anybody 's and so be the water in the bay and no one in all that region of country stand more in need of plenty of water than he the vagabond take he right to the road as he have take he other right to beg he dinner until half-way down to the landing he be meet by a opportunity to do a little more beg give a poor feller suthin ' he impudently drawl as he stare straight into the sweet fresh face of annie foster annie have be out for only a short walk but she happen to have she pocket-book with she and she thoughtlessly draw it out mean to give the scamp a trifle if only to get rid of he only a dime miss whine the tramp as he shut he dirty hand over annie 's gift come now make it a dollar my beauty i 'll call it all square for a dollar the whine grow louder as he speak and the wheedle grin on he disgusting face change into a expression so menacing that annie draw back with a shudder and be about return she little portemonnaie to she pocket no you do not honey the word be utter in a hoarse and husky voice and be accompany by a sudden grip of poor annie 's arm with one hand while with the other he snatch greedily at the morocco case do she scream how could she help it or what else could she have do under the circumstance she scream vigorously whether she would or no and at the same moment drop she pocket-book in the grass beside the path so that it momentarily escape the vagabond 's clutch shut up will you other angry and evil word accompany by more than one vicious threat follow thick and fast as annie struggle to free herself while she assailant peer hungrily around after the miss prize it be not at all likely he would have attempt any thing so bold as that in broad daylight if he have not be drink too freely and the very evil spirit which have prompt he to he rash rascality unfit he for its immediate consequence these latter in the shape of dab kinzer and the lower joint of a stout fishing-rod have be bound along up the road from the landing at a tremendous rate for nearly half a minute a boy of fifteen assail a full-grown ruffian why not age hardly count in such a matter and then it be not every boy of even he growth that could have bring muscle like those of dab kinzer to the swing he give that four-foot length of seasoned ironwood annie see he come but she assailant do not until it be too late for he to do any thing but turn and receive that first hit in front instead of behind it would have knock over almost anybody and the tramp measure he length on the ground while dabney ply the rod on he with all the energy he be master of oh do not dabney do not plead annie : you 'll kill he i would not want to do that say dab as he suspend he pound but he add to the tramp -- now you would better get up and run for it if you be catch around here again it 'll be the worse for you the vagabond stagger to he foot and he look savagely enough at dab but the latter look so very ready to put in another hit with that terrible cudgel and the whole situation be so unpleasantly suggestive of further difficulty that the youngster 's advice be take without a word that be if a shambling kind of double limp can be describe as a run for it here it be : i have find my pocket-book say annie as she enemy make the best of he way off he do not hurt you no : he only scare I except that i suppose my arm will be black-and-blue where he catch hold of it thank you ever so much dabney : you be a brave boy why he be almost twice you size yes but the butt of my rod be twice as hard as he head say dabney i be almost afraid to strike he with it i might have break he skull you do not even break you rod no and now i must run back for the other piece and the tip i drop they in the road please dabney see I home first say annie i know it be foolish and there be not a bit of danger but i must confess to be a good deal frightened dab kinzer be a little the proudest boy on long island as he walk along at annie 's side in compliance with she request he go no farther than the gate to be sure and then he return for the rest of he rod : but before he get back with it keziah kinzer hurry home from a call on mr foster bring a tremendous account of dab 's heroism and then he own pride over what he have do be only a mere drop in the bucket compare to that of he mother dabney be grow wonderfully she remark to samantha he 'll be a man before any of we know it if dab have be a man however or if ham morri or mr foster have be at home the matter would not have be permit to drop there that tramp ought to have be follow arrest and shut up where he vicious propensity would have be under wholesome restraint for a while as it be after hurry on for a short distance and make sure he be not pursue he clamber over the fence and sneak into the nearest clump of bush from this safe covert he watch dab kinzer 's return after the lighter piece of he rod and then he even dare to crouch along the fence and see which house he young conqueror go into that be where he live be it he mutter with a scowl of the most ferocious vengeance well they 'll have some fun there before they git to bed to-night or i 'll know the reason why it could not have occur to such a man that he have be give he dinner at the door of that very house what have the collection of he rights as a tramp to do with question of gratitude and revenge the bush be a good enough hiding-place for the time and he crawl back to they with the air and manner of a man whose mind be make up to something ford and frank be absent in the city that day with mr foster who be kindly attend to some affair of frank 's but when the three come home and learn what have happen it be hard to tell which of they fail most completely in try to express he boiling indignation they be all on the point of run over to the morri house to thank dab but mr foster interpose i do not think i would to-morrow will do as well and you know they be expect mr and mr morris this evening it be harder for the boy to give it up than for mr foster and the wait till to-morrow look a little dreary they be linger near the north fence two hour later with a faint idea of catch dab even though they know that the whole kinzer family be down at the railway-station wait for ham and miranda there be a good deal of patience to be exercise by they also for that railway-train be provokingly behind time and there be wait to be do accordingly the darkness of a moonless and somewhat cloudy night have settle over the village and its surrounding farm long before the belated engine puff its way in front of the station-platform just at that moment back there by the north fence ford foster exclaim -- what be that smell it be like burn hay more than any thing else reply frank where can it come from i would like to know we have not have a light out at we barn light exclaimed frank just look yonder why it be that old barn ` way beyond the morri and kinzer house somebody must have set it on fire hullo i think i see a man run come on frank there be indeed a man run just then but they do not see he for he be already very nearly across the field and hide by the darkness he have know how to light a fire that would smoulder long enough for he to get away he be not run as well nevertheless as he might have do before he come under the operation of dab kinzer 's lower joint mr kinzer do she best to prevent any thing like a scene at the railway-station when ham and miranda come out upon the platform but there be a immense amount of welcome express in word and hug and kiss in the shortest possible space of time there be no linger on the platform however for ham and he wife be as anxious to get at the surprise they be tell be wait for they as they friend be to have they come to it before they be half way home the grow light ahead of they attract they attention and then they begin to hear the vigorous shout of fire from the throat of the two boy re-enforced now by mr foster himself and the lawyer 's voice be a uncommonly good one dabney be drive the pony and they have to go pretty fast for the rest of that short run surprise exclaim ham i should say it be do you light it before you start dabney do not joke hamilton remark mr kinzer it may be a very serious affair for all of we but i can not understand how in all the world that barn should have catch fire guess it be set a-going say dab chapter xvi dab kinzer and ham morri turn into a fire-department the morri farm as have be say be a pretty large one and the same tendency on the part of its owner which lead they to put up so extensive and barn-like a house have stimulate they from time to time to make the most liberal provision for the storage of they crop barn be a family weakness with they as furniture have be with the kinzer the first barn they have put up now the oldest and the farthest from the house have be a large one it be now in a somewhat dilapidated condition to be sure and be bow a little northerly by the weight of year that rest on it but it have still some hope of future usefulness if it have not be for that tramp and he box of match there be not a bit of use in try to save it exclaim ham as they be whirl in through the wide-open gate it be go but ham say mr kinzer we can save the other barn perhaps look at the cinder fall on the long stable if we could keep they off somehow we can do it ham exclaim dab very earnestly mother will you send I out a broom and a rope while ham and i set up the ladder you be the boy for I say ham i guess i know what you be up to the ladder be one the house-painter have be use and be a pretty heavy one but it be quickly set up against the largest and most valuable of the barn and the one too which be nearest and most expose to the burning building and its fly cinder the rope be on hand and the broom by the time the ladder be in position ford say dab you and frank help the girl bring water till the man from the village get here there be plenty of pail but every one of we hand be away -- now ham i be ready up they go and be quickly astride of the ridge of the roof it would have be perilous work for any man to have venture farther unassisted but dab tie one end of the rope firmly around he waist ham tie himself to the other and then dab could slip down the steep roof in any direction without danger of slip off to the ground below but the broom it be as useful as a small fire-engine the fly cinder of burn hay or wood as they alight upon the sun-dried shingle of the roof need to be sweep off as fast as they fall before they have time to fulfil they errand of mischief here and there they have be at work for some minute and the fresh little blaze they have kindle have so good a start that the broom alone would have be insufficient and there the rapidly-arriving pail of water come into capital play ford foster have never shine out to so good a advantage in all he life before as he do when he take he station on the upper round of that ladder and risk he neck to hand water-pail to ham it be hard work all around but hardest of all for the two fireman on the roof now and then the strength and agility of ham morri be put to pretty severe test as dab dance around under the scorching heat or slip flat upon the sloping roof it be well for ham that he be a man of weight and substance there be score and score of people stream up from the village now arrive in pant squad every moment and mr kinzer have all she could do to keep they from rescue every atom of she furniture out of the house and pile it up in the road wait please she say to they very calmly if ham and dab save the long barn the fire will not spread any farther the old barn will not be any loss to speak of anyhow fiercely as the dry old barn burn it use itself up all the quicker on that account and it be less than thirty minute from the time ham and dabney get at work before roof and rafter fall in and the worst of the danger be over the man and boy from the village be eager enough to do any thing that now remain to be do but a large share of this be confine to stand around and watch the bonfire burn down to a harmless heap of badly smell ash as soon however as they be no more want on the roof the two volunteer fireman come down and ham morri 's first word on reach the ground be -- dab my boy how you have grow not a tenth of a inch in mere stature and yet ham be entirely correct about it he stare at dabney for a moment and then he turn and stare at every thing else there be plenty of light just then moon or no moon and ham 's eye be very busy for a full minute he note rapidly the improvement in the fence shed barn the blind on the house the paint a host of small thing that have change for the better and then he simply say come on dab and lead the way into the house she mother and sister have already give miranda a hurry look at what they have do but ham be not the man to do any thing in haste deliberately and silently he walk from room to room and from cellar to garret hardly seem to hear the frequent comment of he enthusiastic young wife that he do hear all that have be say around he as he go however be at last make manifest for he say -- dab i have see all the other room where 's yours i be go to let you and miranda have my room say dab i do not think i shall board here long i do not think you will either say ham emphatically you be go away to boarding-school miranda be there any reason why dab can not have the south-west room up stair with the bay-window that room have be samantha 's choice and she look at dab reproachfully but miranda reply -- no indeed not if you wish he to have it now ham say dabney i be not big enough to fit that room give I one nearer my size that be a little loose for even sam and she can not take any tuck in it samantha 's look change to one of gratitude and she do not notice the detest nickname well then say ham we 'll see about it you can sleep in the spare chamber to-night -- mother kinzer i could not say enough about this house business if i talk all night it must have cost you a deal of money i could not have dare to ask it i guess you must kiss I again a curious thing it be that come next -- one that nobody could have reckon on mr kinzer -- good soul -- have set she heart on have ham and miranda 's house ready for they on they return and now ham seem to be so pleased about it she actually begin to cry she say too -- i be so sorry about the barn ham only laugh in he quiet way as he kiss he portly mother-in-law and say -- come come mother kinzer you do not set it afire can not miranda and i have some supper dab must be hungry too after all that roof-sweeping there have be a sharp strain on the nerve of all of they that day and evening and they be glad enough to gather around the tea-table while all that be now leave of the old barn smoulder peaceably away with half the boy in the village on guard once or twice ham or dab go out to see that all be die out rightly but it be plain that all the danger be over unless a high wind should come to scatter the cinder by this time the whole village have hear of dab 's adventure with the tramp and have at once connect the latter with the fire there be those indeed who express a savage wish to connect he with it bodily and it be well for he that he have do he run away promptly and have hide himself with care for man be out after he in all direction on foot and on horseback who would have dream of so dirty a vagabond take to the water he be a splendid fellow anyway odd be it not but annie foster and jenny walter be half a mile apart when they both say that very thing just before the clock in the village church hammer out the news that it be ten and bedtime they be not either of they speak of the tramp it be long after that however before the light be out in all the room of the morris mansion chapter xvii dab have a wake dream and ham get a sniff of sea-air sleep one of the most excellent thing in all the world and very few people get too much of it nowadays as for dabney kinzer he have do he sleeping as regularly and faithfully as even he eat up to the very night after ham morri come home to find the old barn afire there have be a few a very few exception there be the night when he be expect to go duck-shooting before daylight and wake up at midnight with a strong conviction that he be late about start there be perhaps a dozen of eel expedition that have keep he out late enough for a full basket and a proper scolding there too be the night when he have stand so steadily by the tiller of the swallow while she dance through the dark across the rough billow of the atlantic but on the whole dab kinzer have be a good sleeper all he life till then once in bed and there have be for he a end of all wakefulness on that particular night for the first time sleep refuse to come late as be the hour when the family circle break up it could not have be the excitement of ham and miranda 's return he would have get over that by this time no more could it have be the fire though the smell of smoulder hay come in pretty strongly at time through the wide-open window if any one patch of that great roomy bed be better make up for sleep than the rest of it dab would surely have find the spot for he tumble and roll all over it in he restlessness some field on a farm will grow wheat better than other but no part of the bed seem to grow any sleep at last dab get wearily up and take a chair by the window the night be dark but the star be shine and every now and then the wind would make a shovel of itself and toss up the hot ash the fire have leave send a dull red glare around on the house and barn for a moment and flooding all the neighborhood with a stronger smell of burnt hay if you be go to burn hay soliloquize dabney it will not do to take a barn for a stove not that kind of a barn but what do ham morris mean by say that i be to go to boarding-school that be what i would like to know the secret be out he have keep remarkably still for he all the evening and have not ask a question but if he brain be ever to work over he book as they have over ham 's remark he future chance for sound sleep be all go it have come upon he so suddenly the very thing he think about that night in the swallow and wish for and dream about during all those walk and talk and lesson of all sort with ford foster and frank harley ever since they come in from that memorable cruise it be a wonderful idea and dab have he doubt as to the way he mother would take to it when it should be bring seriously before she little he guess the truth ham 's remark have go deep into other ear as well as dabney 's and there be reason therefore why good mr kinzer be sit by the window of she own room at that very moment as little inclined to sleep as be the boy she be think of so proud of he too she be and so full of bright motherly thought of the man he would make one of these day when he get he growth there must have be a good deal of sympathy between dab and he mother for by and by just as she begin to feel drowsy and muttered well well we 'll have a talk about it to-morrow dab find himself nod against the window-frame and slowly rise from he chair remark -- guess i might as well finish that dream in bed if i would tumble out o ' the window i would have light among miranda 's rose-bush they have get they thorn all out at this time o ' night it be necessary for they both to sleep hard after that for more than half the night be go and they be to be up early so indeed they be but what surprise mr kinzer when she go into the kitchen be to find miranda there before she you here my dear that be right i 'll take a look at the milk-room where 's ham out among the stock dab 's just go to he curious thing people will do at time miranda have put down the coffee-pot on the range there be not a single one of the farm help around male or female and there stand the bloom young bride with she back toward she mother and stare out through the open door and then mr kinzer slip forward and put she arm around she daughter 's neck well it be very early in the morning for those two woman to stand there and cry but it seem to do they good and miranda remark at last as she kiss she mother -- o mother it be all so good and beautiful and i be so happy and then they both laugh in a subdue and quiet way and miranda pick up the coffee-pot while mr kinzer walk away into the milk-room such cream as there seem to be on all the pan that morning as for ham morri he first visit on leave the house have be to the relic of the old barn as a matter of course not much of a loss he say to himself but it might have be but for dab there be the making of a man in he wonder if he would get enough to eat if we send he up yonder on the whole i think he would if he do not i do not believe it would be he fault he be get to go and he mother 'll agree to it i know talk about mother-in-law if one of 'em be worth as much as she be i would like to have a dozen do not know ` bout that though i be afraid the rest would have to take back seat as long as mr kinzer be in the house very likely ham be right but just then he hear the voice of dab behind he -- i say ham when you have look at the other thing i want to show you ` the swallow ' i have not hurt she a bit and she new grapnel 's worth three of the old one all right dab i think i would like a sniff of the water come on there be nothing else i know of like that smell of the shore with the tide half out no more there be and there have be sea-shore man many of they who have wander away into the interior of the country hundred and hundred of long mile and settle there and even get rich and old there and yet who have come all the way back again just to get another smell of the salt marsh and the sea-air and the out-going tide ham actually take a little boat and go on board the swallow when they reach the landing and dab keep close to he she be all right ham but what be you cast loose for dab they will not all be ready for breakfast in two hour the stock and thing can go : the man 'll tend to 'em just haul on that sheet a bit now the jib look out for the boom there the wind 's a little ahead but it be not bad ah the last word come out in a great sigh of relief and be follow by a chuckle which seem to gurgle all the way up from ham 's boot this be better than railroad he say to dabney as they tack into the long stretch where the inlet widen toward the bay no pound or jarring here talk of you fashionable watering-place why dab there be not any thing else in the world prettier than that reach of water and the sand-island with the ocean beyond it there be some duck and some gull why dab do you see that there be a porpoise inside the bar it be as clear as daylight that ham morri feel himself at home again and that he brief experience of the outside world have by no means lessen he affection for the place he be bear in if the entire truth could have be know it would have be find that he feel he heart warm toward the whole coast and all its inhabitant include the clam and yet it be remarkable how many of the latter be mere empty shell when ham finish he breakfast that morning he prefer they roasted and he mother-in-law have not forget that trait in he character once or twice in the course of the sail dabney find himself on the point of say something about boarding-school but each time he friend break away to the discussion of other topic such as blue-fish porpoise crab or the sailing quality of the swallow and dab dimly feel that it would be better to wait until another time so he wait it be a grand good time however to be have before breakfast and as they again sail up the inlet very happy and very hungry dab suddenly exclaim -- ham do you see that how could they have guess where we would go there be the whole kinzer tribe and the boy be with they and annie what boy and annie oh ford foster and frank harley annie be ford 's sister they live in we old house you know what be become of jenny you mean my boat there she be hitch a little out just beyond the landing there be nothing on dab 's face to lead any one to suppose that he guess the meaning of the quizzical grin on ham 's it be barely possible however that there would have be fewer people at the landing if ham and dab have not be keep a whole house-full of hungry mortal include a bride wait breakfast for they chapter xviii how dab work out another of he great plan there be a sort of council at the breakfast-table of the foster family that morning and ford and annie find they side of it vote down that be not at all because they do not debate vigorously and even protest but the odds be too much against they annie my dear say mr foster at last in a gentle but decide way i be sure you aunt marium if not you uncle must feel hurt at you come away so suddenly if we invite joe and foster to visit we it will make it all right yes sharply exclaim mr foster : we must have they come they 'll behave themselves here i 'll write to they father : you write to maria they be she own boy you know add mr foster soothingly well mother say annie if it must be but i be sure they 'll make we all very uncomfortable if they come i can stand 'em for a week or so say ford with the air of a man who can do or bear more than most people i 'll get dab kinzer to help I entertain they excellent say mr foster and i hope they will be civil to he to dabney asked annie fuz and joe civil to dab kinzer exclaimed ford certainly : i hope so father say ford may i say just what i be think speak it right out well i be think what a good time fuz and joe would be likely to have try to get ahead of dab kinzer annie look at she brother and nod and there be a bit of a twinkle in the eye of the lawyer himself but he only remark -- well you must be neighborly i do not believe the hart boy know much about the seashore dab and frank and i will try and educate they annie thought of the ink and she box of spoil cuff and collar while she brother be speak could it be that ford mean a good deal more than he be say at all event she fully agree with he on the dab kinzer question that be one council and it be one of peace or war probably a good deal as the hart boy themselves might thereafter determine at the same hour however matter of even greater importance be come to a decision around the well-filled breakfast-table in the morris mansion ham have give a pretty full account of he visit to grantley include he dinner at mr myer 's and all he have learn relate to the academy it seem like spend a great deal of money begin mr kinzer when ham at last pause for breath but lid catch she up at once with -- i know you have be pay out a good deal mother kinzer but dab must go if i pay -- you pay indeed for my boy i would like to see myself now i have find out what he be i mean he shall have every advantage if this grantley 's the right place -- mother exclaim samantha it be the very place mr foster be go to send ford to and frank harley exactly say ham mr hart speak of a mr foster -- he brother-in-law -- a lawyer why say keziah he be live in we old house now ford foster be dab 's greatest crony they be the very people you meet at the landing yes i have hear all that say ham but somehow i have not put the two thing together now mother kinzer do you really mean dab be to go of course i do say she well if that be not do it easy do you know it be about the nicest thing i have hear since i get here except the barn say dabney unable to hold in any longer mother may i stand on my head a while you 'll need all the head you have get say ham you will not have much time to get ready he 'll have book enough after he get there say mr kinzer decidedly i 'll risk dabney and they 'll make he give up all he slang add samantha yes sam when i come back i 'll talk nothing but greek and latin i be get french now from ford and hindu from frank harley then i know english and slang and long-islandish think of one man with seven first-rate language but dabney soon find himself unable to sit still even at the breakfast-table not that he get up hungry for he have do he duty by miranda 's cookery but the house itself big as it be seem too small to hold he with all he new prospects swell within he perhaps moreover the rest of the family feel that they would be better able to discuss the important subject before they after dab have take himself out into the open air for none of they try to stay he go this beat dream all hollow he say to himself as he stand with he hand in he pocket half way down to the gate between the two garden now i 'll see what can be do about that other matter two plan in one head and so young a head as that yes and it speak well for dab 's heart as well as he brain that he plan number two be not a selfish one the substance of it come out in the first five minute of the talk he have a trifle later with ford and frank on the other side of the gate ford you know there be twenty dollar leave of the money the frenchman pay we for the bluefish well what of it be not it yours one share of it be mine the rest be yours and dick 's he need it more 'n i do ford do you know dick lee be real bright ` cute little chap as ever i see why well he ought to go to school why do not he go he do except in summer he might go to the academy if they would take he and if he have money enough to go with academy what academy why grantley of course i be go and so be you and frank why should not dick go you be go hurrah for that why do not you say so before be not sure till this morning you fellow 'll be a long way ahead of I though but i mean to catch up for a few minute poor dick be lose sight of in a perfect storm of talk but dab come back to he with -- dick 's folk be dreadful poor but we might raise it twenty dollar to begin with i have ten dollar save up and i know mother 'll say ` pass it right in ' exclaimed ford it be hardly likely mr foster would express she assent in precisely that way but frank harley promptly add -- i think i can promise five i mean to speak to ham morri and mother about it say dab all i want be to fix it about the twenty dollar to start on frank shout ford let 's go right in and see we crowd ford be evidently get a little excited and it be hardly five minute later that he wind up he story in the house with -- father may i contribute my ten dollar to the richard lee education fund of course but he will need a good deal more money than you boy can raise why father the advertisement say half a year for a hundred and fifty he can board for less than we can perhaps mr myer would let he work out a part of it i can spare as much as ford can here put in annie do you leave I out entirely say she mother with a smile that be even sweeter than usual as for sharp-eyed lawyer foster himself he have be hem and cough in a odd sort of way for a moment and he have say i declare several time but he now remark somewhat more to the purpose -- i do not believe in give any man a better education than he will ever know what to do with but then this dick lee and you boy -- well see what you can do but no one must be allow to contribute outside of the foster and kinzer family and frank as for the rest hem -- ah -- i think i 'll say that there will not be any difficulty you father why not annie do you s ` pose i be go to let myself be beat in such a matter by a mere country-boy like dabney kinzer father say ford if you would see how dick behave that night out there on the ocean in ` the swallow ' just as well just as well my son hurrah shout ford then it be all right and dick lee 'll have a fair shake in the world a what my son exclaim he mother i do not mean to talk slang mother : i only mean -- well you know how dreadfully black he be but then he can steer a boat tiptop and he be splendid for crab and bluefish and dab say he be a good scholar too dab 's a very good boy say mr foster but you friend dick will need a outfit i imagine -- clothing and almost every thing i must see mr kinzer about it meantime dick lee 's part in the matter and that of he family have be take for grant all around a hour later however mr kinzer 's first reply to she son after listen to a calculation of he which almost make it seem as if dick would make money by go to grantley be -- what if mr lee should say she can not spare he dab 's countenance fall he know mr lee but he have not think so far as that he say something not very intelligible but to that effect well dabney if we can make the other arrangement i 'll see she about it ham morri have be exchange remarkable wink with miranda and samantha and now gravely suggest -- maybe the academy authority will refuse to take he ford say they have a blacker boy than he be there last year now dab exclaimed ham well i know he be pretty black but it do not come off mother say samantha mr foster and annie be come through the gate dab wait just long enough after that to learn the news concern the richard lee education fund and mr foster 's offer and then he be off towards the shore he know very well in which direction it be best to go and half way to the landing he meet dick come up the road with a basket of eel on he arm dick shout dabney i be go away to boarding-school at a academy ` cad ` my whar up in new england they call it grantley academy -- where frank and ford be go dat spile it all say dick ruefully now i 's get to fish wid feller ` at do not know nuffin no you will not you be go with we it be all fix -- money and all dick would never have think ordinarily of question a statement make by captain kinzer but the rueful expression deepen on he face the basket of eel drop heavily on the grass the tough black finger of he hand twist nervously together for a moment and then he sit mournfully down beside the basket it be not no use dab no use why not i be not a w ` ite boy what of it do not you learn well enough over at the school more dar like I wot would

ford it would never do to let dick tell she guess dat 's so say dick quite a embassy they make those four boy with dab kinzer for spokesman and dick lee almost crouch behind they mr lee listen with open mouth while dab unfold he plan but when he have finish she shut she lip firmly together they be not very thin and not at all use to be shut and in another instant they open again sho de boy be

ten-acre lot full of we come on boy if mr lee be surprise by they very sudden and somewhat unceremonious retreat she need not have be after she learn the cause of it she stand in wholesome awe of mr kinzer and a brush with the portly widow re-enforce by the sweet face of annie foster be a pretty serious matter she do not hesitate about begin the skirmish however for she tongue be already a bit loosen and in fine working-order wot 's di yer mr kinzer ` bout sendin ' away my dick to a furrin ` cad ` my be not he ` most nigh nuff spile a ` ready oh it be all arrange nicely miss foster and i only come over to see what we could do about get he clothes ready he must have thing warm and nice for the winter be cold up there i have not say he might go -- dick put down dem eel a ' he have not say he would go -- dick take off yer hat a ' he father -- now glorianna interrupted mr kinzer call dick 's mother by she first name i have know you these forty year and do you suppose i be go to argue about it just tell we what dick 'll need and do not let 's have any nonsense the money 's all provide how do you know what 'll become of he he may be governor yet he mought preach that idea have suddenly dawn upon the perplexed mind of mr lee and dick 's fate be settle she be prouder than ever of she boy and truth to tell she opposition be only what mr kinzer have consider it a piece of unaccountable nonsense to be brush away by just such a hand as the widow 's own chapter xix a grand sailing-party and a experiment by richard lee that be a great day for the boy but before the close of it ford foster have tell he friend the news that joe hart and he brother fuz have be invite to visit with he will they come ask dab certainly that kind of boy always come nobody want to keep he from come when do you look for they right away vacation 's almost go you know will not they be ashamed to meet you sister not a bit they 'll try they trick even after they get here all right we 'll help 'em all we know how but boy i 'll tell you what we must try for what be that one grand good sailing-party in ` the swallow ' before they get here hurrah for that annie be wish for one only yesterday we 'll have all of you folk and all of ours ` the swallow ' be plenty big enough mother would not go and father can not just now he be try a case but there be annie and frank and I -- and my mother and ham and miranda and we girl ham 'll go sure then we must take dick lee along it would make he sick if we do not of course be not i glad about he could we get ready and go to-morrow guess not so quick as that we might by the day after if the weather 's all right exactly there be always a large-sized if to be put in where any thing depend on the weather mr kinzer take the matter up with enthusiasm and so do the girl miranda include and ford foster be quite right about he part of the company but the weather it look well enough to unpractised eye but ham morri shake he head and go to consult he fisherman friend there be a good deal of head-shaking do thereupon for every human barometer among they advise he to wait a day or so and hardly any two of they give he the same reason for do it ford foster be at the house when ham make he report and be a little surprised to see how promptly dab kinzer yield he assent to the verdict such warm nice weather as this be he remonstrate and there be not any wind to speak of there be too much of it come be ham 's response and there be no help for it after that not even when the mail bring word from aunt marium that both of she dear boy would arrive in a day or two we last chance be go annie say ford when the news come o mother she say despondingly what shall we do have you sail just the same and invite you cousin but the kinzer -- why annie mr kinzer will not think of neglect they she be as kind as kind can be and we be to pay she with joe and fuz say ford well i wish ham morri 's storm would come along he only have to wait until the next day for it and he feel quite contented to be safe on shore while it last there be no call for any laughter at the prophecy of the fisherman after it begin to blow still the blow be not a long one and ham morri remark -- this be only a outside edge of it it be a good deal worse than this out at sea i be glad we be not out in it ford foster thought that about the worst of that weather be when the afternoon train come in and he have to show a pair of tired moist and altogether unpleasant cousin to the room set apart for they the cloud in he mind do not clear away perceptibly even when just after supper a note come in from mr kinzer invite the hart boy to join the yachting-party next morning the storm may not be over growl ford a little sulkily oh say annie mr kinzer add that the weather will surely be fine after such a blow and the bay will be quite safe and smooth do she know the clerk of the weather ask joe hart get one of she own say ford joe and ford both find something to laugh at in that but they say nothing they be both feel a little strange as yet and be almost incline to try and behave themselves the main difficulty in the way of it be a queer idea they have that they ordinary way of do thing make up a fair article of good behavior nobody have take the pain to bounce they out of the notion when the morning really come sea and earth and sky seem to be all the better for the trial they have be through and the weather be all that mr kinzer have prophesy of it the grass and tree be greener and the bay seem bluer while the few cloud visible be very white and clean as if all the storm have be recently wash out of they there be no question now to be raise concern the yachting-party or any part of it not a single thing go wrong in mr kinzer 's management of the set out and that be half the day win to begin with ford have some difficulty in get joe and fuz out of bed so early as be necessary but he give they a intimation which prove quite sufficient : -- you would better hop boy ham morri would not wait five minute for the queen of england or even for I joe whisper fuz a little while after they get on board the yacht be we to be go a week why what be up such pile of provision as they have stow away in that kennel the bit of a water-tight cabin under the half-deck at which fuz point be pretty well fill beyond a doubt but mr kinzer know what she be about she have provide luncheon for most of that party before and the effect on they of the sea-air be also to be take into account dab say ford foster you have forget to unhitch the ` jenny ' here she be tow astern that be all right we may need she she be too heavy to be take on board a careful fellow be mr hamilton morris and he well know the value of a rowboat to a sea-going picnic-party as for joe and fuz they be compel to overcome a strong inward inclination to cast the boat loose such a good joke it would have be but ham morri be in the way of it so long as he stand at the tiller the swallow be steady enough to inspire even annie foster with a feeling of confidence but ford carefully explain to she the difference between slip over the little wave of the landlocked bay and plunge into the gigantic billow of the stormy atlantic i prefer this say annie but i would not have miss the other for any thing reply ford would you dick mr richard lee have take he full share in the work of start and have make himself singularly useful but if all the rest have not be so busy they would surely have notice he remarkable silence hardly a word have he utter that anybody could remember and now he be force to say something he mouth open slowly as if he have never try to speak before and be not quite sure he know how no -- mr -- foster -- i -- would -- not -- have -- miss -- that -- trip -- for -- a -- good -- deal every word come out by itself afoot and alone and as different from dick 's ordinary speech as a cut stone be from a rough one ham morri open he eye wide and ford pucker he lip into the shape of a still whistle but annie catch the meaning of it quicker than they do dick she say at once be we to fish to-day may -- be -- but -- that -- depend -- on -- mr morri every word be slowly and carefully utter a good deal in the manner of a man counting over a lot of money and look out sharp for counterfeit look here dick suddenly exclaim dab kinzer i give it up : you can do it but do not you try to keep it up all day kill you sure as any thing if you do do i say 'em all right cap'n dab anxiously inquire dick with a happy look on he merry black face every word say dab but it be well for you they be all short keep on practise i 'll je ' do dat shuah practise dick yes that be it and he join heartily in the peal of laughter with which the success of he first attempt at w ` ite folk ' english be receive by that party dab explain that as soon as dick find he be really to go to the academy he determine to teach he tongue new habit and the whole company heartily approve even while they join dab in advise he not to attempt too much at a time you might sprain you tongue over a big word say ford there be a abundance of talk and fun all around as the swallow skim onward and the outline of the long low sand-island be rapidly become more distinct nearer they draw and nearer be that a light-house away over there ask annie of dab yes that be a light-house and there be a wrecking-station close down by it a wrecking-station i say say ford be there man there all the while be there many wreck on this coast ever so many wreck say dab and they keep a sharp lookout there use to be more before there be so many light-house it be a bad place to go ashore in too -- almost as bad as jersey why well the coast itself be mean enough for shoal and surf and then there be the wrecker oh i understand say ford not the government man no the old sort it be a bad enough piece of luck to be drive in on that bar or another like it but the wrecker make it as much worse as they know how to they be all listen now even he sister and dabney launch out into a somewhat highly-colored description of the terror of the long-island south shore in old time and new and of the character and deed of the man who be formerly the first to find out if any thing or anybody have be drive ashore what a prize to they that french steamer would have be say annie the one you and ford take frank from no she would not why she be not wreck at all she only stick she nose in the sand and lay still till the tug come and pull she off that be not a wreck a wreck be where the ship be knock to piece and people be drown and all that sort of thing the crew can not help themselves after that then you see the wrecker have a notion that every thing that come ashore belong to they why i have hear some of we old fisherman -- best kind of man too -- talk of how government have rob they of they rights by the new system say annie well first by have wreck prevent and then by have all property keep for the owner be not that strange do you say they be good man some of 'em honest as the day be long about every thing else but they be not all so there be old peter now and he live on the island yet there be he cabin you can just see it stick out of the edge of that big sand-hill what a queer thing it be queer i guess you would say so if you could have a look at the thing he be pick up along shore and stow inside of it there be not but just room for he to cook and sleep in be he a fisherman too why that be he trade sometimes the storm drift the sand high all over that cabin and old pete have to dig it out again he get snow under two or three time every winter annie foster and probably some of the other be get new idea concern the sea-coast and its inhabitant every minute and she feel a good deal like dick lee -- she would not have miss that trip for any thing they be now coast along the island at no great distance and although it be not nearly noon dabney hear joe hart say to he brother -- never be so hungry in all my life glad they do lay in a good stock of provision so be i return fuz and he add in a whisper be not there any way for we to get into that cabin joe shake he head there be not the slightest chance for any small piracy to be work on that craft so long as mr kinzer remain the stewardess of it and the two hungry boy be compel to wait she motion chapter xx a wreck and some wrecker dismally barren and lonesome be that desolate bar between the bay and the ocean here and there it swell up into great drift and mound of sand which be almost large enough to be call hill but nowhere do it show a tree or a bush or even a patch of grass annie foster find herself get melancholy as she gaze upon it and thought of how the wind must sometimes sweep across it laden with sea-spray and rain and hail or with the bitter sleet and blinding snow of winter dabney she say be the storm very severe here last night and yesterday worse than it be over on we side of the bay ten time be there any vessel wreck most likely but it be too soon to know just where at that moment the swallow be run around a sandy point jut out into the bay from the foot of the highest mound on the bar not half a mile from the light-house and only twice as far from the low wooden roof of the wrecking-station where as dab have explain to he guest the lifeboat and other apparatus of all sort be keep safely house the pile of drift sand have for some time prevent the brightest eye on board the swallow from see any thing to seaward but now as they come around the point and a broad level lay before they ham morri spring to he foot in sudden excitement as he exclaim -- in the breaker why she must have be a three-master it be all up with she now look along the shore shout dab some of 'em save anyhow the coast-man be there too life-boats and all so they be and ham be right about the vessel though not a mast be leave standing in she now if there have be indeed she might have be keep off the breaker as they afterwards learn she have be dismast in the storm but have not strike until after daylight that morning and help have be close at hand and promptly give there be no such thing as save that unfortunate hull she would beat to piece just where she lay sooner or later accord to the kind of weather that might take the job in hand and the size and force of the wave it should bring with it the work do already by the life-boat man have be a good one and it have not be very easy either for they have bring the crew and passenger safely through the boiling surf and land they all upon the sandy beach they have even save for they some item of baggage in a few hour the coast wrecking-tug would be on hand to look out for the cargo there be therefore no chance for the ` long-shore man to turn a honest penny without work hard for it work and wages enough there would be to be sure help to unload whenever the sea now so heavy should go down a little but work and wages be not the precise thing some of they be most hungry for two of they at all event -- one a tall grizzled weather-beaten stoop-shouldered old man in tattered raiment and the other more batter still but with no look of the sea about he -- stand on a sand-drift gloomily gaze at the group of shipwrecked people on the shore and the helpless mass of timber and spar out there among the beating of the surf not more 'n three hunder ' yard out she would break up soon ' f there be no one to hender wot a show we have hev i reckon growl the shorter man 's you name peter ay i belong yer aller live ` bout high-water mark whar would ye come from the only answer be a sharp and excited exclamation neither of they have be pay any attention to the bay side of the bar and while they be gaze at the wreck a very pretty little yacht have cast anchor close in shore and then with the help of a rowboat quite a party of lady and gentleman -- the latter somewhat young-looking for the greater part -- have make they way to the land and be now hurry forward they do not pay the slightest attention to peter and he companion but in a few minute more they be try to talk to those poor people on the seaward beach try but not succeed very well for the wreck have be a bremen bark with a assorted cargo and some fifty passenger all emigrant german seem to be they only tongue and none of mr kinzer 's pleasure-party speak german too bad ford foster be say about it when there come a sort of wail from a group at a little distance and it seem to close with -- _ pauvre enfant _ french exclaimed ford why they look as dutch as any of the rest come on annie let 's try and speak to they the rest follow a good deal like a flock of sheep and it be a sad enough scene that lay before they no life have be lose in the wreck but there have be a good deal of suffering among the poor passenger coop up between deck with the hatch close while the storm last nobody drown indeed but all have be dreadfully soak in the surf in get ashore and among the rest have be the fair-haired child now lie there on he mother 's lap so pinched and blue and seemingly so nearly lifeless french be they yes and no for the father a tall stout young man who look like a farmer tell ford they be from alsace and speak both language the child be it sick not so much sick as die of starvation and exposure oh such a sad plead look as the poor mother lift to the moist eye of mr kinzer when the portly widow push forward and bent over the silent boy such a pretty child he must have be and not over two year old but the salt water be in he tangled curl now and he poor lip be part in a weak sick way that tell of utter exhaustion can any thing be do mother yes dabney there can you and ham and ford and frank go to the yacht quick as you can and bring the spirit-heater lamp and all and bread and milk and every dry napkin and towel you can find bring keziah 's shawl such quick time they make across that sand-bar they be none too soon either for as they come run down to they boat a mean-looking slouching sort of fellow walk rapidly away from it he be go to steal it can not go for he now dab but you 'll have to mount guard here while we go back with the thing there be a good deal of the guard mount look in dab 's face when they leave he a few minute later stand there by the boat and he have one of the oar in he hand a oar be almost as good a club as the lower joint of a fishing-rod and that be exactly the think in dab 's mind ham and frank and ford hurry back to the other beach to find that mr kinzer have take complete possession of that baby every rag of he damp thing be already strip off and now while miranda light the heater and make some milk hot in a minute the good lady begin to rub the little sufferer as only a experienced mother know how then there be a warm wrapping-up in cloth and shawl and better success than anybody have dream of in make the seemingly half-dead child eat something that be about all the matter with he say mr kinzer now if we can get he and he mother over to the house we can save both of they ford how long do you say it be since they would eat any thing about three day they say mercy on I and that cabin of ours hold so little glad it be full anyhow let 's get every thing out and over here right away the cabin no hamilton the provision not a soul among they all thought of they own lunch any more than mr kinzer herself do but joe and fuz be not among they just then on the contrary they be over there by the shore where the jenny have be pull up try to get dab kinzer to put they on board the swallow somebody ought to be on board of she say fuz in as anxious a tone as he could assume with so many strange people around it be not safe add joe fact reply dab but then i kind o ' like to feel a little unsafe the hart boy have a feeling at that moment that somehow or other dab know why they be so anxious to go on board and they be right enough for he be say to himself they can wait they do look hungry but they 'll live through it there be not any cuff or collar in ham 's locker all there be then in the locker be soon out of it after mr kinzer and the rest come for they bring with they the officer of the wreck bark and neither joe nor fuz have a opportunity to so much as help distribute that supply of provision ham go over to see that the distribution should be properly make while mr kinzer see she little patient with he father and mother safely stow on board the swallow i 'll save that baby anyhow she say to miranda and ford say he father 's a farmer we can find plenty for 'em to do they 'll never see a thing of they baggage and i guess they have not a great deal she be just the woman to guess correctly about such a matter at that moment dabney be say to annie foster -- whom do you guess i have see to-day i can not guess who be it the tramp the same one the very same there he go over the sandhill yonder with old peter the wrecker we have get to hurry home now but i be go to set ham morri on he track before we get through you 'll never find he again do you s ` pose old peter would befriend a man that do what he do right on the shore of the bay no indeed there be not a fisherman from here to montauk that would not join to hunt he out he be safe to be find whenever ham want he if we do not scare he away now do not scare he then almost whisper annie the wind be fair and the home sail of the swallow be really a swift and short one but it do seem dreadfully long to she passenger mr kinzer be anxious to see that poor baby and he mother safely in bed ham want to send a whole load of refreshment back to the shipwrecked people dab kinzer could not keep he thought from follow that tramp and then if the truth must come out every soul on board the beautiful little yacht be get more and more painfully aware with every minute that pass that they have have a good deal of sea-air and excitement and a splendid sail across the bay but no dinner -- not so much as a red herring and a cracker chapter xxi dab and he friend turn themselves into cook and waiter as for the kinzer that be by no means they first experience in such matter but none of they friend have ever before be so near a out-and-out shipwreck it be quite possible moreover that they have never before be so nearly starve as they be that day at least something to that effect be remark by joe hart and fuz more than a dozen time apiece while the swallow be thread the crooked inlet and make she way to the landing ham say dab be you go right back again course i be -- soon as i can get a load of eatables together from the house and the village you 'll have to stay here why can not i go with you plenty for you to do at the house and around while i be go no you can not go dab seem to have expect as much for he turn to ford with -- then ford i 'll tell you what we must do what be that we must see about the famine can you cook no i can then ham 'll have one half of we house at work get he cargo ready and that baby 'll fill up the other half mother will not be expect we so soon and we cook 's go out for the day annie know something she can help I then those hart boy 'll die if they be not feed pretty soon look at fuz why he can not keep he mouth shut joe and he brother seem to know as if by instinct that the dinner question be under discussion and they be soon take at least they share of the talk oh how they do wish it have be a share of something to eat instead the swallow be carefully moor after discharge she passenger but dab do not start for the house with he mother and the rest he even manage to detain some of the empty lunch-baskets large one too come on mr kinzer shout joe hart let 's put for the village we 'll starve here a fellow that 'll starve here just deserve to that be all say dabney ford there be bill lee 's boat and three other come in we be all right one of 'em be a dredger ford and frank could only guess what they friend be up to but dab be not do any sort of guess bill he shout as dick lee 's father come within hearing -- bill put a lot of you best panfish in this basket and then go and fetch we some lobster there be half a dozen in you pot do those other have any luck more clam 'n ` yster respond bill then we 'll take both lot the respect of the city boy for the resource of the long-island shore in a time of famine begin to rise rapidly a few moment later for not only be one of dab 's basket promptly laden with panfish such as porgy blackfish and perch but two other receive all the clam and oyster they be at all anxious to carry to the house at the same time bill lee offer as a amendment on the lobster question -- yer wrong ` bout de pot dab wrong why -- yes you 's wrong glorianny 's be a ' bile ebery one on 'em a ' dey be all nice a ' cold by dis time all right i never do eat my lobster raw just you go and get they dick bring 'em right over to ford 's house bill lee would have send he house and all on a suggestion that the kinzer or the foster be in need of it and dick would have carry it over for he as for glorianna when she son come run in with he errand she exclaim -- dem lobster sho dem be not good nuff dey sha 'n' t have 'em i 'll je ' send de ole man all roun ' de bay to git some good one on ' y dey be not no kine ob lobster good nuff for some folk dey be not dick insist however and by the time he reach the back door of the old kinzer homestead with he load the kitchen beyond that door have become almost as busy a place as be that of mrs miranda morris a few rod away ford suddenly exclaim dab as he finish scale a large porgy what if mother should make a mistake make a mistake how cook that baby it be awful why its mother 's there yes but they have put she to bed and its father too hey here come the lobster now ford -- the rest of what he have to say be give in a whisper and be not even hear by annie foster who be just then look prettier than ever as she busy herself around the kitchen-fire the bloom that be come up into she face be a sight worth see as for the hart boy mr foster have invite they to come into the parlor and talk with she until dinner should be ready she add with she usual smile that there be cook enough in the kitchen such a frying and broiling before ham morri be ready with he cargo for he trip back to the wreck and right in the midst of he greatest hurry word come over from mr foster that the table be wait for they all even mrs kinzer draw a long breath of relief and satisfaction there be nothing more in the wide world that she could do just then for either that baby or its unfortunate parent and she be begin to worry about she son-in-law and how she should manage to get he to eat something for ham morri have work himself into a high state of excitement in he benevolent haste and do not seem to know that he be hungry miranda have entirely sympathize with she husband until the arrival of that message from mr foster o hamilton and good mr foster must have cook it all herself no miranda say ham thoughtfully we dabney go home with ford and annie i can not stay more than a minute but i think we would better go right over there be a good many thing to come yet from the village go they do while the charitable neighbor whom ham have stir up concern the wreck attend to the completion of the cargo of the swallow more than that be true for at least one other good and kind-hearted boat would be ready to accompany she on she return trip across the bay laden with creature comfort of all sort even old jock the village tavern-keeper not by any mean the best man in the world have come waddle down to the landing with a demijohn of old apple-brandy and he gift have be kindly accept by the special advice of the village physician that sort of thing have make plenty of shipwreck around here say the man of medicine and the people on the bar have swallow so much salt water the apple-jack can not hurt 'em maybe the doctor be wrong about it but the demijohn go over to the wreck in the swallow very much to the gratification of old jock mr foster 's dining-room be not a large one : there be no large room in that house nevertheless the entire party manage to gather around the table -- all except dab and ford dab be head cook and i be head waiter have be ford 's explanation frank and the boy be company certainly the cook have no cause to be ashamed of he work the coffee be excellent the fish be do to a turn the oyster roasted broil or stew and likewise the clam be all that could have be ask of they bread there be in abundance and all thing be go finely till mr kinzer ask she son as he fire-red face show itself at the kitchen-door -- dabney you have not send in you vegetable we be wait for they dab 's face grow redder and he come near drop a plate he hold in he hand vegetable oh yes well ford we might as well send they in now i have get they all ready annie open she eye and look hard at she brother for she know very well that not so much as a potato have be think of in they preparation ford himself look a little queer but he march right out white apron and all a minute or so later the two boy come in again each bear aloft a huge platter one of these be solemnly deposit at each end of the table vegetable why -- they be lobster o ford how could you the last exclamation come from annie foster as she clap she hand over she face bright-red be those lobster and fine-looking fellow every one of they in spite of mr lee 's poor opinion but they be a little too well dress even for a dinner-party they thick shoulder be adorn with collar of the daintiest material and finish while every ungainly flipper wear a cuff which have be manufacture for a different kind of wrist there be plenty of cuff and collar and queer enough the lobster look in they all the queerer because every item of lace and linen be variegate with huge black spot and blotch as if some one have begin to wash it in ink joe and fuz be almost as red as the lobster and mr foster 's face look as severe as it could but that be not say a great deal the kinzer family know all about those cuff and collar and ham morri and the younger lady be try hard not to laugh joe say fuz snappishly can not you take a joke annie 's get the laugh on we this time i exclaimed annie indignantly : no indeed that be some of ford 's work and dabney 's -- mr kinzer i be ashamed of you poor dab he mutter something about those be all the vegetable he have and retreat to the kitchen joe and fuz however be not of the sort that take offence easily and they be shortly help themselves quite liberally to lobster cuff or no cuff that be all that be necessary to restore harmony at the table but dab 's plan for punish the hart boy be a complete failure as ford tell he afterwards : feel it not they you might as well try to hurt a clam with a pin and i hurt you sister 's feeling instead of theirs say dab well i 'll never try any thing like it again anyhow joe and fuz be not comfortable they eat too many roasted clam and a good deal too much lobster there be a certain degree of consolation to be have from such a fact as that chapter xxii the real mission of the jug ham morri eat well when he once get at it but he do not linger long at the dinner-table for he heart be in the swallow dab would have give more than ever for the privilege of go with he not that he feel so dreadfully charitable but that he do not care to prolong he stay at mr foster 's as cook or otherwise he have not by any means lose he appetite -- although he seem disposed to neglect the lobster and when he have take proper care of it he hurry away on a errand for he mother in the direction of the village nearly everybody he meet have some question or other to ask he about the wreck and it be not to have be expect that jenny walter would let she old acquaintance pass she without a word or so dab answer as well as he could consider the disturbed state of he mind but he wind up with -- jenny i wish you would come over to we house by and by what for oh i have get something to show you -- something you never see before do you mean you new baby the one you find on the bar yes but that baby jenny what be wonderful about it why it be only two year old and it can squall in two language that be a good deal more than you can do they say you friend miss foster speak french retort jenny be she ever shipwreck in french may be so but not in german well dabney i do not propose to squall in any thing be you folk go to burn any more of they barn this year not unless samantha get married jenny do you know what be the latest fashion in lobster changeable green i suppose no : i mean after they be boil it be to have 'em come on the table in cuff and collar lace around they neck you know and glove no not any glove we have lobster to-day at mr foster 's and you ought to have see 'em dabney kinzer it be time you go to school again i be go in a few day go do you mean you be go away somewhere ever so far and dick lee 's go with I i hear about he but i do not know he mean to take you along that be very kind of dick i s ` pose you will not speak to common people when you get back now jenny -- good-afternoon dabney perhaps i 'll come over before you go if it be only to take a look at that shipwrecked baby a good many of mr kinzer 's lady friend young and old deem it they duty to come and do that very thing within the next few day then the sewing-circle take the matter up and both the baby and its mother be provide for as they never have be before it would have take more language than two to fairly express the gratitude of the poor alsatian as for the rest of they out there on the bar they be speedily take off and carry to the city none of they be seriously the worse for they suffering after all ham morri declare that the family he have bring ashore come just in time to help he out with he fall work and he do not see any charity in it good for ham it be the right way to feel about it but dab kinzer think he could see something in it that look like charity when he meet he tired-out brother-in-law on he late return from that second trip across the bay real charity never care to make a exhibition of itself they be pretty thoroughly wear out both of they but they carefully moor the swallow in she usual berth before they leave she she have effectually discharge she cargo over on the sand-island but they have enough of a load to carry home in the shape of empty basket and thing of that sort be every thing out of the locker dab inquire ham all but the jug i say do you know it be nearly half full would it do any hurt to leave it here the jug no not if you just pour out the rest of the apple-jack over the side make the fish drunk well it sha 'n' t do that for anybody else if i can help it well if it be good for water-soaked people i guess it can not hurt the fish empty it dab empty it and come along the doctor be not so far wrong and i be glad to have it with I seem to do some of 'em a power of good but medicine 's medicine and i only wish some people i know of would remember it some of 'em do a good deal of that kind of doctoring the condemn liquor be already gurgle from the mouth of the demijohn into the salt water and neither fish nor eel come forward to get a share of it they be probably all feel pretty well that night when the demijohn be empty and the cork replace it be set down again in the cabin and that be leave unlock for there be no more danger in it for anybody dab and ham be altogether too tired to take any pain there be no call for dab 's mind must have be tire as well as he body for he decide to postpone until the morrow the report he have to make about the tramp he be strongly of the opinion that the latter have not see he to recognize he and at all event the matter could wait so it come to pass that all the shore and the road that lead away from it and the village the road lead into be desert and silent a hour or so later when a stoutly-built cat-boat with she one sail lower be quietly scull up the inlet there be two man on board a tall one and a shorter one and they run they boat right alongside the swallow as if that be the precise thing they have come to do burgin remark the tall man wot ef we do not find any thin ' arter all this sailin ' and rowin ' and scullin ' most likely he be kerry it to the house in course he have the keenly watchful eye of burgin have note the arrival of that apple-jack at the island and they have closely follow its fortune from first to last he have more than half try indeed to work himself in among the crowd as one of the sufferer but with no manner of success the officer of the ship know every face that have any right to a spoonful and burgin 's fail to pass he he have not fail however to note that he coveted medicine be by no means exhaust and to see ham stow the demijohn carefully away at last under the half-deck of the swallow that information have give all the inducement require to get old peter and he boat across the bay and the ancient wrecker be as anxious about the result as the tramp himself could be it be hard to say now which of they be the first on board the swallow it be not lock then the jug be not thar wall it be exclaim burgin triumphantly as he pull it out but he under jaw drop a little when he feel how light it lift reckon they help themselves on thar way hum it be a good deal worse than that and a angry and disappointed pair be they when the cork and the truth come out thar 's jest a good smell that be old peter 's remark and it sound as if word fail he to add to it but burgin 's wrath explode in a torrent of bitter abuse of the man or man who have empty that demijohn he give old peter a capital chance to turn upon he morosely with -- look a-yer my chap be this ` ere you boat no : i do not say it be do i be that there you jug i do not know if i keer to sit and hear one of my neighbor -- and he be a good feller too he be -- abused all night jest bekase i have be and let a entire stranger make a fool of I do you mean I well ef i do not i would not say it do not you git mad now it will not pay ye jest let 's take a turn ` round the village you kin go ef you want ter i 'll wait for ye ` pear like i do not feel much like doin ' any trampin ' ` round stay thar then but mind you do not try on any runnin ' away with my boat if i want a boat old man there be plenty here that be better worth stealin ' than yourn that be so i do not know you would be makin ' any kalkilation on it i will not be go any great while he be go some time however whatever may have be he errand old peter be not the man to be at a loss for one of some sort even at that hour of the night and he present business perhaps do not particularly require company when he return at last he find he own boat safe enough and he really could not tell if any of the other have walk away but he look around in vain for any sign of he late comrade not that he spend much time or waste any great pain in search for he and he mutter to himself as he give it up -- go have he well then it be a good riddance to bad rubbidge i be not no aingil but that feller 's a long way wuss 'n i be whether or not old peter be right in he estimate of himself or of burgin in a few moment more he be all alone in he cat-boat and be scull it rapidly out of the crooked inlet he search for burgin have be a careless one for he have but glance over the gunwale of the swallow a second look might have show he the form of the tramp half cover by a loose flap of the sail deeply and heavily sleep on the bottom of the boat it be every bit as comfortable a bed as he have be use to and there he be still lie long after the sun have look in upon he the next morning other eye than the sun 's be to look in upon he before he awaken from that untimely and imprudent nap it be not so very early when ham morri and dabney kinzer be stir again but they have both arise with a strong desire for a talk and ham make a opportunity for one by say -- come on dab let 's go down and have a look at ` the swallow ' ham have mean to talk about school and kindred matter but dab 's first word about the tramp cut off all other subject you ought to have tell I he say i would have have he tie up in a minute dab explain as well as he could but before he have finish ham suddenly exclaim -- there be dick lee on board ` the swallow ' what on earth 's he there for dick shout dabney cap'n dab do yo ' set this yer boat to trap somebody no why 'cause you be do go a ' cotch ` im jes ' you come a ' see the sound of dick 's voice so near they reach the dull ear of the slumbering tramp and as ham and dabney spring into a yawl and push along-side the yacht he unpleasant face be slowly and sleepily lift above the rail it be the very man excitedly shout dabney the tramp yes -- the tramp no one would have suspect ham morri of so much agility although he broad and well-knit frame promise abundant strength but he be on board the swallow like a flash and burgin be pin by he iron grasp before he could so much as guess what be come le ' go o ' I i have get you it be too late for any such thing as resistance and the captive settle at once into a sullen dogged silence after the ordinary custom of he kind when they find themselves corner it be a species of dull brute instinct more than cunning seemingly but not a word more do ham and dab obtain from they prisoner -- although they say a good many to he -- until they deliver he over to the safe-keeping of the lawful authority at the village that do they go home to breakfast feeling that they have make a good morning 's work of it but wonder what would be the end and result of it all ten year i guess say ham in state prison yes break stone he 'll get he board free but it 'll be total abstinence for he i wonder what take he on board ` the swallow ' i know -- the jug that be it sure 's you live i see he over on the island i declare to think of a empty demijohn have so much good in it chapter xxiii another grand plan and a very grand runaway the whole community be stir up over the news of the capture of the tramp it make a first-class excitement for a place of that size but none of the inhabitant take a deeper interest in the matter than do ford and frank and the two hart boy it be difficult for they to get they mind quite right about it especially the first pair to whom it be a matter of unasked question just how much help ham have give dab in capture the marauder mr foster himself get a little excited about it when he come home but poor annie be a good deal more troubled than pleased o mother she exclaim do you suppose i shall have to appear in court and give my testimony as a witness i hope not my dear perhaps you father can manage to prevent it somehow it would not have be a easy thing to do even for so good a lawyer as mr foster if burgin himself have not save they all trouble on that score long before the slow process of country criminal justice could bring he to actual trial so many misdeed be bring home to he from here and there that he give the matter up and not only confess to the attack on annie 's pocket-book but to the barn-burning to which dab 's cudgelling have provoke he he make he case so very clear that when he finally come before a judge and jury and plead guilty there be nothing leave for they to do but to say just what he be guilty of and how long he should break stone to pay for it it be likely to be a good deal more than ten year if he live out he time all that come to pass some month later however and just now the village have enough to talk about in discuss the peculiar manner of he capture the story of the demijohn leak out of course and while it do not rob dab and ham of any part of they glory it be make to do severe duty in the way of a temperance lecture old jock indeed protest you see boy say he real good liquor like that do not do nobody no harm that be the real stuff -- prime old apple-jack ` at i would have in my cellar ten year last christmas a ' it jest tole that feller across the bay and capter he without no manner of diffikilty there be some among he auditor who could have testify to a decidedly different kind of capture one effect of dab 's work on the day of the yachting-trip include he special performance as cook and as milliner to the lobster be that he feel himself thenceforth bind to be somewhat carefully polite to joe and fuz the remain day of they visit would have be altogether too few for the varied entertainment he lay out for they in he own mind by way of reparation for he unlucky practical joke they be to catch all there be in the bay they be to ride everywhere they be to be show every thing there be to see they do not deserve it dab say ford but you be a real good fellow mother say so do she say dab and he evidently feel a good deal relieve after that mr richard lee when he friend once more find time to think of he have almost disappear from the public eye some three day after the trip while all the other boy be out in the jenny have a good time with they hook and line dick 's mother make she appearance in mr kinzer 's dining-room or miranda 's with a face that be even darker than usual with a cloud of motherly anxiety miss kinzer she say have you see my dick di week no : he have not be here at all be there any thing the matter with he dat 's de berry question i jes ' do not know wot to make ob ` im why glorianna do you think he be study too hard it be not je ' de book i be not so much afeard ob dem : but it be all ` long ob de ` cad ` my i wish you would je ' take a good look at ` im fust chance ye git do he look badly no : ` tai not je ' altogedder he look he be de be ' lookin ' boy ` long shoah but den de way he be a-goin ' on to talk ` tai not natural he use to talk fust-rate can not he talk now yes miss kinzer he kin talk but den de way he git out he word nebber see sech a t ` ing in all my bear day take he ebber so long je ' to say good-mornin ' a ' he do not say it like he use ter i wish you would je ' take a good look at ` im mrs kinzer promise and she give she black friend what comfort she could but dick lee 's tongue would never again be the free-and-easy member of society it have be even when at home and about he commonest chore he be all the while struggle with what he call he pronounciation if he should succeed as well with the rest of he schooling it be safe to say that it would not be throw away upon he glorianna go she way that morning and the next to intrude upon mr kinzer 's special domain be she son-in-law himself accompany by he bloom bride we have get a plan you apian what about dab and he friend that be the beginning of a tolerably long consultation and the result of it be duly report to dabney when he come home with he fish a party he exclaim when he mother finish she brief but comprehensive statement : ham and miranda to give a party for we boy well now if they be not right down good but mother we 'll have to get it up mighty quick i know it dab but that be easy enough with all the help we have i 'll take care of that a party but mother what can we do there be only a few of 'em know how to dance i do not for one you must talk it over with ford perhaps annie and frank can help you they be all take into counsel soon enough and endless be the plan and proposition make till even mrs kinzer find she temper get a little fret and worry over they at all event it be a settle fact that the party be to be and the invitation go out in due and proper form miranda say she mother on the morning of the important day we must manage to get rid of dabney and those boy for a few hour send 'em for some green to rig the parlor with suggest ham let 'em take the pony do you think the pony be safe for they to drive just now oh dab can handle 'em they be a trifle skittish that be all they need a little exercise so they do but it be to be doubt if the best way to secure it for they be to send they out in a light two-seated wagon with a load of five lively boy now do not you let one of the other boy touch the rein say mr kinzer dab 's promise to that effect prove a hard one to keep for fuz and joe almost try to take the rein away from he before they have drive two mile from the house he be firm however and they manage to reach the strip of woodland some five mile inland where they be to gather they load without any disaster but it be evident to dab all the way that he pony be in uncommonly high condition he take they out of the wagon while the rest begin to gather they liberal harvest of evergreen and he do not bring they near it again until all be ready for the start homeward now boy he say you get in joe and ford and fuz on the back seat to hold down the green frank get up there forward while i hitch in the pony these fellow be chuck full of mischief very full certainly nor do dab kinzer know exactly what the matter be for a minute or so after he seize the rein and spring up beside frank harley then indeed as the pony kick and rear and plunge he think he see something work out from under they collar and fall to the ground a acorn-burr be just the thing to worry a restive horse if put in such a place but joe and fuz have hardly expect they little joke to be so very successful as it be the pony be off now joe shout fuz let 's jump do not let 'em ford exclaimed dab give he whole energy to the horse they 'll break they neck if they do hold 'em in ford who be in the middle promptly seize a arm of each of he panic-stricken cousin while frank clamber over the seat to help he they be all down on the bottom now serve as a weight to hold the evergreen branch as the light wagon bounce and rattle along over the smooth level road in vain dab pull and pull at the pony run they would and run they do and all he could do be to keep they fairly in the road brace strongly back with the rein wind around he tough hand and with a look in he face that should have give courage even to the hart boy dab strain at he task as bravely as when he have stand at the tiller of the swallow in the storm there be no such thing as stop those pony and now as they whirl along even dabney 's face pale a little i must reach the bridge before he do : he be just stupid enough to keep right on it be very stupid indeed for the driver of that one-horse truck-wagon to try and reach the little narrow unrailed bridge first it be a old used-up sort of a bridge at best dab loosen the rein a little but could not use he whip why can not he stop it be a moment of breathless anxiety but the wagoner keep stolidly on there would be barely room to pass he on the road itself none at all on the narrow bridge the pony do it they seem to put on a extra touch of speed on they own account just then there be a rattle a faint crash and then as the wheel of the two vehicle almost touch each other in pass ford shout -- the bridge be down such a narrow escape one of the rotten girder never half strong enough have give way under the sudden shock of the hinder wheel and that truck-wagon would have to find its road across the brook as best it could there be more wagon to pass as they plunge forward and rough place in the road for dabney to look out for but even joe and fuz be now get confidence in they driver before long too the pony themselves begin to feel that they have have enough of it then it be that dab use he whip again and the street of the village be traverse at a rate to call for the disapprobation of all sober-minded people here we be ham green and all do they run far dab ask ham quietly chapter xxiv dabney 's great party the boy return a good deal earlier than anybody have expect but they make no more trouble as ford foster remark they be all willing to go slow for a week after be carry home at such a rate by dab 's pony there be a great deal to be say too about the runaway and mrs foster long to see dabney and thank he on ford 's account but he himself have no idea that he have do any thing remarkable and be very busy deck miranda 's parlor with the evergreen a nice appearance they make too all those weave branch and cluster spray when they be in place and samantha declare for they that -- they have keep dab out of mischief all the afternoon at a early hour after supper the guest begin to arrive for mr kinzer be a woman of too much good sense to have night turn into day when she could prevent it as the stream of visitor steadily pour in dab remark to jenny walter -- we shall have to enlarge the house after all if it be only a dress now what then why you could just let out the tuck i have have to do that with mine jenny shake hand with I what for dabney i be so glad to meet somebody else that be outgrow something there be a tinge of color rise in jenny 's face but before she could think of any thing to say dab add -- there jenny : there be mr foster and annie be not she sweet one of the nicest old lady i ever see oh i do not mean she mother never mind you must introduce I to they so i will take my arm jenny walter have be unusually kindly and gracious in she manner that evening and she very voice have less than its accustomed sharpness but she natural disposition break out a little some minute later while she be talk with annie foster say she -- i have want so much to get acquaint with you with I yes : i have see you in church and i have hear you talk about and i want to find out for myself find out what ask annie a little soberly why you see i do not believe it be possible for any girl to be as sweet as you look i could not i know i have be try these two day and i be nearly wear out annie 's eye open wide with surprise and she laugh merrily as she answer -- what can you mean i be glad enough if my face do not tell tale of I but mine do say jenny and then i be so sure to tell all the rest with my tongue i do wish i know what be you fault my fault what for i do not know seem to I if i could think of you fault instead of mine it would not be so hard to look sweet annie could but see that there be more earnestness than fun in the queer talk of she new acquaintance the truth be that jenny have be have almost as hard a struggle with she tongue as dick lee with he though not for the same reason before many minute she have frankly tell annie all about it and she could not have do that if she have not somehow feel that annie 's sweetness be genuine the two girl be sure friend after that much to the surprise of mr dabney kinzer he indeed have be too much occupy in care for all he guest to pay especial attention to any one of they he mother have look after he again and again with eye brimful of pride and of commendation of the way in which he be acquit himself as host mr foster herself remark to she husband who have now arrive -- do you see that who would have expect as much from a raw green country boy but my dear do not you see the secret of it be that he be not think of himself at all he be only anxious that he friend should have a good time that be it but then that too be a very rare thing in a boy of he age dabney exclaim the lawyer in a louder tone of voice good-evening mr foster i be glad you have find room the house be not half large enough it 'll do i understand you pony run away with you to-day they do come home in a hurry that be a fact but nobody be hurt i fear there would have be but for you do you start for grantley with the other boy tomorrow of course dick lee and i need some one to take care of we we never have travel so far before on land you mean be dick here to-night come and look in sir but he get scare by the crowd and go home poor fellow i do not wonder well we will all do what we can for he poor dick lee and yet if mr dabney kinzer have know he whereabouts at that very moment he would half have envy he dick 's mother be in the kitchen help about the refreshment but she have not leave home until she have compel she son to dress himself in he best -- white shirt red necktie shine shoe and all and she have bring he with she almost by force you be goodnuff to go to de ` cad ` my and leab yer pore mother a ' i reckon you 's good nuff for de party dick have actually venture in from the kitchen through the dining-room and as far as the door of the back parlor where few would look how he heart do beat as he gaze upon the merry gathering a large part of whom he have know all he bear day but there be a side-door opening from that dining-room upon the long piazza which mr kinzer have add to the old morri mansion and dick 's hand be on the knob of that door almost before he know it then he be out on the road to the landing and in five minute more he be vigorously rowing the jenny out through the inlet towards the bay he heart be not beat unpleasantly any longer but as he shoot out from the narrow passage through the flag and see the little wave laugh in the cool dim starlight he suddenly stop rowing lean on he oar give a great sigh of relief and exclaim -- dar i 's safe now i be not get to say a word to nobody out yer wonder ' f i 'll ebber git back from de ` cad ` my a ' ketch fish in dis yer bay sho course i will but goin ' ` way 's awful dab kinzer think he have never before know jenny walter to appear so well as she look that evening and he must have be right for good mr foster say to annie -- what a pleasant kindly face you new friend have you must ask she to come and see we she seem to be quite a favorite with the kinzer have you know dabney long annie have ask of jenny a little before that ever since i be a little bit of a girl and a big boy seven or eight year old push I into the snow be it dabney no but dabney be the boy that push he in for do it and then help I up dab rub he face with snow for he till he cry just like he exclaim annie with emphasis i should think he friend here will miss he indeed they will say jenny and then she seem disposed to be quiet for a while the party could not last forever pleasant as it be and by the time he duty as host be all do and over dabney be tire enough to go to bed and sleep soundly he arm be lame and sore from the strain the pony have give they and that may have be the reason why he dream half the night that he be drive runaway team and crash over rickety old bridge there be some reason for that but why be it that every one of he dream-wagon no matter who else be in it seem to have jenny walter and annie foster smile at he from the back seat he rise later than usual next morning and the house be all in its customary order by the time he get down stair breakfast be ready also and it be hardly over before dab 's great new trunk be bring down into the front-door passage by a couple of the farmhand it be a hour yet to train-time say ham morri but we might as well get ready we must be on hand in time what a long hour that be and not even a chance give to dab to run down to the landing for a good-by look at the jenny and the swallow he mother and ham and miranda and the girl seem to be all make up of good-by that morning mother say dab what be it my dear boy that be it exactly if you say ` dear boy ' again ham morri 'll have to carry I to the car i be all kind o ' wilt now then they all laugh and before they get through laugh they all cry except ham he put he hand in he pocket and draw a long whistle the pony be at the door now the light wagon be a roomy one but when dab 's trunk have be put in there be barely room leave for the lady and dab and ham have to walk to the station i be kind o ' glad of it say dab it be a short walk and a silent one but when they come in sight of the platform dab exclaim -- there they be -- all of they the whole party why the platform 's as crowd as we house be last night mr kinzer and she daughter be already the center of a talkative crowd of young people and ford foster and frank harley with joe and fuz hart be ask what have become of dab for the train be in sight a moment later as the puff locomotive pull up in front of the water-tank the conductor step out on the platform exclaim -- look a-here folk this be not right if there be go to be a picnic you ought to have send word and i would have tack on a extra car you 'll have to pack in now best you can he seem much relieve when he find how small a part of that crowd be to be he passenger dab say ford this be you send-off not ours you 'll have to make a speech dab do want to say something but he have just kiss he sister and he mother and half a dozen of he school-girl friend have follow the example of jenny walter and then mr foster have kiss he and ham morri have shake hand with he and dab could not have say a word to have save he life speech whisper ford mischievously as dab step upon the car-platform but dick lee who have just escape from the tremendous hug he mother have give he and have get he breath again come to he friend 's relief in the nick of time dick feel as he afterwards explain that he must shout or he should go off and so at the top of he shrill voice he shout -- hurrah for cap'n kinzer dar be not no better feller lef long shoah and then amid a chorus of cheer and laughter and a grand wave of white handkerchief the engine give a deep hysterical cough and hurry the train away three homestead by the long island shore be lonely enough that evening and they be all likely to be lonelier still before they get fairly accustomed to the continue absence of those boy it be well understand that the foster have determine to prolong they summer in the country until the arrival of cold weather they have find all thing so pleasant and the kinzer be well please with that as samantha remark -- if it be only to compare letter i do hope dabney will write as soon as he get there and tell we all about it he will say he mother but ham 's face put on a somewhat doubtful look i be not quite sure about dab he say slowly if thing be not just right he be the sort of boy that would not say a word about it well i must say i like what i saw of mr myer 's notion about feed people chapter xxv the boy on they travels a great city and a great dinner the conductor of that train need not have be much alarm at fall in with a picnic of any moderate size for he would have have room in he train to seat a good part of it at least the boy have no difficulty in get seat all together that be they find four empty one two on each side right opposite and when they have turn over the front seat there they be ford and frank be face dabney and dick on the right and the two hart boy be face each other on the left each with a whole seat to himself almost the first thing joe do after take possession be to lean over and whisper -- look out fuz -- keep you secret catch I spoil a good joke the other party seem disposed to keep pretty quiet for a while the first break of any consequence in the silence come when ford foster exclaim -- dab it be right along here what be where the pig have he collision with my train first time i be over here do you hear he squeal ask frank as he peer through the window the pig no but you ought to have hear the engine squeal when it see he come the story have to be all tell over again of course and do good service in get they thought in order for the trip before they up to the mention of the pig it have somehow seem to dab as if the railway-platform at the station and all the people on it have keep company with the train and frank harley find himself calculate the distance between that car and the mission at rangoon in far-away indium as for ford foster he stand in less need of any pig than the rest from the fact that he have a large-sized idea in he head he keep it there too until that train pull up within reach distance of one of the brooklyn ferry before they lay the swift tide of the broad east river and beyond that with its border of crowded dock and bristle mast lay the street and square and swarm the multitude of the great city of new york ford say dabney you be captain this time what be we to do now well if i be not captain i guess i would better do a little steering we must give we check to the expressman and have we luggage cart over to the grand central depot will it be sure to get there in good time of course it would not if we be in any hurry but we train do not leave until three o'clock and the express will not fail to have it there before that ford be all alive with the responsibility of he position as the only boy in the party who have be bear in the city and have travel all over it and a little out of it joe and fuz he say will want to take the night boat for albany they have more time on they hand than we have joe -- fuz -- why can not you come along with we after you have check you trunk we 'll be get dinner before long the hart boy promptly assent after a look at each other and a sort of chuckle might as well keep together say joe we would like to take a look at thing come along i 'll show you frank harley have see quite a number of great city and he could hardly help say something about they while they be go over on the ferryboat they be all as far forward as they could get do you ever see any thing just like this ask dab well no not just like it -- in indium or in china or in london or in africa say ford it be a little different from any thing i ever see well be not it bigger that be a question frank might have undertake to answer if there have be proper time give he but just then the boat be run into she slip away down town and ford exclaim -- hurrah boy now for fulton market and some oyster oyster say dab yes sir there be more oyster in that old shanty than there be in you bay i do not know about that say dab stare at the queer huge rickety old mass of unsightly wood and glass that ford be point at after they get ashore i be hungry anyhow hungry so be i but no man ought to say he be be in new york till he be try some fulton-market oyster let 's take 'em raw say fuz then we can go ahead dick lee have be in the city before but never in such company nor in such very good clothes and there be a expression on he face a good deal like awe when he actually find himself stand at a oyster-counter in line with five well-dressed young white boy the man behind the counter serve he too in regular turn and dick feel it a point of honor to empty the half-shell before he as quickly as any of the rest there be no delay about that anywhere along that line of boy dick say ford where 's you lemon there it be ford have already explain to the rest that it be against the constitution and by-law of fulton market to eat a raw oyster without the lemon-juice and dick would have blush if he could dat 's so i forget um and then he add with great care yes mr foster the lemon improve the oyster i declare muttered ford he be keep it up the oyster be eat and then it be come on boy and away they go up fulton street to broadway they walk two and two as well as the stream of people would let they but the hart boy keep a little in the rear what do you think of it joe think of what walk over new york with dick lee just as if he be one of we guess nobody 'll think we be walk with he anybody can tell what we be just by look at we dick 's face show just what he be too i do not care for this once but it be awful if any such thought be troubling ford foster he make no confession of it and be even specially careful now and then to turn around and address some remark or other to the member from africa as he call he dick say dab in a undertone as they be leave the market you look out now : you must have as good a time as any of we or i will not feel right about it je ' you sail right ahead cap'n dab i 's on hand ford be determine to do the honor and he lead they down broadway to the battery before he start up town and he have something to say about a great many of the building dab feel he respect for city boy increase rapidly and dick remark -- ef he do not know di coa ' mo ' as well as i know de bay it look like it and he also seem to be on term of easy acquaintance with some of the human fish they fall in with not that he speak to any of they but he point out the several kind -- policeman fireman messenger-boys loafer broker post-office carrier a dozen more with a degree of confidence which fairly astonish he friend i could learn to tell all of they that wear uniform myself say dabney but how do you know the other how do i know 'em well it be just like know a miller or a blacksmith when you see he they all have some kind of smut on they that come from they trade there may have be something in that or it may be barely possible that ford now and then mixed he man a little and point out broker as gambler and busy attorney as probable pickpocket he may have be too confident on they go till the brain of all but ford and frank be in a sort of whirl even dab kinzer be contented to look without talk and dick lee although he have not a word to say find unusual difficulty in keep he mouth shut it positively would come open every time ford point out another big building and tell he what it be they be not travel very fast but they be use a good deal of time in all that sight-seeing and walking be hungry business and a few raw oyster could not last six hearty boy very long i say ford sing out joe from the rear be not it get pretty near time for we to think of get something to eat we be ` most there now we be go to have we dinner at the magnilophant to-day what be that say frank never hear of it oh you be the member from indium well it be the greatest restaurant in the known world or in paris either beat any thing on long island serve you up any thing there be and no living man can tell what he be eat ford be in high spirit and seem all one chuckle of self-confidence it be indeed a remarkably elegant establishment in its line into which he lead they a few minute later there certainly be nothing like it on long island whatever might be true of pari and other place outside of the known world dab kinzer feel like walk very straight as he follow he leader and dick lee have to use all the strength he have to keep himself from take he hat right off when he go in there be any amount of glitter and shine in all direction and dab have a confused idea that he have never before believe that the world contain so many table ford seem wonderfully at home and at ease and dick find voice enough to say half aloud -- be not i glad he be get de rudder di time cap'n dab could not steer t ` rough di yer the steering be well do and it bring they nearly to the farther end of the great splendid room and seat they at a round table that seem as well furnished as even mr foster 's own they all imitate ford in hang they hat on the appoint peg before sit down now boy what shall we have he say as he gaze learnedly up and down the print bill of fare speak up joe fuz what be you weakness every boy of they be willing to let ford do he best with that part of the dinner and he be hard at work decide what soup and fish he have better pick out when the tall waiter who have bustle forward to receive the come order bent over he shoulder and point to dick lee inquire -- beg pardon sah be dis young color gen ` l-man of youah party it be ` gainst de rule ob de establishment sah dab kinzer feel he face flush fiery red and he be on the point of say something he hardly know what when ford look calmly up into the mahogany face of the mulatto waiter with -- you refer to my friend from africa we 'll talk about that after dinner gumbo soup and spanish mackerel if you please sharp now but sah -- do not be afflict my friend he be as white as anybody except on friday : this be he black day hurry up the soup and fish joe and fuz be look as if they be dreadfully ashamed of something but poor dick be sit up as straight as a ramrod under the influence of a glance that he have take at the face of dab kinzer i be not goin ' back on he and ford he say to himself i would foller dem feller right fru ' dis yer eatin ' - house frank harley seem to be get some information in the country he have live in nearly all he life color people be as good as anybody if they be of the right sort and a man 's skin have little to do with the degree of respect pay he although even there it be a excellent thing to be white as for the mulatto waiter after a moment more of hesitation he take ford 's order and walk dignifiedly away mutter -- nebber see de like afore reckon i be not g ` wine to tote soup and fish for no nigger : i 'll see de boss that mean a appeal to the lordly and pompous but quite gentlemanly head waiter a man as white as ford foster a word or two to he a finger point towards the upper end of the hall and the keen eye of the man in authority take it all in six of they -- five white and one black well gus do they look as if they could pay they bill before they go yes sah dey do de young gen ` lman wid de bill ob fare in he han ' he be get moah cheek a ' moah tongue a ' moah lip sah -- well then gus you just tramp right along if he and the rest do not care i do not it 'll be time enough for I to make a fool of myself when somebody offer to pay I for it give 'em they dinner sharp it be je ' a mon ` ous outrage growl the offended waiter as he stalk away but he take good care to obey he order for he have a consciousness that the eye of he master be on he he could hardly have guess how completely he errand have be understand by the six boy or how closely ford foster have hit it say he in reply to a angry remark from dab kinzer -- it be all humbug they run this concern to make money and they want some of ours mr marigold 'll be send right back with we soup he be right but before they have eat they way to the pie and pudding ford be dignifiedly inform -- if you please sah my name be not mr marigold sah it be mr bellerington sah a ' my first name be not coffee sah it be augustus you do not say reply ford : well augustus do not forget the little remark i make about pie and the other thing it be a capital dinner and ford be proud of it for he have pick out every item of it from the soup to the macaroon dick lee have enjoy it hugely after he begin to feel that he first social victory have be fairly win for he still he have doubt in he own mind as to whether he would ever dare such another undertaking with less than five white boy along to see he through joe and fuz eat well but they spirit be manifestly low for they be painfully conscious of have forever lose the good opinion of that mulatto waiter but for dick lee 's be with we they think he and everybody else would have know we be gentleman we 'll never be catch in such a trap again it be a very sad matter no doubt to lose the intelligent respect of such gentleman as mr augustus bellerington but it sometimes have to be do that be unless they good opinion be to be gain by some nice little stroke of sneak cowardice joe and fuz stand it out indeed mainly because they be in some way more afraid of dab and ford and frank than they be of even augustus that too be strange for they be older than either of the other and taller than any but dabney himself the dinner be well eat and it be well pay for as dabney remark when he pay he share and half of dick 's and then they be all in the street again march along and sight-seeing towards the grand central railroad depot chapter xxvi the first morning in grantley and another excellent joke ford foster be the only one of those six boy who have ever see the great railway-building and he confess that it look a little large even to he frank harley freely declare that he have see nothing like it in indium and dick lee 's eye show all the white they have to show before he have see the whole of it they first errand be to the baggage-room and they be on they way when dab kinzer thoughtfully remark -- now joe here we have drag you and fuz away up here mile and mile out of you way that be so say ford but they can take a street-car down they have get hour of time to spare no hurry say joe : we 'll see you off but fuz whisper to he -- time 's up joe joke 's get to come out now it come out at the baggage-room for there be the trunk of the hart boy and they have to go with the other to the ticket-office for they ticket before they could get they check do you mean you be to go right on now with we say ford in some astonishment i think you be go home first no we get a letter three day ago tell we what to do we other thing 'll be send on by express the joke be out and the two joker be laugh as though it be a remarkably good one in they estimation but ford nod he head approvingly uncle joseph be a wise and careful man about he child he say slowly he do not mean you should make the trip alone i be much oblige to he for such a expression of he confidence in I the laugh somehow die away as if a sudden fit of sickness have carry it off while a broad smile widen on the face of the other boy notably include dick lee but the baggage-check be to be look after and there be seat in the sleeping-car to be secure the lost joke could hide itself easily in all that hurry and excitement the sleeper 'll carry we the best part of the way say ford when at last they take they seat but we 'll have a doleful little ride on a small railway early in the morning but that 'll take we right up north to grantley add dab with a long-drawn breath of expectation the remain hour of that Friday be largely spend by all six of they in look out of the window when they be not do that it be mostly because joe or fuz be tell some yarn or other about grantley and its academy they agree perfectly in they somewhat extravagant praise of mr myer and she daughter almira she be such a good kind-hearted liberal motherly woman say joe and almira 's a sweet young lady add fuz only she be a little timid about boy need not be afraid of we i guess say ford foster with a benevolent and protect expression on he face while dab draw a mental picture of the fair almira as a sort of up-country copy of annie foster after the darkness come and the sleeper be turn into a great travelling-box full of little shaky bedroom there be no more talk to be do and all the boy be tire enough to go to sleep one consequence of they begin they slumber so early however be that they feel bright and fresh when the porter arouse they before daylight next morning and they hurriedly dress themselves for they ride on what ford foster call the switch it be quite a respectable railway however and it carry they through scenery so different from any that dabney or dick be accustom to that they lose a good deal of what joe and fuz be say about dr abiram brandegee the learn principal of grantley academy it be of less importance perhaps because they have hear it all before and have gather a curious collection of idea concern the man under whose direction they be to get they new stock of learn dab say dick if it be any feller but they say it i would want to go home well yes say dab quietly but then that be just it you can not guess when they be tell the truth and when they be not be dar really any fun in lyin ' do you s ` pose dab can not say dick guess there would not be much for you or I dar 's lot ob fun in ford a ' he tell de truth mo ' all de time stiddy so do frank je ' a little bit stiddier ford never lie dick no sir he do not but w ` en anoder feller 's lyin ' he kin make believe he do not know it be ' of any feller i ebber see dick exclaim dabney what if dr brandegee have hear you say that i would tell he i be imitate somebody i have hear solemnly respond dick with fair correctness the ride begin in the dark hour that come before the dawn and the train run fast the sun be above the horizon but have not yet peer over the high hill around grantley when the excited schoolboy be land at the little station in the outskirts of the village it be on a hillside and they could almost look down upon a large part of the scene of they good time come -- or they bad time a good deal as they themselves might make it dab and he friend see that valley and village often enough afterwards but never again do it wear to they precisely the same look it put on that morning in the grow light of that noble September day as for joe and fuz it be all a old story to they and what be more they have another first-rate joke on hand there be the academy say joe : that big white concern in the middle of the green and with so short a steeple steeple enough say ford be the rest church yes and if you do not go to church reg ` lar old by 'll be sure to hear of it old by be the irreverent nickname they have select for dr abiram brandegee and fuz add -- never mind he boy he be a raspy old fellow but he be such a little old withered wisp of a chap you 'll soon get use to he dab be bewilder enough just then to wonder how such a weak-minded malicious old dwarf as have be paint to he could have manage to get and keep so high a position in so remarkably beautiful a place as grantley he say something about the village be so pretty but dick lee have be stare eagerly in all direction and reply with -- je ' one little mite of a patch ob water be dar any fish to ketch fish in that pond say fuz why it be alive with 'em the people of grantley just live on fish guess i know ` bout how many dey be now say dick soberly and he be not far from right for there be no fish to speak of in that willow-bordered mill-pond mr myer will hardly be up so early as this say dab we can get we trunk over by and by let 's have a look at the village joe it be you turn to steer now you and fuz know how the land lie they be ready enough to tell all they know and a good deal more but the listener they have that morning be not without eye of they own and it be not a very fatiguing task to walk all over the village of grantley the first house to be study with special care be the neat white residence of dr brandegee with its shady tree and its garden for joe say -- that be where you fellow 'll have to come right after breakfast to be examine oh but will not old by put you through dick lee 's mouth come open as he stare at the knob on the doctor 's front door and dabney catch himself doubt if he know the multiplication-table even ford foster wonder if there be really any thing he could teach dr brandegee and remark to frank harley -- i s ` pose you be about the only man among we that he can not corner how 's that why if he be too hard on you you can answer he in hindustanee he be never be a heathen in all he life : you would have he -- shuah chuckle dick the green be large and well-kept and look like the best kind of a ball-ground but there be nothing wonderful about the academy building except that it evidently have in it room enough for a great many boy you 'll see enough of it before you get through say fuz but there 'll have to be lot of whittle do this fall whittle what for why do not you see they have go and paint the old thing all over new every boy cut he name somewhere before we leave last term they be all paint over now : maybe they be putty up level they do that once before and we have to cut 'em all out again oh say ford i see : you be afraid they would forget you i do not believe they would you have not point out mr myer 's say dabney it must be pretty near breakfast-time where be it the hart boy break out into a joint giggle of enjoyment as joe respond -- there it be -- right across there beyond the harness-shop opposite the other end of the green handy in bad weather it be a pretty decent-looking house too say ford come on : let 's go over and let she know we have arrive in port well no say joe : you fellow go over soon as you please fuz and i will not take we breakfast there this morning go somewhere else eh well we 'll have a eye to you trunk when they come the giggle grow rapidly into a laugh as fuz exclaim -- trunk why we baggage 'll go to we boarding-house we do not put up with mother myer this time : get a new place oh but will not you fellow just love she and almira it be all out that deep secret about they change of boarding-house and the hart boy have something to enjoy this time for dab and he friend look at each other for a moment in blank amazement all right boy shout ford at the end of it : here be for some breakfast good-morning joe day-day fuz see you again by and by they all follow he but they could see that there be something more hide under the mirth of joe and fuz as they walk away and they be hardly out of hearing before dab kinzer remark -- look a ' here boy i move we do not give those two any fun at we expense how ask ford if there be any thing at mr myer 's that we do not like we must not let they know it i 's keep my mouf shet if i foun ' de house be a ole eel-pot say dick emphatically and frank and ford come out even more strongly they all seem to feel as if some kind of a trick have be play upon they to begin with however it serve to put they on they guard and prevent any change of countenance among they when they knock at the front door of that house be answer and the freckled face of mr myer beam out upon they from under its thin smooth glisten thatch of carroty hair she be not a handsome woman and she have a thin nose and a narrow mouth and very pale blue eye but she be all one smile of welcome as she stand in that doorway mr myer say ford with a extraordinary bow we arrive on the morning train i be mr foster and then with a half turn to the right he continue mr myer -- mr richard lee mr dabney kinzer mr franci harley we baggage will come over pretty soon walk in young gentleman walk in i be happy to see you -- almira here they be : put breakfast on the table right away that be not a bad beginning think dab that sound a good deal like what ham say of she she know we must be hungry walk into the parlor please breakfast 'll be ready in one minute i 'll show you you room afterwards that too be considerate and when almira herself come to the door between the parlor and the dining-room she too look as if it be quite she habit to smile when she say -- breakfast 's ready almira smile but she be too much like she mother there be nothing at all about she to put dabney in mind of annie foster or of either of he own sister samantha or keziah or pamelum could have be make over into two almira in every thing but height and dab make up he mind at once that either of they could beat she at smile -- not so much perhaps as to mere quantity but as to quality that be a breakfast which would have fully justified ham morri 's report for it be well cook and plentiful the johnnycake in particular be abundant and all the boy take to it kindly glad you like it say mr myer almira that be one thing we must not forget i be always proud of my johnny cake there be very few know what to do with they corn-meal after they have get it she do evidently and the boy all say so except dick lee he could do full justice to he breakfast indeed but he be say to himself all the while -- i win ` er ' f i 'll ebber git use to dis yer it be je ' awful di goin ' to de ` cad ` my chapter xxvii a new kind of examination three large trunk and one small one be deliver at mr myer 's front door before that first breakfast be dispose of and miss almira remark of the boy a few minute later -- how strong they be especially mr kinzer do not make a mistake almira say she mother in a undertone i be glad the trunk be up stair but we must not begin by say ` mister ' to they i have get all they first name they must not get it into they head that they be any thing more 'n just so many boy she hurry up stair however and it do not take long to make she new boarder know they place so far as they room be concern that house be largely make up of its one wing on the first floor of which be the dining-room and sitting-room all in one in the second story of it be two bedroom open into each other the first and larger one be assign to dab and ford and the inner one to frank yours be a coop say ford to he friend from indium but ours be big enough you can come in here to study and we 'll fix it up prime the stove 's a queer one guess they burn wood up here mostly of course so long as there be a good wood-lot on the outlying farm that belong to mr hart 's speculation the stove be a little box of a affair with two griddle on top and be quite capable of warm that floor she be put dick away in back somewhere say frank we must look and see what she be do for he the main building of that house be only big enough for a hall a good-sized parlor opening into it on the right a bedroom and large closet back of that and two room overhead but the kitchen and milk-room back which must have be stick on at a later day have only one wide low garret of a room in the space under the roof it be light by a dormer window and it do not contain any stove the floor be bare except in the spot cover by a old rug before the little narrow bed but there be a table and a chair by stand on either of which dick would be able to put he hand upon the unceiled rafter and board of the roof on the whole it be a room well calculate to be as hot as possible in summer and as cold as possible in winter but that would do very well in spring and autumn at all event it be as good as he have be use to at home mr myer herself say that to almira and the answer be -- guess it be and better too dick never dream of make any criticism in fact he young brain be in a whirl of excitement through the dust of which every thing in and about grantley take on a wonderfully rosy color di room he say to he inquire friend when they look in on he how do i like di room it be de be ' room in de house i shall -- study -- hard -- in -- this -- room bully for you say ford but you must not forget there be a stove in we room when cold weather come get you book out here they be i will pile they upon the table stick to it dick say ford but it be about time we set out for dr brandegee 's -- dab have not we better kindle a fire before we go it make I feel chilly to think of it we 'll all be warm enough before he get through with we say dab but the sooner we get there the better maybe there be other boy and we must go in first come on dick not one of they seem to be in a hurry in spite of dab 's prudent suggestion and at the bottom of the stair they be meet by mr myer go for you examination that be right dinner 'll be ready at half-past twelve when school 's open it will be a few minute earlier so you 'll have plenty of time to eat and get back dick as soon as you examination 's over i want you to come right back here so i can finish make my arrangement with you yes ma'am i will return at once you say that tip-top say dab the moment they be on the sidewalk but i can not guess what she mean ham morri make all the bargain for you when he settle for I s ` pose it be all right though course it be i 's get to work out half my board a-doin ' chore je ' wot i 's be use to all my life frank harley have see a great many people consider how young he be and he have do less talk than the rest that morning and more study of he landlady and she daughter the result of it come out now tell you what boy : if i be not mistaken dick lee 'll pay more for he board than we will for ours i do not care say dick bravely it be wuff a good deal to feed a boy like I he mother have tell he so many a time and in that matter glorianna have not be so far from the truth ham morri have indeed make a careful and particular bargain for dick and that he duty about the house should not interfere with he study he have do more for he have insist on buy dick 's text-book for he and have make he promise to write to he about the way thing go at grantley up the street march the four new boy still a little slowly until ford break out into a sudden word of encouragement -- look here boy we be a set of wooden-head i would like to know if we need be afraid of any thing joe and fuz hart could go through well i guess not reply dab let 's push ahead he find himself lead the procession when it go through dr brandegee 's front gate and there be a look of admiration on dick 's face when he see how promptly and courageously captain dab kinzer pull that door-bell this way please say the servant who open the door -- into the library the doctor 'll see you in a minute and we 'll see he mutter ford as they walk in and he add in a whisper to dick -- that be he portrait there over the mantel je ' so say dick come dangerously near smile a ' he name den be oliver cromwell a ' dey dress he up in sheet iron that be the name print under the engraving but the smile have barely time to fade from dick 's face before a door open on the opposite side of the room and the dreaded principal of grantley academy walk in good-morning my young friend glad to see you so early he hand be out towards dick lee as he speak and they all have what ford afterwards call a good square shake of it by the time they recover they tongue and reply to that genial hearty encouraging welcome dick could not have help it if he have try -- and he somehow forget to try -- a broad grin of delight spread all over he face as he look up in that of the doctor the latter himself be smile a good deal as if he could not help it but he do not know the exact reason why every one of those boy look so cheerful just then the think in ford 's mind come within a inch of get out over he tongue dwarf why he be more like a giant how joe and fuz hart do spin it the great man be certainly a good six foot two and all he bodily proportion be correspondingly ample frank harley be the last to be shake hand with and so have time to think -- afraid of he why he be too big to be afraid of we be all right that be the whole truth dr brandegee be too big in mind as well as body for any boy of they size to feel at all uneasy after the first half-minute of look in he calm broad thoughtful face every member of that quartet begin to feel a queer sort of impatience to tell all he know about book the doctor mention the fact that he have that morning receive letter from they parent and friend announce they arrival but the oddity of it be that he seem to know at sight the right name for each boy and the right boy for each name he might have guess at dick think ford but how do he know I perhaps a quarter of a century spend in receive classify and manage young gentleman of all sort have give the man of learn special faculty for he work i shall have to ask you a few question my young friend but i think there will be little difficulty in assign you you place and study be seat please that library be plainly a place where no time be to be waste for in less than a minute more ford foster be suddenly stop in the middle of a passage of easy latin -- that will do give I a free translation ford do so glibly enough but there follow no word of comment favorable or otherwise similar brief glimpse be take of three or four other study and then the doctor suddenly remark to he in french -- you father have write I very fully concern you previous study you be well prepared but you have plenty of hard work before you ford fairly strained he best french in the reply he make and the doctor observe -- i see constant practice i wish more parent would be as wise -- mr harley i have not be inform that you speak french you notice mr foster 's mistake please correct it for he frank blushed to he eye but he obey and he hardly know how it be that before the doctor 's rapid question be over he answer have include the whole range of he schooling and acquirement be not dey doin ' fine be the proud thought in the mind of dick lee but je ' wait till he git hol ' ob cap'n dab dick 's confidence in he friend be at least ten time greater than dabney 's in himself the very air of the room he be in seem to the latter to grow oppressively heavy with learn and he dread he own turn more than ever while he be wait for it to come however some casual reference to long island by the doctor and a question as to the precise character of its southern coast rapidly expand into a wider range of geography upon the heel of which history tread a little carelessly and other subject come tumble in until dabney discover that he be compute at the doctor 's request sundry arithmetical result which might with greater propriety have be reserve for he examination that too be the way poor dick lee come to make so bad a breakdown he shine face would have tell even to eye less practiced than those of dr brandegee exactly the answer as to kind and readiness which he would have make to every question put to he white friend that be unless he have be directly call upon to answer out aloud there be no tell what he would have do in such a case as that the doctor find out for he quietly shift he last question over dab 's left shoulder and let it fall upon dick in such a way as not to scare he you be get I dis time dat 's de berry place whar we stop at de end of we school las ' year then i think i know about where it be best for you to begin i 'll have another talk with you about it richard you must come up and see I again it be not a great deal to say but the way in which he say it plainly add -- i mean to be you friend my dear boy i 'll do all i can to help you along dick understand it too but he be feel dolefully about he tongue just then miss fire de fust time he say to himself but he carefully reply aloud -- thank you sir will you tell I when to come to-night right away after tea now young gentleman i must bid you good-morning bear in mind that the first law of grantley academy be punctuality i expect you to be in you place promptly at nine o'clock Monday morning we will sir say dabney but will you please tell we when we be to be examine i believe mr kinzer i have a fair idea of the use you have make of you book up to this time no further examination will be necessary i will see you all with other after school be open next Monday they be politely show out of the library but they do not clearly comprehend the matter until they have draw each a good long breath in the open air dab say ford can not you see it i be begin to seem to I we have be through the sharpest examination i ever hear of i say frank do you know any thing he do not make you tell he nothing but hindustanee and a little teloogoo well yes i know a karen hymn he get all the rest if i be not mistaken there be no doubt at all but what dr brandegee have gain a correct view of the attainment of he new pupil chapter xxviii a unusual amount of introduction the front door of dr brandegee 's library have hardly close behind that earliest flock of he autumn bird before the door by which he have enter swing open and a fine-looking middle-aged matron stand in it remark -- my dear there be more than a dozen wait in the parlor have you not spend a great deal of time on those four they be worth it mary there be enough in every one of they to make a man of and they have all start fairly well i fear that be more than you will be able to say of all these other of course it will they father and mother have have a great deal to do with that they be all examine however in due season some in one way and some in another and during all that time dab kinzer and he friend be inwardly wonder whether they say so or not precisely what impression they have make upon the doctor it be just as well every way that they do not know it be a curious fact that with one accord they accompany dick on he return to they boarding-house and while he disappear through the door at the end of the hall with miss almira some invisible leading-string drag they up stair not that they really have any study to do but it be dinner-time before they have finish turn over the leaf of they text-book and estimate the amount of hard work it would cost to prepare for a examination on they there be no good reason for complaint of that dinner any more than of they breakfast and it wind up with a very excellent indian-meal pudding concern which dabney go so far as to say he would like to send the recipe home to he mother i be so glad you like it say mr myer almira just remember that they can have it as often as they please she ask they too how they propose to spend they afternoon and smilingly explain as to dick lee that -- Saturday be one of my busy day and he will have to stay at home and help errand to run and i want he to learn how he be a bright active little fellow that be all accord to contract but dick do not come in for he dinner until the rest have eat theirs and then he barely have time to say to dab kinzer -- do you ebber shell corn course i have why 'cause dar 's a bigger heap ob corn out in de barn dan you ebber see bigger 'n ham 's well no not so big as he 'n mebbe but dar 's more ob it i 's get it to shell dab go off with the other two vaguely begin to ask himself if shell corn come fairly into the proper meaning of the word chore all that sort of thing be quickly forget however for there be a dozen group of boy scatter here and there over the broad expanse of the green and ford foster at once exclaim -- boy let 's examine that crowd it 'll take all the afternoon to find what they know get acquaint be apt to be a slow process in case of that sort unless it be take hold of with vigor and ford be the very fellow to hurry it up before the afternoon be over every boy on that green know who he be and where he come from and a good share of they have try they hand at chaff he and he friend of these latter it may safely be say that not a single one could afterwards remember that he have seem to himself to get the best of it first day at school be pretty safe to be a peace-day also and none of the wordy collision go too far although it be plain that the new-comer have not yet attain any high degree of popularity after supper dick lee set off for dr brandegee 's and he friend attend he nearly to the gate they would have be glad to have have a report of he visit from he on he return but he have he chore to do then and any amount of careful instruction concern they to receive from mr myer and almira the other three be more thoroughly tire out than they have at all expect and be all quite ready to agree with frank harley -- we would better get to bed boy i want to see if this be a good house to sleep in sleep say ford i could go to sleep in a omnibus early to bed mean early to rise necessarily and they be all up and dress the next morning when dick lee slip in on they before they have time to ask he a question he exclaim -- i say cap'n dab be you goin ' to church di mornin ' of course we be all go so i heerd mrs myer tell miss almiry she be goin ' to take you along wid she when she go richard say ford be you go hab not heerd a word about dat do not you go back on you friend richard be all ready in time sure 's you live and go with we or i 'll complain to dr brandegee dick 's grin be a wide one but he respond -- i 'll be ready see ' f i be not the voice of almira call he name at the foot of the stair prevent any further conversation just then and dick find afterwards that he have undertake a task of some difficulty he hardly know when or where he squeeze out the time for the proper polishing of he shoe or the due arrangement of he magnificent red necktie but both feat be accomplish most faithfully the subject of church-going come up again incidentally at the breakfast-table and the remark of she young boarder meet the emphatic approval of mr myer and she daughter perhaps because neither of they have be near enough after dick dodge out of they room at the end of he early call to hear dabney kinzer remark -- ford do not you think we can find we way across the green without any help from the lady i be ponder that matter what do you say frank we must get out of it if we can politely i do not just see how we 'll do it do it why we 'll all wait for dick lee mr myer take a little too much for grant and when the hour come for start there come a slight disturbance in the smooth current of she calculation mr foster she call out in she best voice from half way up the stair the first bell be ring be you and you friend ready ring respond ford so it be i regret to say we be not yet ready to go at the same moment dab be whisper -- we must not start until it be nearly do toll what be that ask frank do not you know it be always so in the country first they ring the bell as it be ring now that be to set people a-going then they toll it you 'll hear in a few minute that mean the time 's up ford foster 's city training have not teach he as much as that but he be glad to know it mr myer once more urge upon they the necessity of make haste it will not do to be late she say i never allow myself to be a minute behind time the last clause sound a very very little impatient but ford once more politely express he sorrow and abstain from put on he coat at that moment too dick lee come tiptoe in from he cheerless garret and look astonishingly spruce the shine on he shoe be a brilliancy to be remembered and so be the shine on he face and the sunset glow of he necktie sh dick say dab hold still a minute the bell 's begin to toll i fear almira and i will be compel to start say mr myer regretfully perhaps you can overtake we if you hurry perhaps we could reply ford but i beg you will not let yourself be late on we account we be come he begin to put he coat on as she and almira go through the gate in such a village as that no one be afraid to leave a house alone for a hour or two not only be the door-lock on the latch as usual but dick lee have be vaguely expect to stay at home there again mr myer have take too much for grant and she have not say a word to he about it just as she hear the bell give its last few rapid and warn stroke and disappear through the church-door she might have see have she turn back and look once more towards she own front gate four well-dressed youngster hurry from it across the street as if a great deal depend on they reach church before service could begin it be very kind of mr myer to invite we remark ford but she never think how bashful we would be about it they be quickly within the ample porch of the roomy and not at all overcrowded edifice and be greet by two or three benevolent-looking elderly gentleman with a degree of prompt cordiality which leave little to be ask for the deacon be awake to they duty relate to new scholar -- student they call they and every attention be pay these four who have begin so well they first Sunday so it would be at every church on that green and it would really be about the middle of the term before stray academy boy would be leave to find they own way to well-whittled bench in the gallery one of the best pew in the house well forward in the middle aisle and they have it all to themselves there be not another pew in church that morning which seem to attract so large a share of the attention of the congregation mr myer and almira be several pew behind and on the other side of the house and there have be no opportunity to capture she four boarder or any of they while they be march in almira if they have not bring dick with they yes mother but how very well they look mr kinzer be really quite handsome that be hardly dab 's opinion of himself and nobody have ever take pain to tell he so but the four of they stand up together and all singing make quite a picture dick lee be between dab kinzer and frank harley and seem to feel in honor bind to sing he best that be very well too if glorianna could but have have a look at she boy that morning there be no such thing as tell how proud she would have feel about he it be too bad she could not have do so especially as dick be most loyally think of she and wish that she could there be no fault to be find by mr myer or anybody else with the strict decorum of she boarder and they profound attention to the service and sermon but she feel that she have a duty to perform and she only wait the proper time for its performance the last hymn have be duly sing and the boy be drift along with the tide in the aisle towards the door when dabney nudge ford with he elbow we be nab ford no escape this time that be a fact do not let 's try she mean it all for politeness they would have be quite willing to have be allow to get out and go home unnoticed but there in the porch await they be mr myer and almira and there be no possibility of a escape it would have be unkind to try in the face of so much smile besides they do board with she and she have she rights of property one of which be to show they off and introduce they she proceed to exercise it at once and it be to the credit of the three white boy that they come promptly to she assistance and add any little matter she might happen to miss in the hurry of the moment deacon short this be mr dabney kinzer of long island this be mr frank harley of rangoon son of rev dr harley we well-known missionary this be mr ford foster son of the eminent new-york lawyer delighted -- begin the deacon rapidly grasp and shake hand after hand with a peculiar lift of he elbow that place most of what might be call the action at the point of it but ford be think of the thing mr myer have omit and he promptly add -- glad to meet you deacon short and this be my friend mr richard lee of long island to do the good deacon justice he grasp of dick 's hand be every bit as cordial as any other of he grasp and he beam on the smile black boy in a way that give he back after the manner of a reflection a great glow of the best and broadest beam mr myer do not stop a moment in the repetition of she formulum and there be sharp work before she but dab 's tongue be also loose now and elder potter have hardly time to hear who he be before deacon short have to let go of dick and hear dab say -- how d'ye do elder potter and this be my near neighbor and friend mr richard lee mr sunderland begin mr myer to a lady whose face and dress declare she a social magnate my new boarder mr frank harley : and the rest of she introduction speech follow and stately mr sunderland have just time to utter a few word of gracious inquiry about the precious health of frank 's father and mother when he too take up the omission and dick lee 's introduction step into the place of any other answer for a moment it be a good thing for dick as mr sunderland be a member of a society for promote emigration to liberium and be seize at once with a dim idea that a part of she mission be stand before she in very brilliant shoe and a new red necktie she do not know how utterly she and the other good people and those three boy be demolish a curious vision of almira 's and she mother 's of some social advantage they might derive thenceforward from have a color servant in they employ dick 's own chance be come right down upon he a little before he be quite ready for it for the minister and he wife come out a few moment later and mr sunderland take upon herself the duty of present richard lee to they very much if as she would have say -- my dear mr fallow -- my dear mrs fallow -- see what i have find be he not remarkable the word she really utter be somewhat more formal but the good quiet-looking little minister and very quiet-looking little wife be still shake hand with dick that be with he right hand when he turn almost eagerly and catch hold of dab kinzer with he left yes sir a ' dis be cap'n dab -- i mean this be my friend mr dabney kinzer of long island -- de be ' -- how do you do mr kinzer glad to make you acquaintance say mr fallow and dick 's success be complete except that he be say to himself -- i jes ' can not trus ' my tongue wid de oder boy dey 's get to take dar chance now mr kinzer say miss almira at that moment it be time we be go home yes frank say she mother patronizingly i think we have better be go if such a exercise as introduction could earn it they be both entitle to good appetite and after all it have be quite a nice little affair dabney be quite as tall as miss almira but as they walk across the green side by side he could not avoid a side-glance that give he a very clear idea of the difference between he present company and annie foster it be at that very moment that it occur to frank that he have last walk home from church under the protect wing of the portly and matronly mr kinzer and he could but draw some kind of a comparison between she and mr myer they be both widow he think but there be not any other resemblance ford and dick bring up the rear and for some reason or there may have be more than one they be both in capital good spirit tell you wot exclaimed dick : if goin ' to de ` cad ` my be all like dis yer -- i be very glad indeed that i ever come oh you be all right say ford but there be more good people in this village than i would any idea of i be glad we come to church dick say mr myer a little sharply when they reach the gate i want some wood and a pail of water you would better hurry up stair and put on you every-day clothes chapter xxix letter home from the boy -- dick lee 's first grief there be a large number of new scholar assemble in the great room of grantley academy on the first Monday morning of that fall term there be also many who have be there before but the new-comer be in the majority there be boy from the village boy from the surrounding country and boy from even farther away than the southern shore of long island and they be of many kind and age the youngest may have be under twelve and entitle to ride in a street-car at half-price and several of the very older one have already cast they first vote as grown-up man count they all and add those who be to make they appearance during the week they make a little army of nearly two hundred there be also a young lady ' department with about a hundred pupil and there be quite as great a variety among they as among they young gentleman fellow-student the class-room assign to the lady teacher and they several grade of learner be all on the northern side of the academy building there be a large wing there that belong to they and they only meet the boy face to face in the great room during morning exercise even those of they who live or board in the southern half of the village find they way across the green come and go under the shade of the most northerly row of tree as to the great room itself there have be much trouble about the name of it dr brandegee call it the lecture-room and he do a great deal towards make it so there be those who try to say chapel when they speak of it but so many other refuse to know what place they be speak of that they have to give it up hall would not fit because it be square and the boy generally reject the doctor 's name because of unpleasant-ideas connect with the word lecture so it come to be the great room and no more and a great thing it be for dick lee to find himself sit on one of the front seat of it with he friend all in line at he right wait they turn with he to be classify and send about they business dr brandegee make wonderfully rapid work of it and he several assistant seem to know exactly what to do the fact be say ford the first chance he have to speak to dab i have be study that man he be teach school before guess he know how too and i be not afraid about dick lee now i have see the rest he can go right ahead of some of they they 'll bounce he if he do tell you what dab if you and i want to be popular here we would better wear we old clothes every day but Sunday and miss about half the question that come to we dick will not be sharp enough for that he say he be go to write a letter home tonight make he turn pale too those first letter home ford 's be a matter of course and frank harley have have some practice already but dab kinzer have never try such a thing before and dick lee would not come to anybody else for instruction neither would he permit anybody not even captain dab to see he letter after it be write i 's be mighty partikler ` bout de pronounciation he say to himself specially in wot i write to mr morri but i would like to see dem all read dem letter guess dar 'll be a high time at we house it would be a long while before frank harley 's epistle would reach the eye that be anxiously wait for it but there be indeed high time in those three house on the long-island shore old bill lee be oblige to trust largely to the greater learning of he wife but he chuckle over every word he manage to pick out as if he have pull in a twenty-pound bluefish and the signature at the bottom affect he somewhat as if he have capture a small whale sho de boy say glorianna he be doin ' fust-rate dar be not anoder young gen ` lman at dat ar ' ` cad ` my je ' like he onless it be young mr kinzer i have not a word to say ` gin he or mr foster or dat ar ' young mish ` nayry glorianna say bill doubtfully do you s ` pose dick do all dat writin ' he own self sho course he do do not i know he hand-writin ' be not he my own bless boy guess he do and i 's goin ' ober to show it to mr kinzer it 'll do she good to hear from de ` cad ` my so it do for dick 's letter to he mother like the shorter one he send to ham morri be largely make up of complimentary remark concern dabney kinzer when glorianna knock at the kitchen door of the morris mansion however it be open by the help and she might have lose she errand if mr kinzer have not happen to hear she voice it be just possible it be pitch somewhat higher than usual that morning glorianna be that you come right in we have some letter from the boy something in they about dick that you 'll be glad to hear sho de boy course dey all have to say somet ` ing ` bout he i 's je ' like to know wot ` tis dough in she go but more than the kinzer family be gather in the sitting-room mr foster and annie have bring jenny walter with they and ham be there and all the rest and they all sit still as mouse while glorianna listen to dab 's account and ford 's of the journey to grantley and the arrival and the examination and they boarding-house there be not a word of complaint anywhere and it do seem as if ham morri be right when he say -- we have hit it this time mr foster i think i ought to write to mr hart and thank he for he recommendation just as you please hamilton say mr kinzer but this be they very first week you know guess dey will not fool dick much anyhow say the radiant glorianna but wot 's dat ` bout de corn-shellin ' that be all right say ham shell corn will not hurt he glad there be plenty of it mother kinzer you and miranda must try that recipe dab send for the new pudding new pudding indeed why she do not put in half egg enough but i be glad she be a good cook we 'll have that pudding for dinner this very day so will we say mr foster miss kinzer say dick 's mother je ' will not you show I how to make dat puddin ' i 's like to know je ' wot dey eat at de ` cad ` my it be a great comfort to know that the boy be so well satisfied but there be she usual good sense in mr kinzer 's suggestion about its be the very first week there be never any more such letter as first letter nor any other week like the first the fact that there be so many boy together all old acquaintance shut out any such thing as loneliness and it be not time to be homesick all that week be really spend in get settle and there do not seem to be more than a day or so of it Saturday come around again somewhere in the place commonly take by Wednesday and surprise they all they have all be busy enough but dick lee have never in all he life find so little spare time on he hand it be no use cap'n dab he remark on Friday : we can not eat up all de corn i have shell not if we have johnnycake from now till nex ' summer dab be look a little thoughtful at that moment ford he say slowly have she miss a day yet a corn day no or a meal no i say i would cut a notch on my slate first time she do and it be all smooth yet he hold it up as he speak and frank remark -- yes smooth enough on that side but you have nick it all down on the other end to end what be that for that oh that be quite another thing i be keep tally of joe and fuz every time one of 'em ask a question about we boarding-house or mr myer or almira or ' little dr brandegee i nick it down get to quit pretty soon or buy another slate they have kind o ' keep away from we say dab they be in only one of my class but they be in three of yours be not in any ob mine say dick but dr brandegee say he 'll promote I soon dick 's tongue always begin to work better the moment he mention the academy-principal i do not mind they keep away from we say frank nor i say ford at that moment they reach they own gate and dick dart forward in response to a imaginary call from mr myer ford go on -- they can keep away all they please but they will not do it long they be bind on mischief of some kind to we ask frank well yes but it 'll light on richard lee first he will not say a word to we about it but they have bother he i 'll ask he say dab in whose face a flush be rise they must let dick alone they will not then and there be plenty of other just like 'em they be get together in a kind of a flock these last two or three day some of 'em be pretty big one boy exclaim frank how about we boxing lesson guess we have not forget 'em all in one week say ford i be think about to-morrow so be they all and they hold a council-of-war about it in they own room before supper the result be that by a unanimous vote that Saturday be to be devote to the catch of fish rather than to play ball or any thing else that would bring they into immediate contact with joe and fuz they have all bring they fishing-tackle with they as a matter of course plenty of worm for bait be to be dig in the garden and dab kinzer have learn by careful inquiry that both bait and tackle could be use to good purpose in the water of green pond and sundry other small bit of lake mile and mile away among the hill to the north of grantley we 'll have a grand time he say and it 'll do we all good no crab though wonder if those fresh-water fish bite like ours down in the bay some do and some do not say ford i have catch 'em it do not occur to he now however that he could probably teach dab and they all obey the supper-bell there be three kind of corn-cake on the table but the boy be think of something more important and dab hardly receive he first cup of tea before he remark -- we be all go a-fishing to-morrow mr myer but we may get home in time for supper can you spare dick what on Saturday the very day i need he most three load of wood 'll be over from the farm to-night dick have be in the kitchen and have advance as far as the door while dab be speak wood he mutter to himself guess i know wot dat mean t ` ree load ob wood a ' no fishin ' it be je ' awful now mr myer say ford if you know what a fisherman dick be he might bring you home a load of they i be sorry say mr myer with more of firmness and less of smile than they have ever see on she face before i have no objection to the rest of you go you may do as you please about that but i must keep richard at he work i be particularly well pleased to learn that you have no objection to we go remark ford with extreme politeness and dabney add -- it do I good too we 'll take dick with we some other time mr myer if you will have breakfast pretty early i 'll be much oblige to you even almira have never see dabney look quite so tall as he do at that moment chapter xxx dabney kinzer try fresh-water fishing for the first time conversation do not flourish at the supper-table that Friday evening there be a puzzle look on the face of mr myer and she daughter and they three boarder seem to be run a kind of race with each other as to which of they should make out to be the most carefully polite as for poor dick lee out there in the kitchen the nearest he come to break the silence be in a sort of smother groan and a half-uttered determination to git up good and early a ' dig dem feller de be ' worm dey be in de gardin there be talk enough in the room up stair in the course of the evening but the door be close and there be no chance for any one in the passage outside no matter how silently he or she might go by to hear a distinct word of it you see boy say ford foster at the end of some extended remark i be not at all mean or exact my father only pay mr myer three dollar a week and all she agree to give be board i can not expect she to be any kind of a aunt too and let I go a-fishing i 'll take it all off she hand and let myself go it be hard on dick though say dab and she be kind o ' get the right of it i s ` pose she have but if he be not earn all he get i be mistaken boy if she put any more work on he what 'll we do eat say dab : that be the only way we can make it up we can not do it dab not unless the price of corn-meal go up think of eat another three dollar ' worth of hasty-pudding every week they landlady come out in all she smile at breakfast and hope they would have good success with they fishing only she add i be not very fond of fish and i never take the trouble to clean they we will try and catch ours ready clean mr myer say ford now boy if you be ready i be they be ready bait and all thanks to dick and the breakfast have be a early one dab thank mr myer for that even while he wish he have ford foster 's tongue to do it with in fact he have be notice of late that he idea come to he a little slowly not but what he have plenty of they but they seem disposed to crowd one another so that whenever there be any thing to be say in a hurry ford be sure to get ahead of he and sometimes even quiet frank harley must be i be grow somehow he say to himself or i would not be so awkward the north road from grantley lead through a region that be as the old farmer say of it a-goin ' back and be less thickly people than it have be two or three generation before there have once be pretty well cultivate farm all around some of the little lake that be now border by stout growth of forest and the road among the hill wear a neglect look many of they as if it have cease to profit anybody to keep they in order there be come and go over they nevertheless and the boy manage to get a lift of nearly five mile in a farmer 's wagon so that they reach the vicinity of green pond sooner than they have expect and with much less fatigue the same farmer in response to anxious question by dab inform he -- fish wall ye-e nobody do not ketch 'em much nowadays time be when they be pretty much all fish out but i heerd there be some feller turn in a heap of seedlin ' fish three or four year ago right away arter that my boy go over and put in three day a hand runnin ' but they do not get nothin ' but pumpkin-seeds plenty of they yit i s ` pose that be encouraging but ford at once remark -- pumpkin-seed a fine-looking fish be they not i know they somewhat depress and extend laterally guesso you be ` tendin ' school at the ` cadummy be not ye yes we be there think so ye-es we-ell it be a good thing for the ` cadummy hope you 'll ketch some o ' they seedlin ' fish ef ye do you kin jest stuff 'em with big word and bake 'em they do say as how fish be good for the brain do not we turn off somewhere along here ask dabney ye-e green pond 's right down there through the wood not more 'n a mile see ' t ye do not lose yer way what bait have ye get bait angle-worm be they the right thing worm ye-e they 'll do somebody tell ye do they ` two not take ye long to larn how to put 'em on there be not a great deal to be make out of that old new-england farmer and he good-natured contempt for a lot of ignorant young city feller in good clothes do not require any further expression they leave he with a wide grin on he wrinkled face and follow he direction over the nearest fence but with idea concern they probable string of fish that be rather depressed than extend it be a long mile but it do not contain any danger of get lose and at the end of it they have quite enough of a surprise to pay they for they trouble why ford it be a beauty dab do you s ` pose as nice a pond as that have not any thing in it but pumpkin-seed no boat that i can see remark frank we 'll fish from the shore say dab there be a log that run away out in rock too rock and tree and natural ruggedness all around and some ten or a dozen acre of clear cold beautiful water with little brook and spring run into it and a brook run out on the opposite shore that would have to grow considerably before it would be fit for mill-turning boy say dabney we have miss it how 's that ask ford put on the smallest hook you have get right away and try for minnow there must be pickerel and bass here bass of course do not he say something about seed-fish that be what they put in and they be not as big as pin when he boy come for 'em minnow-pole as they call they could be cut from the bush at the margin and little fish could be take at the same time that they be try for large one they find too before long that sometimes a very respectable perch or bass would stoop to nibble at one of the elegant worm with which dick lee have provide they no turn of the tide to wait for here dab say ford and no crab to steal you bait off hey there come one perch first game for my hook we 'll stay till dark but we 'll get a good string frank you cork 's under never fish with one before say frank i 'll soon get the hang of it that be a capital school for it at all event and they learn that it might be a good thing for a little lake like that to have a bad reputation fish out year ago i understand now say dab understand what why those fellow in the village that send I out here be play a joke on we -- a good deal like one of joe and fuz hart 's best kind of a joke but if we tell about it when we get home the whole village 'll be over here next week then we will not tell hurrah i 'll get he in steady now if he be not a two-pounder see he run boy this be go to be fun they do not neglect they minnow-catching and before a great while they be vary they bait very much to they advantage how they do wish for a boat so they could try the deeper water they work they way along from point to point look for the best spot if such there be and dabney at last find himself quite a distance ahead of he companion boy ford frank a boat come on lie behind the trunk of a tree that have fall into the water -- not much of a boat to be sure and without any oar or even rowlock but when the water be tip out of it and it be shove in again it actually float careful ford say dab remember dick lee the old thing may come to piece it be not make yesterday look 's as if christopher columbus own it and forget just where he leave it we can paddle with piece of bark as far out as we need go now the fun be double and some of the pickerel they pull in remind dabney of small blue-fish while the bass and perch be every way as respectable as ordinary porgy and black-fish except for size he have even to confess that the sea itself contain a great many small fish and that he have often have much poorer luck in he own beloved bay the boat be a great acquisition but when they be paddle ashore for the fourth time to turn she over and let the water out dabney remark -- it be after dinner-time boy could either of you fellow eat any thing eat say frank i would forget that yes let 's have lunch but there be more cold johnny-cake than any thing else in the basket there be plenty of salt and pepper though and it will not take any time at all to make a fire and broil some fish do not you ever go on a chowder-party and do you own cooking no i never do nor i say ford very reluctantly can we do it do it i 'll show you no kettle we 'll have to broil you fellow make a fire while i clean some of these fish it be every bit as good fun as catch those fish to cook they there on the shore of that lovely little lake dabney do know all about it as become a ` longshore boy and he take a particular pride in show ford and frank how many different way there be of cook a fish without a oven or a kettle or a gridiron it be another fine point to discover after they have eat all they could include the cold johnny-cake that they do not seem to have make they string of fish look perceptibly smaller tell you what boy say dabney : next time we come out we 'll bring a hammer and nail and some oakum and i 'll calk up that old punt so she 'll float well enough only it will not do to dance in she then say ford i move we do not try she again to-day if we have get to carry all these fish it 'll be a long pull home we be not half sure of catch another ride we can pole we fish though and make it easy carry how 's that i 'll show you cut two pole hang you string half way shoulder the pole and take turn carry one boy get rest all the while and no cord cut you hand that be as sensible as if he own mother have tell he and it be a good thing he think of it for they do not catch a ride till they be half way home all the wagon be come the other way of course on Saturday afternoon but the one chat then catch up with they have be carry a new stove home and be return empty fine string of fish remark the stove-man as they clamber in where would you catch 'em over in one of the lake do ye though you do not say guess i know the place you must have have a all-killin ' walk though i declare i be goin ' to try that pond first day i get away want some of these would not rob ye -- but you have get a-plenty -- that pickerel thank ye now oh -- and the bass tew you be good feller he seem to be another and dab warn he at parting that when he want to get a string of fish if he would come to he he would tell he just where to go all right glad i have the luck to ketch up with ye dab say ford as they reach the outskirts of grantley i know it be late but we must walk through the village with these fish if it be only to have the whole town ask we where we catch they that be so i be rest now too let 's get right out they be nearly at the southerly end of the village

be a unwise boy that afternoon he know how to turn he hand to a great many thing thanks to he home-training and a woodpile be one of the matter he have learn how to deal with but he have not take hold of that of mr myer with any heart for he work it be simply impossible for he to imagine that he be pull in fish or have any other kind of fun while he be saw wood or even while splitting it there be however something almost vicious in the way he come down with he axe upon some of the more obstinate piece he will be a very useful boy remark mr myer as she watch he from the window but i fear i shall have some difficulty with the other they be very much inclined to be uppish dick toil faithfully and he feel it as a kind of relief late in the day to be send to the grocery-store at the lower end of the village with a basket that be to bring home the usual Saturday assortment for mr myer he do well enough in go but on he way home if the truth must be tell dick lee loiter dreadfully it be so nice a day and he have be so long at he woodpile and he have have so little time to call he own that week over on the green the boy of the village be play a sort of match-game of base-ball with a pick nine from the academy and there seem no reason why dick and he basket should not stroll along inside the barrier-fence of the green and see they play it that be where he unwisdom show itself for among the boy who be not play be joe and fuz hart and all they crowd and this be the first time they have see dick on the green all alone that would have be quite enough of itself consider how black he be and that he be a new boy at the academy but the additional fact that he have he basket on he arm open the way to trouble for he all the sooner he be stand still on the walk near the fence gaze at the batting and catch with so deep a interest that he mouth would stay open when he suddenly find himself surround hullo dick what you get in you basket grocery grocery fresh from afriky let 's see 'em je ' you keep off now give we that basket do not you tech a thing what you get midnight none ob youah business i 's ` tendin ' to mine put dat back now will you dick have promptly retreat against the fence in he surprise and vexation and be defend himself and he cargo vigorously but he be sadly outnumber they be a cowardly lot : for they all but helpless victim have even receive several sharp blow in return for he grasp and push and the matter threaten to end unpleasantly for he when suddenly joe hart feel he foot jerk from under he down he go and over go fuz on top of he and then there be four or five boy all in a heap with dick 's basket upset just beyond they and dick himself diving hither and thither after its late contents and exclaim -- cap'n dab 's come i 's all right now je ' let I pick up some ob dese t ` ing there be a resentful ring in the last remark as if he be think of something like war after the recovery of he grocery but it be indeed the voice of dab kinzer shout full and clear -- pick 'em up dick we be just in time a boy somewhat larger than the rest a good half-head taller than dabney but with a somewhat pasty and unhealthy complexion have select ford foster as the shortest of the new arrival and demand -- what be you meddle for just as he aim a clumsy blow at he head that blow do not hit ford but a shorter young ruffian have also pick he out perhaps for the same reason and the hit he aim reach its mark for ford have no extra pair of arm behind to box with frank harley seem just then to be remarkably busy with the heap of boy on the ground spat -- that be the way something sound and dab kinzer add -- go for that fellow on the grass ford : i 'll take care of the long one you will -- will you spit -- spat -- spat oh i see : you do not know how to box weak in the arm too better go home the tall boy be step backwards quite rapidly with one hand on he nose and the other swing wildly in the air above he and ford be keep the fellow on the grass from get up when all the noise around they suddenly cease dr brandegee where where come across the green at the upper end he be come this way several of the late assailant start on a run at once but dab kinzer have catch a sharp whisper from frank harley and he shout -- no you will not joe hart hold on fuz that other chap must stay too give dick back he grocery dey 's hook a pile ob 'em say dick he eye dance with triumph je ' make 'em hand ober do you mean to say we have be steal fiercely demand joe what I I steal almost gasp fuz they would not do such a thing as that say ford not quite comprehend the situation that be it say dab : let 'em empty they pocket -- joe be indignantly turn inside out the side pocket of he neat cut-away and a small brown-paper-covered parcel drop upon the ground dem 's de cloves shout dick as he dart forward and pick it up the finger of fuz almost unconsciously imitate those of he elder brother and with a like result dat 's de cinnamon if de oder feller do not git de tea a ' de sal ` ratus whar 's de nutmegs these too be forthcoming as well as a paper of indigo blue for the next Monday 's wash and other item which testify strongly as to how much at a time mr myer be in the habit of buy it be all over in less than half a minute but dick 's assailant look very much as if they want to sink right down through the grass go home joseph say ford go home foster i 'll write to you father that you be out of these thing at you boarding-house we _ buy _ all we grocery where we live i never touch a thing roar joe somebody put 'em in my pocket do not say any thing more joseph say ford calmly if you do not get enough to eat come over to we house : we will not let you starve give you all the bluing you want too they do not seem to need any just then and there be such a crowd of boy gather that they be glad to take ford 's advice and hurry away even then a good deal more attention might have be pay they all around but for the excitement create in the mind of every boy who look at the great string of fish dab and he friend have drop when they go in to the rescue of dick lee question as to where they be catch and how pour upon the young fisherman so fast that it be not easy to dodge they all at once or prevent a general stampede of the academy boy to green pond they would use up the boat in one day and all the fish in the next say dab to frank but where would you learn to do what you do for fuz and joe sleight-of-hand oh one of father 's hindu convert have be a juggler he teach I they be the best in the world but father do not like I to do much of it we can have some fun with it yet though it come to I like a flash when i see those thing on the ground serve 'em right spoil 'em on the ground be next thing to steal come on boy say ford it be after five o'clock they be all glad to escape from the crowd especially dick lee and it be not until they be across the street that the tall form of dr brandegee come slowly down past the ball-player he seem particularly interested in that game it be currently report indeed that he have be a first-class athlete in he younger day and that he take a quiet half-hour in the morning with he dumb-bell now before do any thing at all with he greek and latin the short-stop be a well-built sunburned student of at least twenty and the doctor notice how neatly he have be do he work wish i could catch a equation as well as i can a ball say the young fellow color a little perhaps at the memory of something in mathematics which have get by he you will i think by the way do not i see what look like a disturbance down here among the boy just now disturbance well yes i should say there be come near interrupt the game any thing serious well it might have be some of the boy make a set on that little colored chap mean thing to do i would ha ' stop it myself but that kinzer boy and the other two that board with mr myer they clear it all up in no time no fighting i hope well no but i tell you what doctor the rest of the boy 'll let that nigger alone he friend can box ah yes i understand they stand by he would not see he impose upon they just would not they be prime little chap the other boy be bigger 'n they be i would ha ' help 'em but they do not need any help no yes -- i see it will not do to have any fighting but then h be they stand right by he good-afternoon mr pulsifer good-afternoon dr brandegee there if he have not make I lose a hit i would ha ' fetch it but i be glad i have a chance to set he right about that scrimmage i think those three chap be kind o ' stick up but everybody 'll know where to place 'em now there be nothing like anger or even disapproval on dr brandegee 's face when he walk away but he be mutter -- know how to box do they i think i see something like it they be a fine lot of young fellow i must keep my eye on they they 'll be man one of these day they be only boy yet however and they be hardly arrive in front of the kitchen-door before they begin to make the propose division of the fish mr myer come to meet dick and receive a account of he errand you have be go twice as long -- i declare almira come here and see these fish you have have wonderful luck i must say more 'n we 'll know what to do with i will attend to the cleaning of they begin dabney but dick interrupt he with -- guess not cap'n dab i 's clean load ob fish will not be no time at all puttin ' t ` rough je ' a string or two dick will clean they say mr myer but it be too late to cook any for supper she turn away into the house as she speak and take almira with she now boy say dabney we have just time before supper to go with these other string and get back they would have be late indeed if they have stop to talk with every one who want to admire dab 's big pickerel and ford 's remarkable bass but a little good management bring they to dr brandegee 's in not much more than five time the number of minute need to walk the distance the fish be hand to the door-opener with -- the compliment of mr harley mr kinzer and mr foster and a great flourish of a bow from the latter which could hardly be make to keep that string company till the doctor should see it now for the minister 's the good man himself reply to the ring at he door-bell but dabney be half sorry he have consent to be spokesman this time my young friend say mr fallow inquiringly fish sir say dab some we catch to-day over in green pond we think we would bring you a mess of 'em he think too without say it -- now i have make a mess of it why do not i let ford do it thank you thank you my young friend very kind and thoughtful will not you walk in no sir thank you it be most supper-time we must hurry back mary come and see these fish some very fine one go indeed see you in church last Sunday hope i 'll see you there again to morrow good-afternoon my dear young friend good-afternoon sir they walk away a little rapidly but with a vivid and decidedly pleasant impression that they have give the pale-faced earnest-eyed minister a extraordinary amount of comfort the fish be not worth much say ford it could not have be just they no indeed it be not and they fail to make it out to they satisfaction but it might have help they if they have see he hand the fish to mary and say -- there what do you think of that the very boy i tell you of the one you see on the green fighting exactly i must see dr brandegee they can not be altogether bad bad no there must be something about it the doctor always know he will be able to explain it i know great be the confidence of the grantley people in dr brandegee as to any and all thing relate to he boy and that of mr fallow be none the less when she husband return from he evening call defend that color boy you do not say the dear brave little fellow fight be dreadful do any of they get hurt hurt dear no and they give those young ruffian -- h be well -- david have to do a great deal of fight mary but we must not approve too -- my dear i say they do right and the little woman 's tired face flush into sudden beauty with she honest enthusiasm over those boy they have not reach the end of they day 's experience however when they leave the minister 's gate or even when they arrive at they own at that very moment mr myer be once more standing in the kitchen doorway dick as soon as you have have you supper you may take one of those string of fish over to deacon short 's and another to mr sunderland 's you may clean all the rest yes be say dick vaguely but dar 's on ' y one string only one where be all the rest i would like to know dabney and he friend be around the corner of the house now and she last question be plainly direct to they the rest of what mr myer ' why the fish what have you do with they oh they be all right mr myer say ford fish be good for brain that be what we have do with 'em brain what -- exactly next to we three the man that work they brain the hardest around here be mr fallow and my friend dr brandegee and you never ask I a word about it about what inquire dabney i must say i do not quite understand do you mean about what we be to do with we fish of course i do i can not allow -- she hesitate a moment as if the next word be slow in come and dab help she out with -- can not allow what mr myer and ford add -- now mr myer there be nothing healthier than fish it will not hurt either of 'em be supper ready i hope it be say dab i be get hungry again mr myer look at they in amazement and so do miss almira for if one thing be plainer than another it be that neither of those three boy understand the nature of she complaint it do not seem to occur to they that she have or could or would claim any control over the result of they day 's fun not even when she say -- i intend one string for deacon short and another for mr sunderland -- do not work they brain mr myer say ford do not need any fish but then if we have as good luck next time we 'll bear they in mind we have keep enough pan-fish for breakfast and the big one 'll be just the thing for dinner that have be the plan of mr myer herself for she have already say to almira -- it 'll be a real saving and the corn beef 'll be just as good on Monday more talk would hardly improve such a case as that and it be really begin to dawn upon mr myer that she three boy boarder have mind and will of they own moreover that they have not the most distant idea of fail to exercise they on every proper occasion chapter xxxii old friend and neighbor of he come to visit dabney boy remark dab kinzer when they gather in they own room after supper i can not say we have learn a great deal this first week but we have find a tiptop fishing-ground and we have settle the hart boy should not wonder if mr myer feel a good deal more settle than she do too say ford but i be think what frank harley 's go to do with he finger when we can give he a chance we have load of fun ahead or i be mistaken i will not try it on very often say frank fun 's fun that be a fact but i come here to learn something my dear young friend say ford with a sudden imitation of mr fallow think of how much you have learn in seven day dab 's begin to know so much he can not talk i be not just comfortable about dick say dabney oh he 'll come out all right : the corn 's mostly shell and the woodpile can not last forever he do not know how to run a sewing-machine she try make he read aloud to she and almira last night but dick think she will not ask he to do it again do not be trouble about richard : he future be safe part of it undoubtedly and the boy have settle more thing for themselves and he than those they mention they have settle they own position among the boy of the academy and the village old and young for every soul of they have hear about the big fight on the green before he go to bed that night they have secure dick lee 's position for he : not that they have give he a false one but that he would be safe to enjoy almost unmolested whatever position he own conduct might earn for he that be all any boy ought to have black or white they have do much as ford say to settle they own position at they boarding-house but that be nothing of importance compare to the impression they have make upon the large heart and brain of the stately academy principal they have make a firm friend of he and of other whose friendship be worth have all that be a great deal to have accomplish in one short week but there be much more that would require they immediate attention book fish lecture base-ball french pigeon-shooting elocution kite composition nutting and the academy debate society and the list of the future demand upon they time grow as they talk until ford exclaim -- hold on boy : my brain will not stand any more till after i have eat a supply of fish they ought all to have be able to think harder after the next day 's breakfast and dinner but the corn beef come on Monday and with it as usual come corn in other form the farm have do well that year with that particular crop but so have all the other farm east and west and mr myer find she best market for she maize harvest at she own table it would take a good while to dispose of what dick have already shell and all she could do be to be liberal as to quantity there be no fault to be find with she on that score but dabney do not ask for any more recipe to send home to he mother the second week be much longer than the first Saturday come around very nearly in its own turn this time but it bring with it such a storm of wind and rain as not only shut green pond out of all possible calculation but keep the village green as well clear of all boy it be a good time to write letter in and those write be long one but they do not contain a solitary complaint of any thing the boy have yet discover in or about grantley hamilton say mr kinzer after ponder a little over she letter when it come dabney seem to be well satisfied mr foster say ford and frank be but i notice he do not say any thing about he appetite i do hope he be not lose it he seem to be study hard dabney lose he appetite in less than two week no mother kinzer it would take he longer than that it be just one week later that he show she a part of a curious epistle he have himself receive from dab it have evidently be write in a moment of what be call confidence i tell you what ham he write mother do not know what can be do with corn mr myer do she raise a heap of it this year and the thing she turn it into would drive a cook-book crazy i have be give they latin name and frank he turn they into hindustanee it be real fun sometimes but i sha 'n' t be the boy i be i be get corn my hair be silkier and my voice be husky my ear be grow i would like a few clam and some fish once in a while just for a change a crab would taste wonderfully good so would some oyster and they do not have any up here we have have one good day 's fishing since we come but we have to go mile and mile after it now do not you tell mother we do not get enough to eat there be plenty of it and you ought to see mr myer smile when she pass the johnnycake we be all try to learn that heavenly smile ford do it best i think dick lee be get a little pale perhaps corn do not agree with he he be learn fast though and so be i but we have to work harder than ford and frank i guess the hart boy know more than they do when they get here and they do not learn it all out of they book either we keep up we french and we boxing but oh would not i like to go for some blue-fish just now have mother make any mince-pie yet i have almost forget how they taste i be go by a house the other day and i smell some ham cooking i be real glad i have not forget i know what it be right away do not you be afraid about my study for i be at it all the while except when we be play ball or eat corn they say they have sleigh here earlier than we do and more of it and plenty of skate well now do not say any thing to mother about the corn but will not i eat when i get home yours all the while dabney kinzer why the poor fellow exclaim mr kinzer it be enough to stop he growth it be not many day after that before dabney receive a couple of box by express the mark tell where they come from and he and the other boy carry they right up stair in the face of a kind suggestion from mr myer that they might take they right out into the kitchen and open they there she have almost cease from put she wish in any more dictatorial form but she and almira wonder exceedingly what might be the contents of those box dab be only a minute or so in find out what be in one of they boil ham a whole one out with it frank all that brown paper -- why it be a pair of chicken all ready to roast something more 's down under those slat say ford in a tone of great excitement mince-pie and they be not much mash either it be wonderful how they do pack they slat and shingle and paper say ford what can there be in that other box shall we eat first or open it open it open it maybe they have send you some corn open it be with a desperate display of energy ice say frank harley sawdust shout ford fish say dabney clam oyster crab lobster dick lee have gaze in absolute silence up to that very moment and all he could say now be -- ah-h-h o-h-h-h je ' be not dey fine boy say dab with a sort of loving look at the contents of that box do you suppose we can eat those fellow eat 'em exclaim ford why after they be cook well i s ` pose we can but i feel more like shake hand with 'em all around just now they be old friend and neighbor of mine you know yes but i guess we have better eat they cap'n dab say dick dey je ' knock all de correck pronounciation out ob I dey do ford frank i 'll ask mr myer and almira up here right away those oyster and clam have get to be eat this very evening they do not need twice ask and there be a thoughtful expression on the face of mr myer when she look from one box into the other it be fairly on she tongue 's end to suggest what share of those luxury should be take at once to deacon short 's or mrs sunderland 's but she stop in time for that thought be follow by another -- what could the boy have be write home about she cooking and she table there might be something serious in it for boarder be people who come and go boy or no boy and dab and he friend be just the kind of boy to come and go at all event she could not object to they have such a supply as that send they and she take up the responsibility of all the cookery require at once it be a feast while it last and the effect of it upon the character of mr myer 's table be permanent there be no further danger that dab 's growth would be check in any such manner as he mother have fear nor be there any great doubt remain as to the steadiness of he growth in other way during he school day at grantley for he and he friend be now settle and they have make that most important success in life -- a good begin the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of dab kinzer by william o stoddard
