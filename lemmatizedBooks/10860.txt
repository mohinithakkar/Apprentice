produce by stan goodman ted garvin c markus and pg distribute proofreader epoch of ancient history \* \* \* \* \* the gracchus marius and sullum by ah beesley with map 1921 preface it would be scarcely possible for anyone write on the period embrace in this volume to perform he task adequately without make himself familiar with mr long 's ` history of the decline of the roman republic ' and mommsen 's ` history of rome ' to do over again -lrb- as though the work have never be attempt -rrb- what have be do once for all accurately and well would be mere prudery of punctiliousness but while i acknowledge my debt of gratitude to both these eminent historian i must add that for the whole period i have carefully examine the original authority often come to conclusion widely differ from those of mr long and i venture to hope that from the advantage i have have in be able to compare the work of two writer one of whom have well-nigh exhaust the theory as the other have the fact of the subject i have succeed in give a more consistent and faithful account of the leader and legislation of the revolutionary era than have hitherto be write certainly there could be no more instructive commentary on either history than the study of the other for each supplement the other and emphasize its defect if mommsen at time push conjecture to the verge of invention as in he account of the junction of the helvetius and cimbrus mr long in he dogged determination never to swerve from fact to inference fall into the opposite extreme resorting to somewhat cyclopean architecture in he detestation of stucco but my admiration for he history be but slightly qualify by such consideration and to any student who may be stimulate by the volume of this series to acquire what would virtually amount to a acquaintance first-hand with the narrative of ancient writer i would say ` read mr long 's history ' to do so be to learn not only knowledge but a lesson in historical study

i antecedent of the revolution during the last half of the second century before christ rome be undisputed mistress of the civilised world a brilliant period of foreign conquest have succeed the 300 year in which she have overcome she neighbor and make herself supreme in italy in 146 bc she have give the death-blow to she greatest rival carthage and have annex greece in 140 treachery have rid she of viriathus the stubborn guerilla who defy she general and defeat she army in spain in 133 the terrible fate of numantium and in 132 the merciless suppression of the sicilian slave-revolt warn all foe of the republic that the sword which the incompetence of many general have make seem duller than of old be still keen to smite and except where some slave-band be in desperate rebellion and in pergamus where a pretender dispute with rome the legacy of attalus every land along the shore of the mediterranean be subject to or at the mercy of a town not half as large as the london of to-day almost exactly a century afterwards the government under which this gigantic empire have be consolidate be no more foreign war will have but secondary importance in the follow page -lrb- sidenote : the history will not be one of military event -rrb- the interest of the narrative centre mainly in home politics and though the world do not cease to echo to the tramp of conquer legion and the victorious soldier become a more and more important factor in the state still military matter no longer as in the samnite and punic war absorb the attention dwarf as they be by the great social struggle of which the metropolis be the arena in treat of the first half of those hundred year of revolution which begin with the tribunate of tiberius gracchus and end with the battle of actium it be mainly the fall of the republican and the foreshadowing of the imperial system of government which have to be describe -lrb- sidenote : in order to understand the time of the gracchus it be necessary to understand the history of the order at rome -rrb- but in order to understand rightly the event of those fifty year some survey however brief of the previous history of the roman order be indispensable -lrb- sidenote : the patre -rrb- when the mist of legend clear away we see a community which if we do not take slave into account consist of two part -- the govern body or patre to whom alone the term populus romanus strictly apply and who constitute the roman state and the govern class or cliente who be outside its pale the word patrician more familiar to we ear than the substantive from which it be form come to imply much more than its original meaning -lrb- sidenote : the client -rrb- in its simplest and earliest sense it be apply to a man who be spring from a roman marriage who stand towards he client on much the same footing which in the mildest form of slavery a master occupy towards he slave as the patronus be to the libertus when it become customary to liberate slave so in some measure be the father to they retainer the client that the community be originally divide into these two section be know what be not know be how besides this primary division of patre and cliente there arise a second _ political _ class in the state namely the pleb the client as client have no political existence -lrb- sidenote : the plebeian -rrb- but as a plebeian he have whether the pleb be form of client who have be release from they clientship just as slave might be manumit or of foreigner as soldier trader or artisan be admit into the community or partly of foreigner and partly of client the latter be equalise by the patre with the former in self-defence and whether as a name it date from or be antecedent to the so-called tullian organization be uncertain but we know that in one way or other a second political division in the state arise and that the constitution of which servius tullius be the reputed author make every freeman in rome a citizen by give he a vote in the comitium centuria yet though the plebeian be a citizen and as such acquire ` commercium ' or the right to hold and devise property it be only after a prolonged struggle that he achieve political equality with the patre -lrb- sidenote : gradual acquisition by the pleb of political equality with the patre -rrb- step by step he wring from they the rights of intermarriage and of fill office of state and the great engine by which this be bring about be the tribunate the historical importance of which date from even though as a plebeian magistracy it may have exist before the first secession of the pleb in 494 bc -lrb- sidenote : character of the tribunate -rrb- the tribunate stand towards the freedom of the roman people in something of the same relation which the press of we time occupy towards modern liberty : for its existence imply free criticism of the executive and out of free speech grow free action -lrb- sidenote : the roman government transform from oligarchy into a plutocracy -rrb- side by side with those external event which make rome mistress first of she neighbor then of italy and lastly of the world there go on a succession of internal change which first transform a pure oligarchy into a plutocracy and secondly overthrow this modified form of oligarchy and substitute caesarism with the earlier of these change we be concern here but little the political revolution be over when the social revolution which we have to record begin but the root of the social revolution be of deep growth and be in fact sometimes identical with those of the political revolution -lrb- sidenote : parallel between roman and english history -rrb- englishman can understand such a intermixture the more readily from the analogy more or less close which they own history supplies they have have a monarchy they have be rule by a oligarchy which have first confront and then coalesce with the moneyed class and the united order have be force to yield theoretical equality to almost the entire nation while still retain real authority in they own hand they have see a middle class coquet with a lower class in order to force a upper class to share with it its privilege and a upper class resorting in its turn to the same alliance and they may have note something more than a superficial resemblance between the tactic of the patre and nobile of rome and we own magnate of birth and commerce even now they be witness the displacement of political by social question and it be to be hope the successful solution of problem which in the earlier stage of society have defy the effort of every statesman yet they know that underlie all the political struggle of they history question connect with the rights and interest of rich and poor capitalist and toiler land-owner and land-cultivator have always be silently and sometimes violently agitate political emancipation have enable social discontent to organize itself and find permanent utterance and we be to-day face some of the demand to satisfy which the gracchus sacrifice they life more than 2000 year ago -lrb- sidenote : the struggle between the order chiefly agrarian -rrb- with we indeed the wages question be of more prominence than the land question because we be a manufacturing nation but the principle at stake be much the same at rome social agitation be generally agrarian and the first thing necessary towards understand the gracchan revolution be to gain a clear conception of the history of the public land -lrb- sidenote : origin of the ager publicus -rrb- the ground round a town like rome be originally cultivate by the inhabitant some of whom as more food and clothing be require would settle on the soil from they the rank of the army be recruit and thus doubly oppress by military service and by the land tax which have to be pay in coin the small husbandman be force to borrow from some richer man in the town hence arise usury and a class of debtor and the sum of debt must have be increase as well as the number of the debtor by the very mean adopt to relieve it -lrb- sidenote : fourfold way of deal with conquer territory -rrb- when rome conquer a town she confiscate a portion of its territory and disposed of it in one of four way -lrb- sidenote : colony -rrb- 1 after expel the owner she send some of she own citizen to settle upon it they do not cease to be roman and be in historical time take almost exclusively from the pleb must often have be but poorly furnish with the capital necessary for cultivate the ground -lrb- sidenote : sale -rrb- 2 she sell it and as with we when a field be sell a plan be make of its dimension and boundary so plan of the land thus sell be make on tablet of bronze and keep by the state -lrb- sidenote : occupation -rrb- 3 she allow private person to ` occupy ' it on payment of ` vectigal ' or a portion of the produce and though not surrender the title to the land permit the possessor to use it as they private property for purchase sale and succession -lrb- sidenote : common -rrb- 4 a portion be keep as common pasture land for those to whom the land have be give or sell or by whom it be occupy and those who use it pay ` scriptura ' or a tax of so much per head on the beast for whose grazing they send in a return this irregular system be fruitful in evil it suit the patre with whom it originate for they be for a time the sole gainer by it without money it must have be hopeless to occupy tract distant from rome the poor man who do so would either involve himself in debt or be at the mercy of he richer neighbor whose flock would overrun he field or who might oust he altogether from they by force and even seize he himself and enroll he as a slave the rich man on the other hand could use such land for pasture and leave the care of he flock and herd to client and slave -lrb- sidenote : this irregular system the germ of latifundium -rrb- so originate those ` latifundium ' or large farm which greatly contribute to the ruin of rome and italy the tilled land grow less and with it dwindle the free population and the recruiting field for the army gang of slave become more numerous and be treat with increase brutality and as man who do not work for they own money be more profuse in spend it than those who do the extravagance of the roman possessor help to swell the tide of luxury which rise steadily with foreign conquest and to create in the capital a class free in name indeed but more degrade if less miserable than the very slave who be treat like beast through italy it be not certain whether anyone except a patrician could claim ` occupation ' as a right but as the possessor could in any case sell the land to plebeian it fall into the hand of rich man to whichever class they belong both at rome and in the roman colony and the municipium and as it be never really they property -- ` dominium ' -- but the property of the state it be a constant source of envy and discontent among the poor -lrb- sidenote : why complaint about the public land become louder at the close of the second century bc -rrb- as long as fresh assignation of land and the plantation of colony go on this discontent could be keep within bound but for a quarter of a century precede we period scarcely any fresh acquisition of land have be make in italy and with no hope of new allotment from the territory of they neighbor the people begin to clamor for the restitution of they own -lrb- sidenote : previous agrarian legislation spurius cassius -rrb- the first attempt to wrest public land from possessor have be make long before this by spurius cassius and he have pay for he daring with he life -lrb- sidenote : the licinian law -rrb- more than a century later the licinian law forbid anyone to hold above 500 ` jugera ' of public land for which moreover a tenth of the arable and a fifth of the grazing produce be to be pay to the state the framer of the law be say to have hope that possessor of more than this amount would shrink from make on oath a false return of the land which they occupy and that as they would be liable to penalty for exceed the prescribe maximum all land beyond the maximum would be sell at a nominal price -lrb- if this interpretation of the -lrb- greek : kat ' oligon -rrb- of appian may be hazard -rrb- to the poor it be probable that they do not quite know what they be aim at and certain that they do not foresee the effect of they measure in a confused way the law may have be mean to comprise sumptuary political and agrarian object it forbid anyone to keep more than a hundred large or five hundred small beast on the common pasture-land and stipulate for the employment of a certain proportion of free labor the free labourer be to give information of the crop produce so that the fifth and tenth might be duly pay and it may have be the breakdown of such a impossible institution which lead to the establishment of the ` publicanus ' -lrb- sidenote : composite nature of the licinian law -rrb- nothing indeed be more likely than that licinius and sextius should have attempt to remedy by one measure the specific grievance of the poor plebeian the political disability of the rich plebeian and the general deterioration of public moral but though they motive may have be patriotic such a measure could no more cure the body politic than a man who have a broken limb be blind and in a consumption can be make sound at every point by the heal-all of a quack accordingly the licinian law be soon except in its political provision a dead letter licinius be the first man prosecute for its violation and the economical desire of the nation become intensify -lrb- sidenote : the flaminian law -rrb- in 232 bc flaminius carry a law for the distribution of land take from the senone among the pleb though the law turn out no possessor it be oppose by the senate and noble nor be this surprising for any law distribute land be both actually and as a precedent a blow to the interest of the class which practice occupation what be at first sight surprising be that small parcel of land such as must have be assign in these distribution should have be so coveted -lrb- sidenote : why small portion of land be so coveted -rrb- the explanation be probably fourfold those who clamour for they be wretched enough to clutch at any change or do not realize to themselves the danger and drawback of what they desire or intend at once to sell they land to some richer neighbor or lastly long to keep a slave or two just as the primary object of the ` mean white ' in america use to be to keep he negro -lrb- sidenote : failure of previous legislation -rrb- on the whole it be clear that legislation previous to this period have not diminish agrarian grievance and it be clear also why these grievance be so sorely feel the general tendency at rome and throughout italy be towards a division of society into two class -- the very rich and the very poor a tendency which increase so fast that not many year later it be say that out of some 400000 man at rome only 2000 could in spite of the city be notoriously the center to which the world 's wealth gravitate be call really rich man to any patriot the progressive extinction of small land-owner must have seem piteous in itself and menacing to the life of the state on the other hand the poor have always one glare act of robbery to cast in the tooth of the rich a sanguine tribune might hope permanently to check a grow evil by fresh supplies of free labor he poor partisan again have a direct pecuniary interest in get the land selfish and philanthropic motive therefore go hand in hand and in advocate the distribution of land a statesman would be sure of enlist the sympathy of needy italian even more than those of the better-provided-for poor of rome -lrb- sidenote : roman slavery -rrb- incidental mention have be make of the condition of the slave in italy it be the sight of the slave-gang which partly at least rouse tiberius gracchus to action and some remark on roman slavery follow naturally a enquiry into the nature of the public land the most terrible characteristic of slavery be that it blight not only the unhappy slave themselves but they owner and the land where they live it be a absolutely unmitigated evil as roman conquest multiply and luxury increase enormous fortune become more common and the demand for slave increase also ten thousand be say to have be land and sell at delo in one day what proportion the slave population of italy bear to the free at the time of the gracchus we can not say it have be place as low as 4 per cent but the probability be that it be far greater -lrb- sidenote : slave labor universally employ -rrb- in trade mine grazing levying of revenue and every field of speculation slave-labour be universally employ if it be certain that even unenfranchised italian however poor could be make to serve in the roman army it be a proprietor 's direct interest from that point of view to employ slave of whose service he could not be deprive -lrb- sidenote : whence the slave come they treatment -rrb- a vast impetus have be give to the slave-trade at the time of the conquest of macedonium about thirty-five year before we period the great slave-producing country be those border on the mediterranean -- africa asia spain & c a organized system of man-hunting supply the roman market and slave-dealer be part of the ordinary retinue of a roman army when a batch of slave reach its destination they be keep in a pen till buy those buy for domestic service would no doubt be best off and the cunning mischievous rogue the ally of the young against the old master of whom we read in roman comedy if he do not come up to we ideal of what a man should be do not seem to have be physically very wretched even here however we see how degrade a thing a slave be and the frequent threat of torture prove how utterly he be at the mercy of a cruel master 's caprice we know too that when a master be arraign on a criminal charge the first thing do to prove he guilt be to torture he slave but just as in america the popular figure of the oily lazy jocular negro brimming over with grotesque good-humour and screening himself in the weakness of a indulgent master merely serve to brighten a picture of which the horrible plantation system be the dark background so at rome no instance of individual indulgence be a set-off against the monstrous barbarity which in the end bring about they own punishment and the ruin of the republic -lrb- sidenote : dread inspire by the prospect of roman slavery -rrb- frequent story attest the horror of roman slavery feel by conquer nation we read often of individual and sometimes of whole town commit suicide sooner than fall into the conqueror ' hand sometimes slave slew they dealer sometimes one another a boy in spain kill he three sister and starve himself to avoid slavery woman kill they child with the same object if as it be assert the plantation-system be not yet introduce into italy such story and the desperate out-break and almost incredibly merciless suppression of slave revolt prove that the condition of the roman slave be sufficiently miserable -lrb- sidenote : the horror of slavery culminate in sicily -rrb- but doubtless misery reach its climax in sicily where that system be in full swing slave not sell for domestic service be there brand and often make to work in chain the strongest serve as shepherd badly feed and clothe these shepherd plunder whenever they find the chance such brigandage be wink at and sometimes positively encourage by the owner while the governor shrink from punish the brigand for fear of offend they master as the demand for slave grow slave-breeding as well as slave-importation be practice no doubt there be as various theory as to the most profitable management of slave then as in america lately damophilus have the instinct of a legree : a haley and a cato would have hold much the same sentiment as to the rearing of infant some master would breed and rear and try to get more work from the slave by kindness than harshness other would work they off and buy afresh and as this would be probably the cheapest policy no doubt it be the prevalent one and what a appalling vista of dumb suffering do such consideration open to we cold hunger nakedness torture infamy a foreign country a strange climate a life so hard that it make the early death which be almost inevitable a comparative blessing -- such be the terrible lot of the roman slave at last almost simultaneously at various place in the roman dominion he turn like a beast upon a brutal drover -lrb- sidenote : outbreak in various quarter -rrb- at rome at minturna at sinuessa at delo in macedonium and in sicily insurrection or attempt at insurrection break out they be everywhere mercilessly suppress and by wholesale torture and crucifixion the conqueror try to clothe death they last ally with terror which even a slave dare not encounter in the year when tiberius gracchus be tribune -lrb- and the coincidence be significant -rrb- it be find necessary to send a consul to put down the first slave revolt in sicily it be not know when it break out -lrb- sidenote : story of damophilus -rrb- its proximate cause be the brutality of damophilus of enna and he wife megalli he slave consult a man name eunous a syrian-greek who have long foretold that he would be a king and whom he master 's guest have be in the habit of jestingly ask to remember they when he come to the throne -lrb- sidenote : the first sicilian slave war -rrb- eunous lead a band of 400 against enna he could spout fire from he mouth and he juggling and prophesy inspired confidence in he follower all the man of enna be slay except the armourer who be fetter and compel to forge arm damophilus and megalli be bring with every insult into the theater he begin to beg for he life with some effect but hermeia and another cut he down and he wife after be tortured by the woman be cast over a precipice but they daughter have be gentle to the slave and they not only do not harm she but send she under a escort of which this hermeia be one to catana eunous be now make king and call himself antiochus he make achaeus he general be join by cleon with 5000 slave and soon muster 10000 man four praetor -lrb- accord to florus -rrb- be defeat the number of the rebel rapidly increase to 200000 and the whole island except a few town be at they mercy in 134 the consul flaccus go to sicily but with what result be not know in 133 the consul l calpurnius piso capture messana kill 8000 slave and crucify all he prisoner in 132 p rupilius capture the two stronghold of the slave tauromenium and enna -lrb- taormina and castragiovannus -rrb- both town stand on the top ledge of precipice and be hardly accessible each be blockade and each be eventually surrender by a traitor but at tauromenium the defender hold out it be say till all food be go and they have eat the child and the woman and some of the man cleon 's brother comanus be take here all the prisoner be first tortured and then throw down the rock at enna cleon make a gallant sally and die of he wound eunous flee and be pull out of a pit with he cook he baker he bathman and he fool he be say to have die in prison of the same disease as sullum and herod rupilius crucify over 20000 slave and so quench with blood the last fire of rebellion besides the danger threaten society from the discontent of the poor the aggression of the rich the multiplication and ferocious treatment of slave and the social rivalry of the capital the condition of italy and the general deterioration of public morality imperatively demand reform it have be already say that we do not know for certain how the pleb arise but we know how it wrest political equality from the patre and speak roughly we may date the fusion of the two order under he common title ` nobile ' from the licinian law -lrb- sidenote : the ` nobile ' at rome -rrb- it have be a gradual change peaceably bring about and the larger number have absorb the smaller the term ` nobile ' which specifically mean those who have themselves fill a curule office or whose father have do so comprehend in common usage the old nobility and the new the new noble rapidly draw aloof from the residuum of the pleb and in the true _ parvenu _ spirit ape and outdo the arrogance of the old patrician down to the time of the gracchus or thereabout the two great state party consist of the pleb on the one hand and these nobile on the other -lrb- sidenote : the ` optimate ' and ` populare ' -rrb- after that date new name come into use though we can no more fix the exact time when the term optimate and populare supersede previous party watchword than we can when tory give place to conservative and whig to liberal thus patrician and plebeian be obsolete term and noble and plebeian no longer have any political meaning for each be equal in the sight of the law each have a vote each be eligible to every office but when the fall of carthage free rome from all rival and conquest after conquest fill the treasury increase luxury make the means of ostentation more greedily seek office mean plunder and to gain office man bribe and bribe every day on a vaster scale if we say that ` optimate ' signify the man who bribe and abuse office under the banner of the senate and its connection and that ` populare ' mean man who bribe and abuse office with the interest of the people outside the senatorial pale upon they lip we might do injustice to many good man on both side but should hardly be slander the party party in fact they be not they be faction and the fact that it be by no means easy always to decide how far individual be sway by good or bad motive where good motive be so often parade to mask base action do not disguise they despicable character honest optimate would wish to maintain the senate 's preponderance from affection to it and from belief in its be the mainstay of the state honest populare like the gracchus who see the evil of senatorial rule try to win the popular vote to compass its overthrow dishonest politician of either side advocate conservatism or change simply from the most selfish personal ambition and in time of general moral laxity it be the dishonest politician who give the tone to a party the most unscrupulous member of the ruling ring the most shameless panderer to mob prejudice carry all before they both seek one thing only -- personal ascendency and the state become the bone over which the vilest cur wrangle -lrb- sidenote : who the equite be -rrb- in write of the gracchus reference will be make to the equite the name have broaden from its original meaning and now merely denote all non-senatorial rich man a individual eque would lean to the senatorial faction or the faction of man too poor to keep a horse for cavalry service just as he connexion be chiefly with the one or the other how as a body the equite veer round alternately to each side we shall see hereafter instead of form a sound middle class to check the excess of both party they be sway chiefly by sordid motive and back up the man who for the time seem most willing or able to gratify they greed what go on at rome must have be repeat over again with more or less exactitude throughout italy and there in addition to this process of national disintegration the cloud of a political storm be gather the follow table will show at a glance the classification of the roman state as constitute at the outbreak of the social war _ cive romanus _ : 1 rome 2 roman colony 3 municipium roman colony and municipium be praefectura _ peregrinus _ : 1 latinus or nomen latinum a old latin town except such as have be make municipium b colony of old latin town c joint colony -lrb- if any -rrb- of rome and old latin town d colony of italian from all part of italy found by rome under the name of latin colony 2 socius ie free inhabitant of italy 3 provincial ie free subject of rome out of italy -lrb- sidenote : rights of cive romanus -rrb- the cive romanus in and out of rome have the jus suffragius and the jus honorum ie the right to vote and the right to hold office -lrb- sidenote : the roman colony -rrb- a _ roman colony _ be in its organization rome in miniature and the people among whom it have be plant as a garrison may either have retain they own political constitution or have be govern by a magistrate send from rome they be not roman citizen except as be resident of a roman city but by irregular marriage with roman the line of demarcation between the two people may have grow less clearly define -lrb- sidenote : the praefectura -rrb- _ praefectura _ be the generic name for roman colony and for all municipium to which prefect be send annually to administer justice -lrb- sidenote : municipium -rrb- _ municipium _ be suppose to have be originally those conquer italian town to which connubium and commercium ie rights of intermarriage and of trade be give but from whom jus suffragius and jus honorum be withhold these privilege however be confer on they before the social war some be govern by roman magistrate and some be self-governed they vote in the roman tribe though probably only at important crisis such as the agitation for a agrarian law they be under the jurisdiction of the praetor urbanus but vicarious justice be administer among they by a official call _ praefectus jurus dicundo _ send yearly from rome -lrb- sidenote : the latinus -rrb- the latinus have no vote at rome no right of hold office and be practically roman subject a roman who join a latin colony cease to be a roman citizen whether there be any difference between the internal administration of a latin colony and a old latin town be uncertain the latinus may have have commercium and connubium or only the former they certainly have not jus suffragius or jus honorum and they be in subjection to rome a latin could obtain the roman franchise but the mode of do so at this time be a disputed point livy mention a law which enable a latin to obtain the franchise by migrate to rome and be enrol in the census provide he leave child behind he to fill he place there be no doubt that either legally or irregularly latinus do migrate to rome and do so obtain the citizenship but we know no more other say that the later right by which a latin obtain the citizenship in virtue of fill a magistracy in he native town exist already -lrb- sidenote : the socius -rrb- of the socius all or many of they have treaty define they relation to rome and be therefore know as foederata civitate they have internal self-government but be bind to supply rome with soldier ship and sailor -lrb- sidenote : grievance of the latin and ally -rrb- at the time of the gracchus discontent be seething among the latin and ally there be two class among they -- the rich landlord and capitalist who prosper as the rich at rome prosper and the poor who be weigh down by debt or be push out of they farm by slave-labour or be hanger-on of the rich in the town and eager for distribution of land the poor be oppress no doubt by the rich man both of they own city and of rome the rich chafe at the intolerable insolence of roman official it be not that rome interfere with the local self-government she have grant by treaty but the italian labor under grievous disability and oppression so late as the jugurthine war latin officer be execute by martial law whereas any roman soldier could appeal to a civil tribunal again while the army have formerly be recruit from the roman and the ally equally now the severest service and the main weight of war fall on the latter who furnish moreover two soldier to every roman again without a certain amount of property a man at rome could not be enrol in the army but the rule seem not to have apply to italian nor be the civil less harsh than the military administration a consul 's wife wish to use the man 's bath at teanum and because the bather be not clear out quickly enough and the bath be not clean enough m marius the chief magistrate of the town be strip and scourge in the market-place a free herdsman ask in joke if it be a corpse that be in a litter pass through venusium and which contain a young roman though not even a official its occupant show that if lazy he be at least alive by have the peasant whip to death with the litter strap in short the rich italian would feel the need of the franchise as strongly as the old plebeian have feel it and all the more strongly because the roman have not only cease to enfranchise whole community but be chary of give the citizenship even to individual the poor also have the ordinary grievance against they own rich and be so far likely to favor the scheme of any man who assail the capitalist class roman or italian as a whole but they none the less disliked roman supremacy and would be easily persuade to attribute to that supremacy some of the hardship which it do not cause -lrb- sidenote : state of the transmarine province -rrb- while such fire be slowly come to the surface in italy and be soon to flame out in the social war the state of the province out of the peninsula be not more reassure the struggle with viriathus and the numantine war have reveal the fact that the last place to look for high martial honor or heroic virtue be the roman army if a scipio sustain the tradition of roman generalship and a gracchus those of republican rectitude other commander would have stain the military annals of any nation -lrb- sidenote : deterioration of roman generalship -rrb- roman general have come to wage war for themselves and not for the state they even wage it in defiance of the state 's express order if they find peace in the province they find mean to break it hope to glut they

the state and the army be worthy of the commander the former engage in perhaps the worst war that can be wage hound on by its mercantile class it fight not for a dream of dominion or to beat back encroach barbarism but to exterminate a commercial rival the latter which it be hard to recruit on account of the grow effeminacy of the city it be harder still to keep under discipline it be follow by train of cook and actor and the viler appendage of oriental luxury and be learn to be satisfy with such victory as be win by the assassination of hostile general or ratify by the massacre of man

chapter ii tiberius gracchus -lrb- sidenote : scipio aemilianius -rrb- general expectation would have point to scipio aemilianus the conqueror of numantium and carthage and the foremost man at rome he be well-meaning and more than ordinarily able strict and austere as a general and as a citizen unite greek culture with the old roman simplicity of life he be full of scorn of the rabble and do not scruple to express it ` silence ' he cry when he be hiss for what he say about he brother-in-law 's death ` you step-child of italy ' and when this enrage they still more he go on : ` do you think i shall fear you whom i bring to italy in fetter now that you be loose ' he show equal scorn for such pursuit as at rome at least be associate with effeminacy and vice and express in lively language he dislike of singing and dancing ` we child be teach disgraceful trick they go to actor ' school with sambuca and psaltery they learn to sing -- a thing which we ancestor consider to be a disgrace to freeborn child when i be tell this i could not believe that man of noble rank allow they child to be teach such thing but be take to a dancing school i saw -- i do upon my honor -- more than fifty boy

child dancing to the castanets and it be a dance which one of we wretched shameless slave would not have dance ' on another occasion he show a power of quick retort as censor he have degrade a man name asellus whom mummius afterwards restore to the equite asellus impeach scipio and taunt he with the unluckiness of he censorship -- its mortality & c ` no wonder ' say scipio ` for the man who

and he association he seem mark out as the one man who could and would desire to step forth as the savior of he country but such self-sacrifice be not exhibit by man of scipio 's type too able to be blind to the sign of the time they be sway by instinct too strong for they conviction a aristocrat of aristocrat scipio be a reformer only so far as he think reform might prolong the reign of he order from any more radical measure he shrink with dislike if not with fear the weak spot often to be find in those culture aristocrat who coquet with liberalism be fatal to he chance of be a hero he be a trimmer to the core who without intentional dishonesty stand face both way till the hour come when he be force to range himself on one side or the other and then he take the side which he must have know to be the wrong one palliation of the error of a man place in so terribly difficult a position be only just but laudation of he statesmanship seem absurd as a statesman he carry not one great measure and if one be conceive in he circle he cordially approve of its abandonment to those who claim for he that he see the impossibility of those change which he brother-in-law advocate it be sufficient to reply that rome do not rest till those change have be adopt and that the hearty co-operation of himself and he friend would have go far to turn failure into success but he mind be too narrow to break through the association which have environ he from he childhood when tiberius gracchus a nobler man than himself have suffer martyrdom for the cause with which he have only dally he be base enough to quote from homer -lrb- greek : os apoloito kai allos hotis toiaita ge hoezous -rrb- -- ` so perish all who do the like again ' -lrb- sidenote : tiberius gracchus -rrb- but the splendid peril which scipio shrink from encounter he brother-in-law court with the fire and passion of youth tiberius sempronius gracchus be accord to plutarch not quite thirty when he be murder plutarch may have be mistaken and possibly he be thirty-five he father whose name he bear have be a magnificent aristocrat and he mother be cornelia daughter of hannibal 's conqueror the first scipio africanus and

of appius and he brother have marry the daughter of mucianus he have serve under scipio and display striking bravery at carthage and as quaestor of the incompetent mancinus have by he character for probity save a roman army from destruction for the numantine would not treat with the consul but only with gracchus no man have a more brilliant career open to he at rome have he be content only to shut he eye to the fate that threaten he country but he have not only insight but a conscience and cheerfully risk he life to avert the ruin which he foresee he character have be as much debate as he measure and the most opposite conclusion have be form about both so that he name be a synonym for patriot with some for demagogue with other even historian of we own day be still at variance as to the nature of he legislation but from a comparison of they research and a independent examination of the authority on which they be base something like a clear conception of the plan of gracchus seem possible what have never perhaps as yet be make sufficiently plain be who it be that gracchus especially mean to benefit much of the public land previously describe lay in the north and south of italy from the frontier river rubicon and macra to apulia it form as appian say the largest portion of the land take from conquer town by rome -lrb- sidenote : agrarian proposal of gracchus -rrb- what gracchus propose be to take from the rich and give to the poor some of this land it be in fact merely the licinian law over again with certain modification and the existence of that law would make the necessity for a repetition of it inexplicable have it not be a curious principle with the roman that a law which have fall into desuetude cease to be bind but it actually fall short of the law of licinius for it provide that he who surrender what he hold over and above 500 jugera should be guarantee in the permanent possession of that quantity and moreover might retain 250 jugera in addition for each of he son some writer conjecture that altogether a occupier might not hold more than 1000 jugera now the first thing to remark about the law be that it be by no mean a demagogue 's sop toss to the city mob which he be court gracchus see slave labor ruin free labor and the manhood and soil of italy and the roman army proportionately depreciate -lrb- sidenote : nothing demagogic about the proposal -rrb- to fill the vacuum he propose to distribute to the poor not only of rome but of the municipium of the roman colony and it be to be presume of the socius also land take from the rich member of those four component part of the roman state this consideration alone destroy at once the absurd imputation of he be actuate merely by demagogic motive but in no history be it adequately enforce no demagogue at that epoch would have spread he net so wide at the same time it give the key to the subsequent maneuver by which he enemy strive to divide he partisan broadly then we may say that gracchus strike boldly at the very root of the decadence of the whole peninsula and that if he remedy could not cure it nothing else could -lrb- sidenote : the socius -- land-owner -rrb- how the socius become possessor of the public land we do not know probably they buy it from cive romani its authorised occupier with the connivance of the state we now see from whom the land be to be take namely the rich all over italy and to whom it be to be give the poor all over italy and also the object with which it be to be give namely to re-create a peasantry and stop the increase of the slave-plague -lrb- sidenote : provision against evasion of the law -rrb- in order to prevent the law become a dead letter like that of licinius owing to poor man sell they land as soon as they get it he propose that the new land-owner should not have the right to dispose of they land to other and for this though it would have be hard to carry out we can not see what other proviso could have be substitute lastly as death and other cause would constantly render change in the holding inevitable he propose that a permanent board should have the superintendence of they and this too be a wise and necessary measure -lrb- sidenote : provision for the administration of the law -rrb- we can understand so much of the law of gracchus but it be hard thoroughly to understand more it have be urge as a difficulty not easily explain that few people after retain 500 jugera for themselves and 250 for each of they son would have have much leave to surrender but this difficulty be imaginary rather than real for appian say that the public land be ` the greater part ' of the land take by rome from conquered state and the great family may have have vast tract of it as pasture land -lrb- sidenote : thing about the law hard to understand -rrb- there be however other thing which with we meager knowledge of the law we can not explain for instance be a hard and fast line draw at 500 jugera as compensation whether a man surrender 2 jugera or 2000 beyond that amount again consider the outcry make it be hard to imagine that only those possess above 500 jugera be interfere with but this perhaps may be account for by recollect that in such matter man fight bravely against what they feel to be the thin end of the wedge even if they be themselves concern only sympathetically what gracchus mean to do with the slave displace by free labor or how he mean to decide what be public and what be private land after inextricable confusion between the two in many part for so many year we can not even conjecture the statesmanlike comprehensiveness however of he main proposition justify we in believe that he have not overlook such obvious stumbling-block in he way -lrb- sidenote : appian 's criticism of the law -rrb- when appian say he be eager to accomplish what he think to be a good thing we concur in the testimony appian thus give to gracchus have be a good man but when he go on to say he be so eager that he never even think of the difficulty we prefer to judge gracchus by he own act rather than by appian 's criticism or the similar criticism of modern writer -lrb- sidenote : speech of gracchus explain he motive -rrb- the speech ascribe to he which be apparently genuine seem to show that he know well enough what he be about ` the wild beast of italy ' he say ` have they den to retire to but the brave man who spill they blood in she cause have nothing leave but air and light without home without settle habitation they wander from place to place with they wife and child and they general do but mock they when at the head of they army they exhort they man to fight for they sepulchre and the god of they hearth for among such number perhaps there be not one roman who have a altar that have belong to he ancestor or a sepulchre in which they ash rest the private soldier fight and die to advance the wealth and luxury of the great and they be call master of the world without have a sod to call they own ' again he ask ` be it not just that what belong to the people should be share by the people be a man with no capacity for fight more useful to he country than a soldier be a citizen inferior to a slave be a alien or one who own some of he country 's soil the best patriot you have win by war most of you possession and hope to acquire the rest of the habitable globe but now it be but a hazard whether you gain the rest by bravery or whether by you weakness and discord you be rob of what you have by you foe wherefore in prospect of such acquisition you should if need be spontaneously and of you own free will yield up these land to those who will rear child for the service of the state do not sacrifice a great thing while strive for a small especially as you be to receive no contemptible compensation for you expenditure on the land in free ownership of 500 jugera secure for ever and in case you have son of 250 more for each of they the striking point in the last extract be he remark about a ` small thing ' it be likely enough that the loss of the proprietor as a body would not be overwhelming and that the opposition be render furious almost as much by the principle of restitution and interference with long-recognised ownership as by the value of what they be call on to disgorge five hundred jugera of slave-tended pasture-land could not have be of very great importance to a rich roman who however might well have be alarm by the warning of gracchus with regard to the army for in foreign service and not in grazing or plough the fine gentleman of the day find a royal road to wealth -lrb- sidenote : grievance of the possessor -rrb- on the other hand it be quite comprehensible both that the possessor imagine that they have a great grievance and that they have some ground for they belief a possessor for instance who have purchase from another in the full faith that he title would never be disturb have more right to be indignant than a proprietor of indian stock would have if in case of the bankruptcy of the indian government the british government should refuse to refund he money there must have be number of such case with every possible complexity of title and even if the class that would be actually affect be not large it be powerful and every landowner with a defective title would however small he holding -lrb- provide it be over 30 jugera the propose allotment -rrb- take the alarm and help to swell the cry against the tribune as a demagogue and a robber this be what we can state about the agrarian law of tiberius gracchus it remain to be tell how it be carry -lrb- sidenote : how the law be carry -rrb- gracchus have a colleague name octavius who be say to have be he personal friend octavius have land himself to lose if the law be carry and he oppose it gracchus offer to pay he the value of the land out of he own purse but octavius be not to be so win over and as tribune interpose he veto to prevent the bill be read to the people that they might vote on it tiberius retort by use he power to suspend public business and public payment one day when the people be go to vote the other side seize the voting urn and then tiberius and the rest of the tribune agree to take the opinion of the senate the result be that he come away more hopeless of success by constitutional means and doubtless irritated by insult he then propose to octavius that the people should vote whether he or octavius should lose office -- a weak proposal perhaps but the proposal of a honest generous man whose aim be not self-aggrandisement but the public weal octavius naturally refuse tiberius call together the thirty-five tribe to vote whether or no octavius should be deprive of he office -lrb- sidenote : octavius deprive of the tribunate -rrb- the first tribe vote in the affirmative and gracchus implored octavius even now to give way but in vain the next sixteen tribe record the same vote and once more gracchus intercede with he old friend but he speak to deaf ear the voting go on and when octavius on he tribunate be take from he would not go away plutarch say that tiberius order one of he freedman to drag he from the rostrum these act of tiberius gracchus be commonly say to have be the beginning of revolution at rome and the guilt of it be accordingly lay at he door and there can be no doubt that he be guilty in the sense that a man be guilty who introduce a light into some chamber fill with explosive vapor which the stupidity or malice of other have suffer to accumulate but after all too much be make of this violation of constitutional form and the sanctity of the tribunate -lrb- sidenote : defense of the conduct of gracchus -rrb- the first be effete and all regular means of renovate the republic seem to be close to the despairing patriot by stolid obstinacy shelter itself under the garb of law and order the second be no longer what it have be -- the recognize refuge and defense of the poor the rich as tiberius in effect argue have find out how to use it also if all man who set the example of forcible infringement of law be criminal gracchus be a criminal but in the world 's annals he sin in good company and when man condemn he they should condemn washington also perhaps he failure have have most to do with he condemnation success justify failure condemn most revolution in most man 's eye but if ever a revolution be excusable this be for it be carry not by a small party for small aim but by national acclamation by the voice of italian who flock to rome either to vote or if they have not vote themselves to overawe those who have how far gracchus see the inevitable effect of he act be open to dispute -lrb- sidenote : gracchus not a weak sentimentalist -rrb- but probably he see it as clearly as any man can see the future because he be generous and enthusiastic it be assume that he be sentimental and weak and that he policy be guide by impulse rather than reason there seem little to sustain such a judgment other than the desire of writer to emphasise a comparison between he and he brother if he character have be what some say that it be he speech would hardly have be describe by cicero as acute and sensible but not rhetorical enough all he conduct be consistent he strive hard and to the last to procure he end by peaceable means drive into a corner by the tactic of he opponent he break through the constitution and once have do so go the way on which he act lead he without turn to the right hand or the leave there seem to be not a sign of he have drift into revolution because a portrait be draw in neutral tint it do not follow that it be therefore faithful and those writer who seem to think they must reconcile the fact of tiberius have be so good a man with he have be as they assert so bad a citizen have blur the likeness in they anxiety about the chiaroscuro no one would affirm that tiberius commit no error but that he be a wise as well as a good man be far more in accordance with the fact than a more qualified verdict would be -lrb- sidenote : mean behavior of the senate -rrb- the senate show its spite against the successful tribune by petty annoyance such as allow he only about a shill a day for he official expenditure and as rumor say by the assassination of one of he friend but while man like p scipio nasica busy themselves with such miserable tactic tiberius bring forward another great proposal supplementary to he agrarian law -lrb- sidenote : proposal of gracchus to distribute the legacy of attalus -rrb- attalus the last king of pergamus have just die and leave he kingdom to rome gracchus wish to divide he treasure among the new settler and express some other intention of transfer the settlement of the country from the senate to the people as to the second of these proposition it would be unsafe as well as unfair to gracchus to pronounce judgment on it without a knowledge of its detail the first be both just and wise and necessary for previous experience have show that the first temptation of a pauper land-owner be to sell he land to the rich and as the law of gracchus forbid this he be bind to give the settler a fair start on he farm -lrb- sidenote : retort of the senate -rrb- the senate take fresh alarm and it find vent again in characteristically mean device one senator say that a diadem and a purple robe have be bring to gracchus from pergamus another assail he because man with torch escort he home at night another twit he with the deposition of octavius to this last attack less contemptible than the other he reply in a bold and able speech which practically assert that the spirit of the constitution be bind on a citizen but that its letter under some circumstance be not -lrb- sidenote : other intended reform of gracchus -rrb- he be also engage in meditate other important reform all direct against the senate 's power plutarch say that they comprise abridgment of the soldier 's term of service a appeal to the people from the judice and the equal partition between the senate and equite of the privilege of serve as judice which hitherto belong only to the former accord to velleius tiberius also promise the franchise to all italian south of the rubicon and the macra which if true be another proof of he far-seeing statesmanship to carry out such extensive change it be necessary to procure prolongation of office for himself and he become a candidate for the next year 's tribunate -lrb- sidenote : gracchus stand again for the tribunate he motive -rrb- to say that consideration of personal safety dictate he candidature be a very easy and specious insinuation but be nothing more it be indeed a good deal less for it be utterly inconsistent with the other act of a unselfish dauntless career at election-time the first two tribe vote for tiberius then the aristocracy declare he candidature to be illegal because he could not hold office two year run it may have be so or the law may have be so violate as to be no more valid than the licinian law which though never abrogate have never much force -lrb- sidenote : tactic of the senate -rrb- to fasten on some technical flaw in he procedure be precisely in keep with the rest of the act of the opposition but those writer who accuse tiberius of be guilty of another illegal act in stand fail to observe the force of the fact that it be not till the first two tribe have vote that the aristocracy interfere this show that they objection be a last resort to a invalid statute and a deed of which they be themselves ashamed however the president of the tribune rubrius hesitate to let the other tribe vote and when mummius octavius 's substitute ask rubrius to yield to he the presidency other object that the post must be fill by lot and so the election be adjourn till the next day it be clear enough to what end thing be tend and tiberius put on mourning commit he young son to the protection of the people it need hardly be say that the father 's affection and the statesman 's bitter dismay at find the dearest object of he life about to be snatch from he by violence need not have be tinge with one particle of personal fear a man of try bravery like gracchus might guard he own life indeed but only as be regard it as indispensable to a great cause that evening he tell he partisan he would give they a sign next day if he should think it necessary to use force at he election it have be assume that this prove he be meditate treason but it prove no more than that he mean to repel force forcibly if as be only too certain force should be use and this be not treason no other course be open to he the one weak spot in he policy be that he have no material strength at he back even sullum would have be a lose man at a later time if he have not have a army at hand to which he could flee for refuge just as without the army cromwell would have be powerless but it be harvest-time now and the rural ally of gracchus be away from home in the field -lrb- sidenote : murder of gracchus -rrb- the next day dawn and with it occur omen full of mean to the superstitious roman the sacred fowl would not feed tiberius stumble at the doorway of he house and break the nail of he great toe some crow fight on the roof of a house on the left hand and one dislodge a tile which fall at he foot but blossius be at he side encourage he and gracchus go on to the capitol and be greet with a great cheer by he partisan -lrb- sidenote : different account give by appian and plutarch -rrb- appian say that when the rich would not allow the election to proceed tiberius give the signal plutarch tell we that fulvius flaccus come and tell he that he foe have resolve to slay he and have fail to induce the consul scaevolum to act be arm they friend and slave and that gracchus give the signal then as appian agree with plutarch in he account of nasica 's conduct in the senate the last be the more probable version of what occur nasica call on scaevolum to put down the tyrant scaevolum reply that he would not be the first to use force then nasica call on the senator to follow he mount the capitol to a position above that of gracchus arm themselves with club and leg of bench he follower charge down and disperse the crowd gracchus stumble over some prostrate body and be slay either by a blow from p satyreius a fellow-tribune or from l rufus for both claim the distinction so die a genuine patriot and martyr and so foul

aristocracy -rrb- over three hundred of the people be kill and throw into the tiber and the aristocracy follow up they triumph as harshly as they dare they banish some and slew other of the tribune 's partisan plutarch say that they fasten up one in a chest with viper when blossius be bring before he judge he avow that he would have burn the capitol if gracchus have tell he to do it so confident be he in he leader 's patriotism -- a answer testify not only to the nobleness of the two friend but to the strong character of one of they philosopher be not so impressed by weak impulsive man blossius be spare probably because he have connexion with some of the noble rather than because he reply inspire respect but while the aristocracy be make war on individual the work of the dead man go on as if even from the grave he be destine to bring into sharper relief the pettiness of they project by the grandeur of he own -lrb- sidenote : the law of gracchus remain in force -rrb- the allotment of land be vigorously carry out and when appius claudius and mucianus die the commissioner be partisan of tiberius -- he brother caius m fulvius flaccus and c papirius carbo -lrb- sidenote : its beneficial effect -rrb- in the year 125 instead of another decrease in the able-bodied population we find a increase of nearly 80000 it seem probable that this increase be solely in consequence of what the allotment commissioner do for the roman burgess nor if the proletarius and capite census be not include in the register of those class for military service be the increase remarkable for it would be to member of those class that the allotment would be chiefly assign moreover the poor whom the rich expel from they land do not give in they name to the censor and do not attend to the education of they child these man would on receive allotment enrol themselves the consul of the year 132 inscribe on a public monument that he be the first who have turn the shepherd out of the domain and install farmer in they stead and these farmer become as gracchus intend a strong reinforcement to the roman soldier-class as well as a check to slave labor what be do at rome be do also it be say throughout italy and if on the same scale it must have be a really enormous measure of relief to the poor and a vast stride towards a return to a healthier tenure of the land -lrb- sidenote : difficulty and hardship in enforce it -rrb- but it be not hard to imagine what heart-burning the commissioner must have arouse some man be thrust out of tilled land on to waste land some who think that they property be private property find to they cost that it be the state 's some have encroach and they encroachment be now expose some of the socius have buy parcel of the land and find out now that they have no title lastly some land have be by special decree assign to individual state and the commissioner at length proceed to stretch out they hand towards it historian while record such thing have fail to explain why the chief opposition to the commissioner arise from the country which have furnish the chief supporter of tiberius and what be the exact attitude assume by scipio aemilianus it be lose sight of that as at rome there be two class so there be two class in italy it be absurd constantly to put prominently forward the sharp division of interest in the capital and then speak of the country class as if they be all one body and they interest the same -lrb- sidenote : division in italy similar to those in rome -rrb- the natural and apparently the only way of explain what at first sight seem the inconsistency of the country class be to conclude that the man who support tiberius be the poor of the italian town and the small farmer of the country while the man who call on scipio to save they from the commissioner be the capitalist of the town and the richer farmer -- some of they voter some of they non-voter -- with they force swollen it may be by not a few who have clamour for more land find now that the title to what they already have be call in question though this can not be state as a certainty it at least account for what historian after many page on the subject have leave absolutely unexplained and it present the conduct of scipio aemilianus in quite a different light from the one in which it have commonly be regard he be usually extol as a patriot who would not stir to humor a roman rabble but who when downtrodden honest farmer he comrade in the war appeal to he at once step into the arena as they champion -lrb- sidenote : attitude of scipio aemilianus -rrb- in reality he be a reactionist who when the inevitable result of those liberal idea which have be broach in he own circle stare he in the face seize the first available means of stifle they the world have move too fast for he as censor instead of beseech the god to increase the glory of the state he beg they to preserve it and no doubt he would have greatly prefer that the god should act without he intervention brave as a man he be a pusillanimous statesman and when confront by the revolutionary spirit which he and he friend have help to evoke he determine at all cost to prop up the senatorial power -lrb- sidenote : he unpopularity with the senate -rrb- but the senate hate he partly as a trimmer and partly because by he personal character he rebuke they baseness he have just impeach aurelius cotta a senator and the judice from spite against he have refuse to convict so he turn to the italian land-owner and become the mouthpiece of they selfishness for a selfish or at best a narrow-minded end the noble must have at heart dislike he ally but they cheer he in the senate and he succeed in practically strangle the commission by procure the transfer of its jurisdiction to the consul the consul for the time be immediately find a pretext for leave rome and a short time afterwards scipio be find one morning dead in he bed -lrb- sidenote : he death -rrb- he have go to he chamber the night before to think over what he should say next day to the people about the position of the country class and if he be murder it be almost as probable that he be murder by some rancorous foe in the senate as by carbo or any other gracchan it be well for he reputation that he die just then without sullum 's personal vice he might have play sullum 's part as a politician and he atrocity in spain as well as he remark on the death of tiberius gracchus -- word breathe the very essence of a narrow swordsman 's nature -- show that from bloodsh at all event he would not have shrink it be hard to respect such a man in spite of all he good quality fortune give he the opportunity of play a great part and he shrink from it when the crop spring up which he have himself help to sow he blighted it but because he be personally respectable and because he hold a middle course between contemporary party he have find favor with historian who be too apt to forget that there be in politics as in other thing a right course and a wrong and that to attempt to walk along both at once prove a man to be a weak statesman and do not prove he to be a great or good man -lrb- sidenote : the early career of caius gracchus -rrb- in bc 126 caius gracchus seven year after he have be make one of the commissioner for the allotment of public land be elect quaestor sardinium be at that time in rebellion and it fall by lot to caius to go there as quaestor to the consul oreste it be say that he keep quiet when tiberius be kill and intend to steer clear of politics but one of those splendid burst of oratory with which he have already electrify the people remain to show over what he be for ever brooding ` they slew he ' he cry ` these scoundrel slew tiberius my noble brother ah they be all of one pattern ' he say this in advocate the lex papirium which propose to make the re-election of a tribune legal but scipio oppose the law and it be defeat then to be carry however a few year later again in the year of he quaestorship he speak against the law of m junius pennus which aim at expel all peregrinus from rome they be the very man by whose help tiberius have carry he agrarian law and when caius speak for they he be clearly tread in he brother 's step at a later time he declare that he dream tiberius come to he and say ` why do you hesitate you can not escape you doom and mine -- to live for the people and die for they ' such a story would be effective in a speech and particularly effective when tell to a superstitious audience but he day-dream we may be sure be the cause and not the consequence of he vision of the night for there can be no doubt that the younger brother have already one purpose and one only -- to avenge the death of tiberius and carry out he design such omen as roman credulity fasten on when the political air be heavy with come storm abound now with grave irony the historian record : ` besides shower of oil and milk in the neighborhood of veii a fact of which some people may doubt a owl it be say be see on the capitol which may have be true ' fulvius flaccus the friend of gracchus make the first move -lrb- sidenote : proposition of fulvius flaccus its significance -rrb- in order to buy off the opposition of the socius to the agrarian law he propose to give they the franchise just as licinius when he have offer the poor plebeian a material boon offer the rich one a political one so as to secure the united support of the whole body the proposal be significant and it be make at a critical time the poor italian be chafe no doubt at the suspension of the agrarian law the rich be indignant at the carrying of the law of pennus other and deeper cause of irritation have be mention above in the year of the proposal of flaccus and very likely in consequence of its rejection fregella -- a latin colony -- revolt -lrb- sidenote : revolt and punishment of fregella -rrb- the revolt be punish with the ferocity of panic the town be destroy a roman colony fabraterium be plant near its site and for the moment italian discontent be awed into sullen silence no wonder the senate be panic-stricken here be a real omen not conjure up by superstition that one of those town which through rome 's darkest fortune in the second punic war have remain faithful to she should single-handed and in time of peace raise the standard of rebellion be fregellae indeed single-handed the senate suspect not and turn furiously on the gracchan party and it be allege accuse caius of complicity with the revolt -lrb- sidenote : caius gracchus accuse of treason he stand for the tribunate -rrb- it be rash provocation to give to such a man at such a time if he be accuse he be acquit and he at once stand for the tribunate thus the party which have slay he brother find itself again at death-grip with a even abler and more implacable foe -lrb- sidenote : prominence of gracchus at home and abroad -rrb- there be no doubt that for some time past caius gracchus young as he be and have as yet fill none of the regular high office have have the first place in all man 's thought he first speech have be receive by the people with wild delight he be already the greatest orator in rome he importance be show by the senate 's actually prolong the consul 's command in order to keep he quaestor longer abroad but he friend be console for he absence by the story they hear of the respect show to he by foreign nation the sardinian would not grant supplies to oreste and the senate approve they refusal but gracchus interpose and they voluntarily give what they have before appeal against micipsa son of masinissa also send corn to oreste but aver that it be out of respect to gracchus the senate 's fear and the esteem of foreigner be equally just what the life of gracchus be in sardinium he have himself tell we and from the imply contrast we may judge what be the life of the noble of the time -lrb- sidenote : he description of the life of a noble -rrb- ` my life ' he say to the people ` in the province be not plan to suit my ambition but you interest there be no gormandising with I no handsome slave in wait and at my table you son see more seemliness than at head-quarter no man can say without lie that i ever take a farthing as a present or put anyone to expense i be there two year and if a single courtesan ever cross my door or if proposal from I be ever make to anyone 's slave-pet set I down for the vilest and most infamous of man and if i be so scrupulous towards slave you may judge what my life must have be with you son and citizen here be the fruit of such a life i leave rome with a full purse and have bring it back empty other take out they wine jar full of wine and bring they back full of money ' such be the man who now come back to rome to demand from the aristocracy a reckoning for which he have be yearning with undying passion for nearly ten year a exaggerated contrast between he and tiberius at the expense of the latter have be previously condemn the man who originate be always so far greater than the man who imitate and caius only follow where he brother lead he be not greater than but only like he brother in he bravery in he culture in the faculty of inspiring in he friend strong enthusiasm and devotion in he unswerving pursuit of a definite object and as he send the son of fulvius flaccus to the senate just before he death prove in the tooth of all assertion to the contrary in he willingness to use he personal influence in order to avoid civil bloodshed -lrb- sidenote : caius compare with tiberius -rrb- the very dream which caius tell to the people show that he brother 's spell be still on he and he tell it together with he impetuous oratory and he avowed fatalism militate against the theory that tiberius be sway by impulse and sentiment and he by calculation and reason but no doubt he profit by experience of the past he have learn how to bide he time and to think generosity waste on the murderous crew whom he have swear to punish pure in life perfectly prepare for a death to which he consider himself foredoom glowing with one fervent passion he take up he brother 's cause with a double portion of he brother 's spirit because he have think more before action because he have greater natural eloquence and because be forewarn he be forearm in spite of the labor of recent historian the legislation of caius gracchus be still hard to understand where the original authority contradict each other as they often do probable conjecture be the most which can be attain and no attempt will be make here to specify what be the measure of the first tribunate of caius and what of the second -lrb- sidenote : the general purpose of the legislation of caius -rrb- the general scope and tendency of he legislation be clear enough it be to overthrow the senatorial government and in the new government to give the chief share of the executive power to the mercantile class and the chief share of the legislative power to the country class these be he immediate aim probably he mean to keep all the string he thus set in motion in he own hand so as to be practically monarch of rome but whether he definitely conceive the idea of monarchy and look beyond he own requirement picture to himself a successor at some future time inherit the authority which he have establish no one can say in such vast scheme there must have be much that be merely tentative but have he live and retain he influence we may be sure that the empire would have be establish a century earlier than it be -lrb- sidenote : date of the tribunate of caius December 10 bc 124 -rrb- rome be throng to overflow by the country class and the noble strain every nerve in opposition when caius be elect tribune he be only fourth on the list out of ten and enter on he office on December 10 bc 124 with a fix presentiment of he own fate he feel that even if he wish to remain passive the people would not permit he to be so he might he say have plead that he and he young child be the last representative of a noble line -- of p africanus and tiberius gracchus -- and that he have lose a brother in the people 's cause but the people would not have listen to the plea it have be say that he mother dissuade he from he intention but the fragment on which the statement be base be as likely as not spurious and cornelium 's fortitude after she have lose both she son would hardly have be show by one capable of subordinate public to private interest -lrb- sidenote : story of he mother 's sentiment -rrb- it be far more likely that when in he stir speech he speak of he home as no place for he to visit while he mother be weep and in despair he be influence by she adjuration to avenge he brother and not by any craven warning against share he fate however this may have be no timid influence could be trace in the fiery passion of he first speech -lrb- sidenote : story of the means by which he modulate he voice when speak -rrb- he be in fact so carry away by he feeling that he have to resort to a curious device in order to keep he voice under control a man with a musical instrument use it be say to stand near he and warn he by a note at time if he be pitch he voice too high or too low it be now that he tell he story of the flogging of the magistrate of teanum and the murder of the venusian herdsman and we can imagine how they would incense he hearer against the noble against one of they octavius he specially direct a law make it illegal for any magistrate previously depose by the people to be elect to office but this at cornelium 's suggestion it be say he withdraw another law also have special reference to the fate of tiberius it make illegal the trial of any citizen for a offence which involve the loss of he civic rights without the consent of the people -lrb- sidenote : caius procure the banishment of popillius laena -rrb- this law if in force would have prevent the ferocity with which popillius laena hunt down the partisan of tiberius and caius follow it up accord to the oration de domo by procure against popillius a sentence of outlawry one of the fragment from he speech be probably speak at this time in it he tell the people that they now have the chance they have so long and so passionately desire and that if they do not avail themselves of it they would lay themselves open to the charge of caprice or of ungoverned temper popillius anticipate the sentence by voluntary retirement from rome -lrb- sidenote : he lex frumentarium -rrb- have satisfy he conscience by the performance of what no doubt seem to he sacred duty caius at once set to work to build up he new constitution it be commonly represent that in order to gain over the people to he side he cynically bribe they by he lex frumentarium now if this be true and caius be as clear-sighted as the same writer who insist on the badness of the law describe he to have be it be hard to see how they can in the same breath eulogise he goodness and nobleness to gain he end he would have be use vile means and would have be a vile man -lrb- sidenote : the common criticism on it unjust -rrb- look however more closely into the law we be lead to doubt whether it be bad or at all event even grant that eventually it lead to evil whether it would have appear likely to do so to caius the public land it must be remember be liable to a impost call vectigal this vectigal go into the aerarium which the noble have at they disposal now the law of caius appear to have fix a nominal price for corn to all roman citizen and if the market price be above this price the difference would have to be make good from the aerarium we at once see the object of caius and how the justice of it might have blind he to the demoralising effect of he measure ` the public land ' he say in effect ` belong to all roman and so do the vectigal if you take that to which you have no right you shall give it back again in cheap corn ' in short it be a clever device for partially neutralise the long misappropriation of the state 's property by the noble and for give to the people what belong to the people -- to each man as it be so many ear of corn from whatever fraction would be he own share of the land -lrb- sidenote : contrast between the just proposal of caius and the demagogy of drusus -rrb- when drusus be afterwards set up to outbid caius he propose that the vectigal should be remit and that the land that have be assign might be sell by the occupier how this would catch the farmer 's fancy be as obvious as be its odious dishonesty it be dishonest to the state because it be only fair that each occupier should contribute to its fund and because it do away with the hope of fill italy with free husbandman it be dishonest to the occupier himself because it put in he way the worst temptation to unthriftiness when caius renew he brother 's law he purposely charge the land distribute to the poor with a yearly vectigal how different be this from the mere demagogic trick of drusus it appear then that the lex frumentarium of caius be not the indefensible measure which modern writer fill with modern notion have call it it have moreover be well say that it be a kind of poor-law and even if bad in itself may have be the least bad remedy for the pauperism which not caius but senatorial misgovernment have bring about no doubt it confer popularity on caius and no doubt he popularity be acceptable to he but there be no ground for believe that he noble nature deliberately stoop to demoralise the mob for selfish motive -lrb- sidenote : he lex judiciarium -rrb- one great party however he have thus win over to he side the lex judiciarium gain over the equite also it have be before explain that the equite at this time be non-senatorial rich man senator be forbid by law to mix in commerce though no doubt they evade the law between the senatorial and moneyed class there be a natural ill-will which caius proceed to use and increase he exact procedure we do not know for certain accord to some authority he make the judice eligible from the equite only instead of from the senate in the epitome of livy it be state that 600 of the equite be to be add to the number of the senator so that the equite should have twice as much power as the senate itself this at first sight seem nonsense but caius may have propose that for judicial purpose 600 equite should form as it be a second chamber which be twice as numerous would permit two judice for every senatorial judex in form he may have devise that ` counter-senate ' which as it have be show he in fact create -lrb- sidenote : the effect of it the senate abase the equite exalt -rrb- but whether caius provide that all the judice or only two-third of they should be choose from the equite and in whatever way he do so he do succeed in exalt the moneyed class and abase the senate in civil process and in the permanent and temporary commission for the administration of justice the equite be henceforth supreme even the senator themselves depend on they verdict for acquittal or condemnation and the chief power in the state have change hand of course the change would not be feel at once to the full but this be the most trenchant stroke which gracchus aim at the senate 's power here again it be customary to write of he action as if they be govern solely by feel quite apart from all consideration of right and wrong but cicero declare that for nearly fifty year while the equite discharge this office there be not even the slightest suspicion of a single eque be bribe in he capacity as judex and after every allowance have be make for ciceronian exaggeration the statement may at least warrant we in believe that gracchus have some reason for hope that he change would be a change for the better even if as appian declare it turn out in the end just the opposite indeed it be beyond question that as the province be govern by the senatorial class judice who have to decide case like those of cotta would be more fairly choose from the equite than from the class to which cotta belong -lrb- sidenote : the taxation of asia -rrb- we know little of the arrangement for the taxation of asia make by gracchus he provide that the tax should be let by auction at rome which would undoubtedly be a boon to the roman capitalist and a check to provincial competition he be say also to have substitute the whole system of direct and indirect tax for the previously exist system of fixed payment by the various state there be a certain narrowness about the conception of both the gracchus with regard to the transmarine world which be common to all roman to which for instance tiberius give expression when he speak of the conquest of the whole world as a thing which he audience have a right to expect and this sentiment may have in this instance influence caius to use harshness -lrb- sidenote : the common criticism on the measure of caius unjust -rrb- but even here to condemn without more knowledge of he measure would be unjust fixed payment it must be remember be not always preferable to tithe of the produce in a sterile year the payer of vectigalium would be best off again if a rich province like asia do not pay tribute in proportion to other province a re-adjustment of its tax would not seem to the roman unfair and perhaps auction at rome would after all be less mischievous than a hole-and-corner arrangement in the province if the sheep be to be fleece they would not be shear closest in the capital -lrb- sidenote : measure for the relief of publicanus -rrb- to another of he provision at all event no one could object -- the one which give relief to such publicanus as have suffer loss in collect the revenue -lrb- sidenote : allege privilege confer on the equite -rrb- gracchus have thus raise the equite above the senate at rome in the court of justice and open a golden harvest to they in the province it be conjecture that he also give they the distinction of a golden finger-ring and reserve seat at the public spectacles two class be thus gratify the city poor and the city rich -lrb- sidenote : caius attempt to conciliate the farmer class and the italian -rrb- but gracchus have to deal also with those of the country class in whose favor he brother 's agrarian law have be pass and with those who have resent the law to provide for the former he renew the operation of he brother 's law which have be suspend by scipio 's intervention and probably take away its administration from the consul and restore it to triumvir and as that might be insufficient he begin the establishment of many colony in various part of the peninsula and even beyond it at carthage to which he invite colonist from all part of italy to compensate and benefit the latter he propose to give they the franchise so as to secure they from such outrage as that of teanum for though such of they as belong to roman colony or municipium possess the franchise already the mass of the latin and italian do not possess it there be different account of this measure but appian say that he wish to give the latinus the jus suffragius and jus honorum and to the rest of the italian the jus suffragius only but here he reckon without he host -lrb- sidenote : feeling at rome -rrb- the boon of colony and cheap bread and the prospect of a slice out of the public land occupy by italian be all not strong enough to overcome the deep ingrained prejudice against extend the franchise rich and poor roman meet here on the common ground of narrow pride and the offence cause by this wise project probably pave the way for the tribune 's fall in speaking of the motive which induce tiberius to seek the tribunate a second time -lrb- p 33 -rrb- it have be say that he be not influence by personal consideration but want time to carry out he measure this view be confirm by what appian say about caius namely that he be elect a second time for already a law have be enact to this effect that if a tribune could not find time for execute in he tribunate what he have promise the people might give the office to he again in preference to anyone else this have be pronounce to be a blunder on appian 's part but without adequate reason it be in fact the natural and inevitable law which caius would insist on first and he would plead for it precisely on the grounds which appian state it be also clear that such a law once pass make virtual monarchy at rome possible -lrb- sidenote : other measure of caius -rrb- in fact the other measure of caius be both worthy of a great and wise monarch and might with good reason be think to be design to lead to monarchy -lrb- sidenote : road granary soldier ' uniform age for service -rrb- he construct magnificent road -- along which it would be whisper he voter might come more easily to rome he build public granary he give the soldier clothing at the cost of the state he make seventeen the minimum age for service in the army he himself superintend the plantation of he own colony everywhere he make he finger feel but whether this be of set purpose or only from he constitutional energy it be hard to decide he chief object however be to overthrow the senate and we have not yet exhaust the list of he assault upon it -lrb- sidenote : change in nomination to province -rrb- hitherto it have be the custom for the senate to name the consular province for the next year after the election of the consul which mean that if a favorite be consul a rich province be give to he and if not a poor one caius enact that the consular province should be name before the election of the consul by way perhaps of soften this restriction he take away from the tribune they veto on the naming of the consular province -lrb- sidenote : alleged change in the order of voting -rrb- he be further suppose though on slender evidence to have change the order of voting in the comitium centuria formerly the first class vote first now the order of voting first be to be settle by lot and so the influence of the rich would be diminish -lrb- sidenote : general criticism of he scheme -rrb- such in outline be the grand scheme of caius gracchus if he be less single-minded in he aim than he brother he could hardly help be so and have to reconcile so many conflict interest he may have swerve from what would have be he own ideal but that he main purpose be to break down a rotten system and establish a sound one on its ruin and that no petty motive of expediency guide he but only the one principle ` salus populi suprema lex ' be incontrovertible when we think of he so eloquent resolute and energetic conceive such great project and execute they in person make the regeneration of he country he lodestar in spite of he ever-present belief that he would in the end fall by the same fate as he brother we think of he as one of the noblest figure in history -- a purer and less selfish julius caesar -lrb- sidenote : machination of the noble -rrb- as the petty act of the noble have bring out into relief the large policy of tiberius so it be now they resort to even lower trick than accusation of tyranny and find in the fatuity or dishonesty of drusus a tool even more effective than nasica 's brutality the plantation of a colony at carthage be look at askance by many roman it be the first colony plant out of italy and the superstitious be fill with foreboding which the senate eagerly exaggerate such colony have repeatedly out-grown and overtop the parent state the ground have be solemnly curse and the restoration of the town forbid when the first standard be set up by the colonist a blast of wind it be say blow it down and scatter the flesh of the victim and wolf have tear up the stake that mark out the site such malicious story meet with readier credence because if it be true that caius have call for colonist from all italy and junonium be to be a roman colony he be evade the decree of the people against extend the franchise and he be thus admit to it by a side-wind those to whom it have just in the harshest manner be refuse for when the vote have be take every man not have a vote have be expel from the city and forbid to come within five mile of it till the voting be over caius have come to live in the forum instead of on the palatine when he return to rome among he friend as he think and still even in little matter he stand forward as the champion of the poor against the rich there be go to be a show of gladiator in the forum and the magistrate have enclose the arena with bench which they mean to hire out caius ask they to remove the bench and on they refusal go the night before the show and take they all away anyone who have witness modern athletic sport and observe how a crowd will hem in the competitor so that only a few spectator can see although a equally good view can be obtain by a great number if the ring be enlarged will perceive caius 's object and be slow to admit that he spoil the show but though such act please the people all of they have not forgive he the proposition about the franchise and he popularity be on the wane -lrb- sidenote : drusus outbid caius -rrb- the senate have suborn one of he colleague m livius drusus to outbid he either drusus think he be guide the senate into a larger policy when he be himself merely the senate 's puppet and this he son 's career make probable or he be cynically dishonest and unscrupulous caius have meditate it may be many colony but accord to plutarch have at this time only actually settle two drusus propose to plant twelve each of 3000 citizen caius have superintend the settlement himself and employ he friend with virtuous self-denial drusus wash he hand of all such patronage caius have impose a yearly tax on those to whom he give land drusus propose to remit it caius have wish to give the latin the franchise drusus reply by a comparatively ridiculous favor which however might appeal more directly to the lower class of latin no latin he say should be liable to be flog even when serve in the army drusus could afford to be liberal he colony be sham colony he remission of the vectigal be a thin-coated poison he promise to the latin be at best a cheap one and be not carry out but none the less he treachery or imbecility serve its purpose and the greedier and baser of the partisan of gracchus begin to look coldly on they leader -lrb- sidenote : caius reject for the tribunate -rrb- it be state indeed that on he standing for the tribunate a third time he be reject by fraud he colleague have make a false return of the name of the candidate in any case he be not elect and one of the consul for the year 121 be l opimius he mortal foe the end be draw near sadly caius must have recognize that he presentiment would soon be fulfil and that he must share he brother 's fate -lrb- sidenote : preparation for civil strife -rrb- he foe propose to repeal the law for the settlement of junonium and accord to plutarch other of he law also warn by the past he friend arm man come disguise as reaper to defend he it be likely enough that they be really reaper who would remember why tiberius lose he life and that they support would have save he fulvius be address the people about the law when caius attend by some of he partisan come to the capitol he do not join the meeting but begin walk up and down under a colonnade to wait its issue here a man name antyllus who be sacrifice probably in behalf of opimius the consul either insult the gracchan and be stab by they or catch hold of caius 's hand or by some other familiarity or importunity provoke some hasty word or gesture from he upon which he be stab by a servant as soon as the deed be do the people run away and caius hasten to the assembly to explain the affair but it begin to rain heavily and for this and because of

deeply committed and send he son back again upon which opimius seize he and at once march to the aventine there be a fight in which fulvius be beat and with another son flee and hide himself in a bath

afterwards he put to death 3000 man many of whom be innocent but whom he would not allow to speak in they defense the house of caius and fulvius be sack and the property of the slay be confiscate then

recall popillius from exile when opimius be arraign for ` perduellio ' or misuse of he official power to compass the death of a citizen they procure he acquittal but when carbo be accuse of the same

that spurius borius impose the vectigal it be assume that cicero confused name that the spurius borius of appian be spurius thorius and that the tribune whom cicero call thorius be really quite another person however that may be the law would benefit the rich because the rich would be owner of the land certain provision of it be directly mean to prevent opposition in the country for if many of the poor farmer would grumble at be oust from they land the land which have be specially assign to latin town and of which tiberius gracchus have threaten to dispossess they be leave in the same state as before he legislation that be to say the senate do not give the occupier a indefeasible title but it do not meddle with they moreover it amply indemnify the socius and latinus who have surrender land for the colony of caius while some compensation be give to poor farmer by a clause that in future a man might only graze ten large and fifty smaller beast on the pasture of what still

which could not be confer by a consul but only by a king \* \* \* \* \* chapter vii saturninus and drusus -lrb- sidenote : attitude of marius -rrb- with such a weapon in he hand marius come back to rome intoxicate with success he think he march in two continent worthy to be compare with the progress of bacchus and have a cup make on the model of that of the god he speak badly he be easily disconcert by the disapproval of a audience he have no insight into the evil or any project for the reformation of the state but the scorn of man like metellus have make he throw himself on the support of the people from whom he spring and they idolise he for he dazzling exploit as a soldier look to he as they natural leader and the creator of a new era indeed it need no stimulus from without to whet he ambitious craving that seventh consulship which superstition whisper would be surely he he have yet to win and in all he after conduct he seem to have be guide by the most vulgar selfishness which in the end become murderous insanity but while he hope to use all party for he own advancement -- a game in which he of all man be least qualify to succeed -- other and abler politician be bent on use he for the overthrow of the optimate -lrb- sidenote : saturninus -rrb- the harangue of memmius have show that the spirit of the gracchus be still alive in rome and now lucius apuleius saturninus take up they revolutionary project with a violence to which they have be averse but for which the act of they adversary have become a fatal precedent of saturninus himself we do not know much more than that he be a eloquent speaker and a resolute though not over-scrupulous man at a time when to be scrupulous be equivalent to self-martyrdom or self-effacement -lrb- sidenote : glaucium -rrb- in something of the same relation in which camille desmoulin stand to danton caius servilius glaucium a wit and favorite of the people stand towards the sombre and imperious saturninus and both hope to effect they aim by the aid of marius if they be to be judge by they act alone we can hardly condemn they -lrb- sidenote : defense of they policy -rrb- they try to do what the gracchus have attempt before they what drusus attempt after they and what when they and drusus have fall as the gracchus have fall the social war finally effect no historian have give sufficient prominence to the fact that it be primarily a country movement of which each of these man be the leader a movement of unbroken continuity though each use he own means and have he own special temperament if this be keep in view we shall no longer consider with some modern historian that no event perhaps in roman history be so sudden so unconnected and accordingly so obscure in its original cause as this revolt or conspiracy of saturninus like caius gracchus saturninus represent rural as oppose to urban interest and the interest of the province as oppose to those of the capital like caius too he endeavor to conciliate the equite but they have all the roman prejudice against admit italian to a level with themselves and the attempt to play off party against party utterly fail in vain saturninus try to defy opposition by enlist the support of the marian veteran the rich the noble and the city mob unite against he and when he seize the capitol it be to defend himself against all three in the year 100 bc marius be consul for the sixth time glaucium be praetor and saturninus be a second time tribune a triumvirate so powerful might if unite have overthrow the constitution but the vanity and vacillation of marius be the best ally of the optimate and it be no grown man but caius julius caesar a child bear in that same year who be destine to subvert they rule -lrb- sidenote : the lex servilium the equite and the judicium -rrb- saturninus have be instrumental in secure the election of marius to he fifth consulship in 102 and it be about that time that the lex servilium be carry this law define the liability of roman official to trial for extortion in the province and by a process of elimination -lrb- for senator worker for hire and other be expressly declare ineligible -rrb- practically leave to the equite the jurisdiction in such trial whether or no the law of gracchus have be repeal by another servilian law -- that of q servilius caepio -- we can not say for certain if so the second servilian law repeal the first but whether it restore power to the equite or only confirm they in it in theory it leave the office of judex open to all citizen for while it exclude so many citizen that in practice the judicium be close to all but the equestrian class it do not assign the office to any one class in particular it also provide that anyone not a citizen who win he suit against a official should by virtue of do so obtain the citizenship -lrb- sidenote : threefold purpose of the lex servilium -rrb- so that we may trace in this law a threefold policy -- a attempt -lrb- 1 -rrb- to relieve the provincial by make prosecution for extortion easy and even put a premium on they -lrb- 2 -rrb- to conciliate the equite -lrb- 3 -rrb- to pave the way for the overthrow of class jurisdiction by nominally at least leave the judicium open to all who do not come under specify restriction cicero inveigh against glaucium as a demagogue of the hyperbolus stamp but there be more of the statesman than the demagogue in this law when saturninus be a candidate for the tribunate he and glaucium be say to have set on man to murder nonius another candidate who they fear might use he veto to thwart they project marius have be previously elect consul and support saturninus in he candidature as saturninus have support he -lrb- sidenote : personal reason for marius join saturninus -rrb- marius may have be induce to enter into this alliance by the desire to gratify a personal grudge for the rival candidate have be the man he most detested q metellus and the first measure of saturninus be a compliment to he and a direct blow aim at metellus -lrb- sidenote : agrarian law of saturninus -rrb- this be a agrarian law which would benefit the marian veteran and as it contain a proviso that any senator refuse to swear to observe it within five day should be expel from the senate it would be sure to drive metellus from rome but if there be diplomacy in this measure of saturninus there be sagacity also what discontent be seethe in italy the social war soon prove and this be a attempt to appease it saturninus have previously propose allotment in africa now he propose to allot land in transalpine gaul sicily achaium and macedonium and to supply the colonist with a outfit from the treasure take from tolosa marius be to have the allotment of the land -lrb- sidenote : difficulty about this agrarian law -rrb- there be a difficulty as to these colony which no history solve they be roman colony to which only roman citizen be eligible and yet the roman populace oppose the law the italian on the contrary carry it by violence some have cut the knot by suppose that though the colony be roman italian be to be admit to they but there be another possible explanation it be certain that many italian pass as citizen at rome in 187 bc 12000 latin pass as roman citizen have be oblige to quit rome in 95 bc there be another clearance of alien which be one of the immediate cause of the social war fictitious citizen might have find it easy to obtain allotment from a consul whose ear if first make deaf by the din of arm have never since recover they hearing however this may be it be the rural party which by violence procure a preponderance of vote at the ballot-box and it be the town populace which resist what it feel to be a invasion of its prerogative by the man from the country -lrb- sidenote : exile of metellus -rrb- marius be say to have get rid of metellus by a trick he pretend that he would not take the oath which the law demand but when metellus have say the same thing tell the senate that he would swear to obey the law as far as it be a law in order to induce the rural voter to leave rome and metellus scorn such a subterfuge go into exile -lrb- sidenote : corn-law of saturninus -rrb- another law of saturninus either renew the corn-law of caius gracchus or go farther and make the price of grain merely nominal this law be no doubt mean to recover the favor of the city mob which he have forfeit by he agrarian law but caepio son probably of the hero of tolosa stop the voting by force and the law be not carry -lrb- sidenote : law of treason -rrb- the third law of saturninus be a lex de majestate a law by which anyone could be prosecute for treason against the state and which be not improbably aim specially at caepio who be impeach under it it seem at any rate certain that of these law the agrarian be the chief and the other subsidiary in other word that he and glaucium be work together on a organize plan and strive to admit the whole roman world into a community of rights with rome they think that with the marian soldier at they back they would be safer than gracchus with he band of reaper and so they may have take the initiative in violence from which both by past event and the act of man like caepio it be certain that the optimate would not shrink it be difficult to apportion the blame in such case -lrb- sidenote : civil strife saturninus seize the capitol -rrb- but when glaucium stand for the consulship of 99 and he rival memmius a favorite with the people be murder a attack be make on saturninus who hastily send for aid to he rural supporter and seize the capitol he find then that in reckon on marius he have make a fatal blunder that selfish intriguer have be alarm by the popular favor show to a impostor name equitius who give out that he be the son of tiberius gracchus and who be imprison by marius be release by the people and elect tribune he may have be jealous too of the popularity of saturninus with he own veteran and at the same time anxious to curry favor with the foe of saturninus -- the urban populace -lrb- sidenote : marius turn on he friend -rrb- so instead of boldly join he late ally he become the general of the opposite party drive saturninus and he friend from the forum and when they have surrender suffer they to be pelt to death in the curia hostilium where he have place they -lrb- sidenote : death of saturninus and glaucium -rrb- saturninus it be say have be proclaimed king before he death if so he have at least strike for a crown consistently and boldly and even if he attempt for the moment unite the senatorial party and the equite while the city mob stand wavering or hostile he might nevertheless have forestall the empire by a century have marius only have half he enterprise or nerve in a epoch of revolution it be idle to judge man by a ordinary standard how far personal ambition and how far a nobler ideal animated saturninus no man can say those who condemn he must condemn cromwell too for the moment the power of the optimate seem restore the spectre of monarchy have make the man of riches coalesce with they old rival the man of rank and the mob ungrateful for a unexecuted corn-law chafe at italian pretension metellus the aristocrat be recall to rome amid the enthusiasm of the anti-italian mob and p furius be tear to piece for have oppose he return -lrb- sidenote : marius fall into disrepute -rrb- marius slink away to the east finding that he treachery have only isolate he and bring he into contempt and there it be say he try to incite mithridate to war sextus titius indeed bring forward a agrarian law in 99 bc but he be oppose by he colleague and drive into exile two event soon happen which show not only the embittered feeling exist between the urban and rural population but also the sympathy with the provincial feel by the better roman and as a inference the miserable condition of the provincial themselves -lrb- sidenote : the lex licinium minucium -rrb- the first be the enactment in 95 bc of the lex licinium minucium which order latin and italian resident at rome to leave the city -lrb- sidenote : and the prosecution of rutilius rufus foreshadow the social war -rrb- the second be the prosecution and conviction of publius rutilius rufus nominally for extortion but really because by he just administration of the province of asia he have rebuke extortion and the equestrian court which connive at it though most of the senator be as guilty as the equite the mass like m scaurus who be himself impeach for extortion would ill brook be force to appear before they court and be eager to take hold of they maladministration of justice as a pretext for abrogate the servilian law -lrb- sidenote : drusus attempt a reform -rrb- one more attempt at reform be to be make this time by one of the senate 's own member but only to be once more defeat by rancorous party-spirit and besotted urban pride marcus livius drusus be son of the man whom the senate have put forward to outbid caius gracchus he be a haughty upright man of a impetuous temper -- such a man as often become the tool of less courageous but more dexterous intriguer m scaurus have be impeach for take bribe in asia and it be say that in he disgust he egg on drusus to restore the judicium to the senate drusus be probably one of those man whom a aristocracy in its decadence not rarely produce -lrb- sidenote : attitude of drusus -rrb- he dislike the preponderance of the moneyed class he could not feel the vulgar roman 's antipathy to give italian the franchise for he see it exercise by man who be in he eye infinitely more contemptible he dislike also and despise the vice of he own order mistake the crafty suggestion of scaurus for a genuine appeal to high motive flatter by it and by the confidence of the italian he think that he could educate he party and by he personal influence induce it to do justice to italy but this conservative advocate of reform be not wily enough tactician for the time in which he live or the change which he meditate he attempt to improve on the device of saturninus and gracchus be miserable failure and the senator who use he or be influence by he shrink from he side when they see he follow to they logical issue the principle which they have advocate either for selfish object or only theoretically -lrb- sidenote : main object of drusus to aid the italian -rrb- whether this be the true view of the character and position of drusus or not we may feel sure that he be in earnest in he advocacy of italian interest and that this be the main object of he reform -lrb- sidenote : sop to the mob : depreciation of the coinage colony corn-law -rrb- to silence the mob at rome he slightly depreciate the coinage so as to relieve debtor establish some colony -- perhaps those promise by he father -- and carry some law for distribute cheap grain -lrb- sidenote : sop to the senate and equite -rrb- senator like scaurus he court by hand over the judicium once more to the senate while by admit 300 equite to the senate he hope to compensate they for the wound which he thus inflict on they material interest and they pride the body thus compose be to try case of judice accuse of take bribe but the senate scorn and yet fear the threaten invasion by which it would be sever into two antagonistic half the equite leave behind be jealous of the equite promote and where drusus hope to conciliate both class he only draw down they unite animosity upon himself even in italy he plan be not unanimously approve occupier of the public land who have never yet be disturb in they occupation -- such as those who hold the campanian domain land -- be alarm by this plan of colonisation which not only call in question once more they right of tenure but even appropriate they land but though the large land-owner be adverse to he the great mass of the italian be on he side and it be by they help that he carry the first three of he law which he shrewdly include in one measure thus those who want land or grain be constrain to vote for the change in the judicium also but as there be a law expressly forbid this admixture of different measure in one bill he leave a opening for he opponent of which they soon take advantage -lrb- sidenote : philippus oppose drusus -rrb- chief of these opponent be the consul philippus when the italian crowd into rome to support drusus which they would do by overawe voter at the ballot-box by record fictitious vote and by escort drusus about so as to lend he the support which a apparent majority always confer philippus come forward as the champion of the opposite side he seem to have be a turncoat with a fluent tongue and few principle he have no sympathy with the generous if flighty liberalism of the party of drusus no doubt it seem to he weak sentimentalism and he openly say that he must take counsel with other people as he could not carry on the government with such a senate accordingly he appeal to the worst roman prejudice viz the selfishness of large occupier and the anti-italian sentiment of the mob this explain he be number among the popular party with which the italian party be not now identical drusus when he subsidiary measure have prove abortive grow desperate as he influence in the senate wane he enter into closer alliance with the italian who on they part bind themselves by a oath to treat as they friend or enemy each friend or enemy of drusus and it be conjecture from a fragment of diodorus that 10000 of they lead by pompaedius silo arm with dagger set out for rome to demand the franchise but be persuade to desist from they undertaking -lrb- sidenote : drusus almost monarch -rrb- monarchy seem once more imminent and now as in the case of gracchus it be impossible to say whether the attitude of the champion of reform be due to the force of circumstance or to settle design but philippus be equal to the occasion he induce the senate to annul the law of drusus already carry and summon the occupier of the public land whom that law affect to come and confront the italian in rome -lrb- sidenote : assassination of drusus -rrb- a battle in the street would have no doubt ensue but it be prevent by the assassination of drusus who be one evening stab mortally in he own house it be say that when die he ejaculate that it would be long before the state have another citizen like he he seem to have have much of the disinterested spirit of caius gracchus though with far inferior ability and like he he leave a mother cornelium to do honor by she fortitude to the memory of she son that year the presentiment of come political convulsion find expression in report of supernatural prodigy while ` sign

victorious occupation but the loyalty which no external or sudden shock could snap have be slowly eat away by corrosive which the arrogance or negligence of the government supply -lrb- sidenote : interest of italian capitalist and italian farmer oppose -rrb- it be clear from the episode of drusus that there be as wide a breach between italian capitalist and cultivator as there have be between roman occupier and the first clamourer for agrarian law so at the outbreak of the war umbrium and etrurium whence philippus have summon he supporter because the farmer class have be annihilate and large land-owner hold the soil remain faithful to rome but where the farmer class still flourish as among the marsus marrucinus and the adjacent district discontent have be gather volume for many year no doubt the demoralisation of the metropolis contribute to this result and as intercourse with rome become more and more common familiarity with the vice of they master would breed indignation in the mind of the hardier dependent who they would ask themselves be these scaurus these philippus man fit only to murder patriot and sell they country and themselves for gold that they should lord it over italian why should a roman soldier have the right of appeal to a civil tribunal and a italian soldier be at the mercy of martial law why should two italian for every one roman be force to fight rome 's battle why should insolent young roman and the fine lady of the metropolis insult italian magistrate and murder italian of humbler rank this be the reward of they long fidelity if here and there a statesman be willing to yield they the franchise the flower of the aristocracy the scaevola and the crassus expel they by a alien act from rome they have try all party and by all be disappoint for roman faction be unite on one point and one only -- in obstinate refusal to give italian justice the two glorious brother have be slay because they pity they wrong so have scipio so have the fearless saturninus and now they last friend this second scipio drusus have be strike down by the same cowardly hand surely it be time to act for themselves and avenge they benefactor they be more numerous they be hardier than they tyrant and if not so well organize still by they union with drusus they be in some sort weld together and now or never be the time to strike for the friend of drusus be

disintegration which the social war have bring on italy be faithfully reproduce in rome there too every man 's hand be against he neighbor creditor and debtor tribune and consul senate and anti-senate fiercely confront each other personal interest have become so much more prominent and old party-division be so confuse by the scheme of italianise politician aristocratic in they connexion but cleave to part at least of the traditional democratic program that it be very hard to see where the view of one faction blended with those of another and where they clash -lrb- sidenote : the sulpician revolution difficult to understand -rrb- still harder be it to dissect the character of individual to decide for instance how far a man like sulpicius be sway by disinterested principle and how far he fight for he own hand we need not make too much of the fact that he appeal to force because violence be the order of the day and submission to the law simply mean submission to the law of force but there be some part of he career apparently so inconsistent as almost to defy explanation which in any case can be little more than guesswork -lrb- sidenote : sulpicius -rrb- publius sulpicius rufus be now in the prime of life have be bear in 124 bc he be a aristocrat a orator of great force and fire and a friend of drusus whose view he share and inherit cicero speak of he in no grudging term ` of

theatrical about they and he oratory though quick and fluent be neither redundant nor verbose ' -lrb- sidenote : financial crisis at rome -rrb- the year before he tribunate have be a turbulent one at rome the social war and asiatic disturbance have bring about a financial crisis debtor hard press by they creditor invoke obsolete penalty against usury in they defense and the creditor because the praetor asellio attempt to submit the question to trial murder he in the open forum the debtor respond by a cry for _ tabula novae _ or a sweeping remission of all debt of these debtor many doubtless would belong to the lower order but from a proposal of sulpicius make the next year it appear probable that some be find in the rank of the senate war have make money ` tight ' to use the phraseology of we modern stock exchange and reckless extravagance could no longer be support by borrowing -lrb- sidenote : sulpicius the successor of drusus -rrb- sulpicius inherit the policy of drusus which be to reconstruct the senatorial government on a italian basis like drusus he have to conciliate prejudice in order to carry out he design plutarch say that he go about with 600 man of the equestrian order whom he call he anti-senate no doubt it be to please these equite who would belong to the party of creditor that he propose that no one should be a senator who owe more than 2000 denarius no doubt too he would have fill the vacancy thus create by the expulsion of reckless anti-italian optimate from the rank of these equite just as drusus have do -lrb- sidenote : he attempt to remodel the government -rrb- just like drusus too he have to court the proletariate and this he do by propose to enrol freedman in the tribe this as they be generally dependent on man of he own order he could do without prejudice to the new-modelled aristocracy which he be attempt to organize he also propose to grant a amnesty to those who have be exile by the lex varium hope no doubt to gain more by the adherent who would return to rome than he would lose by the return of man like varius himself he have oppose such a amnesty before but on such a point he might have easily change he view especially if a strong cry be be raise by the friend of the exile he have a personal feud with the julian family because he have oppose caesar 's illegal candidature for the consulship but have fortify himself by such alliance he proceed to carry out the main design of drusus namely the complete enfranchisement of the italian -lrb- sidenote : pro-italian measure of sulpicius -rrb- this perhaps would be especially distasteful to the julius as supersede the lex julium and the lex plautium papirium which to they no doubt seem ample and more than ample concession sulpicius on the other hand and the minority of the senate which side with he see that under the cover of clemency a grievous wrong be be do for not only be the italian who have submit since the term of the lex plautium take effect without the franchise but from the fact of they rebellion they have lose they old privilege as ally state even those who have benefit by these concession have benefit only in name as they vote in new tribe they vote be valueless and often would not be record at all for a majority on most question would be assure long before it come to they turn to vote to a statesman imbue with the view of drusus such a distribution of the franchise must have seem impolitic trickery and like drusus sulpicius resort to questionable means in order to gain the end on which he have set he heart rome be thus break up into two camp not as of yore broadly mark off by palpable distinction of rank property or privilege but each contain adherent of all sort and condition though in the senate the opponent of sulpicius have the majority when sulpicius propose to enrol the italian in the old tribe the consul proclaim a justitium or suspension of all public business for some religious observance it be say by some modern writer that the object of sulpicius in propose to enrol the italian in the old tribe be to secure the election of marius to the command against mithridate it be certain indeed that marius long for it -lrb- sidenote : attitude of marius -rrb- daily he be to be see in the campus martius exercise with the young man and though old and fat show himself nimble in arm and active on horseback -- conduct which excite some man 's good-humoured sympathy but shocked other who think he have much better go to baiae for the bath there and that such a exhibition be contemptible in one of he year sulpicius may have think marius quite fit for the command and be warrant in think so by the event of the social war but there be no more ground for suppose that the election of marius be he primary object than for consider plutarch 's diatribe a fair estimate of he character -lrb- sidenote : connection of marius and sulpicius explain -rrb- he be the friend and successor of drusus and he alliance with marius be a means to the end which in common with drusus he have in view and not the end itself this consideration be essential to a true understanding of the politics of the time and just make the difference whether sulpicius be a petty-minded adventurer or deliberately follow in the line lay down for he by a succession of statesman -lrb- sidenote : street-fighting -rrb- to the maneuver of

escape but he son be kill the other sullum annul the justitium but be say to have get off with he life only because marius generously give he shelter in he own house in these occurrence it be impossible not to see that the consul be the first to act unfairly sulpicius have be intend to bring forward he law in the regular fashion they thwart he by a trick whether he in anger give the signal for violence or whether as be quite as likely he italian partisan do not wait for he bidding the blame of the tumult lay at the door of the other side in such case he be not guiltiest who strike the first blow but he who have make blow inevitable -lrb- sidenote : the sulpician law carry by force -rrb- the law of sulpicius be carry -lrb- sidenote : sullum fly to the army which march on rome -rrb- sullum flee to the army and perhaps it be only now that sulpicius know or think that he know that sullum would march on rome carry a resolution in the popular assembly for make marius commander in the east two tribune be accordingly send to the camp at nolum to take the army from sulla he soldier immediately slew they and burn for the booty of asia and attach to they fortunate leader they when without venture to hint at the means by which he could avenge it he complain of the wrong do to he clamorously call on he to lead they to rome all he officer except one quaestor leave he but he set

and a third time the senate send to ask he intention ` to release rome from she tyrant ' be the grim reply then he vouchsafe a offer that the senate marius and sulpicius should meet he in the campus martius to come to term if this mean that he would come with he army at he back it be a absurd proposal if it mean that he would come alone it be a falsehood in either case it be a device to fritter away time -lrb- sidenote : sullum 's astuteness and superstition -rrb- for all the while that he be bandy meaningless message he continue he onward march he have sacrifice and the soothsayer postumius when he see the entrails have stretch out he hand to he and offer to be keep in chain for punishment after the battle if it be not a victory he too have himself see a vision of good omen bellona or another goddess have he dream put a thunderbolt in he hand and name he enemy one by one bid he strike they and they be consume to ash again envoy come from the senate forbid he to come within five mile of rome perhaps they still feel as secure in the immemorial freedom of the city from military rule as the english parliament do before cromwell 's _ coup d'tat _ again he amuse they and no doubt himself also with a falsehood and profess compliance follow close upon they heel with one legion he occupy the caelian gate with another under pompeius the colline gate with a third the pon sublicius

account for he moderation at this conjuncture and for he leave italy precisely when he enemy be again gather for a attack but the true one have never yet perhaps be suggest who be it that have make he supreme at rome the army what have be the bribe which have win it over a campaign in asia under the fortunate sullum without that army he be powerless nay he be a dead man therefore it be absolutely necessary to execute he pledge to the army which would have no keen desire to encounter its countryman in italy no doubt he covet the glory and spoil of the asiatic command but it be absurd to suppose that he would have quit italy now of he own free will he have no choice in the matter he be bind hand and foot by he promise to the soldier and all that he could do be by plausible moderation to win as many friend conciliate as many foe as possible throw on cinna whom he could not hope to keep quiet the guilt of perjury and trust to fortune for the rest this be a probable and consistent view of what now take place at rome and every other account make out sullum to have be either inconsistent which he never be for he be always uniformly selfish or patriotic which he never be if patriotism consist in sacrifice private to public consideration or indifferent which he be in principle but never in practice unless where he own interest be not threaten and only the suffering of other involve

order that as pontifex he might prevent he home be polluted by death he divorce she and remove she to another house while still alive soon afterwards he marry another wife who at a gladiatorial show come and pluck he sleeve in order as she say to obtain some of he good fortune -lrb- sidenote : he abdication -rrb- the rest of he life be spend near cuma in hunting write he memoirs amusing himself with actor and practise all sort of debauchery ten day before he die he settle the affair of the people of puteolus at they request and be busy in collect fund to restore the capitol up to the last -lrb- sidenote : he death -rrb- some say he die of the disease which destroy herod some say that there be no such disease other say that he break a blood-vessel when in a rage he be describe as have blue eye and a pale face so blotched over that it be liken to a mulberry sprinkle with meal -lrb- sidenote : rivalry of lepidus and pompeius -rrb- he death 78 bc be the signal for that break-up of he political institution to which he have wilfully shut he eye the great man at rome begin to wrangle over he very body before it be cold lepidus whom pompeius against sullum 's wish have help to the consulship oppose a public funeral the other consul support it sullum have with he usual shrewdness divine the character of lepidus and tell pompeius that he be only make a rival powerful pompeius oppose lepidus now for he know that the partisan of sullum would insist on do honor to he memory -lrb- sidenote : funeral of sullum -rrb- appian describe the funeral at length ` the body be bear on a litter adorn with gold and other royal array amid the flourish of trumpet and with a escort of cavalry after they follow a concourse of armed man he old soldier who have throng from all part and fall in with the procession as each come up besides these there be as vast a crowd of other man as be ever see at any funeral in front be carry the axis and the other symbol of office which have belong to he as dictator but it be not till the procession reach rome that the full splendor of the ceremonial be see more than 2000 crown of gold be bear in front gift from town from he old comrade in arm and he personal friend in every other respect too the pomp and circumstance of the funeral be past description in awe of the veteran all the priest of all the sacred fraternity be there in full robe with the vestal virgin and all the senator and all the magistrate each in he garb of office next in array that contrast with theirs come the knight of rome in column then all the man whom sulla have command in he war and who have vie with each other in hasten there carry gilded standard and silver-plated shield there be also a countless host of flute-player make now most tender now most wail music a cry of benediction raise by the senator be take up by the knight and the soldier and re-echoed by the people for some mourn he loss in reality and other fear the soldier and dread he in death as much as in life the present scene recall dreadful memory that he have be a friend to he friend they could not but admit but to the rest even when dead he be still terrible the body be exhibit before the rostrum and the greatest orator of the time speak the funeral oration for faustus sullum 's son be too young to do so then some strong senator take up the litter on they shoulder and bear it to the campus martius where king only be wont to be bury there it be place on the funeral pyre and the knight and all the army circle round it in solemn procession and that be sullum 's end ' to the student of history the story of such a funeral seem like the prostration of a nation of barbarian before the car of some demon-god if the strong personality of the man -- with all that dauntless bravery that unerring sagacity that trenchant tongue -- still after two thousand year fascinate attention if we be force to own that for sheer power of will and intellect he stand in the very foremost rank of man yet we feel also that in the case of such superhuman wickedness tyrannicide would if it ever could cease to be a crime \* \* \* \* \* chapter xv sullum 's reactionary measure it be difficult to say about part of the legislation of this period whether it be directly due to sullum or not just as some of the change in the army may or may not have be due to marius but be certainly make about he time the method of gathering together all the change make within certain date attribute they to one man and base a estimate of he character on they have a simplicity about it which enable the writer to be graphic and spare the reader trouble but be a unsatisfactory way of present history enough however be know of sullum 's own measure to make they general tendency perfectly plain -lrb- sidenote : main object of sullum 's law -rrb- he main object be to restore the authority of the senate and to do more than restore it to give it such power as might if it be true to itself secure it from mob-rule on the one hand and tyranny on the other though he foresee that he effort would be futile he be none the less energetic in make they and may reasonably have hope that they would at all event last he time and enable he to enjoy himself in campanium undisturbed by another revolution we acquaintance with he law be only second-hand for none of they survive in they original form they be know as lex corneliae a term which though applicable to some other law be usually apply to those of he make the senate have originally be a advise council then it have acquire superior authority and issue command to the magistrate it be place by sullum in a still higher position -lrb- sidenote : he reconstitute the senate -rrb- to fill up its exhaust rank he admit to it 300 of the equestrian order and though it be not certain what its number be to be it be probable that they be fix at about 500 then he provide for keep the list full for the future -lrb- sidenote : fill it up from the quaestor -rrb- hitherto a man have become a senator either at the censor 's summons -lrb- of which he be practically certain if he have be tribune or quaestor -rrb- or if he have be consul praetor or aedile -lrb- sidenote : increase the number of the quaestor -rrb- sullum make the quaestorship instead of the aedileship the regular stepping-stone and increase the number of the quaestor to twenty -lrb- sidenote : degrade the censorship -rrb- he also in all probability though it be not certain take away from the censor they right of confer or take away senatorial rank ` once a senator always a senator ' be therefore now the rule and as the quaestor who be the main source of supply be nominate by the comitium tributa the senate become a more representative as well as a more permanent body than before and independent of the magistrate -lrb- sidenote : legislative initiative give to the senate -rrb- secondly we have see that sullum have give to the senate by law the power which it have previously exercise only by custom of deliberate on a measure before it be submit to the vote of the comitium this be one security against any measure be carry against its interest before this the practice have be either for the senate through the tribune to submit a measure to the vote or for the tribune to submit a measure of they own after obtain the senate 's authority to do so saturninus as we have see have override this custom and the only way in which the senate could maintain its old privilege would have be either by proclaim a justitium as it do on that occasion or by pick out some technical informality in the passing of the plebiscitum have not sullum thus make its previous authorisation absolutely indispensable -lrb- sidenote : curtailment of the tribune ' prerogative -rrb- the tribune be deprive of the power of propose a measure at will to the comitium tributa would also lose the power of prosecute anyone before it and probably lose the right of convene meeting in order to address the people sulla too provide that those who have be tribune should be ineligible to other office and though the right of veto seem to have be leave to they it be not clear that it be leave without restriction while the abuse of it be make a heavily punishable offence it be likely also that he make senator the only person eligible to the tribunate positively therefore by make the senate 's previous consent to a law necessary and negatively by these limitation of the prerogative of the tribune legislative power be place wholly in the senate 's hand -lrb- sidenote : change in the comitium -rrb- thirdly the balance in the comitium themselves be so adjust that the voting would be mostly in the senate 's interest something have already be say of sullum 's change on this head in revert to the servian mode of voting -lrb- p 129 -rrb- some explanation of what this mean may be give here sullum do not abolish the comitium tributa but the measure just mention as they leave the practical power of legislation with the senate leave the formal power with the comitium centuria -lrb- sidenote : history of the comitium tributa and centuria -rrb- we know the origin of the comitium centuria we do not know the origin of the comitium tributa but we do know that by degree the latter obtain legislative power co-ordinate with that of the former and that the plebiscitum become as binding on the nation as the lex there be in short two parallel body in which the people could make law -- range in the one by tribe and voting on measure submit to they by they tribune range in the other by century and voting on measure submit to they by the consul but as the state become more and more democratic the comitium tributa be more use than the comitium centuria in which legislation be gradually confine to special matter assign to they by law or custom besides these function the comitium tributa decide on war or peace elect the tribune aedile and lesser magistrate and also usurp judicial power arraign magistrate for they conduct in office & c the function of the comitium centuria be as we have see also legislative they elect to the higher magistracy and exercise jurisdiction in capital case a function which grow out of the roman citizen 's right to appeal each century have one vote and as by the servian arrangement the first class though contain fewest voter have nevertheless owe to its highest assessment most vote it could by itself outvote the other class at some time or other this classification be alter and a new system base partly on century and partly on tribe come into use each tribe be divide into ten century five of senior and five of junior the first class consist of one of each of these from each tribe so that as there be thirty-five tribe each class would consist of seventy century it be say by some that the first class include also thirty-five century or eighteen century of equite if this be true the first class would still have retain the preponderance of vote in any case it have the best of the voting for even if it be decide by lot which century of all the century should vote first still the first class vote second and the moral effect of the wealthier and weightier citizen vote one way or other would naturally influence the vote of the other century moreover some say that the lot be confine to the century of the first class such then be the original and such the modify constitution of the comitium centuria -lrb- sidenote : sullum 's legislation about the comitium -rrb- appian expressly state that sullum revert to the original mode of voting but he may be confusing thing and only mean that sullum take the voting power from the comitium tributa and vest it in the comitium centuria and this probably be what sullum do -lrb- sidenote : curtailment of the power of the consul and praetor -rrb- fourthly as sullum weaken the censorship in order to exalt the senate 's authority at its expense so to prevent any individual again obtain undue influence he ordain that no man should be consul till he have be first quaestor and then praetor and that no man should be re-eligible to a curule office till after a interval of ten year this however be not enough it be he object to curtail the power of every magistrate and therefore though the consulate be not dangerous to the senate in the sense that the tribunate be he lay hand both on it and on the praetorship -lrb- sidenote : previous power of the two office -rrb- the function of the consul and praetor have hitherto be these the consul have the general superintendence of all except judicial matter at home and the military superintendence in all the province except sicily sardinium and the two spain in which they only occasionally exercise they imperium one praetor the praetor urbanus preside over civil suit between roman citizen another the praetor peregrinus superintend such suit between a citizen and a alien or between two alien the other four be over the four above-mentioned province in case of need one man could do the work both of the praetor urbanus and the praetor peregrinus leave he colleague free for a military command or the consul or praetor might have he term of office extend be bind to continue in he command till a successor arrive or one consul might manage the ordinary function of both and the other be similarly leave free for some special employment the senate could in any given year assign as business to be superintend by a consul or a praetor some military command or judicial commission and then the consul or praetor have to settle by lot or by agreement who should undertake it as the state grow greater these special assignation have to be make oftener -lrb- sidenote : the new scheme -rrb- there have be eight official for eight office now five new superintendent have to be provide for asia africa macedonium narbo and cilicium as well as one for the quaestio de repetundis to enable eight man to do the work of fourteen the senate make prolongation of office for a second year the rule and the official confine by the nature of these duty to the city during these year of office be generally send at the end of it to the transmarine province where most money be to be make sullum increase the six praetor to eight and make the two year ' term of office the legal term but if this add to they power in appearance he diminish it in reality by separate the civil from the military function altogether the consul and praetor be to manage the civil business of rome the proconsul and propraetor be to command the army in the first year of office the two consul have the general administration of rome and two of the praetor its judicial administration the other six preside over the various court in the second the ten exercise the imperium in sicily sardinium the two spain asia africa macedonium cilicium and the two gaul and none of they might stay in he province beyond thirty day after he successor 's arrival or under penalty for treason might leave he province during he term or attack a foreign power without express leave from home -lrb- sidenote : effect of the new scheme -rrb- the effect of all this be plain whereas formerly the magistrate directly elect in the comitium might combine civil and military authority now the military authority could only be hold by those whose term of office be prolong by the senate 's pleasure for though the practice become invariable it remain at the senate 's discretion to break through it when it choose -lrb- sidenote : co-optation restore to the college -rrb- fifthly have thus lessen the power of the censor consul praetor and tribune he by way of compensation -- a serio-comic compensation it must have seem to he shrewd yet superstitious mind -- restore the right of co-optation to the sacred college of augur and pontiff and increase they number thus multiply harmless object of rivalry analogous to the riband and garter of modern court sixthly he take away from the equite and restore to the senate the judicium -lrb- sidenote : restoration of the judicium to the senate -rrb- the judicium have be often mention and something maybe say about they here in civil suit the praetor as we have see have the superintendence sometimes he decide a case at once sometimes if he think the case should be try he appoint a judex give he certain instruction by which after the investigation he must decide the case he action here would be something like one of we judge 's charge but give before hear the evidence there be nothing to prove that a judex of this kind be at this time take from any special class or that sullum interfere with the established mode of procedure -lrb- sidenote : organization of criminal court -rrb- it be about the constitution of the criminal court that the long struggle have rage between the senate and equite and here he make great change he find some permanent criminal court -lrb- eg the quaestio de repetundis or court for investigate case of extortion in the province -rrb- already in existence he institute or settle other but it can not be ascertain how many of the follow which be in existence after he time be due to he there be at least nine of these permanent court -lrb- quaestione perpetua -rrb- : the quaestio majestatis de vi de sicariis & c de veneficiis de parricidio de falso de repetundis peculatus ambitus or court for try case of treason violence assassination poisoning parricide forgery extortion embezzlement and bribery and there may have be more eg de adulteriis and de plagiis for try case of adultery and the enslavement of freeman -lrb- sidenote : procedure in the court -rrb- he object in consolidate they be to take from the comitium the settlement of criminal case and to obviate the necessity for appoint special commission for there be no appeal from the quaestio and a special commission be seldom requisite when so many court be available to preside in these court there be six praetor but as there be more court than praetor a senator call judex quaestioni be appoint annually for each court where a president be want something after the fashion by which one of we judge sometimes in press of business appoint a barrister as he deputy to clear off the case the praetor or judex quaestioni preside over the judice in each court and the judice return a verdict by a majority of vote sometimes give by ballot sometimes openly in choose these judice this be the process the whole number available be it be say 300 divide into three decuria in any give case the praetor name the decurium from which the juryman be to be take and then draw from a urn contain they name the number assign by law for the case to be decide each side could then challenge a certain number and fresh name be draw from the urn in place of those challenge what sullum do be to supply these decuria from the senator instead of the equite one of the permanent court find by sullum already exist be that of the centumvirus who have jurisdiction over dispute inheritance the member of it be elect by the tribe three by each tribe 105 in all though it be directly elect by the people sullum could apprehend no danger from such a court and do not meddle with it -lrb- sidenote : other measure attribute to sullum -rrb- other measure be attribute to sulla on evidence more or less probable such as the suppression of gratuitous distribution of corn the abolition of the right of freedman to vote and of the reserved seat appropriate to the equite at public festival the re-establishment in asia of fixed tax instead of the farming system the extension of italy proper from the aesis to the rubicon and the conversion of cisalpine gaul into a province it may be consider certain that he do all that he could to humiliate the equite but the settlement of italy be probably not due to he -lrb- sidenote : he minor measure -rrb- other minor law of which he be the author deal with specific criminal offence or social matter one as we have see -lrb- p 196 -rrb- specify the penalty for all sort of assassination and poisoning another deal with forgery another with violence to the person or property another with marriage and probably adultery another be a sumptuary law which be say to have limit the price of certain luxury if this be the case it be even sillier than other sumptuary law for it would have encourage instead of check gluttony lastly there be a law for the settlement of he colony through italy and at alerium in corsica -lrb- sidenote : effect of sullum 's legislation -rrb- sullum have for the moment undo by he legislation the work of age he gag free speech by the disability attach to the tribunate he keep the government within a close circle by he process of recruit the senate he make the magistrate subordinate to the senate he fill italy and rome with he own partisan and therefore with those of the senate and he give back to the senate that covet possession of the judicium for which it have struggle so long with the equite but a system which could endure only by the repression not only of hostile interest but of the ambition of its own adherent carry in itself the seed of early dissolution almost before the reaction be complete a counter-reaction have begin abdication only reveal monarchy and the broad road which sullum have lay over the breaker and quicksand of revolution in reality pave the way to a throne -lrb- sidenote : sullum 's abdication a farce -rrb- when be abdicate he offer to render account to anyone for he act and there be a story that one young man thereupon follow he to he home load he with abuse which sullum listen to with meekness if the story be true the incident be probably a pre-arranged part of the ceremony of abdication which in everything except the fact that sullum slip off the care of government be of course a farce he funeral show what he real power continue to be and if another anecdote be true just before he death he have a magistrate of puteolus strangle because he have not collect in time he town 's subscription to the restoration of the capitol he have in fact do mischievously what the gracchus would have do beneficently and greedy swordsman occupy the soil which the tribune would have divide peaceably among peaceable man -lrb- sidenote : the policy of the gracchus justify by after event -rrb- the civil war and the triumvirate be the best vindication of the policy of the gracchus unless we can bring ourselves to fancy that the gracchus create instead of attempt wisely to satisfy the demand of the age by a orderly intermixture of italian and foreigner with the corrupt body of roman citizen new life might have be infuse into the old system and something foreshadow modern representative government have be establish without proscription or praetorian rule as it be the vice of society only become aggravate at a era of violence and the sharpest remedy fail to stay the creep paralysis by which it be assail the gradual depopulation of italy have already be describe in spite of sullum 's colony the ruin of the country must have be vastly accelerate by he civil war and those which follow they and while the honest country class be die out the town class be ever plunge deeper into frivolity and voluptuousness to defray the cost of the sumptuous life of the capital the fashionable spendthrift be force to resort to extortion in the province which as we have see become so cry a evil that a permanent court exist for deal with it before the time of sullum the greedy throve on usury or involve the state in war to fill they own purse the fortune amass by a aquillius a verre a lucullus speak as eloquently of rome 's rapacity abroad as do those of crassus or sullum in italy such be the state of thing under the government which sulla strove to perpetuate he character as a statesman deserve as strong reprobation as he conduct as a man to lay down power from a sense of duty be one thing cynically to shrink from responsibility be another the misery of the follow half-century must be lay chiefly at sullum 's door the inevitable goal to which everything be tend be as patent in he time as in the time of augustus whatever may have be for the interest of the roman aristocracy monarchy be by this time for the interest
