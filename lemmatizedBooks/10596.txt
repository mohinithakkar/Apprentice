which celebrate undergraduate life must not be take too seriously they seldom pretend to the dignity of poetry college verse if i understand it be verse suit to the period and point of view of undergraduate day light graceful humorous sparkling -- this it should be for the most part serious sometimes it be true -- for young man and woman about to take upon themselves the responsibility of mature life be at heart by no means frivolous but touch the note of grief if at all almost as though by accident life be often sad enough in the after-year and for the period of sorrow sad verse may be in place happy they who have not yet trade cap and bell -lrb- never far hide under cap and gown -rrb- for the sable steal of cypress lawn happier still if they never need make such a sorry exchange yes like all sound art college verse must above all else be honest let we not say however that the thoughtful mood of young man and woman may not sincerely be set to the music of verse one department

what they be worth leave they explanation to other first there seem to be a general fondness for the sonnet and a very general lack of success in write it second the french form of light verse be exceedingly popular -- particularly the rondeau ballade and triolet these more easily lend themselves to gay mood than do the sonnet be write with much greater success triolet be perhaps least often rondeaus most often successful third purely sentimental verse be little write in woman 's college its place be take by poetry of nature or of reflection oddly enough when it _ be _ attempt the writer usually fancy herself the lover and describe feminine not masculine beauty college girl show possibly more maturity of reflective power than do they brother but they be notably weaker in the sense of humor fourth amongst so much merely graceful verse there be not want touch here and there of genuine poetry i shall be disappoint if the reader do not discover many such in this little book while i
